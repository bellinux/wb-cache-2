5|$|Abramson was {{a leading}} {{architect}} of synagogue-centers at that time. He designed a number of New York examples, including the original synagogue-center, the Manhattan <b>Jewish</b> Center (1918), {{as well as the}} Brooklyn <b>Jewish</b> Center, the Flatbush <b>Jewish</b> Center, and the Ocean Parkway <b>Jewish</b> Center (all constructed in Brooklyn between 1920 and 1924). While the Flatbush <b>Jewish</b> Center has been completely remodeled, the Brooklyn and Ocean Parkway <b>Jewish</b> Centers are visually similar to the East Midwood <b>Jewish</b> Center, and the Brooklyn <b>Jewish</b> Center in particular has an identical layout. The written evidence consists of an entry in a souvenir journal commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the Flatbush <b>Jewish</b> Center, stating that Abramson drew East Midwood's plans. The NRHP nomination form speculates that Abramson drew the basic plans for the East Midwood Center, and that the Building Committee completed them, in order to save money.|$|E

5|$|After 1986, the <b>Jewish</b> Community of Zagreb {{began to}} {{consider}} a <b>Jewish</b> cultural center and a memorial synagogue. Two architects, Branko Silađin and Boris Morsan, both of whom participated in the failed 1977 department store competition, came forward on their own accord and contributed their ideas for a new <b>Jewish</b> center in Praška Street. Silađin's vision was ultimately not accepted by the <b>Jewish</b> community; instead, plans were being made {{for the construction of}} the cultural center and a synagogue, following an international architecture competition. However, despite support for the project both within Yugoslavia and abroad, the issuance of necessary permits was either stalled or denied by the municipal government. The project was not developed.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Jewish,</b> Levi's {{family did}} not {{practise}} their religion, {{and were not}} part of the <b>Jewish</b> community, but when she was enrolled at the Victoria School (now the Bettina School) in Frankfurt, her religion was listed as <b>Jewish.</b> Religious instruction was compulsory, so she had to attend classes with a local rabbi. She soon rebelled against this, and told her parents that she did not wish to attend the classes. She came to reject formal religion.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1920, and {{continuing}} until the 1960s, McGill imposed a controversial quota which specified a maximum on {{the proportion of}} newly admitted students who were <b>Jewish.</b> Up until that point Jews had been overrepresented in the university, especially in the arts (20% <b>Jewish)</b> and law (40% <b>Jewish).</b> The quota limited the <b>Jewish</b> population across McGill to at most 10%.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{religious}} definitions and varying population data, the United States currently has {{the second largest}} <b>Jewish</b> community in the world (after Israel). The American <b>Jewish</b> population {{was estimated to be}} approximately 5,128,000 (1.7%) of the total population in 2008 (304,060,000). However, it may be as high as 6,444,000 (2.2%). As a contrast, Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics estimated the Israeli <b>Jewish</b> population was 5,435,800 in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Discrimination against Jews began {{immediately}} after the seizure of power and following a month-long series of attacks {{by members of the}} SA on <b>Jewish</b> businesses, synagogues and members of the legal profession, on 1 April 1933 Hitler declared a national boycott of <b>Jewish</b> businesses. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service passed on 7 April and forced all non-Aryan civil servants to retire from the legal profession and civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived <b>Jewish</b> members of other professions of their right to practise and on 11 April a decree was promulgated that stated anyone who had even one <b>Jewish</b> parent or grandparent was considered non-Aryan. As part of the drive to remove <b>Jewish</b> influence from cultural life, members of the National Socialist Student League removed from libraries any books considered un-German and a nationwide book burning was held on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|During the Fourth Aliyah (1924–1928), the Jezreel Valley {{was the top}} {{priority}} of the <b>Jewish</b> National Fund (JNF). The JNF wanted to settle the valley {{in order to establish}} a significant <b>Jewish</b> agricultural community in the arable valley, and to create a contiguous bloc of <b>Jewish</b> settlements in the valley, connecting Haifa with the already existing bloc of <b>Jewish</b> settlements between Afula and Beit She'an. In 1924 the JNF bought some 30,175 dunams of land from Arab villages next to Nahalal {{in the western part of}} the valley. On this land, Sarid, Ramat David, Gvat, Kfar Baruch and Mishmar HaEmek were established.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the <b>Jewish</b> Resistance Movement was formed, {{comprising}} several pre-existing <b>Jewish</b> groups. In 1921, the part-time Haganah was formed and trained as a national army. Most <b>Jewish</b> males and some females were required to join. After the Second World War, it obtained numerous surplus weapons to equip its members. The Haganah gave priority to increasing the <b>Jewish</b> population by bringing immigrants into the country from Europe. It always attempted to give prior notice of an attack so that any security service personnel in the area could be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the British, 265,000 <b>Jewish</b> immigrants, {{mainly from}} Europe, came {{to settle in}} Palestine between 1919 and 1939. Arab {{resistance}} and violence to this influx of immigrants {{came to a head}} in 1937, and the Peel Commission recommended that two states should be formed, one Arab and one <b>Jewish,</b> which would divide the country between them. Then in May1939, the British restricted the number of <b>Jewish</b> immigrants to 75,000 in the White Paper of 1939.|$|E

5|$|Holidays (such as Spring Day) {{were part}} of the plot of an episode aired that day, unless the holiday fell over a weekend. Since the Goddzers are a <b>Jewish</b> family, <b>Jewish</b> {{holidays}} are included. On July 18 the 1994 AMIA bombing, when the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association was destroyed in a terrorist attack, was mentioned when Elías said he would attend the annual protest of the unsolved case's handling. Minor <b>Jewish</b> characters (such as relatives and friends) returned for Rosh Hashanah, the <b>Jewish</b> New Year celebration. Its <b>Jewish</b> characters and the number of Argentine and Latin American expatriates in Israel helped Graduados obtain good ratings in Israel.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Frank {{was elected}} {{president}} of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a <b>Jewish</b> fraternal organization. The <b>Jewish</b> community in Atlanta was the largest in the Southern United States, and the Franks belonged to a cultured and philanthropic social environment whose leisure pursuits included opera and bridge. Although the Southern United States was not specifically known for its antisemitism, Frank's northern culture and <b>Jewish</b> faith added to the sense that he was different.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Eichmann {{was posted}} to Vienna to help organise <b>Jewish</b> {{emigration}} from Austria, which {{had just been}} integrated into the Reich through the Anschluss. <b>Jewish</b> community organisations were placed under supervision of the SD and tasked with encouraging and facilitating <b>Jewish</b> emigration. Funding came from money seized from other <b>Jewish</b> people and organisations, as well as donations from overseas, which were placed under SD control. Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmführer (first lieutenant) in July 1938, and appointed to the Central Agency for <b>Jewish</b> Emigration in Vienna, created in August. By {{the time he left}} Vienna in May 1939, nearly 100,000 Jews had left Austria legally, and many more had been smuggled out to Palestine and elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} days of the blockade, someone managed to smuggle a letter out of the <b>Jewish</b> quarter to the <b>Jewish</b> {{leadership}} in Constantinople. It was not until March 27 that the leaders of the <b>Jewish</b> community in the Ottoman capital forwarded it to the Rothschild family, together with a similar call for help from the Jews of Damascus. To these documents, the <b>Jewish</b> leaders attached their own statement in which they cast doubt on their ability to influence the sultan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} century, Caesarius of Arles taught {{that the whole}} glory of the <b>Jewish</b> Sabbath had been {{transferred}} to Sunday and that Christians must keep Sunday {{in the same way}} as the Jews were commanded to keep the Sabbath. The Council of Orléans in 538 reprobated this tendency, to apply the law of the <b>Jewish</b> Sabbath to the observance of the Christian Sunday, as <b>Jewish</b> and non-Christian.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} decade of her reign, {{influenced}} by her <b>Jewish</b> courtier Abraham Mendel Theben, Maria Theresa issued edicts which offered some state protection to her <b>Jewish</b> subjects. Her actions {{during the late}} stages of her reign contrast her early opinions. She forbade the forcible conversion of <b>Jewish</b> children to Christianity in 1762, and in 1763 she forbade Catholic clergy from extracting surplice fees from her <b>Jewish</b> subjects. In 1764, she ordered the release of those Jews who had been jailed for a blood libel {{in the village of}} Orkuta. Notwithstanding her strong dislike of Jews, Maria Theresa supported <b>Jewish</b> commercial and industrial activity in Austria.|$|E
5|$|<b>Jewish</b> {{feminism}} {{is a movement}} that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for <b>Jewish</b> women. The main issues for early <b>Jewish</b> feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or minyan, the exemption from positive time-bound mitzvot, and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce. Many <b>Jewish</b> women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history.|$|E

5|$|No {{surviving}} Greek texts written {{after the}} year 100 can be securely {{identified as having}} a <b>Jewish</b> author.

5|$|On 8 July, Heydrich {{announced}} that all Jews {{were to be}} regarded as partisans, and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot. On 17 July Heydrich ordered that the Einsatzgruppen were to kill all <b>Jewish</b> Red Army prisoners of war, plus all Red Army prisoners of war from Georgia and Central Asia, as they too might be Jews. Unlike in Germany, where the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 defined as <b>Jewish</b> anyone with at least three <b>Jewish</b> grandparents, the Einsatzgruppen defined as <b>Jewish</b> anyone with at least one <b>Jewish</b> grandparent; in either case, whether or not the person practised the religion was irrelevant. The unit was also assigned to exterminate Romani people and the mentally ill. It was common practice for the Einsatzgruppen to shoot hostages.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 2007, the <b>Jewish</b> Museum of New Jersey at 145 Broadway in the Broadway neighborhood, {{held its}} grand opening.
