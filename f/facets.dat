5|$|Wear <b>facets</b> {{are areas}} of a tooth that show {{evidence}} {{of contact with}} a tooth in the opposing jaw when the teeth are brought together (known as occlusion). Flynn and colleagues identified two wear <b>facets</b> at {{the front and back}} margins of the talonid basin; they argue that these wear <b>facets</b> suggest the presence of a protocone (another cusp on the outer side of the tooth) on the upper molars. In a 2005 paper on Asfaltomylos, a related primitive mammal from Argentina, Thomas Martin and Oliver Rauhut disputed the presence of these wear <b>facets</b> within the talonid basin in Ambondro and instead identified wear <b>facets</b> on the cusps and crests surrounding the basin. They proposed that wear in the australosphenidan talonid occurs mainly on the rims, not in the talonid basin itself, and that australosphenidans may not have had a functional protocone.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} certain what pachycephalosaurs ate; having very small, ridged teeth {{they could not have}} chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that their sharp, serrated teeth were ideally suited for a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, fruit and insects. Stegoceras may have had an entirely herbivorous diet, as the tooth crowns were similar to those of iguanid lizards. The premaxillary teeth show wear <b>facets</b> from contact with the predentary bone, and the maxillary teeth have double wear <b>facets</b> similar to those seen in other ornithischian dinosaurs. Every third maxillary tooth of UALVP 2 are erupting replacement teeth, and tooth replacement happened in backwards progression in sequential threes. The occipital region of Stegoceras was well-demarcated for muscle-attachment and it is believed that the jaw movement of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs was mostly limited to up-and-down motions with only a slight capability for jaw rotation. This is based on the structure of the jaw and dental microwear and wear <b>facets</b> of the teeth indicate that the bite-force was used more for shearing than for crushing.|$|E

5|$|The Stonesfield Slate {{material}} {{contains no}} neck vertebrae; {{but a single}} broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the New Park Quarry, specimen BMNH R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large pleurocoels, pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly opisthocoelous, with convex front centrum <b>facets</b> and concave rear centrum <b>facets.</b> They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the diapophysis, the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum <b>facets.</b> They have secondary joint processes, forming a hyposphene–hypantrum complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material, specimen BMNH R9677, suggests {{the presence of a}} crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum <b>facets</b> on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall, representing {{more than half of the}} total vertebral height.|$|E
5|$|An adult {{dragonfly}} {{has three}} distinct segments, the head, thorax, and abdomen {{as in all}} insects. It has a chitinous exoskeleton of hard plates held together with flexible membranes. The head is large with very short antennae. It {{is dominated by the}} two compound eyes, which cover most of its surface. The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia, the numbers being greater in the larger species. Aeshna interrupta has 22650 ommatidia of two varying sizes, 4500 being large. The <b>facets</b> facing downward tend to be smaller. Petalura gigantea has 23890 ommatidia of just one size. These <b>facets</b> provide complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly. The compound eyes meet {{at the top of the}} head (except in the Petaluridae and Gomphidae, as also in the genus Epiophlebia). Also, they have three simple eyes or ocelli. The mouthparts are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw; the flap-like labrum, at the front of the mouth, can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey. The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs on the back of the head that grip structures on the front of the first thoracic segment. This arrester system is unique to the Odonata, and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the difficulty of applying <b>faceted</b> classification outside of library contexts and also to indicate that <b>faceted</b> approaches are poorly expressed to non-experts. Design/methodology/approach - The <b>faceted</b> approach is being applied outside of its "home" community, with mixed results. The approach is based in part on examination of a broad base of literature and in part on results and reflections on a case study applying <b>faceted</b> notions to "real world" engineering documentation. Findings - The paper comes across a number of pragmatic and theoretical issues namely: differing interpretations of the <b>facet</b> notion: confusion between <b>faceted</b> analysis and <b>faceted</b> classification: lack of methodological guidance; the use of simplistic domains as exemplars: description verses analysis: <b>facet</b> recognition is unproblematic; and is the process purely top-down or bottom-up. Research limitations/implications - That <b>facet</b> analysis is not inherently associated with a particular epistemology; that greater guidance about the derivation is needed, that greater realism is needed when teaching <b>faceted</b> approaches. Practical implications - Experiences of applying <b>faceted</b> classifications are presented that can be drawn upon to guide future work in the area. Originality/value - No previous work has reflected oil the actual empirical experience used to create a <b>faceted</b> description, especially with reference to engineering documents...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: <b>Facet</b> joints are {{important}} anatomical structures for {{the stability of}} spine. Surgical or degenerative damage to a <b>facet</b> joint may lead to spinal instability and causes clinical problems. This article explains the importance of <b>facet</b> joints, reviews <b>facet</b> replacement systems, and describes a simple and effective method for <b>facet</b> replacement after surgical removal of <b>facet</b> joints. Materials and Methods: Ten patients were operated with the diagnosis of unilateral nerve root compression secondary to <b>facet</b> degeneration. The hypertrophic <b>facet</b> joints were removed with microsurgical techniques and the roots were decompressed. Then, a unilateral artificial <b>facet</b> joint was created using two hinged screws and a dynamic rod. Results: The clinical outcome of all the patients was determined good or excellent at second and last follow-up (mean 13. 3 months) controls using visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores. Radiological evaluations also demonstrated no implant-related complications. Conclusions: The authors suggest that, if removal of a <b>facet</b> joint is necessary to decompress the nerve roots, the joint can {{be replaced by a}} construct composed of two hinged screws connected by a dynamic rod. This simple system mimics the function of a normal <b>facet</b> joint and is an effective technique for unilateral <b>facet</b> joint replacement...|$|R

5|$|Diamonds are {{extremely}} hard, but also brittle {{and can be}} split up by a single blow. Therefore, diamond cutting is traditionally considered as a delicate procedure requiring skills, scientific knowledge, tools and experience. Its final goal is to produce a faceted jewel where the specific angles between the <b>facets</b> would optimize the diamond luster, that is dispersion of white light, whereas the number and area of <b>facets</b> would determine {{the weight of the}} final product. The weight reduction upon cutting is significant and can be of the order of 50%. Several possible shapes are considered, but the final decision is often determined not only by scientific, but also practical considerations. For example, the diamond might be intended for display or for wear, in a ring or a necklace, singled or surrounded by other gems of certain color and shape. Some of them may be considered as classical, such as round, pear, marquise, oval, hearts and arrows diamonds, etc. Some of them are special, produced by certain companies, for example, Phoenix, Cushion, Sole Mio diamonds, etc.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the paper: An {{overview}} of principles and procedures involved {{in creating a}} <b>faceted</b> classification scheme for use in resource discovery in an online environment. Design/methodology/approach: <b>Facet</b> analysis provides an established scientific methodology for the conceptual organization of a subject field, and the structuring of an associated classification or controlled vocabulary. This paper explains how that methodology {{was applied to the}} humanities in the FATKS project, where the objective was to explore the potential of <b>facet</b> analytical theory for creating a controlled vocabulary for the humanities, and to establish the requirements of a <b>faceted</b> classification appropriate to an online environment. A detailed <b>faceted</b> vocabulary was developed for two areas of the humanities within a broader <b>facet</b> framework for the whole of knowledge. Research issues included how to create a data model which made the <b>faceted</b> structure explicit and machine-readable and provided for its further development and use. Findings: In order to support easy <b>facet</b> combination in indexing, and <b>facet</b> searching and browsing on the interface, <b>faceted</b> classification requires a formalized data structure and an appropriate tool for its management. The conceptual framework of a <b>faceted</b> system proper can be applied satisfactorily to humanities, and fully integrated within a vocabulary management system...|$|R

30|$|Because chronic {{low back}} pain of <b>facet</b> joint pain origin {{represents}} a major health care problem, diagnosis and management of such a high prevalent condition as <b>facet</b> joint syndrome is a major socioeconomic burden. Because of the ability of <b>facet</b> joint pathology to mimic spine root compression, the low specificity of FJ syndrome and inefficient use of lumbar imaging, it appears as a misunderstood, misdiagnosed and improperly treated pathology. <b>Facet</b> joint-related anatomical, clinical and radiologic knowledge is essential for successful <b>facet</b> joint syndrome management. Diagnostic blocks are a keystone of <b>facet</b> syndrome diagnosis. If diagnostic blocks of the nerves that supply specific <b>facet</b> joints relieve the patient’s pain, denervation procedure lesioning of the same nerves can be offered to provide prolonged benefit. The role of the radiologist is essential {{in the management of}} these patients, and radiologists should embrace all aspects of <b>facet</b> joint pain management, from diagnosis—enabled by high-performance modalities available—to interventional management.
