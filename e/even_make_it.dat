5|$|This season focuses {{primarily}} on the show's main protagonist, Senior Sergeant Tom Croydon, his failing health and his personal troubles. John Wood, who portrays Croydon, is the only actor to appear in every episode of Blue Heelers and is, indisputably, the pillar of the show. The final episode of the thirteenth season aired as a 2-hour, movie-length tribute starting with an introduction from John Wood, and concluding with a compilation of Blue Heelers moments from over its 13-season run. For this thirteenth season, Blue Heelers was moved from its primetime Wednesday-night timeslot to the lower rating Saturday-night timeslot, which saw it come up against The Bill, a British police drama which has become quite popular in Australia. Ratings for this season, partially due to the series' move to its lower-rating timeslot, were relatively low; ratings were around the 1.2 million viewer mark, increasing to 1.5 million for the finale. Blue Heelers failed to <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> into the top 20 programmes {{at any time during}} its thirteenth season.|$|E

His success with the Spurs team was varied, with the side finishing in mid-table {{for most of his}} tenure, though they did win the FA Cup in 1991 and finished third in the league in 1990. Venables had brought both Gary Lineker and Paul Gascoigne to Spurs and was a favourite to replace Bobby Robson as England national football team manager when the job became vacant in 1990, but doubts about his probity led him to be passed over in favour of Graham Taylor. Venables did not <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> onto the shortlist of three managers selected by The Football Association.|$|E
25|$|At 1430 Vorse led {{the first}} CAP group to {{intercept}} bombers and fighter escorts {{making their way}} towards the U.S. carriers. Japanese Zero fighters effectively prevented Vorse and the men of his group—Register, Loesch and Sumrall—from engaging the incoming dive bombers, which by day's end would score three hits on Enterprise. The enemy fighters paid dearly for their actions, however: Vorse, Register and Sumrall each downed one {{by the end of}} the scrap. Out of both ammunition and gas by CAP's end, the men of Vorse's division were forced to land and refuel aboard Saratoga, with the notable exception of Vorse himself who could not <b>even</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> that far and plunked his bird down in the water off Saratogas stern. For the remainder of the day, Japanese air power was directed almost singly on Enterprise, with VF-6 scrambling to knock as many bombers off course and out of the sky as possible. By the end of action on 24 August, the fighter squadron claimed 13 Aichi 99 dive bombers and 10 Nagoya Zeros, among other miscellaneous aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Consequently, {{restrictions}} on the Gmail service are also enforced when using GMail Drive. For example, files larger than 25 MB cannot be uploaded, as the maximum file size of Gmail attachments is 25 MB. In the past, Gmail also prevented users from transferring certain file types, such as an executable or ZIP archives that contain an executable within. Some users bypassed this restriction by renaming the file extension or by putting it into a RAR or 7z archive. This restriction has now been lifted.

Clark Green (Clark Duke) feels he {{is ready for the}} position, citing his key role in various sales, but Dwight wants someone who he can be sure will not team up with Pam against him. To that end, he brings in a bizarre gallery of his relatives and close friends, including his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), best friend Rolf (James Urbaniak), part-time private investigator Trevor (Chris Gethard), former Corporate executive Troy Undercook (Noel Petok), and his karate teacher Sensei Ira (Lance Krall).

Stephen added that [...] "Still, she's been in more terrifying situations – actually, she's only been in terrifying situations. Any chance of her just enjoying a double espresso once in a while?" [...] Stephen's colleague Caroline Fitton commented on Mercedes' doubts about whether she could bring Bobby up alone saying it was [...] "entirely understandable" [...] due to Mercedes being unable to restrain from regularly [...] "changing clothes, cosmetics, jobs or men – let alone children".

5000|$|Clinical {{trials are}} {{only a small part}} of the {{research}} that goes into developing a new treatment.

60|$|True, {{there are}} {{men in the world}} that abuse the grace of God, as some are said to turn it into wantonness and into lasciviousness (Jude 4).

It is a dangerous thing for a man to have the notions of grace, while his heart is void of the spirit and holy principles of grace; for such a man can do no other than abuse the grace of God. Alas, what can be expected of him that has nothing in him to teach him to manage that knowledge of grace which he has, but his flesh, his lusts, and lustful passions? Can these teach him to manage his knowledge well? Will they not rather put him upon all tricks, evasions, irreligious consequences and conclusions, such as will serve to cherish sin?

40|$|Interconnect {{design has}} {{emerged as one of}} the major {{challenges}} facing chip designers as VLSI manufacturing progresses and gate sizes scale down. Dynamic programming(DP) is an efficient and robust technique for finding optimal solutions to interconnect optimization problems in VLSI design. However, DP's huge memory requirement often limits its effectiveness and sometimes, due to limited storage resources, <b>even</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> impossible to solve a problem of practical size. Since interconnect optimization is often a subprocess embedded in an upper level design procedure, a memory and time efficient implementation of DP can be very favorable to circuit designers. In this paper, we develop a new memory-efficient dynamic programming approach to interconnect op-timization problems. Our method utilizes selective storage and recomputation technique. This memory and time efficient algorithm speeds up the dynamic programming method without compromising solution quality. Experiments show tremendous saving, both in storage and time, over traditional dynamic programming algorithms. Our novel approach can also be generalized for other VLSI applications using DP algorithms...|$|R
