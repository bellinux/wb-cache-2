40|$|Molten metal {{processing}} is inherently energy intensive and roughly 25 % {{of the cost}} of die-cast products can be traced to some form of energy consumption [1]. The obvious major energy requirements are for melting and holding molten alloy in preparation for casting. The proper selection and maintenance of melting and holding equipment are clearly important factors in minimizing energy consumption in die-casting operations [2]. In addition to energy consumption, furnace selection also influences metal loss due to oxidation, metal quality, and maintenance requirements. Other important factors influencing energy consumption in a die-casting facility include geographic location, alloy(s) cast, starting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process <b>flow,</b> <b>casting</b> yield, scrap rate, cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting form of alloy (solid or liquid), overall process <b>flow,</b> <b>casting</b> yield, scrap rate, cycle times, number of shifts per day, days of operation per month, type and size of die-casting machine, related equipment (robots, trim presses), and downstream processing (machining, plating, assembly, etc.).

40|$|The {{effect of}} planar <b>flow</b> <b>casting</b> {{parameters}} on the microstructural development and soft magnetic properties of Fe-metalloid nanocrystalline materials {{with a high}} saturation magnetisation has been investigated. Furthermore, the size and potential origin of a field induced anisotropy for this class of materials has also been examined. Fe-metalloid nanocrystalline magnetically soft materials, such as the Fe-B-(Si) -Cu alloy system, can offer the unique combination of a large saturation magnetisation while still maintaining relatively low core-losses. However, the nanocrystallisation process {{is known to be}} strongly influenced by the microstructure present in the precursor materials, which may differ considerably between batches due to the natural variability in the planar <b>flow</b> <b>casting</b> process used for its production. This work therefore investigates the origin of this variability and the effect that different processing parameters have on the final microstructure and magnetic softness for a nanocrystalline Fe₈₂. ₅B₁₄Si₂Cu₁. ₅ alloy. It is found that the ribbon geometry and the casting substrate speed both strongly influence the magnetic softness after nanocrystallisation and that by closely controlling these parameters the variability between batches may be reduced. Furthermore, these findings also suggest that variations in the ribbon-substrate contact and ribbon geometry may lead to significant fluctuations in the cooling rate experienced by different regions within an as-cast ribbon and that this might lead to an inhomogeneous microstructure. Therefore, these findings suggest that by tailoring the substrate speed and ribbon geometry for a given composition, {{it may be possible to}} achieve a far larger and more consistent cooling rate than that currently achievable by planar <b>flow</b> <b>casting.</b> It is known that a substantial field induced anisotropy has the potential to degrade magnetic softness in nanocrystalline materials at small grain sizes. Therefore, the size and origin of a field induced anisotropy located within the crystalline phase of an Fe-rich, Si-poor Fe-metalloid nanocrystalline alloy is also investigated. It is seen that a substantial field induced anisotropy exists within the crystalline phase of a Fe-B-(Si) -Cu alloy system and that this may negatively impact its magnetic softness. It is also found that a small uniaxial lattice distortion exists within the crystalline phase after field annealing for nanocrystalline Fe₉₄₋ₓNb₆Bₓ (x = 10, 12 and 14). The size of this lattice distortion is shown to agree well with predictions made by the magnetoelastic model and that this is the likely origin of the field induced anisotropy seen to exist in Si-free Fe-metalloid nanocrystalline alloys. Therefore, with this new understanding it may now be possible to develop novel methods for the control or removal of field induced anisotropies from nanocrystalline Fe-rich materials which may potentially improve their soft magnetic properties...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOne {{industrial}} process used by Nexter Munitions to manufacture pyrotechnical materials consists in preparing an emulsion of wax in TNT (2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene) and adding Aluminium and ONTA (3 -nitro- 1, 2, 4 -triazole- 5 -one) particles. When the suspension is homogeneous, it {{is allowed to}} flow by gravity through a pipe located {{at the bottom of}} the tank and to fill up a shell body. The suspension is characterized by a solid volume fraction of 53. 4 %, which leads to high viscosities. In some circumstances, the emptying time is prohibitively long and the economic profitability is reduced. This study has been performed to make the emptying time lower with the constraint of unchanged volume fractions and grains mean diameter. So, we investigated the influence of the grain size distribution on the suspension viscosity. Different samples of Aluminium and ONTA have been used, with rather small differences in grain size distributions. The suspensions have been prepared in the industrial tank and the <b>flow</b> <b>cast</b> times measured. It has been observed that they differ by one order of magnitude. To avoid situations with too high emptying times, a procedure has been implemented to make prior characterization of the suspension rheology. Because of particles sedimentation and emulsion destabilisation, the classical Couette rheometer is not adapted. So, we designed and built a small size tank (113 cm 3), where the suspension is continuously stirred and kept homogeneous. The measurement of the torque and rotational speed together with the use of the Couette analogy allowed us to observe an Ostwald fluid behaviour (flow consistency index k, flow behaviour index n). To gain in prediction, we established a correlation between the measured (k, n) values and the grain size distributions. We characterized each suspension by the ratio of to, where is the solid volume fraction (imposed by the commercial specifications) and is the maximum packing fraction. Because of the strong analogy between concrete and energetic paste, we chose the widely used De Larrard model to compute. A linear dependance between the ratio and the indices k and n was observed. The second step was to provide an analytical expression for the <b>flow</b> <b>cast</b> time of a power-law suspension from a tank with a given geometry. Considering the large difference between the industrial inner tank diameter and the evacuation pipe diameter, we assumed that all the pressure drop was located in the evacuation pipe. Then, extending the Hagen-Poiseuille equation to Ostwald fluid, we were able to predict the emptying time with the knowledge of k and n. Experimental and predicted emptying time are in very good agreement. This work helped the industrial manufacturer to divide the emptying time by a factor 12...|$|R
