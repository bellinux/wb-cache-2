We have attempted to develop an exact protocol to maximize DNA expression while minimizing tissue damage following EP of skeletal muscle in vivo. Specifically, we investigated the effects of varying injection techniques, electrode surface geometry, and plasmid mediums. Results We found that {{as the amount of}} damage increased in skeletal muscle in response to EP, the level of β-galactosidase (β-gal) expression drastically decreased {{and that there was no}} evidence of β-gal expression in damaged fibers. Two specific types of electrodes yielded the greatest amount of expression. We also discovered that DNA uptake in skeletal muscle following intra-arterial injection of DNA was significantly enhanced by EP. Finally, we found that DMSO and LipoFECTAMINE™, common enhancers of <b>DNA</b> <b>electroporation</b> in vitro, had no positive effect on <b>DNA</b> <b>electroporation</b> in vivo.

We have established conditions for DNA transformation of axenically grown Leishmania infantum amastigotes. Parameters for <b>DNA</b> <b>electroporation</b> of Leishmania axenic amastigotes were systematically studied using luciferase-mediated transient transfection. Cell lines expressing stable luciferase activity were then selected, {{and their ability}} to be used in an in vitro drug screening procedure was determined. A model was established, using axenic amastigotes expressing luciferase activity, for rapidly determining the activity of drugs directly against both axenic and intracellular amastigotes. For intracellular amastigotes, the 50 % effective concentrations of pentamidine, sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam), meglumine (Glucantime), and potassium antimonyl tartrate determined with the luciferase assay were 0. 2 μM (0. 12 μg/ml), 55 μg/ml, 95 μg/ml, and 0. 12 μg/ml, respectively; these values are in agreement with values determined by more labor-intensive staining methods. We also showed the usefulness of luciferase-expressing parasites for analyzing drug resistance. The availability of luciferase-expressing amastigotes for use in high-throughput screening should facilitate the search for new antileishmanial drugs...|$|E

The initial experiments were designed to investigate and optimize conditions for electroporation of H. influenzae. Plasmid DNA was introduced into the competence proficient strain Rd and its competence-deficient uptake mutants com- 52, com- 59, and com- 88, and the recombination deficient mutant rec 1. Plasmid DNA could also be electroporated into the non-transforming strains Ra, Rc, Re and Rf. Plasmid DNA without sequences {{that are involved in}} tight binding (uptake) of DNA by competent cells of H. influenzae Rd was electroporated into both competent and non-competent cells. Competent cells were several orders of magnitude less efficient than non-competent cells for <b>electroporation</b> of plasmid <b>DNAs.</b> <b>Electroporation</b> of H. influenzae chromosomal DNA was not successful. Low levels of integration of chromosomal markers were observed following electroporation and these could be ascribed to transformation.

We examined the efficiency of a new gene transfer method that targets interstitial cells by using parenchymal injection of <b>DNA</b> followed by <b>electroporation.</b> Methods. Fluoresceinisothiocyanate-labelled oligo-deoxynucleotides (FITC-ODNs) or expression vectors were directly injected into the cortex of the kidney, followed by electroporation. Results. Transfection with FITC-ODNs or the EGFP expression vector resulted in efficient transfection in interstitial fibroblasts, but not in tubular epithelial cells or glomerular cells. Transfection efficiency was optimal after using a total of 150 mg of DNA in 1000 ml of PBS, combined with clamping of the renal vessels prior to electroporation. Gene expression peaked at 4 days after transfection and decreased by two orders of magnitude at 6 weeks post-transfection; however, expression recovered to near peak levels after parenchymal or intraperitoneal injection of FR 901228, a histone deacetylase inhibitor.

40|$|The use of {{adenovirus}} (Ad) as vaccine vectors is {{hindered by}} pre-existing immunity to human Ads {{in most of}} the human population. In order to overcome this limitation, uncommon alternative Ad serotypes need to be utilized, In this study, an E 1 -E 3 deleted recombinant Ad based on the chimpanzee serotype 3 (ChAd 3) was engineered to express human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) protein or rat neu extracellular/transmembrane domains (ECD. TM). ChAd 3 vectors were tested in CEA transgenic (CEA. Tg) and BALB/NeuT mice, which show immunologic tolerance to these antigens. ChAd 3 is capable of inducing an immune response comparable to that of hAd 5 serotype-based vectors, thus breaking tolerance to tumor associated antigens (TAAs) and achieving anti-tumor effects. Of importance is that ChAd 3 can overcome hAd 5 pre-existing immunity and work in conjunction with <b>DNA</b> <b>electroporation</b> (DNA-EP) and other Ad vaccines based on common human serotypes.

40|$|PURPOSE: DNA {{vaccines}} {{require both}} efficient delivery methods and appropriate adjuvants. Based on their mechanisms of action, we hypothesised that some adjuvants could enhance vaccine immunogenicity or direct the response towards Th 1 profile after intradermal <b>DNA</b> <b>electroporation.</b> METHODS: After intradermal electroporation of plasmid DNA encoding luciferase, mice received hyaluronidase, imiquimod, monophosphoryl lipid A or were tape stripped {{in order to}} modulate the immune response against the encoded protein. We measured total immunoglobulin G, IgG 1, IgG 2 a titres and the cytokines produced by splenocyte cultures to assess both humoral and cellular response. The effect of tape stripping on the response against intradermally delivered ovalbumin protein was also assessed. RESULTS: Neither hyaluronidase nor imiquimod improved the immune response against the encoded luciferase. Monophosphoryl lipid A did not modify the cytokines production but increased the anti-luciferase IgG 2 a titres. Tape stripping significantly increased anti-luciferase IgG 2 a and IFN-gamma responses. It also enhanced the humoral response after intradermal injection of the ovalbumin protein. CONCLUSIONS: Tape stripping is able to increase the Th 1 immune response against both DNA and protein vaccines. Therefore, tape stripping appears to have interesting adjuvant effect on intradermal vaccination...|$|E

In this study, we show that RNA interference (RNAi) functions throughout spermatogenesis in mice. We first carried out in vivo <b>DNA</b> <b>electroporation</b> of the testis during {{the first wave of}} spermatogenesis to enable foreign gene expression in spermatogenic cells at different stages of differentiation. Using prepubertal testes at different ages and differentiation stage-specific promoters, reporter gene expression was predominantly observed in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and round spermatids. This method was next applied to introduce DNA vectors that express small hairpin RNAs, and the sequence-specific reduction in the reporter gene products was confirmed at each stage of spermatogenesis. RNAi against endogenous Dmc 1, which encodes a DNA recombinase that is expressed and functionally required in spermatocytes, led to the same phenotypes observed in null mutant mice. Thus, RNAi is effective in male germ cells during mitosis and meiosis as well as in haploid cells.

Keratin 14 promoter restricts gene expression to keratinocytes of the epidermal basal layer, CD 11 c promoter to dendritic cells and fascin promoter only to mature dendritic cells. The use of plasmids with tissue specific promoter resulted in significant, but very low protein expression, as compared to that obtained with ubiquitous promoter plasmids. Immunisation with both ubiquitous promoter plasmids elicited humoral and cellular anti-luciferase immune response.

Using a peptide array, a specific profile of B-cell reactive epitopes was identified when hTERT vaccine was combined with IMO. The combination of IMO with hTERT genetic vaccine did not impact vaccine-induced TERT-specific cell-mediated immunity.

L 2 / 3 pyramidal cells expressed ChR 2 -EYFP, but histology revealed abnormal morphology and targeting of ChR 2 -EYFP expressing axons, beginning at postnatal day (P) 33 and increasing with age. Axonal abnormalities included cylinders that enveloped pyramidal cell proximal apical dendrites, and spherical, calyx-like structures that surrounded neuronal cell bodies, including in L 4. These are abnormal subcellular and laminar targets for L 2 / 3 pyramidal cell synapses. Abnormalities did not occur in cells expressing GFP instead of ChR 2, or in intermixed ChR 2 -negative axons. Long-term viral-mediated expression (80 d) did not cause axonal abnormalities when the CAG promoter was used, but produced some abnormalities with the stronger αCaMKII promoter (albeit much less than with in utero electroporation).

Nonunion fracture {{was created in the}} radii of C 3 H/HeN mice, into which a collagen sponge was placed. To allow for recruitment of host progenitor cells (HPCs) into the implanted sponge, the mice were housed for 10 days before electroporation.

In vivo bioluminescent imaging indicated that gene expression was localized to the defect site. Microcomputed tomography (µCT) and histological analysis of murine radii electroporated with BMP- 9 demonstrated bone formation bridging the bone gap, whereas in the control groups the defect remained unbridged. Population of the implanted collagen sponge by HPCs transfected with the injected plasmid following electroporation was noted.

DNA vaccines encoding this single chain antibody fused to the SIV capsid protein were delivered to six monkeys each by either intramuscular electroporation or conventional intramuscular injection co-injected or not with poly ICLC, a stabilized poly I: C analogue, as adjuvant.

The GFP-labeled myelinating OLs were detected in the adult cortex when electroporation was targeted to the ventral neuroepithelium, demonstrating at least some of the myelinating OLs {{are derived from}} the ventral forebrain. However, when electroporation was targeted to the dorsal, we could not find GFP-labeled myelinating OLs. This suggests that the progenitors of cortical OPCs are absent or located at restricted regions in the dorsal forebrain (cortex) at E 12...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{vaccination}} holds {{great promise}} {{for the prevention}} and treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. However, the clinical ability of DNA vaccines is still controversial due to the limited immune response initially observed in humans. We hypothesized that electroporation of a plasmid encoding the HIV- 1 Gag viral capsid protein would enhance cancer DNA vaccine potency. <b>DNA</b> <b>electroporation</b> used to deliver plasmids in vivo, induced type I interferons, thereby supporting the activation of innate immunity. The coadministration of ovalbumin (OVA) and HIV- 1 Gag encoding plasmids modulated the adaptive immune response. This strategy favored antigen-specific Th 1 immunity, delayed B 16 F 10 -OVA tumor growth and improved mouse survival in both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination approaches. Similarly, a prophylactic DNA immunization against the melanoma-associated antigen gp 100 was enhanced by the codelivery of the HIV- 1 Gag plasmid. The adjuvant effect was not driven by the formation of HIV- 1 Gag virus-like particles. This work highlights the ability of both electroporation and the HIV- 1 Gag plasmid to stimulate innate immunity for enhancing cancer DNA vaccine immunogenicity and demonstrates interesting tracks {{for the design of}} new translational genetic adjuvants to overcome the current limitations of DNA vaccines in humans...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the use of Leishmania cells as a novel eukaryotic expression system {{for the production of}} recombinant protein. These cells are easy to maintain, requiring no CO 2 incubator or shaker, and can be grown in standard tissue culture media. Leishmania cells can be readily transfected with plasmid <b>DNA</b> by <b>electroporation</b> and transformants selected with antibiotic resistance. Recent studies have shown {{that it is possible to}} express foreign genes in Leishmania for the purpose of understanding the biology of this protozoan cell. In the present study we report the use of this system as a means of producing a biologically functional human p 53 protein. The conformation of the p 53 protein is critical for its ability to bind specific DNA sequences. It is demonstrated that Leishmania-synthesized human p 53 is phosphorylated and can bind specifically to its enhancer DNA sequence. These data demonstrate that Leishmania may represent a simple eukaryotic expression system for the production of biologically active recombinant proteins...|$|R
40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (mAbs) have wide clinical utility, but global {{access is}} limited by high costs and impracticalities associated with repeated passive administration. Here, we describe an optimized electroporation-based DNA gene transfer platform technology that can be utilized for production of functional mAbs in vivo, {{with the potential to}} reduce costs and administration burdens. We demonstrate that multiple mAbs can be simultaneously expressed at protective concentrations for a protracted period of time using <b>DNA</b> doses and <b>electroporation</b> conditions that are feasible clinically. The expressed mAbs could also protect mice against lethal influenza or Ebola virus challenges. Our findings suggest that this DNA gene transfer platform technology could be a game-changing advance that expands access to effective mAb therapeutics globally...|$|R
40|$|To achieve high {{transfection}} {{efficiency in}} human fibroblasts with good preservation of proliferative capacity we developed an electroporation procedure that combines two distinct modalities: use of recipient cells synchronized {{in the late}} G 2 /mitotic phase of the cell cycle and treatment of cells post-electroporation with 5 mM butyrate. This combination enabled reduction of plasmid <b>DNA</b> concentration and <b>electroporation</b> voltage, both associated with cytotoxicity, while greatly enhancing transfection efficiencies. Although the method was primarily developed for transient expression it was also found to improve stable expression. This procedure should have wide applicability, particularly in studies seeking to identify DNA sequences that lead to inhibition of DNA synthesis and proliferation in human fibroblasts and other cells refractory to transfection...|$|R
