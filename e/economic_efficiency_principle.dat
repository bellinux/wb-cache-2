A few scholars (Mu and Zhao 1996), who studied economic evaluation methods for the exploration phase, have recommended the use of adjusted conventional natural gas evaluation parameters to perform economic evaluations in resource-rich areas that have been explored only at a low level. However, studies on CBM’s economic evaluation methods in the target selection phase are rare.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHealth {{technology}} assessment (HTA) is a rapidly developing {{area and the}} value of taking non-clinical fields into consideration is growing. Although the health-economic aspect is commonly recognised, evaluating organisational impact has not been studied nearly as much. The goal of this work was to provide a definition of organisational impact in the sector of medical devices by defining its contours and exploring the evaluation methods specific to this field. Following an analysis of the literature concerning the impact of technologies on organisations as well as the medical literature, and also after reviewing the regulatory texts in this respect, the group of experts identified 12 types of organisational impact. A number of medical devices were carefully screened using the criteria grid, which proved to be operational and to differentiate properly. From the analysis of the practice and of the methods described, the group was then able to derive a few guidelines to successfully evaluate organisational impact. This work shows that taking organisational impact into consideration may be critical alongside of the other criteria currently in favour (clinically and economically). What remains is to confer a role in the decision-making process on this factor and one that meets the <b>economic</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>principle...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} {{purpose of}} the thesis is to inquire into the interference between the law of contract and fundamental rights, dealing with those cases of admixture between personhood and business relationships that U. S. legal doctrine usually means by the label of “commodification”. The purpose is to apply {{the results of this}} research to those typical situations of interference between market logic and requirements of personal protection, such as (but not only) the right of publicity and general situations of commercial exploitation of personhood. In our legal system, such as in others, the legal doctrine has usually discussed these phenomena sometimes looking at them in a dualistic perspective: on one hand the right of personhood, on the other side the property right on the economic object, built in the form of copyright. This dualistic conception did not lead to satisfactory solutions on both fields: of damages and special rules for the consensus. For both, the dualistic perspective has often failed to analyze problems in a dynamic dimension: the dimension of the conflict between the holder's identity, changing over time, and the binding nature of contract. Starting from the conflict between the holder's identity, changing over time, and the binding nature of contract, the scope of inquiry being extended by encompassing {{the point of view of}} Legal Pluralism, especially with reference to scientific computing offered by the socio-legal German doctrine (Ehrlich, Luhman, Teubner etc.). The perspective of “interlegality” linked with personal identity could be an effective key concept in view of recognizing and understanding identity-choices: in other words, choices that are incomprehensible under the label of pure consumption choice (market choice and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>principle).</b> Such a dynamic perspective involves the overcoming of the classical conception of fundamental right and private choice, understood as the consumption choice: a measure of autonomy based on rationality of efficiency, made out of time and by an absolutely selfish person...|$|E
40|$|Ask for a {{definition}} of the word public-private partnership in a room filled with people from different cultures, and their answers may differ remarkably. The American of the group might refer to privatization and contracting out of traditional government services. A Dutch person might think {{of a network of}} public and private actors, negotiating to deliver services in unison. A Hungarian may think of completely different consequences, such as opening up government to public actors, helping to strengthen democratic institutions. While some proponents of this form of market governance may present these features of public-private partnerships as a single package, it remains important to understand that the effectiveness and type of public-private partnership will vary according to culture. This has particular implications for the influence of PPP on sustainable development. This paper will examine the role of public-private partnerships in breaking down hierarchical structures and helping to better achieve sustainable development. It will also examine the role that cultural factors play when exploring the potential advantages and disadvantages of public-private partnerships. It will use Hungary {{as an example of how}} culture influences how the government interprets public-private partnerships. With its recent accession to the European Union and the quick transfer to a market-based economy, Hungary has been driven to a style of governance closely related to an American model of the welfare state, one based on neo-liberal <b>principles</b> of <b>economic</b> <b>efficiency.</b> These <b>principles,</b> while they may be effective in a country with a weak tradition of government intervention and strong business interests, can be less effective in a country where local industry is fragile, and there’s been a long tradition of some form of corporatist governance. ...|$|R

Energy and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were {{evaluated}} on young (6 year) and old (20 year) jhum fields in Mizoram, north-eastern India during {{second year of}} cropping, and were compared {{with those in the}} first year. The effect of auxiliary measures such as tilling the soil or application of fertilizers (chemical or farm-yard manure or both in combination) was also examined on energy and <b>economic</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> The results indicated that traditional jhum cultivation is labour intensive and energy efficient, producing almost 15 - 20 times of energy invested.
