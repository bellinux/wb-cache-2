40|$|Background: The {{consumption}} of aquatic nutrition sources, especially fishes, {{considered as a}} partial supply of protein, for ever-increasing demand of protein. According to statistics, the annual {{consumption of}} aquatic sources per capita in the word increased from 14. 3 <b>Kg</b> <b>in</b> the <b>year</b> 1994 to more than 15. 75 <b>Kg</b> <b>in</b> 1997 and in Iran it increased from less than 1 <b>kg</b> <b>in</b> the <b>year</b> 1978 to 4. 57 <b>kg</b> <b>in</b> the <b>year</b> 1996.

In this descriptive cross-sectional study heavy metals concentration Cd, Cr, Pb and Ni in cultured ponds fishes of Khorramabad city were studied in 2006. Materials and Methods: To evaluate the safety of the cultured ponds fishes in khorramabad city from toxic heavy metals Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb, 240 samples of fishes were collected. The fishes were collected in the Spring and Summer seasons in 2006. The samples washed and digested with acid before using Atomic Absorption for determination of the metals, then data were analyzed using t-test and SPSS software. Results: The results of the study showed that the average value of Lead, Chromium, Cadmium and Nickel in ten cultured ponds fishes tissue were 0. 46, 0. 06, 0. 053 and 0. 30 ppm (dry weight basis) respectively The study also showed that the amounts of Pb in 27 %, Cd in 8 %, Cr in 3 % and Ni in 25 % of the samples exceeded the WHO standard limits while the averages were blow the standard. Conclusion: The statistical analysis of the samples showed that there are not significant differences between the different species of the fishes for all the heavy metals, except the fishes collected from the cultured ponds. Higher amount of the heavy metals in sea fishes could be related to fish food, which could bioaccumulated in fish tissues.

The most appropriate preventive method used, according to the characteristics of SMEs in Indonesia, is Cleaner Production. This study aims to reduce the risk of environmental pollution caused by the waste production of small chips industries by implementing cleaner production. The method used in this study is quick scanning by analyzing mass balance, energy, and utilities that aim to find an inefficient process to minimize losses.

In year one all steers were fed the same diet (0. 29 Mcal of NEg/kg DM, 0. 41 Mcal of NEm/kg DM) on an ad libitum basis, treatments M and EL for 172 days and treatments C, ME, and EH for 179 days.
