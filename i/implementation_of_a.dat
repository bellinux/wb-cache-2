5|$|During the 2010 {{election}} campaign, Gillard {{also said}} that no carbon tax would be introduced under a government she led. In the first hung parliament result in 70 years, the Gillard Government, {{with the support of}} the Australian Greens and some cross bench independents, negotiated the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> carbon tax (the preferred policy of the Australian Greens), by which a fixed-price carbon tax would proceed to a floating-price ETS within a few years under the plans. The government proposed the Clean Energy Bill in February 2011, which the opposition claimed to be a broken election promise.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, Indonesian {{police and}} {{security}} forces tightened the security in and around Borobudur temple compound, as a precaution to a threat posted on social media by a self-proclaimed Indonesian branch of ISIS, citing that the terrorists planned to destroy Borobudur and other statues in Indonesia. The security improvements included the repair and increased deployment of CCTV monitors and the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> night patrol {{in and around the}} temple compound.

40|$|The {{effective}} <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{integrated management}} system (IMS) is increasingly recognised as essential {{for all types}} of organisations facing today’s turbulent and competitive environment. Literature stresses that most companies could benefit from moving from the mere adoption of the International Standards Organisation (ISO) quality standards to the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> IMS linking strategy and operations by means <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interrelated set <b>of</b> management tools. However, despite the wide range of investigated issues, scholarly literature still mainly focuses upon large organisations, and although much {{progress has been made in}} recent years, many questions on how an IMS could be implemented in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remain unanswered. In order to contribute to this research gap, this paper investigates the process characterising the effective <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> IMS in a leading SME and the main factors enabling the changeover from the adoption of ISO quality standards to the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> IMS. The <b>implementation</b> process identified here is synthesised in a framework which can support the understanding and the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> IMS in SMEs...|$|R
5|$|MacArthur gave {{immunity}} to Shiro Ishii {{and other members}} of the bacteriological research units in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. He also exempted the Emperor and all members of the imperial family implicated in war crimes, including Princes Chichibu, Asaka, Takeda, Higashikuni and Fushimi, from criminal prosecutions. MacArthur confirmed that the emperor's abdication would not be necessary. In doing so, he ignored the advice of many members of the imperial family and Japanese intellectuals who publicly called for the abdication of the Emperor and the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regency.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Kevin Rudd {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following {{the failure of the}} Government's insulation program, controversy regarding the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tax on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy. Significant disaffection had arisen within the Labor Party as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd. On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard had asked him to hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the Labor Party, and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Scott's {{recruiting}} {{difficulties in}} Virginia continued, despite the <b>implementation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> draft {{by the state}} legislature. Finally, in October 1779, he forwarded troops sent to him from Washington's Northern Army on to Lincoln in South Carolina, fulfilling his quota. He retained only Abraham Buford's regiment with him in Virginia. In February 1780, about 750 men sent by Washington under William Woodford arrived at Scott's camp in Petersburg, Virginia. Virginia authorities, fearing that the British force to the south under General Henry Clinton would turn north to Virginia, detained Scott and Woodford until {{it was clear that}} Clinton's object was Lincoln's position at Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E
