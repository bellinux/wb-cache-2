500|$|Balzac worked {{these scenes}} from his boyhood—as he did {{many aspects of}} his life and the lives of those around him—into La Comédie Humaine. His time at Vendôme is {{reflected}} in Louis Lambert, his 1832 novel about a young boy studying at an Oratorian grammar school at Vendôme. The narrator says : [...] "He devoured books of every kind, feeding indiscriminately on religious works, history and literature, philosophy and physics. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he found indescribable delight in reading dictionaries for lack of other books." ...|$|E
500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{change the}} subject I asked him whether he had any further {{information}} about the war, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> was raging in Europe.|$|E
60|$|Cecily. Yes, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{all about}} poor Mr. Bunbury, and his terrible state of health.|$|R
6000|$|... "A great deal. In fact, I {{think we}} talked of nothing else. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of your triumphs and your victims; of your various campaigns and your conquests. And yet I dare say <b>he</b> <b>has</b> not <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all--and I am dying to hear more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing whatever. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{nothing of}} them. In earlier days,--soon after our marriage,--he bade me {{get money from}} you." ...|$|R
60|$|Still I {{could not}} take him seriously. I did not for a moment believe what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> But he was in very real distress.|$|E
6000|$|... "My father's a parson in Norfolk," [...] it said. Evidently he had {{forgotten}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> this important fact before. Truly a nice little tale.|$|E
6000|$|You may {{remember}} a story <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about some anonymous friend. [...] "His latest," [...] said he now, [...] "is to send David a rocking-horse!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At last we are alone. My Elinor, {{you do not}} {{yet know}} all my happiness. Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is indeed, {{something}} very particular. I {{have been with}} papa this morning, Adolphus: <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of the interview between you last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has made}} an appointment. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that he'll never leave me alone. He'll be the death of me {{if this is not}} settled." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> confidentially," [...] Caroline concluded, [...] "that he {{was going}} to wear brown to-day. Now I think Eddy would have looked nice in brown." ...|$|E
60|$|It gave me no pleasure. If <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that {{he admired}} my bowling I {{might not have}} {{believed}} him, but should have loved him for it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does {{that view}} of the {{situation}} still satisfy you?" [...] I asked, when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of this singular experience; I liked his apparently not coloring it at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Jack. That is, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about a {{good many}} things. Of course I don't suppose he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{about some of the}} tricks they played." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A single man," [...] I answered. [...] "In {{all things}} an idealist. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> will never marry until {{he can find}} his ideal woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed {{he would}} not; {{he would like}} it. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so. It sounds so cold to him to be called Mr. Belton by his relations." ...|$|R
60|$|My wife thought Harry {{had been}} hunting, and I {{did not care}} to undeceive her, though what I had seen and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> made me {{naturally}} very anxious.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at large, {{though on}} several occasions, the {{treatment}} {{he had met}} with from the Jew, and what expense he had put him to; how at length he had cast him, as above, and had recovered good damage of him, but that the rogue was unable to make him any considerable reparation. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> also how the Prince de ----'s gentleman had resented his treatment of his master, and how he had caused him to be used upon the Pont Neuf, &c., as I have mentioned above, which I laughed at most heartily.|$|E
6000|$|After <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that the}} workers had to furnish their own tools, brads, [...] "grindery," [...] cardboard, rent, light, and what not, it was plain that his thirty bob was a {{diminishing}} quantity.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{cared for}} <b>me,</b> why couldn't <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so at once, and not had me wait till {{he got to}} Venice? He knew I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well yes, or at {{any rate}} that they're not what they should be. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he didn't esteem them. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> such {{wonderful}} things--he's so interesting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is quite}} {{willing to give up}} the match. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so, and said as much to his aunt, whom I have seen three times on the subject." ...|$|R
60|$|With this preface, he {{told the}} Indian {{traveller}} all that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> at the Shivering Sand. Even the immovable Mr. Murthwaite was so interested in what he heard, that he let his cheroot go out.|$|E
60|$|Nothing could disturb his equanimity. I felt dissatisfied, but I {{could not}} very well fly out at him. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> many useful things--and besides he was the brother of that wealthy merchant. That seemed queer enough.|$|E
60|$|I {{found the}} letter {{he had spoken}} of. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> where it would be. It {{contained}} a bundle of banknotes which he was giving me--so he wrote--with the advice {{to get rid of}} them as quickly as possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you mean, Laura, by 'all'? Sir Percival {{will know}} enough (<b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so himself) {{if he knows}} that the {{engagement}} is opposed to your own wishes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As for my father, {{the very}} threats which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> used make me {{conscious}} that I {{have only to}} measure the price. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> will stop my allowance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{or rather}} to plead for him. You will not, I hope, {{be angry with}} him because <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> much of his history while we were {{travelling}} home alone together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This was {{the first}} time that Matthias had ever spoken to me about Judith, and I knew just as well as if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that it was Dorcas Stone's clothes that had got him into that way of thinking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, never, never!" [...] cried Cecil, {{with most}} unusual excitement. [...] "He {{told me all}} that {{concerned}} himself at the very first. I wish <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> who it was. How much it would have saved! Rosamond, you know, I am sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{all this}} doesn't {{tell me how}} you came to hang on to our side ladder," [...] I inquired, in the hardly audible murmurs we used, after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} more of the proceedings on board the Sephora once the bad weather was over.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Giatron," [...] he began, [...] "I {{have been}} having a chat with Louis. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of his troubles--told me {{the reason for his}} leaving Luigi and {{accepting}} this post with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peyton Dunwoodie hates no one," [...] said Frances, quickly; then, {{blushing}} {{at her own}} ardor, {{she added}} immediately, [...] "he loves you, Henry, I know; for <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so again and again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{just heard}} from him. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so. Come, my dear, let me have the {{pleasure}} of hearing you say that things shall be pleasant again between you and him. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> yielded." ...|$|R
