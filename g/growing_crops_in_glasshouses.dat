40|$|<b>Growing</b> <b>crops</b> <b>in</b> {{greenhouses}} {{can increase}} off-season availability {{of vegetables and}} improve product quality through better control against damage from pests and weather. However, greenhouse cultivation is a labour- and time-intensive way of farming, and requires considerable financial investment. A group of NGOs in Dominica, having joined forces to encourage diversification of the island's agriculture, set out to promote greenhouse cultivation. With support from CTA, they published a practical manual on <b>growing</b> <b>crops</b> <b>in</b> greenhouses, covering all the steps, from construction to marketing the yields.
