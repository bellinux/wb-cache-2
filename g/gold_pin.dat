5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small <b>gold</b> <b>pin,</b> containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E

25|$|The badge is {{the most}} {{prominent}} symbol of membership. The Official Badge of the Fraternity is a <b>gold</b> <b>pin</b> {{in the shape of}} a Roman fasces topped with a double-edged ax and crowned in the superior of the fasces of six stars, each star with an argent pearl at its centre. The fasces are held together by two ropes in gold that tie the fasces at the top and at the bottom and in which the middle is tied in the form of an x-shaped cross. In the middle of the fasces, above the ropes lies an argent riband in which engraved to it are the Greek Letters Phi Iota Alpha. The badge dies at the bottom with a golden sphere that culminates the fasces.|$|E

60|$|She {{tore the}} belt off {{and threw it}} at Joanna's feet. She flung down with haste the armlets, the <b>gold</b> <b>pins,</b> the flowers; and the long hair, released, fell {{scattered}} over her shoulders, framing in its blackness the wild exaltation of her face.|$|R

5000|$|The concept, in {{the second}} sense, was popularized in the 1896 US Presidential Election, when William McKinley {{supporters}} took to wearing <b>gold</b> lapel <b>pins,</b> <b>gold</b> neckties, and gold headbands in a demonstration of support for gold against the [...] "silver menace." ...|$|R
2500|$|... (or <b>Gold)</b> <b>Pin</b> in the 1829 Craven Stakes, {{the first}} {{important}} {{race of the}} season at Newmarket. [...] Among his opponents were Zinganee, ridden by Sam Chifney, Jr., and the King's favourite, Fleur-de-lis. [...] In the race, Golden Pin finished unplaced behind Zinganee, but of greater long term consequence was {{the arrival of the}} young Flatman on the Newmarket scene. [...] It wasn't until the following season that he had his first win, but after that [...] "the boy's rise in his profession was rapid and unintermitted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just like students, {{awards and}} {{recognition}} were also given to adults. Known as the Service Gold – The National Courtesy Award, {{it serves as}} a platform to recognise the efforts put in by various hotel staff [...] "who have gone out of the way to help others, be it colleague or guest", and it opened to all members of the Singapore Hotel Association (SHA). The award that was bestowed upon the recognised staff {{came in the form of}} a certificate and a 23K gold-plated Service <b>Gold</b> <b>pin,</b> which they would wear at work. To assess how courteous civil servants were in dealing with the public, the government would hire private companies to perform undercover courtesy auditor.|$|E

6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] Robert Gregory asked rather curiously, for his {{companion}} {{had the look}} of a well-to-do man, although perhaps rather of a sporting cut. He wore a good substantial great-coat with a velvet collar, a very good hat, put rather on one side of his head, and a quiet scarf, with a <b>gold</b> <b>pin</b> representing a jockey's cap and whip.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did meet}} him in a way," [...] Brown said, biting his finger rather nervously--"I did really. And {{it was too dark}} to see him properly, because it was under that bandstand affair.

5000|$|The {{black dress}} {{was made from}} pieces of silk and lycra fabric, with {{oversized}} <b>gold</b> safety <b>pins</b> placed at [...] "strategical places". The dress was wide open at the front, {{from the neck down}} to at least halfway across the bosom, with two slimline straps on the shoulders each side connected by a <b>gold</b> safety <b>pin</b> and two cut-away parts on both sides that were held together with six <b>gold</b> safety <b>pins</b> on each side and one {{at the top of the}} cut-away on each side connecting it to the bosom section. The dress is said to be punk-inspired, [...] "neo-punk", and something which [...] "emerged from the sari development" [...] according to Gianni Versace himself.|$|R

'My son,' he said, 'I {{have heard}} that you have {{declared}} that if I made you keeper of my treasures you would never lose {{so much as a}} <b>gold</b> <b>pin.</b> Now, in order to prove the truth of your words, I am going to throw the ring from the princess's finger into the brook, and if you do not find it before I come back from council, you will have to die a horrible death.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your Majesty,' {{they said}} to the king, one day, as he was {{standing}} {{on the steps of the}} palace, 'that fellow has been boasting again, that if he had the care of your treasures not so much as a <b>gold</b> <b>pin</b> should ever be lost. Put this vain fellow to the proof, we pray you, and throw the ring from the princess's finger into the brook, and bid him find it. We shall soon see what his talk is worth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have to keep}} a look-out," [...] {{said the}} man with the {{motionless}} face. He was a quiet, well-featured fellow, rather sallow; his dark clothes had nothing distinctive about them, except that his black necktie was worn rather high, like a stock, and secured by a <b>gold</b> <b>pin</b> with some grotesque head to it. Nor was there anything notable in the face, except something that was probably a mere nervous trick--a habit of opening one eye more narrowly than the other, giving the impression that the other was larger, or was, perhaps, artificial.|$|E

Perhaps; I don't know.... What shall I do? What shall I say? Now suppose," [...] I went on, [...] "I like myself that much," [...] and I held my thumb and finger just ajar, [...] "then I like you, think of you, hope for you, why, that!"--and I swept my hand clean across the empty zenith.

60|$|His temper passed off arter a time, and 'e {{began to}} look cheerful agin. It was a lovely morning, and, {{having nothing to do}} and plenty in 'is pocket to do it with, he went along like a schoolboy with a 'arf holiday. He went as far as Stratford {{on the top of a}} tram for a mouthful o' fresh air, and came back to his {{favourite}} coffee-shop with a fine appetite for dinner. There was a very nice gentlemanly chap sitting opposite 'im, and the way he begged Sam's pardon for splashing gravy over 'im made Sam take a liking to him at once. Nicely dressed he was, with a <b>gold</b> <b>pin</b> in 'is tie, and a fine gold watch-chain acrost his weskit; and Sam could see he 'ad been brought up well by the way he used 'is knife and fork. He kept looking at Sam in a thoughtful kind o' way, and at last he said wot a beautiful morning it was, and wot a fine day it must be in the, country. In a little while they began to talk like a couple of old friends, and he told Sam all about 'is father, wot was a clergyman in the country, and Sam talked about a father of his as was living private on three 'undred a year.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are some}} splendid tailors' {{shops in the}} High Street of Southampton, in the fine plate-glass windows of which hang {{gorgeous}} waistcoats of all sorts, of silk and velvet, and gold and crimson, and pictures of the last new fashions, in which those wonderful gentlemen with quizzing glasses, and holding on to little boys with the exceeding large eyes and curly hair, ogle ladies in riding habits prancing by the Statue of Achilles at Apsley House. Jos, although provided {{with some of the}} most splendid vests that Calcutta could furnish, thought he could not go to town until he was supplied with one or two of these garments, and selected a crimson satin, embroidered with gold butterflies, and a black and red velvet tartan with white stripes and a rolling collar, with which, and a rich blue satin stock and a <b>gold</b> <b>pin,</b> consisting of a five-barred gate with a horseman in pink enamel jumping over it, he thought he might make his entry into London with some dignity. For Jos's former shyness and blundering blushing timidity had given way to a more candid and courageous self-assertion of his worth. [...] "I don't care about owning it," [...] Waterloo Sedley would say to his friends, [...] "I am a dressy man"; and though rather uneasy if the ladies looked at him at the Government House balls, and though he blushed and turned away alarmed under their glances, it was chiefly from a dread lest they should make love to him that he avoided them, being averse to marriage altogether. But there was no such swell in Calcutta as Waterloo Sedley, I have heard say, and he had the handsomest turn-out, gave the best bachelor dinners, and had the finest plate in the whole place.|$|E
