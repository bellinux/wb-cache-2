5|$|From March 1958 Formby {{appeared}} in the musical comedy Beside the Seaside, a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play {{may not have been}} to southern audiences' tastes—the plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to Beside the Seaside, he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat in January, and in April hosted his own show, Steppin' Out With Formby. During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. When doctors examined him, they were concerned with his overall health, {{partly as a result of}} his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and <b>had</b> <b>heart</b> problems.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Have</b> <b>Heart's</b> final {{show was}} played on National Edge Day 2009 in Revere, Massachusetts, {{along with other}} {{straight}} edge bands. Many members of bands presented testimonies of how members from <b>Have</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>had</b> a huge influence on their lives and careers, along with presenting stories of good times shared with members of <b>Have</b> <b>Heart.</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Heart's</b> last performance consisted of songs from all three of their releases and went for roughly one hour. Fans responded strongly, with some even using boogie boards for stage diving. The last song they played was [...] "Watch Me Rise" [...] from The Things We Carry. Afterwards, Flynn {{laid out on the}} stage and a good majority of the crowd surrounded him onstage cheering and chanting, [...] "Have Heart," [...] along with fans shouting their personal testimonies to the significance <b>Have</b> <b>Heart</b> <b>had</b> on their lives. This lasted for around 20 minutes straight. Patrick Flynn estimated approximately 1500 people attended, whilst Bridge Nine estimated around 2000.|$|R

He attended the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, where his father was a professor in the university department, before beginning study at Glasgow University in 1834 at the age of 10, not out of any precociousness; the University provided many of the facilities of an elementary school for able pupils, and this was a typical starting age.|$|E
25|$|Disappointed {{with the}} {{indifference}} of European cultural elites to their ideas, the trio returned home. Back in Saint Petersburg Gippius's health deteriorated, {{and for the}} next six years she (along with her husband, who <b>had</b> <b>heart</b> problems) regularly visited European health resorts and clinics. During one such voyage in 1911 Gippius bought a cheap apartment in Paris, at Rue Colonel Bonnet, 11-bis. What at the time felt like a casual, unnecessary purchase, later saved them from homelessness abroad.|$|E

500|$|Numerous {{other causes}} of death have been {{proposed}} over the years, including several forms of rare brain disease or a brain tumor, diabetes, various types of enzyme deficiency, syphilis, apoplexy, delirium tremens, epilepsy and meningeal inflammation. A doctor named John W. Francis examined Poe in May 1848 and believed Poe <b>had</b> <b>heart</b> disease, which Poe later denied. A 2006 test of a sample of Poe's hair provides evidence against the possibility of lead poisoning, mercury poisoning, and similar toxic heavy-metal exposures. Cholera has also been suggested. Poe had passed through Philadelphia in early 1849 during a cholera epidemic. He got sick during {{his time in the}} city and wrote a letter to his aunt, Maria Clemm, saying that he may [...] "have had the cholera, or spasms quite as bad".|$|E
