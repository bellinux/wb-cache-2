The tensile strength increased {{with an increase}} of 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>ratio</b> when it was higher than 50 % in soybean-protein-isolate films, and decreased with an increase of 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>ratio</b> when it was lower than 50 %. Moreover, the total soluble matter of soybean-protein-isolate films decreased with an increase of 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>ratio,</b> while the elongation at break, moisture content, and optical transparency of soybean-protein-isolate films increased with an increase of 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>ratio.</b> Furthermore, 11 S/ 7 <b>S</b> <b>ratios</b> had no influence on the water vapor permeability of soybean-protein-isolate films. These phenomenon mainly resulted from that the matrix of soybean-protein-isolate films was mainly maintained by disulfide bonds when 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>ratio</b> was higher than 50 %, while that was maintained by intermolecular hydrogen bonds when 11 <b>S</b> globulin <b>ratio</b> was lower than 50 %...|$|R
40|$|Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} properties of any structural material including woven fabrics and textile materials. This coefficient determines important mechanical characteristics of fabrics in many applications, including a variety of composite systems containing textiles as a structural element.

In this paper, the practical application of the uniaxial testing of woven fabrics for determining its breaking properties and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> is presented.

For macroscopic wires and nickel nanowires we find Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratios</b> that closely correspond to bulk values, whereas for silver nanowires significant deviations from the bulk silver value are observed. Moreover, repeated measurements on individual silver nanowires at different levels of mechanical and electrical stress yield a small spread in Poisson ratio, with a range of mean values for different wires, all of which are distinct from the bulk value...|$|R
40|$|The pumping {{potential}} (PP) of {{a structure}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of the relative volume change to a relative input stroke. It is introduced to evaluate the volumetric efficiency of a pump. The value of the PP is related to the geometric characteristics and the material properties of the pump structure. A single-layer hyperbolic shell-of-revolution flexible matrix composite (FMC) structure was investigated by Ghoneim and Noor. When under torsion, the rotation of the hyperbolic shell structure causes the throat diameter and the characteristic length to simultaneously decrease, rendering a substantial volumetric decrease and consequently a high PP. Some fibrous composite materials can have negative Effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio.</b> One of their most distinguished characteristics is that they laterally expand under stretching and contract under compression, while for an isotropic material having positive Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio,</b> it expands under compression and contracts under stretching. Therefore, when subjected to axial loading, the relative volume change of a structure made of negative Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> materials would be larger than the corresponding one made of a conventional material. When applied to a pump structure, this characteristic (negative effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio)</b> is expected to increase the pumping potential due to the larger relative volume change. For FMC laminates, when fiber orientation angles are properly set up, a high negative effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> can be obtained. As a result, structures made of these FMC laminates could engender a larger PP. Our work attempts to improve upon the PP of the single-layer hyperbolic shell structure by using multi-layer FMC materials with negative effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio.</b> The study is conducted both analytically and experimentally. The PP of FMC, with negative effective Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio,</b> cylindrical and hyperboloid structures using built-in Matlab codes as well as the ANSYS finite element package, is evaluated. In addition, hyperboloid FMC structures are built and tested. The analytical and experimental PP are compared.

If the H 2 /H 2 O ratio, therefore the oxygen fugacity, is constant in the gas phase, a decrease of the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> {{can be caused by}} a temperature decrease. Hydrogen, however, is a minor species compared with SO 2 and H 2 S, and the H 2 /H 2 O ratio commonly decreases with temperature as a result of reaction (1) under a constant SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> (gas buffer; Giggenbach, 1987). The H 2 /H 2 O ratio of the Shimoedake gas is 5 × 10 − 5, that is three orders of magnitude lower than that controlled by a QFM buffer, a common rock buffer, and {{it is unlikely that the}} SO 2 /H 2 S decrease is caused by a temperature decrease under a constant H 2 /H 2 O ratio. A pressure increase at a constant temperature and the H 2 /H 2 O ratio results in the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> increase (Eq. (2)). The temperature and the oxygen fugacity is likely to be constant at the magma degassing condition, whereas the pressure can be variable. The ten times decrease of the ratio can be caused by a ten times increase of the degassing pressure. The gradual variation of the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratios</b> between 0.8 and 3.3 can be similarly caused by a variation of the degassing pressure by four times.

I demonstrated that this estimation is not sensitive to the average crustal P or S velocity, but is strongly dependent on the V p/V <b>s</b> <b>ratio.</b> The ambiguity is removed by adding a secondary converted phase to the analysis so that both thickness and V p/V <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> can be determined.

Teleseismic P and S arrival delays accurately measured by a multi-channel correlation technique exhibit large azimuthal and lateral variations.

The first uses the receiver function technique to estimate crustal thickness and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> for three receiver stations in the southwestern United States. One station is located in El Paso because relatively few geophysical experiments have been conducted in the southern Rio Grande rift. Two stations are located on the Colorado Plateau, {{in an attempt to}} resolve an ongoing dispute concerning the crustal thickness of this province. ^ The results of the receiver functions studies are used as additional constraints for gravity models along two regional profiles coincident with the much shorter profiles of the Pacific to Arizona Crustal Experiment (PACE) that was led by the U. S. Geological Survey on the Colorado Plateau. Because the profiles extend into adjacent provinces, these models are balanced for isostatic equilibrium and are consistent with elevations predicted by buoyancy calculations. The results are most consistent with a thick (2 ̆ 6 ap; 50 km) crust for the Colorado Plateau and do not support the presence of large lateral thickness variations within the plateau. ^ The second line of research presented also derives Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio,</b> in this case from seismic refraction data. The results are used to interpret a structural cross-section in southwest Washington State and to shed light on a feature of low resistivity (1 – 5 Ωm) located in the High Cascades (the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor or SWCC). This feature is delineated by the interpretation of magnetotelluric and seismic reflection profiles and has been interpreted to be largely composed of Lower Eocene marine sedimentary rocks. ^ Both lines of research estimate Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> using dissimilar techniques, but have produced results consistent with one another. Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratio</b> for quartz-rich rocks (such as sandstones and granites) generally lies between 0. 23 and 0. 26, as exemplified by the upper crust of the Rio Grande rift, and by sedimentary rocks in southwest Washington. In comparison quartz-poor rocks generally exhibit Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>ratios</b> between 0. 28 and 0. 32, typical of the lower crust and the many basaltic formations that comprise the upper crust in southwest Washington.

40|$|The {{applicability}} {{and limitations}} of sulphur isotope ratio as a nuclear forensic signature have been studied. The typically applied leaching methods in uranium mining processes were simulated for five uranium ore samples and the n(34 <b>S)</b> /n(32 <b>S)</b> <b>ratios</b> were measured. The sulphur isotope ratio variation during uranium ore concentrate (UOC) production was also followed using two real-life sample sets obtained from industrial UOC production facilities. Once {{the major source of}} sulphur is revealed, its appropriate application for origin assessment can be established. Our results confirm the previous assumption that process reagents {{have a significant effect on}} the n(34 <b>S)</b> /n(32 <b>S)</b> <b>ratio,</b> thus the sulphur isotope ratio is in most cases a process-related signature.

30|$|The {{variation}} of the CO 2 /SO 2 ratio {{is associated with a}} large {{variation of}} the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> from 3 to 300 (Fig.  8). A large SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> is a common feature of high-temperature fumarolic gases and a small ratio is that of low-temperature gases. These features are commonly considered as a result of temperature dependence of sulfur redox reaction equilibrium (Giggenbach 1987; Symonds et al. 1994). Under an oxygen fugacity controlled by a solid-state buffer, such as QFM, temperature dependence of the H 2 /H 2 O ratio in the gas phase is small (Giggenbach 1987) and the large temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant of the reaction (1) results in a large SO 2 /H 2 S variation with temperature (Fig.  10 in de Moor et al. 2016). The decrease in SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratios</b> from 300 to 3 can be caused by temperature decrease in an equilibrium magma degassing from 1000 to 770  °C under an oxygen fugacity buffer of ∆QFM[*]+[*] 1.3. The estimated temperature range agrees with the range of the apparent equilibrium temperatures (Table  1), and the highest temperature is a reasonable temperature of the erupting basaltic andesite magma.|$|R

There are several researchers that focused their research on analyzing the effect of interbank lending to systemic risk. However, there is a few research that analyzed the effect of banks 2 ̆ 7 decision maker 2 ̆ 7 s behavior, especially on the bank interbank lending to the systemic risk. In this research, the author creates an agent-based simulation of the banking system to analyze the effect of banks 2 ̆ 7 decision maker 2 ̆ 7 s behavior to systemic risk in economic downturn condition.

30|$|A large {{scattering}} {{of the gas}} composition was observed during the eruptive period (Figs.  4, 5, 6), but the variation does not show a systematic correlation with surface manifestations, such as intensive explosions recognized in {{the records of the}} infrasonic waves. Among the variations, systematic correlations are observed between the CO 2 /SO 2 and SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratios,</b> in particular of the results on January 12, 2015 (Fig.  8 a). Logarithm of the CO 2 /SO 2 ratio linearly decreases from 8 to 1.5 with increase in logarithm of the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> from 3 to 30, and the CO 2 /SO 2 is a constant at 1.6 [*]±[*] 0.24 in the SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> range from 30 to 300. The H 2 O/SO 2 and H 2 /SO 2 ratios show a larger scatter than the CO 2 /SO 2 and are almost constant at 30 [*]±[*] 8 and 0.11 [*]±[*] 0.03, respectively (Fig.  8 b, c). Based on the correlation, we assume the following three representative compositions to interpret the observed variation; the CO 2 /SO 2 and SO 2 /H 2 <b>S</b> <b>ratios</b> are 8 and 3.0 for composition A, 1.6 and 30 for B and 1.6 and 300 for C (Table  1). All compositions have the same H 2 O/SO 2 and H 2 /SO 2 ratios of 30 and 0.11, respectively. The AETs under one atmosphere condition are calculated for the compositions A, B and C as 770  °C, 870  °C and 990  °C, respectively (Table  1). The highest estimated temperature of 990  °C agrees with the petrological estimate of the magma temperature, ranging from 1000 to 1100  °C (Saito et al. 2017).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{evolution}} of alternatively spliced exons (ASEs) is of primary interest because these exons are suggested to {{be a major}} source of functional diversity of proteins. Many exon features have been suggested to affect the {{evolution of}} ASEs. However, previous studies have relied on the K A /K <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> test without taking into consideration information sufficiency (i. e., exon length > 75 bp, cross-species divergence > 5 %) of the studied exons, leading to potentially biased interpretations. Furthermore, which exon feature dominates the results of the K A /K <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> test and whether multiple exon features have additive effects have remained unexplored. Results In this study, we collect two different datasets for analysis – the ASE dataset (which includes lineage-specific ASEs and conserved ASEs) and the ACE dataset (which includes only conserved ASEs). We first show that information sufficiency can significantly affect the interpretation of relationship between exons features and the K A /K <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> test results. After discarding exons with insufficient information, we use a Boolean method to analyze the relationship between test results and four exon features (namely length, protein domain overlapping, inclusion level, and exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) frequency) for the ASE dataset. We demonstrate that length and protein domain overlapping are dominant factors, and they have similar impacts on test results of ASEs. In addition, despite the weak impacts of inclusion level and ESE motif frequency when considered individually, combination of these two factors still have minor additive effects on test results. However, the ACE dataset shows a slightly different result in that inclusion level has a marginally significant effect on test results. Lineage-specific ASEs {{may have contributed to the}} difference. Overall, in both ASEs and ACEs, protein domain overlapping is the most dominant exon feature while ESE frequency is the weakest one in affecting test results. Conclusion The proposed method can easily find additive effects of individual or multiple factors on the K A /K <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> test results of exons. Therefore, the system can analyze complex conditions in evolution where multiple features are involved. More factors can also be added into the system to extend the scope of evolutionary analysis of exons. In addition, our method may be useful when orthologous exons can not be found for the K A /K <b>S</b> <b>ratio</b> test. </p...|$|R
