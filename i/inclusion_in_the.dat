40|$|Abstract: A {{theoretical}} {{model of a}} two-component bilayer membrane was used in order to describe the influence of anisotropic membrane inclusions on shapes of membrane daughter micro and nano vesicles. It was shown that for weakly anisotropic inclusions the stable vesicle shapes are only sligthly out-of-round. In contrast, for strongly anisotropic inclusions the stable vesicle shapes may significantly differ from spheres, i. e. they have a flattened oblate shape at small numbers of <b>inclusions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> membrane, and an elongated cigar-like prolate shape at high numbers of <b>inclusions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vesicle membrane...|$|R

5|$|A Cape Coloured of Indian and Portuguese ancestry, D'Oliveira left South Africa {{primarily}} because the era's apartheid legislation seriously restricted his career prospects on racial grounds and barred {{him from the}} all-white Test team. He qualified for Worcestershire County Cricket Club through residency in 1964 and first played for England two years later. The consequences of D'Oliveira's possible <b>inclusion</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1968–69 MCC tour of South Africa were discussed by English and South African cricketing bodies as early as 1966. Manoeuvring by cricketing and political figures in both countries did little to bring the matter to a head. The MCC's priority was to maintain traditional links with South Africa and have the series go ahead without incident. South Africa's Prime Minister B.J. Vorster sought to appease international opinion by publicly indicating that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be acceptable, but secretly did all he could to prevent it.|$|E
