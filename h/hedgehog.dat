5|$|Shadow the <b>Hedgehog</b> is a 2005 {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by Sega Studio USA, the former United States division of Sega's Sonic Team, {{and published by}} Sega. A spin-off to the Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> series, the game features Shadow the <b>Hedgehog</b> as the main character, and was revealed at the March 2005 Walk of Game event.|$|E
5|$|Sonic: After the Sequel is a 2013 {{platform}} not-profit fan {{video game}} created by Brazilian student Felipe Daneluz (LakeFeperd). It is an unofficial game {{based on the}} Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> series and set between the official games Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 2 and Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 3. Daneluz's second Sonic game, it follows Sonic: Before the Sequel, which set between the original Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> and Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 2. Like its predecessor, After the Sequel stars Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> and his sidekick Tails in a quest to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds from Doctor Eggman.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} name, Echinocereus, {{comes from}} the Greek ekinos, meaning <b>hedgehog,</b> and cereus, the Latin term for wax paper. The specific epithet honors the German botanist Ludwig Reichenbach. Common names include Lace <b>hedgehog</b> cactus, Lace cactus, Lace <b>hedgehog,</b> Purple candle, and Órgano-pequeño de colores.|$|E

50|$|Eradication can be troublesome. Attempts to {{eliminate}} <b>hedgehogs</b> from bird colonies on the Scottish islands of North Uist and Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides {{were met with}} international outrage. Eradication began in 2003 with 690 <b>hedgehogs</b> being killed. Animal welfare groups attempted rescues to save the <b>hedgehogs.</b> By 2007, legal injunctions against the killing of <b>hedgehogs</b> were put in place. In 2008, the elimination process was changed from killing the <b>hedgehogs</b> to trapping them and releasing them on the mainland.|$|R

5|$|According to Roger Hector, vice {{president}} and general manager of Sega Technical Institute, the lock-on technology was conceived two and a half years before the release of Sonic & Knuckles, between the releases of Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> and Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 2. Early development screenshots suggest Knuckles was planned to be playable in the first Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> via Sonic & Knuckles lock-on technology, but this feature was removed prior to release.|$|E

5|$|Sonic & Knuckles is a 1994 side-scrolling {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by Sonic Team {{and published by}} Sega for the Sega Genesis. An installment in the main Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> series, it is a direct sequel to Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 3, which released earlier that year. The story follows Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> and Knuckles the Echidna in their respective quests to save Angel Island; Sonic tries to prevent Dr. Robotnik from relaunching his orbital weapon, the Death Egg, while Knuckles scuffles with Robotnik's minion, known as EggRobo.|$|E

5|$|Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 3 is a {{platform}} video game developed by Sonic Team {{and published by}} Sega. The fourth main game in the Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> series, it was released for the Sega Genesis worldwide in February 1994, and in Japan three months later. Following the events of Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 2, Dr. Robotnik's spaceship, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mysterious floating island. There, Sonic and Tails must once more retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to stop Death Egg from relaunching, while making rounds with the island's guardian, Knuckles the Echidna.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{a series}} of pinball machine-like environments in which the player {{controls}} Sonic the <b>Hedgehog,</b> who acts as a pinball {{for the majority of the}} game. Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> Spinball was commissioned by Sega when it became clear that a new Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> game could not be completed in time for the 1993 holiday season, as the majority of staff were occupied with developing Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 3. The game was hastily developed, with most work taking place over 61 days. It received mixed reviews upon release, with most critics praising the game's novelty and graphics, although its control scheme was considered a negative factor. A second pinball game, Sonic Pinball Party, was released in 2003, and a spinning rollercoaster of the same name opened in Alton Towers theme park in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Amy is a 12-year-old, pink-furred {{anthropomorphic}} <b>hedgehog</b> girl {{created by}} Kenji Terada for the Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> manga series. She debuted in 1992, wearing a dress {{and with her}} then-orange hair pulled into 2 ponytails. The character was redesigned the next year for the Sega CD game, Sonic CD. Like the Sonic CD introduction Metal Sonic, an early grayscale concept sketch shows her very similar to her appearance in the game (except her shoes, which became larger and flatter). Her coloring was red at first (including her skirt), except for a green shirt. The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal and Princess Sally (a character in the Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> TV series). Amy received her present design, with a red dress and boots, in Sonic Adventure.|$|E

40|$|To infer the phylogenetic {{position}} of Cretan <b>hedgehogs,</b> Erinaceus concolor nesiotes, we compared directly allozymic variation at 27 loci and 383 bp-long sequences of the mitochondrial cyt-b gene of eleven and three <b>hedgehogs,</b> respectively, collected at diverse locations in Crete with already published data of western and eastern <b>hedgehogs</b> (E. europaeus and E. concolor). Horizontal starch gel electrophoresis revealed 4 alleles at 2 polymorphic loci (Gpi, Acy) in Cretan <b>hedgehogs.</b> Indices of allozymic diversity {{were similar to}} those of regional samples of E. europaeus and E. concolor from Central Europe. A Wagner dendrogram based on pairwise Rogers distances showed that Cretan <b>hedgehogs</b> clustered clearly with the E. concolor from Central Europe. The cyt-b sequences of the Cretan <b>hedgehogs</b> revealed 3 closely related haplotypes, that were tightly connected to haplotypes of E. concolor from various provenances in the Balkans. In contrast, published haplotypes of E. concolor from Asia Minor and Palestine differed distinctly from the Cretan haplotypes. We conclude that Cretan <b>hedgehogs</b> originate from mainland-Greece or other places in the Balkan...|$|R
50|$|Colonists took <b>hedgehogs</b> from England and Scotland to New Zealand on sailing {{ships from}} the 1860s to the 1890s mainly for sentimental reasons. Few survived the 4-6 month voyage, but {{those that did}} had lost all their fleas. Animals found their first homes in the South Island, where their spread was helped by guards {{dropping}} them off at country railway stations. <b>Hedgehogs</b> {{were introduced to the}} North Island about 1906 and, from then on, their numbers increased at an exponential rate. By the 1920s they had become so numerous that game-bird hunters blamed them for reduced bag-sizes. <b>Hedgehogs</b> were declared noxious animals and a bounty of one shilling a snout paid by regional authorities for several years. By the 1950s, <b>hedgehogs</b> could be found over the whole country {{with the exception of the}} coldest wettest corner of the South Island and alpine areas of permanent snow. Nevertheless, <b>hedgehogs</b> have been seen climbing New Zealand glaciers. <b>Hedgehogs</b> do not reach the same weight in New Zealand as in colder parts of Europe. With its milder winters, New Zealand <b>hedgehogs</b> hibernate for only three months of the year so do not need to put on so much weight in autumn as their ancestors. In northern New Zealand, many <b>hedgehogs</b> do not hibernate at all. One of New Zealand's pioneer <b>hedgehogs</b> probably had faulty teeth for this feature is found in about 50% of today's animals. Most New Zealanders welcome <b>hedgehogs</b> in their gardens as they relish slugs and snails. Conservationists are less happy as <b>hedgehogs</b> compete for invertebrate food with native bush birds and prey on some rare insects, lizards and ground-nesting birds. As a result, extensive hedgehog-control programs are under way in some parts of the country, killing thousands of them. To judge by roadkill counts, North Island <b>hedgehogs</b> were at their highest numbers in the 1950s. Since then, roadkill counts have fallen dramatically from about 50/100 km to less than 1/100 km. refs Brockie, R.E. in Carolyn King (Ed) The Handbook of New Zealand Mammals. 1998. Oxford.|$|R
5|$|An {{acclaimed}} literary work, The Elegance of the <b>Hedgehog</b> {{has been}} considered by critics and press alike as a publishing phenomenon. Upon the novel's release, it had received significant support from booksellers. The novel has earned Barbery the 2007 French Booksellers Prize, the 2007 Brive-la-Gaillarde Reader's Prize, and the Prix du Rotary International in France. The Elegance of the <b>Hedgehog</b> has been adapted into the film Le hérisson (2009).|$|E
5|$|Development of Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 2 {{began at}} the end of 1991, with both Japanese and American staff, from Sonic Team and Sega Technical Institute respectively, {{contributing}} to development. As with the original game, the soundtrack was composed by Dreams Come True songwriter Masato Nakamura. Upon release, the game was a critical and commercial success, selling over six million copies, making it the second-best-selling Genesis game behind the original Sonic the <b>Hedgehog.</b> It has since been released on several compilations and downloads for various platforms, which were also generally positively received. The game is considered {{to be one of the}} greatest of all time. A remastered version, developed using the Retro Engine, was released on iOS and Android devices in December 2013. Two direct sequels, Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 3 and Sonic & Knuckles, were released in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{version of}} Puyo Puyo and replaces its {{characters}} {{with those from}} the Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> franchise, being primarily based on the Adventures of Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> animated series. The gameplay is reminiscent of Tetris, in which the player must organise different coloured shapes as they fall down a board. The game received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the gameplay, while criticising the difficulty and overuse of the falling block puzzle genre.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hedgehogs</b> are {{primarily}} nocturnal, though some species {{can also be}} active during the day. <b>Hedgehogs</b> sleep for {{a large portion of}} the day under bushes, grasses, rocks, or most commonly in dens dug in the ground, with varying habits among the species. All wild <b>hedgehogs</b> can hibernate, though not all do, depending on temperature, species, and abundance of food.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hedgehogs</b> {{are also}} {{often seen in}} {{pictures}} with an autumn-themed background, since the animal hibernates in piles of leaves. This also adds to the cute reputation of <b>hedgehogs.</b> In Great Britain, however, the human habit of lighting bonfires to celebrate Bonfire Night on 5 November {{has led to an}} increased risk to <b>hedgehogs,</b> who often choose to sleep in the piles of wood accumulated in gardens and parks beforehand. Television messages now remind viewers who might be lighting bonfires to check them first for the presence of hibernating <b>hedgehogs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In The Animals of Farthing Wood by British author Colin Dann, several <b>hedgehogs</b> {{were part}} of the group of animals that {{travelled}} from Farthing Wood to the nature reserve White Deer Park. The oldest two <b>hedgehogs</b> were run over on a motorway {{near the end of the}} journey. The rest of the <b>hedgehogs</b> safely made it to White Deer Park and appeared sporadically in the remainder of the series. In the television adaptation only two <b>hedgehogs</b> {{were part of}} the group. As in the novel, both were killed on the motorway.|$|R
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{version of}} Puyo Puyo, a Japanese falling block puzzle game {{developed}} by Compile and originally released for the MSX2 in 1991. Sega {{expressed interest in}} releasing the game for the United States and Europe; however, fearing that the product would not be popular with the Western audience, the company decided to replace the characters of Puyo Puyo with those featured in the Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> franchise, particularly those from the Adventures of Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> animated series, which aired {{in the autumn of}} 1993.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of its predecessor, Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 2 already had an established fanbase anticipating its release. The game received critical acclaim upon release and was a best seller in the UK charts for 2 months. As of 2006, the game has sold over 6 million copies, making it the second best-selling game for the Sega Genesis (after the original Sonic the <b>Hedgehog).</b>|$|E

5|$|Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske wanted {{reassurance}} {{that the character}} would not fail. The global head of marketing, Al Nilsen, became involved, and playtested the game across the United States with Mario fans: they were shown Mario and then played Sonic the <b>Hedgehog.</b> 80 percent preferred Sonic the <b>Hedgehog,</b> and the game was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. The game was released in North America on June 23, 1991, and in the PAL regions and Japan the following month. Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles, replacing Altered Beast. This tactic enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units. Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> by mail. Sega of America created a large-scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company.|$|E
5|$|Sonic 2s {{financial}} success {{was a major}} factor in Sega catching up to Nintendo in the early-1990s console wars. It brought their market share up to 50% within six months of its release. Tails, whom Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 2 introduced, would go on {{to become one of the}} most prominent and frequently recurring characters in the series, appearing and acting as Sonic's sidekick in most of the franchise's media, including in recent games such as Sonic Colors, Sonic Generations, and Sonic Lost World in which most of the recurring cast does not appear or is relegated to minor roles. Furthermore, Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 2s popularity managed to extend to various merchandise such as comic books (the well-received fortnightly Sonic the Comic), a television series, and a sequel, Sonic the <b>Hedgehog</b> 3, which received similar acclaim.|$|E
40|$|Background: Recently {{there is}} a high {{tendency}} among exotic pet owners for keeping <b>hedgehogs.</b> This mammal can transfer some significant zoonotic patho-gens to human. Hence, the present study was conducted {{for the first time to}} pre-pare a list of helminth parasites of <b>hedgehogs</b> (Erinaceus concolor) in North of Iran. Methods: Ten (four males and six females) road killed <b>hedgehogs</b> were collected during April to January 2011 in rural areas of Babol city, Mazandaran province, Iran. All of internal organs were scrutinized for helminth burden. The extracted specimens were fixed and preserved in 70 % ethanol and then cleared in Lacto-phenol solution. Helminth identification was carried out according to available systematic keys. Results: All the examined <b>hedgehogs</b> (100 %) were infected with parasitic hel-minth as following: two <b>hedgehogs</b> (20 %) were infected with Crenosoma striatum, four <b>hedgehogs</b> (40 %) harbored Physaloptera clausa, one (10 %) host had Hymenole-pis erinacei and three (30 %) of them were infected with Nephridiacanthus major...|$|R
40|$|Background: European <b>hedgehogs</b> (Erinaceus europaeus) are urban dwellers {{and host}} both Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes hexagonus. These ticks {{transmit}} several zoonotic pathogens like Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia helvetica, Borrelia miyamotoi and " Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis". It is unclear {{to what extent}} <b>hedgehogs</b> in (sub) urban areas contribute {{to the presence of}} infected ticks in these areas, which subsequently pose a risk for acquiring a tick-borne disease. Therefore, it is important to investigate to what extent <b>hedgehogs</b> contribute to the enzootic cycle of these tick-borne pathogens, and to shed more light at the mechanisms of the transmission cycles involving <b>hedgehogs</b> and both ixodid tick species. Methods: Engorged ticks from <b>hedgehogs</b> were collected from (sub) urban areas via rehabilitating centres in Belgium. Ticks were screened individually for presence of Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia helvetica and " Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis" using PCR-based methods. Infection rates of the different pathogens in ticks were calculated and compared to infection rates in questing ticks. Results: Both Ixodes hexagonus (n = 1132) and Ixodes ricinus (n = 73) of all life stages were found on the 54 investigated <b>hedgehogs.</b> Only a few <b>hedgehogs</b> carried most of the ticks, with 6 of the 54 <b>hedgehogs</b> carrying {{more than half of all}} ticks (624 / 1205). Borrelia miyamotoi, A. phagocytophilum, R. helvetica and B. burgdorferi genospecies (Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia bavariensis and Borrelia spielmanii) were detected in both I. hexagonus and I. ricinus. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, R. helvetica, B. afzelii, B. bavariensis and B. spielmanii were found significantly more in engorged ticks in comparison to questing I. ricinus. Conclusions: European <b>hedgehogs</b> seem to contribute to the spread and transmission of tick-borne pathogens in urban areas. The relatively high prevalence of B. bavariensis, B. spielmanii, B. afzelii, A. phagocytophilum and R. helvetica in engorged ticks suggests that <b>hedgehogs</b> contribute to their enzootic cycles in (sub) urban areas. The extent to which <b>hedgehogs</b> can independently maintain these agents in natural cycles, and the role of other hosts (rodents and birds) remain to be investigated...|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} controversy over <b>hedgehogs</b> on the Uists. <b>Hedgehogs</b> are not {{native to the}} islands, but were introduced in the 1970s to reduce garden pests. Their spread posed {{a threat to the}} eggs of ground nesting wading birds. In 2003 Scottish Natural Heritage undertook culls of <b>hedgehogs</b> in the area, but these were halted in 2007; trapped animals are now relocated to the mainland.|$|R
