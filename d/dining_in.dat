5|$|Captain Renaudin {{was said}} in a naval {{registry}} to have swum to safety. He had in fact abandoned his ship with the first British boat, leaving his men behind in disregard for military customs and the 1765 standing order that Captains had to be last to abandon ship, and though his account insinuates {{that he was on}} a boat close to Vengeur when she foundered, he was actually <b>dining</b> <b>in</b> the mess of Culloden at the moment of the sinking. In 1795, Loutherbourg depicted the rescue of Vengeurs crew by British ships in his large canvas of the battle, Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 {{he played}} eight games for England, {{starting}} with defeat to a Scotland team containing a young Bill Shankly. He then travelled to Berlin for another encounter with Münzenberg, where pre-match he witnessed first hand the foreboding devotion the people showed the Führer when his motorcade drove past a café the England team were <b>dining</b> <b>in.</b> The game became infamous as The FA, themselves under instruction from the British government, informed the England team {{that they had}} to perform the Nazi salute as part of the strategy of appeasement. England won 6–3 with Matthews himself getting on the scoreboard having got the better of Münzenberg this time. The next game was a shock 2–1 defeat to Switzerland, which in turn was followed by a 4–2 win over France in Paris. Following the conclusion of this summer tour of the continent, Matthews scored in a 4–2 defeat to Wales in Cardiff, and then played in England's 3–0 win over a Europe XI at Highbury, their 4–0 win over Norway in Newcastle, and their 7–0 win over Ireland at Old Trafford.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{off from}} the Great Hall are the family's private Drawing Room and Parlour. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, in a house such as Montacute, the Parlour was where the family would dine, {{possibly}} with some of their upper servants. It allowed them not only privacy from dining publicly in the hall, but also less state and pomp than if <b>dining</b> <b>in</b> the Great Chamber above. Like its grander cousin above, the Parlour also had an adjoining principal bed chamber, now the Drawing Room, originally known as the White Chamber and later as the Round Parlour. As fashions and uses changed, and privacy from servants became desirable, like the later Baroque state apartments, these ground-floor rooms lost their original purpose and became a series of seemingly meaningless drawing rooms. The National Trust installed an incongruous 18th-century fireplace from Coleshill House in the Drawing Room in the mid-20th century. It is now furnished in 18th-century style.|$|E
