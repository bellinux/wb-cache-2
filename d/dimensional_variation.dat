The collected data is analyzed to find a fit with a known distribution and mean and standard deviations derived from them. The immediate value to this method is that the output represents what is acceptable, even when that is from imperfect geometry and, because it uses recorded data to perform its analysis, {{it is possible to}} include actual factory inspection data into the analysis to see the effect of proposed changes on real data. In addition, because the engine for the analysis is performing the variation internally, not based on CAD regeneration, it is possible to link the variation engine output to another program. For example, a rectangular bar may vary in width and thickness; the variation engine could output those numbers to a stress program which passes back peak stress as a result and the <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> be used to determine likely stress variations. The disadvantage is that each run is unique, so there will be variation from analysis to analysis for the output distribution and mean, just like would come from a factory.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for composite products to be affordable, net-shaped and efficiently assembled makes tight dimensional tolerance critical. Due {{to lack of}} accurate process models, resin transfer moulding (RTM) dimensional analysis and control are often performed using trial-and-error approaches based on engineers' experiences or previous production data. Such approaches are limited to specific geometries and materials and often fail to achieve the required dimensional accuracy in the final products. This paper presents an innovative study on the <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> prediction and control for fibre reinforced polymeric matrix composites. A <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> model was developed for process simulation based on thermal stress analysis and finite element analysis (FEA). This model was validated against experimental data, analytical solutions and data from the literature. Using the FEA-based <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> model, the deformations of typical composite structures were studied, and a regression-based <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> model was developed. By introducing the material modification coefficient, this comprehensive model can account for various fibre/resin types and stacking sequences. The regression based <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> model can significantly reduce computation time by eliminating the complicated, time-consuming finite element meshing and material parameter defining process and providing a quick design guide for composite products with reduced dimensional variations. The structural tree method (STM) is proposed to compute the assembly deformation from the deformations of individual components {{as well as the}} deformation of general shape composite components. The STM enables rapid <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> analysis/synthesis for complex composite assemblies when used along with the regression-based <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> model.

The process design proposes a minimum stress build-up by using the `sheet metal ironing welding technique' in the weld sequencing design. The product design proposes a minimum stress build-up design criterion to manage the accumulation of stress. The proposed product and process design methods enable automotive body design engineers to create a quality product with minimum <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> caused by the manufacturing stress within the body-in-white structure. Moreover, this facilitates the industry's objective of building a high quality automotive body with minimum stress. This {{is an important factor in}} contributing to the superior quality of the body panel fits. It also helps to reduce the quality-related warranty costs. This paper primarily focuses on the development of a joint design guideline by exploring the relationship between the <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> and the stress build-up. First, the automotive assembly process design will be introduced. A simple analysis of a one-dimensional assembly is produced. A three-dimensional structural analysis of a box assembly is investigated for the effect of stress build-up within a structure on the dimensional instability or variation.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demands of {{energy efficiency and}} environment protection, composite materials have become an important alternative for traditional materials. Composite materials offer many advantages over traditional materials including: low density, high strength, high stiffness to weight ratio, excellent durability, and design flexibility. Despite all these advantages, composite materials have not been as widely used as expected because of the complexity and cost of the manufacturing process. One of the main causes is associated with poor dimensional control. General curved composite parts are often used as the structural components in the composite industry. Due to the anisotropic material nature, process-induced <b>dimensional</b> <b>variations</b> {{make it difficult for}} tighttolerance control and limit the use of composites. This research aims to develop a practical approach for the design of general curved composite parts and assembly. First, the closed-form solution for the process-induced <b>dimensional</b> <b>variations,</b> which is commonly called spring-in, was derived. For a general curved composite part, a Structural Tree Method (STM) was developed to divide the curve into a number of pieces and calculate the <b>dimensional</b> <b>variations</b> sequentially. This method can be also applied to an assembly of composite parts. The approach was validated through a case study. The method presented in this paper provides a convenient and practical tool for the dimensional and tolerance analysis in the early design stage of general curved composite parts and assembly, which is extremely useful for the realization of affordable tight tolerance composites.

Spot welding sequences {{have a significant}} influence on the <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> of resulting assemblies and ultimately on overall product quality. It also has a significant influence on welding robot cycle time and thus ultimately on manufacturing cost. In this work we evaluate the performance of Genetic Algorithms, GAs, on multi-criteria optimization of welding sequence with respect to dimensional assembly variation and welding robot cycle time. Reference assemblies are fully modelled in 3 D including detailed fixtures, welding robots and weld guns. <b>Dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> is obtained using variation simulation and part measurement data. Cycle time is obtained using automatic robot path planning. GAs are not guaranteed to find the global optimum. Besides exhaustive calculations, {{there is no way}} to determine how close to the actual optimum a GA trial has reached. Furthermore, sequence fitness evaluations constitute the absolute majority of optimization computation running time and do thus need to be kept to a minimum. Therefore, for two industrial reference assemblies we investigate the number of fitness evaluations that is required to find a sequence that is optimal or a near-optimal with respect to the fitness function. The fitness function in this work is a single criterion based on a weighted and normalized combination of <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> and cycle time. Both reference assemblies involves 7 spot welds which entails 7 != 5040 possible welding sequences. For both reference assemblies, <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> and cycle time is exhaustively calculated for all 5040 possible sequences, determining the optimal sequence, with respect to the fitness function, for a fact.

Furthermore the optimum of the single criterion fitness function entails <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> and cycle time fairly close to their respective optimum. In conclusion, this work indicates that genetic algorithms are highly effective in optimizing welding sequence with respect to <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> and cycle time...|$|E

This innovation is a computational design algorithm that, for the first time, optimizes the efficiency and output power of a TWT while {{taking into account the}} effects of <b>dimensional</b> tolerance <b>variations.</b> Because they are primary power consumers and power generation is very expensive in space, much effort has been exerted over the last 30 years to increase the power efficiency of TWTs. However, at frequencies higher than about 60 GHz, efficiencies of TWTs are still quite low. A major reason is that at higher frequencies, <b>dimensional</b> tolerance <b>variations</b> from conventional micromachining techniques become relatively large with respect to the circuit dimensions. When this is the case, conventional design- optimization procedures, which ignore <b>dimensional</b> <b>variations,</b> provide inaccurate designs for which the actual amplifier performance substantially under-performs that of the design. Thus, this new, robust TWT optimization design algorithm was created to take account of and ameliorate the deleterious effects of <b>dimensional</b> <b>variations</b> and to increase efficiency, power, and yield of high-frequency TWTs. This design algorithm can help extend the use of TWTs into the terahertz frequency regime of 300 - 3000 GHz.

A robust assembly is less sensitive to input variation from the product and process components, such as incoming parts, subassemblies, fixtures, and welding guns. In order to effectively understand the sensitivity of an assembly to input variation, an appropriate set of metrics must be defined. In this paper, three product-oriented indices, including pattern sensitivity index, component sensitivity index, and station sensitivity index, are defined. These indices can be utilized to measure the variation influence of a pattern, an individual part, and/or component, and components at a particular station to the dimensional quality of a final assembly. Additionally, the relationships among these sensitivity indices are established. Based on these relationships, the ranges of the sensitivity indices are derived. Finally, a case study of a sheet metal assembly is presented and discussed to illustrate the applicability of these metrics. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 2735341...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. "May 2006. "Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 74 - 78) Hydroforming {{of aluminum}} sheets {{is very important}} in the aircraft industry, due to the advantages of less wrinkling and cost effectiveness. Numerous research has been conducted in this field, which deals with the development of methods and tools to control accuracy of the bend and prediction of the springback after the sheet metal has been formed. Rivets are the most commonly used fasteners to fit together the subassemblies of the aircraft. The holes for riveting are punched after any forming operation due to the tensile and compressive deformations along the thickness of the sheet metal, which can affect the dimension and position accuracy of the hole. This incurs more cost and time due to the development of special dies for accurately punched holes. It is necessary to develop a method for predicting variation in the holes, which will increase the cost effectiveness of the process. In this research, sheet metal with pre-drilled holes was evaluated for a bending operation using a hydroforming technique. Sheet metal with a variety of thicknesses, bending radii, and bending angles was evaluated. Variation in the dimensional tolerance was attained using the minimum radial separation method. A dataset of <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> in the holes was developed and used for development of the artificial neural network, which was able to predict the <b>dimensional</b> <b>variation</b> of the hole if an unknown pattern of inputs was provided.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated approach to design an assembly, fixture schemes, and an assembly sequence, {{such that the}} dimensional integrity of the assembly is insensitive to the <b>dimensional</b> <b>variations</b> of individual parts. The adjustability of critical dimensions and the proper constraining of parts during assembly process are the keys in achieving the dimensional integrity of the final assembly. A top-down design method is developed which recursively decomposes a lump of initial product geometry and fixture elements matching critical dimensions into parts and fixtures. At each recursion, joints are assigned to the interfaces between two subassemblies to ensure that parts and fixtures are properly constrained at every assembly step. A case study on a simple frame structure is presented to demonstrate the method. Note to Practitioners-Achieving dimensional integrity of complex assemblies is a very demanding task due to the <b>dimensional</b> <b>variations</b> of parts and their propagation. Keys to achieving the goal are to adjust critical dimensions using proper fixtures and joint configurations and to minimize unpredictable deformations caused by overconstrained parts, such that assembled products can be robust to <b>dimensional</b> <b>variations</b> of parts. Equally important are arranging fixtures and sequencing assembly steps as these are what really define which critical dimension is adjusted and which subassemblies are put together on what fixture at each assembly step. In this paper, we propose a top-down decomposition-based approach that generates assembly design, assembly sequence, and fixture plan ensuring adjustability for critical dimensions and properly constrained subassemblies at every assembly step. The method does not only prevent costly trial and error following bottom-up approaches, but also enumerates all feasible solutions for a given product geometry and critical dimensions. As the number of solutions can be fairly large, for real-word application, {{it is crucial to}} incorporate practical constraints and to identify other important criteria to search optimal designs...|$|R
