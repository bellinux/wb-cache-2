40|$|Xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol {{dehydrogenase}} (XDH) {{are the key}} enzymes for xylose fermentation {{and have}} been widely used for construction of a recombinant xylose fermenting yeast. The effective recycling of cofactors between XR and XDH has been thought to be important to achieve effective xylose fermentation. Efforts to alter the coenzyme specificity of XR and HDX by site-directed mutagenesis have been widely made for improvement of efficiency of xylose fermentation. We previously succeeded by protein engineering to improve ethanol production by reversing XDH dependency from NAD(+) to NADP(+). In this study, we applied protein engineering to construct a novel strictly NADPH-dependent XR from Pichia stipitis by site-directed mutagenesis, in order to recycle NADPH between XR and XDH effectively.

40|$|A GH (glycoside hydrolase) family 54 α-L-arabinofuranosidase from Trichoderma koningii G- 39 (termed Abf) was {{successfully}} expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified to near homogeneity by cation-exchange chromatography. To determine the amino acid residues {{essential for the}} catalytic activity of Abf, extensive mutagenesis of 24 conserved glutamate and aspartate residues was performed. Among the mutants, D 221 N, <b>E</b> <b>223</b> Q and D 299 N were found to decrease catalytic activity significantly. The kcat values of the D 221 N and D 299 N mutants were 7000 - and 1300 -fold lower respectively, {{than that of the}} wild-type Abf. <b>E</b> <b>223</b> Q was nearly inactive. These results are consistent with observations obtained from the Aspergillus kawachii α-L-arabinofuranosidase three-dimensional structure. This structure indicates that Asp 221 of T. koningii Abf is significant for substrate binding and that Glu 223 as well as Asp 299 function as a nucleophile and a general acid/base catalyst for the enzymatic reaction respectively. The catalytic mechanism of wild-type Abf was further investigated by NMR spectroscopy and kinetic analysis. The results showed that Abf is a retaining enzyme. It catalyses the hydrolysis of various substrates via the formation of a common intermediate that is probably an arabinosyl–enzyme intermediate. A two-step, double-displacement mechanism involving first the formation, and then the breakdown, of an arabinosyl–enzyme intermediate was proposed. Based on the kcat values of a series of aryl-α-L-arabinofuranosides catalytically hydrolysed by wild-type Abf, a relatively small Brønsted constant, βlg=− 0. 18, was obtained, suggesting that the rate-limiting step of the enzymatic reaction is the dearabinosylation step. Further kinetic studies with the D 299 G mutant revealed that the catalytic activity of this mutant depended largely on the pKa values (> 6) of leaving phenols, with βlg=− 1. 3, indicating that the rate-limiting step of the reaction becomes the arabinosylation step. This kinetic outcome supports the idea that Asp 299 is the general acid/base residue. The pH activity profile of D 299 N provided further evidence strengthening this suggestion...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The surface capsular {{polysaccharide}} (CP) is a virulence factor {{that has been}} used as an antigen in several successful vaccines against bacterial pathogens. A vaccine has not yet been licensed against Staphylococcus aureus, although two multicom-ponent vaccines that contain CP antigens are in clinical trials. In this study, we evaluated CP production in USA 300 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates that have become the predominant community-associated MRSA clones in the United States. We found that all 167 USA 300 MRSA and 50 USA 300 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were CP negative (CP). Moreover, all 16 USA 500 isolates, which have been postulated to be the progenitor lineage of USA 300, were also CP. Whole-genome sequence analysis of 146 CPUSA 300 MRSA isolates revealed they all carry a cap 5 locus with 4 conserved mutations compared with strain Newman.

40|$|Matrix {{metalloproteinase}} (MMP) - 13 {{is one of}} the mammalian collagenases {{that play}} key roles in tissue remodelling and repair and in progression of diseases such as cancer, arthritis, atherosclerosis, and aneurysm. For collagenase to cleave triple helical collagens, the triple helical structure has to be locally unwound before hydrolysis, but this process is not well understood. We report crystal structures of catalytically inactive full-length human MMP- 13 (<b>E</b> <b>223</b> A) in complex with peptides of 14 - 26 aa derived from the cleaved prodomain during activation. Peptides are bound to the active site of the enzyme by forming an extended β-strand with Glu(40) or Tyr(46) inserted into the S 1 ' specificity pocket. The structure of the N-terminal part of the peptides is variable and interacts with different parts of the catalytic domain. Those areas are designated substrate-dependent exosites, in that they accommodate different peptide structures, whereas the precise positioning of the substrate backbone is maintained in the active site. These modes of peptide-MMP- 13 interactions have led us to propose how triple helical collagen strands fit into the active site cleft of the collagenase...|$|E

40|$|High {{concentrations}} of cytosolic Na+ ions induce the time-dependent {{formation of an}} inactive state of the Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger (NCX), {{a process known as}} Na+-dependent inactivation. NCX activity was measured as Ca 2 + uptake in fura 2 -loaded Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the wild-type (WT) NCX or mutants that are hypersensitive (F <b>223</b> <b>E)</b> or resistant (K 229 Q) to Na+-dependent inactivation. As expected, 1) Na+-dependent inactivation was promoted by high cytosolic Na+ concentration, 2) the F <b>223</b> <b>E</b> mutant was more susceptible than the WT exchanger to inactivation, whereas the K 229 Q mutant was resistant, and 3) inactivation was enhanced by cytosolic acidification. However, in contrast to expectations from excised patch studies, 1) the WT exchanger was resistant to Na+-dependent inactivation unless cytosolic pH was reduced, 2) reducing cellular phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate levels did not induce Na+-dependent inactivation in the WT exchanger, 3) Na+-dependent inactivation did not increase the half-maximal cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration for allosteric Ca 2 + activation, 4) Na+-dependent inactivation was not reversed by high cytosolic Ca 2 + concentrations, and 5) Na+-dependent inactivation was partially, but transiently, reversed by an increase in extracellular Ca 2 + concentration. Thus Na+-dependent inactivation of NCX expressed in CHO cells differs in several respects from the inactivation process measured in excised patches. The refractoriness of the WT exchanger to Na+-dependent inactivation suggests that this type of inactivation is unlikely to be a strong regulator of exchange activity under physiological conditions but would probably act to inhibit NCX-mediated Ca 2 + influx during ischemia...|$|R

Methods A randomized controlled trial of 925 individuals at high risk for Type 2 diabetes (FINDRISC-score >/= 13) in 14 general practices in the Netherlands. Intervention consisted of lifestyle counselling from the nurse practitioner and the general practitioner. Usual care consisted of oral and written information {{at the start of the}} study. Study groups were compared over 2. 5 years regarding changes in clinical and lifestyle measures. Results Both groups showed modest changes in body weight, glucose concentrations, physical activity and dietary intake [weight: intervention group, - 0. 8 (5. 1) kg, usual care group, - 0. 4 (4. 7) kg, (P = 0. 69); fasting plasma glucose: intervention group, - 0. 17 (0. 4) mmol/l, usual care group, - 0. 10 (0. 5) mmol/l, (P = 0. 10) ]. Differences between groups were significant only for total physical activity and fibre intake. In the intervention group, self-efficacy was significantly higher in individuals successful at losing weight compared with unsuccessful individuals. No significant differences in participant weight loss were found between general practitioners and nurse practitioners with different levels of motivation or self-efficacy. Conclusions Diabetes risk factors could significantly be reduced by lifestyle counselling in Dutch primary care. However, intervention effects above the effects attributable to usual care were modest. Higher participant self-efficacy seemed to facilitate weight loss.

40|$|We {{investigate}} polyelectrolyte brushes in the osmotic regime {{using both}} theoretical analysis and {{molecular dynamics simulation}} techniques. In the simulations at moderate Bjerrum length, we observe that the brush height varies weakly with grafting density, {{in contrast to the}} accepted scaling law, which predicts a brush thickness independent of the grafting density. We show that such behavior can be explained by considering lateral electrostatic effects (within the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory) combined with the coupling between lateral and longitudinal degrees of freedom due to the conserved polymer volume (which are neglected in scaling arguments). We also take the non-linear elasticity of polyelectrolyte chains into consideration, which makes significant effects as chains are almost fully stretched in the osmotic regime. It is shown that all these factors lead to a non-monotonic behavior for the brush height {{as a function of the}} grafting density. At large grafting densities, the brush height increases with increasing the grafting density due to the volume constraint. At small grafting densities, we obtain a re-stretching of the chains for decreasing grafting density, which is caused by lateral electrostatic contributions and the counterion-condensation process at polyelectrolyte chains. These results are obtained assuming all counterions to be trapped within the brush, which is valid for sufficiently long chains of large charge fraction.

The Poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluorethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE) ] is a copolymer which is obtained with the random introduction of fluorinated CHF-CF 2 monomers in the PVDF main chain. PVDF, and also its copolymers with TrFE contents ranging from 18 to 63 wt. %, have long been studied for their striking ferroelectric properties and their applications in actuators, transducers and ferroelectric memory.

This work follows up the non-magnetic study of convection presented in a companion paper (Gillet et al. 2007). We study here {{the addition of a}} z-invariant toroidal magnetic field to the fluid flow. The experimental measurements of fluid velocities by ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry, together with the quasi-geostrophic numerical simulations incorporating a three-dimensional modelling of the magnetic induction processes, demonstrate a stabilizing effect of the magnetic field in the weak-field case, characterized by an Elsasser number Λ < (E/P) 1 / 3. We find that this is explained by the changes of the critical parameters at the onset of convection as Λ increases. As in the non-magnetic study, strong zonal jets of characteristic length scales ℓβ (Rhines length scale) dominates the fluid dynamics. A new characteristic of the magnetoconvective flow is the elongation of the convective cells {{in the direction of the}} imposed magnetic field, introducing a new length scale ℓφ.

X-ray crystallography of the catalytic domain of the <b>E</b> <b>223</b> S/A 224 H/L 225 V/T 226 A/D 262 G mutant reveals that major differences from the wild-type are confined to the mutations themselves.

The pH variation of kcat/Km for 3, 4 -dinitrophenyl lactoside hydrolysis was accurately bell-shaped for both wild-type and mutant, with pK 1 shifting from 2. 22 ± 0. 03 in the wild-type to 3. 19 ± 0. 03 in the mutant, and pK 2 shifting from 5. 99 ± 0. 02 to 6. 78 ± 0. 02. With this poor substrate, the ionizations probably represent those of the free enzyme. The relative kcat for 2 -chloro- 4 -nitrophenyl lactoside showed similar behaviour. The shift in the mutant pH optimum was associated with lower kcat/Km values for both lactosides and cellobiosides, and a marginally lower stability. However, kcat values for cellobiosides are higher for the mutant. This we attribute to reduced non-productive binding in the + 1 and + 2 subsites; inhibition by cellobiose is certainly relieved in the mutant.

Our results indicate that JEE significantly increased VO 2 at 3 minutes post-exercise when compared to BASELINE (p = 0. 04) and DECAF (p = 0. 02) values, which may be beneficial in enhancing post-exercise fat metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The {{empirical}} {{validity of}} two propositions regarding FHA unsubsidized single-family activity are explored {{at the neighborhood}} level in this paper. The propositions are first that FHA serves moderate-to-middle-income families, not low-income families {{who live in the}} inner city nor high-income families who live in the outer suburbs; and second that all other things being equal, black owner-occupants {{are more likely to have}} an FHA-insured mortgage than are whitesTwo methods of analysis are performed: mapping and regression. First, 1974 FHA activity in the Philadelphia metropolitan area is mapped by race-black and white-and program- 203 (b), 221 (d) (2), and <b>223</b> (<b>e)</b> -at the census tract level. Then, the FHA activity by race and by program is regressed on 1970 neighborhood housing and population characteristics, again, using the census tract as the unit of observation. The results of the analysis provide support for both propositions. In Philadelphia in 1974, FHA is to a degree a border program differentially serving blacks.

40|$|Polarized {{growth in}} {{filamentous}} fungi requires {{the integrity of}} the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton. We found that growing MTs in Aspergillus nidulans merge at the center of fast growing tips and discovered that a kinesin motor protein, KipA, related to Tea 2 p of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is required for this process. In a ΔkipA strain, MT plus ends reach the tip but show continuous lateral movement. Hyphae lose directionality and grow in curves, apparently due to mislocalization of the vesicle supply center (Spitzenkörper) in the apex. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) -KipA accumulates at MT plus ends, whereas a KipA rigor mutant protein, GFP-KipAG <b>223</b> <b>E,</b> coated MTs evenly. These findings suggest that KipA requires its intrinsic motor activity to reach the MT plus end. Using KipA as an MT plus-end marker, we found bidirectional organization of MTs and determined the locations of microtubule organizing centers at nuclei, in the cytoplasm, and at septa...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the first}} {{principles}} calculation combined with quasi-harmonic approximation, in this work {{we focus on the}} analysis of temperature dependent lattice geometries, thermal expansion coefficients, elastic constants and ultimate strength of graphene and graphyne. For the linear thermal expansion coefficient, both graphene and graphyne show a negative region in the low temperature regime. This coefficient increases up to be positive at high temperatures. Graphene has superior mechanical properties, with Young modulus E 11 = 371. 0 N/m, E 22 = 378. 2 N/m and ultimate tensile strength of 119. 2 GPa at room temperature. Based on our analysis, it is found that graphene's mechanical properties have strong resistance against temperature increase up to 1200 K. Graphyne also shows good mechanical properties, with Young modulus E 11 = 224. 7 N/m, <b>E</b> 22 = <b>223.</b> 9 N/m and ultimate tensile strength of 81. 2 GPa at room temperature, but graphyne's mechanical properties have a weaker resistance with respect to the increase of temperature than that of graphene...|$|R
40|$|The {{energetic}} use of residues from agriculture {{can foster}} the transition towards a more renewable energy supply. However, sustainability issues {{have to be}} considered along the entire provision chain as they affect the resource and energy potential as well as the achievable contribution to climate mitigation. Straw {{is one of the most}} important agricultural residues in Germany. It is not yet used for energy purposes extensively and compared to other agricultural feedstock it shows low competition with food, feed or fiber. This paper analyses on the one hand the sustainable potential of cereal straw for energy application in Germany considering the actual agricultural conditions, and on the other hand the global warming potential from different energy provision chains based on straw. Different humus-balance tools that are able to assess the organic matter (OM) demand to presume soil fertility. The analysis of straw potentials was applied at NUTS 3 level for Germany, based on statistical data. The results of this analysis were used as input data for the modeling of concepts for straw provision and use. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were calculated for each concept in order to compare the global warming potential of various energy applications, to investigate the relative contribution of different production steps and to compare them with fossil energy applications. In total, 29. 8 Tg of straw (fresh matter) are produced annually in Germany (1999 - 2007). Approximately 4. 8 Tg of the total straw occurrence are annually required by animal husbandry. Between 7. 97 and 13. 25 Tg straw can be classified as sustainable straw. Highest straw potential (3. 99 Mgha- 1) can be found in parts of Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony. But there are also regions that show a net deficit. The cumulated GHG emissions for the resulting concepts are between 8 and 35 gCO 2 -eq. MJ- 1. In comparison to fossil energy applications, the highest reduction potential occurs for concepts for combined heat and power (CHP) provision, i. <b>e.</b> <b>223</b> gCO 2 -eq. MJel- 1. This study highlights the possible contribution of straw as renewable energy carrier, but also demonstrates that there are regional restrictions for straw use. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|HPLC {{methods are}} now widely {{accepted}} {{as being the}} only accurate means of quantifying chlorophyll in aquatic systems. Very {{little is known about}} the comparability of HPLC with conventional in situ prompt fluorescence methods and with newer techniques involving the measurement of delayed fluorescence of phytoplankton (measure of living algal biomass) in aquatic systems. This paper investigates the use of HPLC for the calibration of in situ delayed fluorometric and Turner fluorometric methods and the correlation of these methods to one another when applied to chlorophyll measurements in waters from the Elbe estuary and the German Bight. The data shows that the correlations of HPLC to both methods were high r super(2) = 0. 7 - 0. 99 when all the samples taken were from the reaches of the river Elbe (605 - 725 km). The correlations of all methods were low at r super(2) = 0. 45 - 0. 52 for samples taken in the saline part of the Elbe plume and when the chlorophyll concentrations were low (0. 2 - 9 mu g l super(- 1)) and with comparatively high chlorophyllide and chlorophyll c contents. Generally the correlations of HPLC to delayed fluorescence were better than the other correlations. This was probably due to the fact that delayed fluorescence measurements are not affected by the presence of other chlorophylls and their breakdown products whereas prompt fluorescence signals are. Delayed and prompt fluorescence methods can be calibrated accurately against HPLC values for chlorophyll in the natural samples and correlations remained good over several days. However, we suggest that it is advisable to check these as often as possible, particularly in the face of measurable changes of turbidity, salinity or spectral properties of the water. In this work the May and October slopes for the comparisons HPLC: delayed fluorescence in the limnic Elbe below Hamburg were similar (i. <b>e.</b> <b>223</b> - 245). A significantly lower slope (160) was found for the 32 stations in the Elbe mouth/German Bight. This indicates that we were dealing with different water bodies and thus different algal populations and is backed up by the HPLC fingerprints of the samples. Our work shows conclusively that although a correlation may be good between absolute chromatographic methods and fluorometric/photometric methods, one cannot extrapolate a long-term conversion factor which holds for different sampling times or sites in any one system, not to mention between system...|$|E
40|$|Muscle {{morphology}} {{was investigated}} in newly hatched barramundi Lates calcarifer larvae incubated at set temperatures (26, 29 and 31 degrees C) prior to hatching. Three days after hatching (the start of exogenous feeding), larvae from the 26 and 31 degrees C treatments were each {{divided into two groups}} and reared at that temperature or transferred over the period of several hours to 29 degrees C (control temperature). Incubation temperature significantly affected muscle cellularity in the developing embryo, with larvae incubated at 26 degrees C (mean +/- s. <b>e.</b> <b>223.</b> 3 +/- 7. 9) having on average 14. 4 % more inner muscle fibres than those incubated at 31 degrees C (195. 2 +/- 8. 8) and 4. 8 % more than those incubated at 29 degrees C (213. 5 +/- 4. 7). Conversely, inner muscle fibre cross-sectional area significantly increased at the warm incubation temperature in L. calcarifer, so that the total cross-sectional muscle area was not different between treatment groups. The total cross-sectional area of superficial muscle fibres and the proportion of superficial to total fibre cross-sectional area in just hatched L. calcarifer were also affected by incubation temperature, with incubation at the cool temperature (26 degrees C) increasing both the total cross-sectional area and proportion of superficial muscle fibres. By 9 days post-hatch, the aforementioned differences were no longer significant. Similarly, {{there was no difference in}} total superficial fibre cross-sectional area between any treatment groups of L. calcarifer, whereas incubation temperature still significantly affected the proportion of superficial to total muscle fibre cross-sectional area. Larvae hatched and grown at 31 degrees C had a significantly reduced percentage of superficial muscle cross-sectional area (mean +/- s. e. 5. 11 +/- 0. 66 %) compared with those incubated and grown at 29 degrees C (8. 04 +/- 0. 77 %) and 26 degrees C (9. 32 +/- 0. 56 %) and those incubated at 26 degrees C and transferred to 29 degrees C (7. 52 +/- 0. 53 %), and incubated at 31 degrees C and transferred to 29 degrees C (6. 28 +/- 0. 69 %). These results indicate that changes in muscle cellularity induced by raising or lowering the incubation temperature of L. calcarifer display varying degrees of persistence over developmental time. The significance of these findings to the culture of L. calcarifer is discussed...|$|E

The quantitative estimation of siderophore production unit of AL 2 - 16 was maximum after 48  hours of incubation (83. 488 %) in the presence of 1  μM of ferric chloride. The fructose followed by glucose and sucrose were proved to be the best carbon sources resulting in appreciable amount of siderophore production, i. <b>e.</b> 77. <b>223</b> %, 73. 584 %, and 65. 363 % respectively. AL 2 - 16 also has the ability to produce indole acetic acid in medium supplemented with l-tryptophan. The highest amount of indole acetic acid, in the presence of 1. 0 % l-tryptophan, was 123. 2  μg/mL after 144  hours.

Hsp 90 binds to a suite of co-chaperone proteins that regulate Hsp 90 function through alteration of intrinsic ATPase activity. Several studies have determined Aha 1 to be an important co-chaperone whose binding to Hsp 90 is modulated by phosphorylation, acetylation and SUMOylation of Hsp 90 [1, 2]. In this study, we applied quantitative affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) proteomics to understand how phosphorylation of hAha 1 at Y 223 altered global client/co-chaperone interaction [3]. Specifically, we characterized and compared the interactomes of Aha 1 –Y 223 F (phospho-mutant form) and Aha 1 –Y <b>223</b> <b>E</b> (phospho-mimic form). We identified 99 statistically significant interactors of hAha 1, a high proportion of which (84 %) demonstrated preferential binding to the phospho-mimic form of hAha 1.

These results are combined with deprojection analyses of the ROSAT images to provide detailed constraints on the mass distributions in the systems, and on the properties of their cooling flows. The spectral and imaging data identify these clusters as the three most-massive cooling flows known, with mass deposition rates of ∼ 1400, 2300, and 1500 M ⊙ yr − 1 respectively. We highlight the need for multiphase models to consistently model the spectral and imaging X-ray data, and discuss the importance of using these models in X-ray determinations of the cluster masses.
