25|$|Among the Eminescu scholars, Bhose <b>has</b> <b>pleaded</b> for {{the work}} {{to be seen as}} one of Eminescu's Hindu-inspired contributions.

Bhose sees the novella as akin to the Advaita Vedanta, the metaphysical school of Adi Shankara. Shankara preached that all the selves in the cosmos are reflections of a formless divine presence. Also according to Bhose, concepts such as time perception and reincarnation came to Eminescu by way of Hindu philosophy.|$|E
