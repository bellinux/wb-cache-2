She appeared in the 1941 horror film Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and her reputation as a glamorous femme fatale was enhanced by her performance in the film noir The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946). Her popularity continued through the 1950s in such films as The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) and Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.|$|E

25|$|Three {{weeks after}} signing her contract, George Sidney {{directed}} Williams' first screen test. The studio was impressed, and when Lana Turner eloped with Artie Shaw, Williams screen tested with the leading man Clark Gable, {{for the film}} Somewhere I'll <b>Find</b> <b>You.</b> However, Turner divorced Shaw after four months of marriage, and rejoined the film. Following several short subject films, Williams appeared as Sheila Brooks in Andy Hardy's Double Life. Sheila was a coed with whom Andy falls in love. Next was a small part in the film A Guy Named Joe, starring Spencer Tracy and Irene Dunne. It was here she first worked with Van Johnson, with whom she would partner in five films.|$|E

500|$|The {{career of}} the {{character}} Daniel Baciagalupo/Danny Angel in the novel bears numerous similarities to that of John Irving. [...] In an October 2009 interview with the New York magazine, Irving stated: [...] "I tried {{to have fun with}} the self-referential stuff. I felt the need to be a little playful, because there were autobiographical parts of the last novel that were difficult for me." [...] In his last novel, Until I <b>Find</b> <b>You</b> (2005) Irving had alluded to his sexual initiation when he was 11, by a woman in her 20s.|$|E

In Hergé's revised edition, he adopts a more florid prose style: [...] "This is to tell you, oh highly esteemed friend, that I entrust to you Abdullah, my adored son. Because here the situation is serious. Should misfortune descend on me like the hawk on an innocent gazelle (for the world is made of life and death) I am sure that Abdullah will <b>find</b> <b>you</b> with warmth and affection, refuge and peace.

500|$|However, Burton {{dropped out}} of Mary Reilly over Columbia's {{decision}} to fast track the film and their interest with Julia Roberts {{in the title role}} instead of Ryder. This prompted Burton to becoming interested in directing Ed Wood himself, on the understanding it could be done quickly. Lehmann said, [...] "Tim wanted to do this movie immediately and direct, but I was already committed to Airheads." [...] Lehmann was given executive producer credit. Alexander and Karaszewski delivered a 147-page screenplay in six weeks. Burton read the first draft and immediately agreed to direct the film as it stood, without any changes or rewrites. Ed Wood gave Burton the opportunity to make a film that was more character-driven as opposed to style-driven. He said in an interview, [...] "On a picture like this I <b>find</b> <b>you</b> don't need to storyboard. You're working mainly with actors, and there's no effects going on, so it's best to be more spontaneous." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2015, Anonymous {{announced}} a major, sustained operation against ISIS following the November 2015 Paris attacks, declaring, [...] "Anonymous {{from all over}} the world will hunt you down.

A week later, Anonymous increased their claim to 20,000 accounts and released a list of the accounts. The list included the Twitter accounts of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, The New York Times and BBC News. The BBC reported that most of the accounts on the list appeared to be still active. A spokesman for Twitter told The Daily Dot that the company is not using the lists of accounts being reported by Anonymous, as they have been found to be “wildly inaccurate” and include accounts used by academics and journalists.|$|E

500|$|In the meantime, MacArthur's {{amphibious assault}} at Inchon went ahead on 15 September. [...] "The success of Inchon {{was so great}} and the {{subsequent}} prestige of General MacArthur was so overpowering," [...] Collins later recalled, [...] "that the Chiefs hesitated thereafter to question later plans and decisions of the general, which should have been challenged." [...] In response to a rumor that the Eighth Army planned to halt at the 38th parallel and await United Nations authorization to cross, Marshall {{sent a message to}} MacArthur informing him that: [...] "We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of 38th parallel. Announcement above referred to may precipitate embarrassment in the UN where evident desire is not to be confronted with necessity of a vote on passage, rather to <b>find</b> <b>you</b> have found it militarily necessary to do so." [...] A few days later, MacArthur was instructed not to issue an announcement that his forces had crossed the 38th parallel. On 7 October a United Nations General Assembly Resolution was passed that could be broadly construed as permitting the invasion of North Korea.|$|E
500|$|Turner also {{appeared}} in four films with Clark Gable between 1941 and 1954, beginning with Honky Tonk (1941). The Turner-Gable films' successes were heightened by gossip-column rumors about {{a relationship between the}} two. In January 1942, she began shooting her second picture with Gable, titled Somewhere I'll Find You; however, the production was halted for several weeks after the death of Gable's wife, Carole Lombard, in a plane crash. Meanwhile, the press continued to fuel rumors that Turner and Gable were romantic offscreen, which Turner vehemently denied. Consequently, the publicity generated by this would lead MGM to play up her image as a sex symbol in her following film, a romantic comedy titled Slightly Dangerous (1943). In promotion of Somewhere I'll <b>Find</b> <b>You,</b> Turner embarked on a nationwide war bond tour, during which she returned to her hometown of Wallace, Idaho with her mother, where she was greeted with a large celebration: [...] "We checked into our hotel, and were told that the Mayor had declared a holiday in my honor," [...] she recalled. [...] "A banner stretched across the street read, in large letters, WELCOME HOME, LANA. We'd been in our rooms only a few moments when people who claimed to have known us when we lived in Wallace began knocking on the door." ...|$|E
500|$|Many themes {{present in}} Irving's earlier works are {{recycled}} in this book: {{the story begins}} in New England, it features a fractured family, a main character is a writer, sudden tragedy, a young boy is sexually initiated by an older women, and bears. It contains Irving's usual fare of [...] "melancholic humor and comic absurdity", [...] "grotesque deaths and grisly accidents", plus [...] "lots and lots of coincidences". As in Irving's writings, Danny's novels are full of [...] "fairy-tale exaggerations" [...] and [...] "melodramatic worst-case scenarios". Daniel Mallory in the Los Angeles Times said that while Irving [...] "loots his own canon", so do other writers, for example Philip Roth, Richard Ford and Don DeLillo. Lucy Daniel wrote in The Daily Telegraph that while such [...] "predictable eccentricities" [...] might disadvantage a writer, they are [...] "part of the charm" [...] of Irving's works. As in The Hotel New Hampshire, incestuous relationships take place in this book: here Danny has sex {{with some of his}} cousins and an aunt. But while Irving presents it in a naughty-but-nice manner, it has serious undertones: it was revealed after Irving's 11th novel, Until I <b>Find</b> <b>You</b> (2005), that he was sexually abused as a child.|$|E

500|$|As an unheralded guard {{after his}} sophomore season, he {{worked out with}} his cousins on guard drills that their father (Davis' uncle) had developed. Davis did not play in the spring/summer AAU circuit between 8th grade and his junior year. He began his junior year at a height of [...] and his junior {{basketball}} season at , saying he felt fortunate to have had such a rapid growth spurt without any knee pains. During his junior year, his family considered having him transfer to one of Chicago's basketball powerhouses, but Hyde Park Career Academy head coach Donnie Kirksey, who knew Davis, Sr. well, advised against it saying [...] "If you're good enough, they'll <b>find</b> <b>you</b> wherever you are." [...] Perspectives finished the season 8–15. Although he remained unnoticed nationally and locally after three seasons of Chicago Public League play, he was soon thereafter rated as the #1 player {{in the class of}} 2011 by Scout.com and in the ESPNU 100. Rivals.com rated him the #2 player behind Austin Rivers. The attention came when he started playing on Tai Streets' Meanstreets (AAU team) traveling system in the spring of his junior year. As late as Spring 2010 he was still unknown, but began to be noticed in mid April. In late April, Syracuse offered him a scholarship. That spring NBA Top 100 Camp Director Dave Telep, invited him to the camp based on his dominant first half performance of {{the first game of the}} Fort Wayne, Indiana Spiece Fieldhouse event. That summer his talent was attention-grabbing. In August 2010, Davis played in the Nike Global Challenge in Hillsboro, Oregon. In the opening game, he had 23 points and 9 rebounds.|$|E
500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can <b>find.</b> <b>You</b> could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to being a handyman, Red also has several main philosophies in life, some of which are passed on to the lodge as a whole.

2500|$|Red {{attempted}} to demonstrate creative and often humorous ways to tackle relatively common tasks, such as {{taking out the}} trash or making use of derelict cars, or to create something extravagant out of whatever {{he could get his}} hands on. Memorable examples included a paddlewheeler made out of a van on pallets and a revolving door, a jetpack made from two propane tanks, a hybrid car from recycled golf carts and satellite dishes, and a kiddie ride made from a bar stool attached to the agitator of a washing machine. Duct tape, [...] "the handyman's secret weapon," [...] was almost always the fastener of choice. In one episode, he tried to duct tape the Ontario-Quebec border as a potential solution to Quebec separatism. The segment customarily concluded with the aphorism [...] "If the women don't <b>find</b> <b>you</b> handsome, they should at least <b>find</b> <b>you</b> handy." ...|$|E

He later said, [...] "to go from the show business environment and <b>find</b> <b>you</b> are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective.
