40|$|The {{dependence}} of the photoluminescence of red amorphous phosphorus upon the energy of excitation photons is discussed {{in the framework of}} models of recombination at defects. The CW luminescence of this material at 4 K is found to show a shift in the emission energy proportional to the excitation energy below a critical energy near the bandgap. Near the same energy the width of the luminescence band switches from being linearly related to the excitation energy (low energies) to being independent of excitation energy (higher energies). The authors discuss the role of the processes involved in absorption in determining the excitation {{dependence of}} the luminescence, and conclude that the sharpness of the transition from linear variation with excitation <b>energy</b> to <b>independence</b> of <b>energy</b> indicates the influence of the mobility edge upon the initial distribution of optically injected carriers...|$|R

Concept of green growth is a new paradigm in economic development that discussed in international organizations such as UNEP (United Nation Environment Program) and OECD (Organization Economy Cooperation Development).

The green growth policy of South Korea is a way to improves <b>independence</b> <b>energy</b> and mitigating climate change. This research is using descriptive and library research methods. The data and information obtained from books, journals, and websites. This research uses neo-realism and security non traditional theory to explain why South Korea uses green growth as its national policy. The result of this research shows that South Korea starts to develop clean energy and uses green technology in efficiency energy consumption and reduce its GHG emissions. By using the five-year plan in green growth policy, the government invests about 2 percent of its GDP in Research and Development (R & D) of clean energy and green technology. government and private sectors starts to expand its industries in green technology and uses clean energy.

In the high <b>energy</b> limit the <b>independence</b> is not maintained, but the result is believed to possess the correct energy dependence...|$|R
