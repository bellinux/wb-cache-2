40|$|Recently, {{the cost}} for Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and the other {{distributed}} energy resources have become more affordable at the household level, especially photovoltaics (PV) and storage batteries. With this, the possibility of households to become “prosumers” (producers and consumers of energy at the same time) becomes an attractive alternative due to the opportunity to save on the electricity bill costs. The traditional concept where a household can only purchase from the grid becomes outdated; this also triggers the concern of “death spiral. ” The reinforcing loop where the increase of the prosumers can provoke them to defect from the grid and force the utilities to increase their tariffs in order to cover their network grid and additional policies cost. Where in the past, this kind of condition was unlikely to happen. Due to household consumers are usually the least elastic and ended up carrying {{the burden of the}} of the cost because this type of end user will not change their consumption by much, even if prices increase greatly (Alleman, 1999; Ramsey, 1927). This research is using Vensim software to build and run a model of the Spanish household market based on System Dynamics (SD) methodology. The model is using six different scenarios that tested into four kinds of combinations of policy: no net metering and mixed tariff, no net metering and volumetric tariffs, net metering and volumetric tariffs, and net metering with mixed tariff. On top of that, the possibility of <b>exit</b> <b>charges</b> and network-only regulation charges were also being tested on those four combinations of policy, to see about the potential possibility of the “death spiral” in the Spanish household market. Results indicated that there is less possibility for the “death spiral” happening in Spain’s household market. Interestingly, cost recovery aside the concept of net metering leads to less to none of the grid defection, and without net metering, it is encouraging households to defect from the grid. Other results are fixed-network regulation cost can dampen grid disconnection, {{but at the same time}} delayed the RES adoption, and <b>exit</b> <b>charges</b> managed to prevent grid defection. Other alternatives are needed to be explored in order to foster RES, efficient market mechanisms need to be designed in order to put in level playing field different technologies at different scales and not incentivizing certain technologies with non-transparent cost shifting among consumers as net-metering does.

40|$|The {{emission}} {{statistics of}} secondary electrons emitted from solid targets under ion impact has been recently {{the object of}} much interest from a theoretical as well as experimental point of view since it provides very useful information about the electron excitation process in the solid. In the case of very thin targets, {{it is possible to}} measure simultaneously the number of electrons emitted {{from both sides of the}} target and the <b>exit</b> <b>charge</b> state of the projectile. The resulting two variable (number of electrons emitted in the backward and in the forward directions) statistical distribution shows in some cases a clear correlation between the numbers of electrons emitted from both sides of the target. This correlation between backward and forward emission has been studied from Monte Carlo simulations and from experiments for H 0 and H+ projectiles incident on thin carbon foils in the MeV energy range. It is shown that the charge exchange processes of the incident projectiles in the target play an important role in the interpretation of the backward-forward correlation of the secondary electron emission.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 years the South African fiscus has {{introduced}} numerous {{changes to the}} Income Tax Act (ITA) which affect the income tax implications of persons ceasing to be a resident of South Africa. The two main changes were: - The introduction of a world-wide basis of taxation for residents - The introduction of capital gains tax (CGT) {{as part of the}} ITA The aim of this treatise was to identify the income tax implications of persons ceasing to be a resident of South Africa. Resulting from this research, several issues in the ITA have been identified, and the two major ones are summarised below. Firstly, upon the emigration of the taxpayer, there is a deemed disposal of a taxpayer’s assets in terms of paragraph 12 of the Eighth Schedule. It is submitted that the resulting exit tax may be unconstitutional for individuals. It is recommended that South Africa should adopt the deferral method within its domestic legislation for individuals who are emigrating. The deferral method postpones the liability until the disposal of the asset. Secondly, on the subsequent disposal of assets by former residents where there was no <b>exit</b> <b>charge</b> in terms of the exemption under paragraph 12 (2) (a) (i) of the Eighth Schedule. Depending on the specific double tax agreement (DTA) that has been entered into with the foreign country, taxpayers have been given vii the opportunity to minimise or eliminate the tax liability with regard to certain assets. This should be of concern {{from the point of view}} of the South African government. Further issues noted in this treatise were the following: - It is submitted that the term ‘place of effective management’ has been incorrectly interpreted by SARS in Interpretation Note 6. - It is further submitted that the interpretation by SARS of paragraph 2 (2) of the Eighth Schedule is technically incorrect. The above issues that have been identified present opportunities to emigrants to take advantage of the current tax legislation. It is further recommended that taxpayers who are emigrating need to consider the South African domestic tax law implications, respective DTA’s, as well as the domestic tax laws of the other jurisdiction, not only on the date of emigration but also on the subsequent disposal of the respective asset...|$|E

Particular {{attention is paid to}} the specific contributions of the K and L shell target electrons to electron recombination in the energetic Zn ionic projectile. The classical Bohr–Lindhard model was used for describing recombination, while quantum mechanical models were also introduced for scaling the L to K cross-section ratios. It was found that even for a hydrogen-like carbon target, the effect of the missing five bound electrons brings about an increase of only 0. 6 charge units in the equilibrium charge state as compared to the cold target value of 23. A collisional radiative calculation was employed for analyzing the type of plasma produced in the experimental study. It was found that for the plasma conditions characteristic of this experiment, some fully ionized target plasma atoms should be present. However in order to explain the experimentally observed large increase in the projectile charge state a very dominant component of the fully ionized plasma must comprise the target plasma. A procedure for calculating the dynamic evolvement of the projectile charge state within partially ionized plasma is also presented and applied to the type of plasma encountered in the experiment of Roth et al. ~ 2000 !.

It is consistent with recent evidence on firm dynamics and {{on the importance of}} reallocation for productivity growth. In the model, growth is driven by selection among heterogeneous incumbent firms, and is sustained as entrants imitate the best incumbents. In this framework, firing costs not only induce misallocation of labor, but also affect growth by affecting firms' <b>exit</b> decisions. Importantly, <b>charging</b> firing costs only to continuing firms raises growth by promoting selection. Also <b>charging</b> them to <b>exiting</b> firms is akin to an exit tax, hampers selection, and reduces growth - by 0. 1 percentage points in a calibrated version of the model. With job turnover very similar in the two settings, this implies that the treatment of exiting firms matters for welfare and growth. In addition, the impact on growth rates is larger in sectors where firms face larger idiosyncratic shocks, as in services. This fits evidence that recent EU-U.
