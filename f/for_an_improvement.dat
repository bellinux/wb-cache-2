Meanwhile, the oil shock caused by the Yom Kippur War in October 1973 resulted in higher oil prices and reduced imports by industrialized countries. The cancellation of the orders was seriously considered, but Shell concluded {{that it was better}} to continue, mostly to not put the shipyard in a very difficult position by withdrawing such a huge, already initiated project (the work commitments were already well advanced, with extremely heavy cancellation charges).

In 1868, he moved to Parramatta, where he initially held services in the School of Arts. A church was built for the community, which opened on 19 May 1872. Also in 1872, Forsaith became chairman of the Congregational Union of New South Wales.

500|$|In 1896 {{plans to}} reduce coal workers' wages led to strike action. Charlton {{supported}} {{the struggle against}} wage reductions, but the effort failed and, {{along with many other}} miners, he moved to the goldfields near Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. After two years there, Charlton returned to Lambton and became an official in the Colliery Employees' Federation, becoming treasurer in 1901. While occupying that position, Charlton also prepared arbitration cases. Battling <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> in mine workers' conditions, he attended a trade union congress in November 1902, at which he moved for nationalisation of the coal mining industry, believing it would [...] "eliminate cut-throat competition between owners that depressed miners' wages and conditions". That idea was opposed as being too radical but a compromise was drawn up urging state governments to open and run their own coal mines, while affirming the ultimate desirability of full nationalisation.|$|E
500|$|Hitler {{proved too}} impatient. He hoped to improve Germany's {{position}} by winning a decisive victory on the Western Front. Hitler distrusted Galland's theory and believed {{him to be}} afraid and stalling for time. The Führer was also skeptical that the Luftwaffe could stop the American air offensive and {{was not willing to}} have German resources sit idle on airfields to wait <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> in flying conditions. Admittedly Galland's efforts had built up a useful reserve, but Hitler was now to use it in support of a land offensive. Göring and Hitler handed over the forces pooled by Galland to Peltz whom they had appointed commander of II. Jagdkorps—responsible for virtually all fighter forces in the west. Peltz appointed Gordon Gollob as Special Fighter Staff Officer for the offensive. Gollob ultimately was a vociferous opponent of Galland and eventually engineered his dismissal. Whether the [...] "Big Blow" [...] operation would have worked is a matter of academic debate. Historians remained divided, with some believing it was a lost opportunity while others think it would have had much less impact than Galland estimated.|$|E

[...] However, the idea that SCI was untreatable remained predominant until the early 20th century. [...] In 1934, the mortality rate {{in the first two}} years after injury was over 80%, mostly due to infections of the urinary tract and pressure sores. It was not until the latter half of the century that breakthroughs in imaging, surgery, medical care, and rehabilitation medicine contributed to a substantial improvement in SCI care. [...] The relative incidence of incomplete compared to complete injuries has improved since the mid-20th century, due mainly to the emphasis on faster and better initial care and stabilization of spinal cord injury patients. [...] The creation of emergency medical services to professionally transport people to the hospital is given partial credit <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> in outcomes since the 1970s.

500|$|When Alexei Kosygin {{resigned}} in 1980 Tikhonov, {{at the age}} of 75, was elected the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers. During his five-year term as premier Tikhonov refrained from reforming the Soviet economy, despite all statistics from that time showing the economy was stagnating. Tikhonov presented the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–85) at the 26th Party Congress, and told the delegates that the state would allocate nine million rubles for mothers who were seeking parental leave. In his presentation to the congress, Tikhonov admitted that Soviet agriculture was not producing enough grain. Tikhonov called <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> in Soviet–US relations, but dismissed all speculations that the Soviet economy was in any sort of crisis. Despite this, Tikhonov admitted to economic [...] "shortcomings" [...] and acknowledged the ongoing [...] "food problem"; other topics for discussion were the need to save energy resources, boost labour productivity and {{to improve the quality of}} Soviet produced goods. Early in his term, in January 1981, Tikhonov admitted that the government's demographic policy was one of the weakest areas of his cabinet. In reality, however, he along with many others, were beginning to worry that not enough Russians were being born. The Era of Stagnation reduced the birth rate, and increased the death rate of the Russian population.|$|E

2500|$|The Iraqis of largely African descent live mostly {{around the}} city of Basra, having {{been brought to the}} region as slaves over one {{thousand}} years ago to work the sugarcane plantations then in existence. Although they are Muslims and Arabic-speakers, Afro-Iraqis also retain some cultural and religious traditions from their ancestral homeland. They suffer considerable discrimination due to their behaviour, and, as a result, are restricted to working as entertainers or menial laborers. Moreover, they are often addressed by other Iraqis as abd, meaning [...] "slave". In the mid-9th century, black slaves around Basra rose in a rebellion, conquering their former masters and ruling the city for 15 years before being put down by forces sent by the Caliph in Baghdad.

2500|$|On 16 October 2017 the LIGO and Virgo collaborations {{announced}} {{the first ever}} detection of gravitational waves originating from the coalescence of a binary neutron star system. The observation of this GW170817 transient, which occurred on 17 August 2017, allowed for constraining the masses of the neutron stars involved between 0.86 and 2.26 solar masses. Further analysis allowed a greater restriction of the mass values to the interval, to 1.17–1.60 solar masses, with the total system mass measured to be 2.73–2.78 solar masses. [...] The inclusion of the Virgo detector in the observation effort allowed <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> of the localization of the source {{by a factor of}} 10. This in turn facilitated the electromagnetic follow-up of the event. In contrast to the case of binary black hole mergers, binary neutron star mergers were expected to yield an electromagnetic counterpart, that is, a light signal associated with the event. A gamma-ray burst was detected by the space telescope Fermi (GRB 170817A), occurring 1.7 seconds after the gravitational wave transient. The signal, originating near the galaxy NGC 4993, was associated with the neutron star merger. This was corroborated by the electromagnetic follow-up of the event (AT 2017gfo), involving 70 telescopes and observatories and yielding observations over a large region of the electromagnetic spectrum which further confirmed the neutron star nature of the merged objects and the associated kilonova.|$|E

60|$|These {{circumstances}} are stated {{in several of}} her letters, and alluded to in several others, but it may help {{to the understanding of}} them if a brief summary be given here. In the autumn of 1845, as described above, Miss Barrett's doctors advised her to winter abroad. The advice was strongly pressed, as offering a good prospect of a real improvement of health, and as the only way of avoiding the annual relapse brought on by the English winter. One or more of her brothers could have gone with her, and she was willing and able to try the experiment; but in face of this express medical testimony, Mr. Barrett interposed a refusal. This indifference to her health naturally wounded Miss Barrett very deeply; but it also gave her the right of taking her fate into her own hands. Convinced at last that no refusal on her part could alter Mr. Browning's devotion to her, and that marriage with him, so far from being an increase of risk to her health, offered the only means by which she might hope <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> in it, she gave him the conditional promise that if she came safely through the then impending winter, she would consent to a definite engagement.|$|E
