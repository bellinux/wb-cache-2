40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of <b>formal</b> kindergarten <b>education</b> on the achievement of primary five pupils. The academic performance of pupils with and without formal kindergarten experience were compared. Their achievement was based on their performance in the English language tests. The sample consisted of one hundred and twenty pupils made up of forty eight pupils with <b>formal</b> kindergarten <b>education</b> and seventy two pupils without <b>formal</b> kindergarten <b>education</b> selected from ten public primary five classes. The sample consisted of boys and girls. The instrument used for data collection was English language achievement tests. The instruments were administered to students in their various schools. The scores obtained from the tests were analysed using the t-test to find the {{significant difference between the}} means of the two groups. The results of this study revealed that <b>formal</b> kindergarten <b>education</b> has a long term effect on the performance of primary school pupils since those with <b>formal</b> kindergarten <b>education</b> performed significantly better than those without. Another finding was that the sex of the students has no effect on the academic performance of pupils in primary school. Conclusively, it was confirmed in the study that pupils with <b>formal</b> kindergarten <b>education</b> perform better than those without in Nigerian context at least in primary school, hence this study emphasized the importance of <b>formal</b> kindergarten <b>education...</b>|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{provision}} of <b>formal</b> coach <b>education</b> has been regarded as a crucial mechanism for endorsing sports coaching and facilitating sports coaching practitioners’ professional development and competency. As a result, {{there has been a}} noticeable {{increase in the number of}} sports coaching research scholars investigating <b>formal</b> coach <b>education.</b> Previous research however has recognised that <b>formal</b> coach <b>education</b> has had a limited impact on learning and professional development. In addition, the research surrounding females in sports coaching, and in particular their experiences of <b>formal</b> coach <b>education,</b> is limited. It is considered an under-researched area, and currently it is unclear why females are under-represented in <b>formal</b> coach <b>education</b> courses. This thesis therefore aims to explore gendered issues associated with the complexities of the Football Association’s <b>formal</b> coach <b>education</b> process, and the issues associated with female football coaching practitioners’ attending coach education courses. The sports coaches who participated in this work were recruited via purposeful sampling procedures, and importantly demonstrated characteristics which resonated with the aims of this research study. The research study was separated into a four-phase, sequential, exploratory method design, which included a series of in-depth, one-to-one semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed utilising a thematic analysis approach, and aligned with a Bourdieun and feminist theoretical framework. The findings revealed a range of contexts and challenges for female coaches undertaking <b>formal</b> coach <b>education.</b> Specifically, high levels of gender discrimination, inappropriate cultural practices, and sexual impropriety were recorded. These insights are discussed in line with the Bourdieun notions of social acceptance, symbolic language and violence. In conclusion, it is argued that the attrition levels of the sports coaching practitioners’ have indeed been affected, and could well continue to be, unless change occurs. Hopefully, the recommendations provided could go a long way to enhancing the future provision of <b>formal</b> coach <b>education...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} tests if a young adult’s social location determines {{what type}} of information {{he or she will}} receive about sexual health from parents and <b>formal</b> sexual <b>education</b> programs. I also test whether sexual education mediates direct associations between social location and 4 protective sexual health behaviors: condom communication, consistent condom use, delaying sexual debut, and reducing the number of lifetime sexual partners. Using the 2011 - 2013 wave of the National Survey of Family Growth, I look for differences in sexual education and engaging in protective sexual health behaviors among white, Hispanic, and African American men and women ages 15 - 24. I find that communication about sex from parents and <b>formal</b> sex <b>education</b> programs varies by race and gender. I also find that direct associations exist between social location, parental communication, <b>formal</b> sexual <b>education,</b> and protective sexual health behaviors. However, all of these operate independently from one another, and I find that parental communication and <b>formal</b> sexual <b>education</b> does little to mediate the direct associations between social location and protective sexual behaviors.

40|$|Problem Statement: Programs to {{facilitate}} Nurse Practitioner (NP) transition to practice {{have been developed}} at public and private institutions across the US {{and there is no}} published evidence of their influence on NP job satisfaction. Purpose: Determine the impact of post-graduate education on job satisfaction among NPs. Research Question: Is there a difference in job satisfaction between NPs who have completed <b>formal</b> post-graduate <b>education</b> and NPs who have not participated in <b>formal</b> post-graduate <b>education</b> programs? Methods: A non-equivalent group research design was used. The Misener Nurse Practitioner Job Satisfaction Scale© was administered to a convenience sample of two groups of nurse practitioners; one group having had <b>formal</b> post-graduate <b>education</b> and another group that has not had <b>formal</b> post-graduate <b>education.</b> Participants were recruited through post-graduate NP education program directors who were asked to forward the job satisfaction scale to program alumni. This group was compared to NPs who have not participated in <b>formal</b> post-graduate <b>education</b> and recruited through a professional NP organization. Analysis: Independent samples t-test of factor scores was used to compare job satisfaction between groups and contrast post-graduate fellowship training effects within demographic strata. A multiple linear regression was calculated to predict participants’ total job satisfaction based on years of NP experience, state regulatory environment {{and whether or not they}} completed a post-graduate education program. Significance: Post-graduate education has a statistically significant positive impact on NP job satisfaction. Knowledge of factors that influence job satisfaction is advantageous to employers and NPs considering post-graduate education opportunities.
