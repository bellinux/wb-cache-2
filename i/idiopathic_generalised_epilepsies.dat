Methods: A sample of 10787 patients with epilepsy with complete information about first degree relatives (parents, siblings and offspring) was selected from the database of the Episcreen Project, the largest Italian observational study on epilepsy. Family history was assessed by: (1) prevalence estimates of epilepsy among proband’s relatives, (2) modified cumulative risks (MCR), adjusted using proband’s age as censoring time in life tables, (3) standardised morbidity ratios (SMR), using a sub-group of symptomatic epilepsies as control group. Results: Patients (9. 1 %) had {{a family history of}} epilepsy. The overall prevalence of epilepsy among first degree relatives was 2. 6 %. <b>Idiopathic</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsies</b> had the highest prevalence (5. 3 %). Cryptogenetic epilepsies had a lower prevalence (2. 1 %) than idiopathic epilepsies, but higher then symptomatic epilepsies (1. 5 %), both in generalised and focal forms (3. 8 % vs. 2. 0 % and 1. 8 % vs. 1. 3 %).

Two thirds of patients had <b>idiopathic</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and mainly reported generalised tonic clonic seizures, but some had typical absence seizures and myoclonic jerks while playing video games. In this series, 30 % with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.

40|$|Generalised {{epilepsy}} with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is {{the most}} studied familial epilepsy syndrome. However, characteristics of UK families have not previously been reported. Among the first 80 families recruited to our families study, four broad subphenotypes were identified: families with classical GEFS+; families with borderline GEFS+; families with unclassified epilepsy; and families with an alternative syndromal diagnosis. Borderline GEFS+ families shared many characteristics of classical GEFS+ families—such as prominent febrile seizures plus and early onset febrile seizures—but included more adults with focal epilepsies (rather than the <b>idiopathic</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsies</b> predominating in GEFS+) and double the prevalence of migraine.

Patients with IGE demonstrated significantly lower scores on tests across all cognitive factor-domains except visual-spatial abilities. Effect sizes ranged from 0. 42 to 0. 88 pooled standard deviation units. The average reduction of scores on tests of executive function in IGE compared to controls was 0. 72 standard deviation units.

In total, 413 microsatellite polymorphisms were genotyped in 617 family members. Non-parametric multipoint linkage analysis, using the GeneHunter program, provided significant evidence for a novel IGE susceptibility locus on chromosome 3 q 26 (Z(NPL) = 4. 19 at D 3 S 3725; P = 0. 000017) and suggestive evidence for two IGE loci on chromosome 14 q 23 (Z(NPL) = 3. 28 at D 14 S 63; P = 0. 000566), and chromosome 2 q 36 (Z(NPL) = 2. 98 at D 2 S 1371; P = 0. 000535).

All subjects were of normal intelligence, educated appropriately to age, and led productive lives in the community. Two of the patients on carbamazepine and one on valproate had less than five partial, absence or myoclonic seizures monthly, the remaining were controlled. Carbamazepine serum concentrations were 12 ± 5 ug/ml, phenytoin were 23 ± 7, and valproate were 62 ± 23 (mean±sd).

Patients on phenytoin and valproate performed significantly worse than controls on immediate recall, and patients on carbamazepine performed significantly worse than controls in Stroop test (p< 0, 01). The results indicate relatively minor effects of the epileptic syndromes and of phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate on cognition of patients with controlled epilepsy leading productive lives in the community.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Idiopathic</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsies</b> (IGE) {{are usually}} {{seen in the}} first two decades of life. There is a paucity of data of these {{patients}} when they get older. Methods: Patients admitted to our epilepsy center were screened for being older than 40 years at the time of last admission and being diagnosed with IGE according to ILAE- 1989 criteria. The clinical features, syndromes and prognosis of 33 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Nineteen (58 %) were female and mean age was 50, 24 ± 10, 29. 16 cases had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, 7 juvenile absence epilepsy, 4 childhood absence epilepsy, 2 IGE with generalised convulsive seizures (GCS), 3 atypical IGE with absence status epilepticus (ASE), 1 late onset IGE. 19 patients were using monotherapy whereas 13 were using polytherapy, and there is only one case without medication. The prognosis was evaluated as good in 54. 5 % (n: 18) and as poor in 45. 5 % (n: 15). Absence of family history of epilepsy, male gender were related with good prognosis without statistical significance. Prognosis was observed as better in the co-existence of myoclonia and GCS and in the group with GCS only, whereas the existence of absence seizures and frequent ASE were associated with poor prognosis. Conclusions: Almost half of the IGE patients older than 40 years had poor prognosis and should be followed up closely. It is remarkable that this group consists of well-known IGE syndromes diagnosed earlier rather than being late onset and also includes atypical patients experiencing frequent ASE...|$|E

40|$|For {{several years}} we have been {{following}} patients with intractable, childhood-onset <b>idiopathic</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsies</b> with ≥ 3 Hz spike-wave discharges. Our need to find explanations for their intractability was {{the starting point for}} this study. We were interested in identifying characteristics, which would predict intractability; evaluating how these patients were treated and whether polytherapy was useful. We identified patients with ≥ 3 Hz spike-wave discharges by reviewing EEG reports recorded between 1983 and 1992. Data were collected from medical records and through personal interviews. We identified 82 patients with tentative idiopathic generalised epilepsy. Eleven were excluded. Thirty-eight patients had childhood absence epilepsy, 18 had juvenile absence epilepsy, 13 had juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and two had eyelid myoclonia with absences: 89. 5, 78, 38 and 0 % of the patients in each group, respectively, had been seizure free for more than 2 years. Twenty percent of the patients had intractable seizures. All intractable patients with juvenile absence epilepsy had rhythmic, random eyelid blinking and generalised tonic-clonic seizures. A history of more than ten generalised tonic-clonic seizures was associated with intractability in juvenile myoclonic patients. Monotherapy with ethosuximide or valproate resulted in seizure control in 65 % of patients. Seventeen patients (24 %) were treated with polytherapy, six achieved remission. These six patients had childhood absence epilepsy and juvenile absence epilepsy. Positive outcome was found in childhood absence epilepsy and juvenile absence epilepsy. Intractable seizures were more frequent among patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. None of them benefited from polytherapy with conventional anti-epileptic drugs.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Seizure onset in <b>idiopathic</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsies</b> (IGE) is {{considered}} to be rare after the second decade of life. We aimed to explore age of seizure onset in a large population of patients with IGE and compare “classical” onset to late onset cases. METHODS: Patients with IGE, treated at the outpatient epilepsy clinic (Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria, 1985 - 2006, n= 798) were retrospectively screened. Inclusion criteria were: Diagnosis of IGE, more than two follow up (FU) visits, duration of FU more than one year, normal brain imaging. We analysed demographic data, age of seizure onset, seizure types, syndromes, neuroimaging and EEG findings, seizure triggers, seizure freedom for one and five years at last FU. RESULTS: A total of 492 patients (mean age at seizure onset 14. 6 years, range 0. 1 - 55, SD 7. 9) with IGE were identified: CAE (n= 113, range 1 - 55, SD 6. 5), JAE (n= 75, range 4 - 39, SD 5. 1), JME (n= 112, range 2 - 39, SD 5. 7), and EGMA (n= 192 range 1 - 52, SD 17. 3). Population was stratified into three groups: 28 patients with seizure onset at > 30 yrs, 180 between 15 and 30 years and 284 < 15 years. Distribution of seizure types and epilepsy syndromes differed significantly in group comparison (p< 0. 001); seizure outcome and other clinical variables did not differ throughout the groups. CONCLUSION: Apart from age related onset of seizure types and syndromes with a loose upper limit of onset age patients with a late onset did not differ from their younger counterparts.

40|$|Typical absence {{seizures}} {{are characteristic}} of many <b>idiopathic</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsies</b> and the only seizure-type in childhood absence epilepsy. We know that absence seizures arise in thalamocortical networks and that GABAergic agents exacerbate or induce absences. Furthermore, raised levels of GABA {{have been identified in}} the ventrobasal thalamus in an established genetic animal model (genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg GAERS), which was later suggested as a result of aberrant GABA uptake. I have shown that enhanced tonic GABAa current in TC neurons of the VB is a common phenomenon across genetic and pharmacological models of absence seizures. Furthermore, my data show that increased extrasynaptic GABAaR (cGABAaR) function in the VB is both sufficient and necessary to induce SWDs. This is supported by the fact that focal intrathalamic application of a selective agonist for eGABAARs, THIP, was sufficient to elicit SWDs in normal animals and that mice lacking cGABAaRs were resistant to absence seizure induction by y-butyrolactone. Moreover, I have presented data that directly implicate aberrant type- 1 GABA transporters (GAT- 1) in SWD generation in vivo, with GAT- 1 knockout mice exhibiting spontaneous SWDs and focal thalamic administration of the GAT- 1 blocker, N 0711, inducing SWDs in normal rats a potential new model of absence epilepsy. In addition, my data indicate that activation of postsynaptic GABAbRs enhances tonic GABAA current, presumably via the Gl o protein coupled adenyl cyclase pathway, which was present under control conditions and occurred in several brain areas. This postsynaptic GABAb-cGABAaR link is further supported by the fact that GBL failed to induce SWDs in 5 -subunit knockout mice. Thus, one of the cellular thalamic pathologies that characterises absence seizures is an astrocyte-specific aberrant GAT- 1 with the resulting elevated extracellular GABA level enhancing tonic GABAa current through two mechanisms: direct activation of high affinity eGABAARs and indirect increase in eGABAAR function due to activation of postsynaptic GABAbRs.

40|$|AbstractWe {{reviewed}} {{our experience}} with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in 165 patients with medically refractory epilepsy (138 partial epilepsy (PE), 13 symptomatic <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (SGE), 14 <b>idiopathic</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (IGE)). Average duration of VNS therapy was 21. 6 months. A 50 % or greater reduction in seizure frequency was achieved in 47. 1 % of the PE group, 46. 1 % of the SGE group, and 57. 1 % of the IGE group. A 50 % or greater reduction in seizure frequency and reduced antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen were achieved in: PE (9. 4 %), SGE (7. 7 %), and IGE (35. 7 %). These preliminary {{results suggest that}} VNS is an effective therapy for some patients with medically refractory IGE...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile myoclonic {{epilepsy}} (JME) is a hereditary, <b>idiopathic,</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and {{is found}} in 5 %– 11 % of patients with epilepsy. It is characterised by myoclonic jerks, occasional generalised tonic-clonic seizures, and sometimes absence seizures. JME continues to be under-appreciated and under-diagnosed. Accurate diagnosis is important as it usually responds well to treatment with appropriate anticonvulsants and misdiagnosis often results in unnecessary morbidity. In addition lifelong therapy is usually indicated as the natural history is one of relapse off treatment, even after a prolonged seizure-free period. In 1822, “myoclonus ” was described as “asymptom associated with epilepsy ” byPritchard. 1 Delasiave in 1854 termed it “petit mal moteur”. In 1867, Herpin gave the firs...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 50 -year-old male patient with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>generalised</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and {{porphyria}} cutanea tarda. Valproic acid and phenobarbital monotherapy controlled seizures but exacerbated porphyric symptomatology, while clobazam, clonazepam and lamotrigine monotherapy were well tolerated as regards porphyric disturbances but did not completely control seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures were eventually controlled by a combination of clonazepam (9 mg/day) and lamotrigine (150 mg/day), but absences persisted and this treatment caused significant adverse effects consisting of sedation and memory disturbances. Levetiracetam monotherapy (3 g/day) was accompanied by complete control of seizures; memory disturbances and sedation also resolved, and no porphyrinogenetic activity of levetiracetain was observed. This is the first report of the safe use of levetiracetam in porphyria cutanea tarda...|$|R
