Nowadays however, the number of {{migrants}} in Europe has reached its peak and the cultural diversity between migrants and the <b>hosting</b> <b>society</b> has never been so great. This is a new and challenging situation which demands a proper psychosocial approach in order to cope with all the issues necessary to successfully integrate migrants into the <b>hosting</b> <b>society.</b> First in line are the field experts, who have to be properly educated and trained. In the article, we address {{the view of the}} experts on their work, discover what are the typical issues they have to deal with, their attitude towards the migrants and emphasize the important aspects that have to be included in psychosocial treatment of migrants from different cultural backgrounds. The issues and improvement possibilities for the inclusion of migrants into the <b>hosting</b> <b>society</b> are also discussed. Nevertheless, the time has come when no one can close his eyes that much that migrants will disappear.

2500|$|The Belçika Türk Federasyonu (BTF) is {{considered}} to be [...] "affiliated with or sympathetic" [...] to the Grey Wolves. According to a study, its aim is [...] "to foster loyalty among young people of Turkish origin to their ancestral culture, religion and history and to keep alive the Turkish identity in Europe. BTF claims to oppose not the integration of Belgian-Turks into their <b>host</b> <b>society</b> but rather their assimilation by it." [...] Its activities mostly focus on [...] "issues relevant to Turkish national sensitivities". For instance, it has demonstrated against the erection of an Armenian Genocide memorial in Brussels. During the municipal elections of 2006 two member of the BTF {{came to the attention of}} the media: Fuat Korkmazer on the Flemish Christian Democrats (CD) list in Ghent and Murat Denizli on the Francophone Socialist Party (PS) list in Schaerbeek, a commune in the Brussels Region. In both cases, political observers saw it as an attempt by Belgian parties to attract far-right Turkish voters in communes where there are numerous Turks, with or without Belgian citizenship. Korkmazer got a very low number of votes, while Denizli was elected but had to resign because it was discovered he had a false address and lived in another commune.|$|E

50|$|The {{immediate}} {{economic and}} social advantages associated with membership in an ethnic enclave are undisputed by scholars, however the long-term consequences remain an area of uncertainty. The role these networks play remains uncertain {{due to the fact}} that ethnic enclaves allow immigrants to function successfully within the <b>host</b> <b>society</b> without a significant amount of adjustment either culturally or linguistically. As such, they can either help or hinder naturalization within the host country. The relatively low levels of skill required allow immigrants to achieve financial stability which can in turn encourage eventual naturalization and assimilation. Adversely, this same factor can afford enclave members the opportunity to remain considerably segregated and secluded from the <b>host</b> <b>society.</b> As such, members may circumvent the need to acquire skills necessary for life in the larger <b>host</b> <b>society</b> such as knowledge of cultural norms and language.|$|E

30|$|According to 2016 {{municipal}} register data, Italy {{has the highest}} number of Indians in continental Europe (151, 000), followed by Spain (41, 000). Mass immigration from India to Italy and Spain started in the 1990 s, but economic and political environments more conducive to the entry and permanent settlement of immigrants have resulted in more rapid growth of the Indian immigrant community in Italy than Spain. Due to the unskilled and irregular nature of Indian immigration and the lack of integration policies for unskilled labour in both countries, the level of integration of Indian immigrants remains unexplored. In this research, we used a qualitative methodology to explore the integration level of Indian immigrants into different spheres of these <b>host</b> <b>societies.</b> We conducted 86 semi-structured interviews with Indian immigrants in seven cities with high concentration of Indian immigrants in both countries over 2016 – 2017. We found that the level of integration of Indian immigrants into the <b>host</b> <b>societies</b> is fragmented: some segments of the Indian community are integrated into specific spheres of the <b>host</b> <b>societies,</b> while the rest remain excluded. The main reasons for this fragmented integration are the absence of integration policies for unskilled immigrants, Indians’ provisional attitudes towards permanent settlement in these countries, the internal diversity of the Indian immigrant community and frequent international mobility through transnational networks.|$|R

This article explores the discursive construction and representation of the Kosovo Albanian Diaspora by homeland Kosovo Albanians by critically engaging with responses to thirteen semi-structured interviews with Kosovan Albanians in Kosovo. The discourse of the ‘Schatzi’ is examined as a stereotype employed in narratives about diasporic Kosovo Albanian identity {{in relation to the}} homeland.
