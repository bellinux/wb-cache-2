500|$|Hatt-i humayun (Ottoman Turkish: [...] خط همايون, Turkish: hatt-ı hümayun or hatt-ı hümâyûn), {{also known}} as hatt-i sharif (hatt-ı şerîf), is the <b>diplomatics</b> term for a {{document}} or handwritten note of an official nature composed by an Ottoman sultan. The terms come from hatt (Arabic: handwriting, command), hümayun (imperial) and şerif (lofty, noble). These notes were commonly written by the Sultan personally, although they could also be transcribed by a palace scribe. They were written usually in response to, and directly on, a document submitted to the sultan by the grand vizier or another officer of the Ottoman government. Thus, they could be approvals or denials of a letter of petition, acknowledgements of a report, grants of permission for a request, an annotation to a decree, or other government documents. Hatt-ı hümayuns could be composed from scratch, {{rather than as a}} response to an existing document. After the Tanzimat reform (1856), aimed to modernize the Ottoman Empire, hatt-ı hümayuns of the routine kind were supplanted by the practice of irâde-i seniyye, in which the Sultan's spoken response was recorded on the document by his scribe.|$|E

Upon the death of Volkel in 1828, the brothers expected to be advanced to {{the first and second}} librarianships respectively, and were dissatisfied when the first place was given to Rommel, the keeper of the archives. Consequently, they moved the following year to Göttingen, where Jacob received the appointment of professor and librarian, and Wilhelm that of under-librarian. Jacob Grimm lectured on legal antiquities, historical grammar, literary history, and <b>diplomatics,</b> explained Old German poems, and commented on the Germania of Tacitus ...|$|E

6000|$|Of all {{which there}} is not, in this place, much more to be said. Friedrich's element is itself wearing dim, sombre of hue; and the records of it, too, seem to grow dimmer, more and more intermittent. Old friends, of the {{intellectual}} kind, are almost all dead; the new are of little moment to us,--not worth naming in comparison, The chief, perhaps, is a certain young Marchese Lucchesini, who comes about this time, ["Chamberlain [titular, with Pension, &c.], 9th May, 1780, age then 28" [...] (Preuss, iv. 211);-arrived when or how is not said.] and continues {{in more and more}} favor both with Friedrich and his Successor,--employed even in <b>Diplomatics</b> by the latter. An accomplished young Gentleman, from Lucca; of fine intelligence, and, what was no less essential to him here, a perfect propriety in breeding and carriage. One makes no acquaintance with him in these straggling records, nor desires to make any. It was he that brought the inane, ever scribbling Denina hither, if that can be reckoned a merit. Inane Denina came as Academician, October, 1782; saw Friedrich, [Rodenbeck, iii. 285, 286.] at least once ("Academician, Pension; yes, yes!")--and I know not whether any second time.|$|E
