The growth rate of this phase decreases with an increase in Ni content. The same is reflected on the estimated integrated interdiffusion coefficients of the components in this phase. The possible reasons for this change are discussed based on the discussions of defects, crystal structure and the <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> <b>for</b> <b>diffusion.</b> Diffusion rate of Co in the Co 2 Ta phase at the Co-rich composition is higher because of more number of Co-Co bonds present compared to that of Ta-Ta bonds and the presence of Co antisites for the deviation from the stoichiometry. The decrease in the diffusion coefficients because of Ni addition indicates that Ni preferably replaces Co antisites to decrease the diffusion rate. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

When gradients in chemical potentials vanish, our method reduces to the Scheutjens-Fleer self-consistent field (SF-SCF) method for inhomogeneous polymer systems in equilibrium. To illustrate the concept of our MFSD method, we studied stationary diffusion between two different bulk mixtures, containing, for simplicity, noninteracting homopolymers. Four alternatives <b>for</b> the <b>diffusion</b> equation are implemented.

40|$|The {{removal of}} milk fouling {{deposits}} often requires {{the diffusion of}} electrolyte solutions such as sodium hydroxide through a gel. Very often more than one single anion and one single cation are involved and thus the modelling of such diffusion requires a multicomponent description. Diffusion of electrolyte solutions through gels can be modelled using the Maxwell-Stefan equation. The <b>driving</b> <b>forces</b> <b>for</b> <b>diffusion</b> are the chemical potential gradients of ionic species and the diffusion potential, i. e., the electrostatic potential induced by diffusion of the ions. A model based on the Maxwell-Stefan equation was applied to electrolyte solutions and electrolyte solutions with a gel. When modelling the diffusion of electrolyte solutions, the resulting equations {{were found to be}} a partial differential algebraic equation system with a differentiation index of two. The identification of this characteristic of the system enabled a solution method using the method of lines to be developed. When modelling the diffusion of electrolyte solutions through a gel an explicit expression <b>for</b> <b>diffusion</b> potential was developed and hence the diffusion equations were solved. Numerical solutions were presented for a number of case studies and comparisons were made with solutions from literature and between different electrolyte systems. It was found that the results of diffusion of electrolytes were in good agreement with those of experiments and literature. In the case of diffusion of electrolytes through a gel, swelling of the gel was predicted.

30|$|As can be {{observed}} in Fig.  10, with the increasing holding time of the cryogenic process up to 48  h, strength coefficient decreases and shows a plateau (~ 5100  MPa). During deep cryogenic process, η-carbides precipitate with the mechanism of stress-assisted diffusion, so carbon content of martensite decreases and as a consequence its strength decreases (Totten and Howes 1997). So, with the increasing holding time up to 48  h, more η-carbide nucleus forms and more carbon atoms are absorbed from martensitic matrix, and this evidence leads to decrement in strength coefficient. In holding times more than the optimum (72  h), the <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>for</b> subzero <b>diffusion</b> (transformation and thermal stresses) decreases, and this leads to the invariable state of strength coefficient (Amini et al. 2012).|$|R

40|$|As a {{guide for}} {{adhesion}} development between two miscible polymers, interdiffusion of these polymers was studied using external reflection and attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. Using gold substrates coated with a double layer of PMMA and PVC, and s-polarized infrared light, PMMA features in the external reflection spectra increase upon annealing at 150 °C {{as a result of}} PMMA diffusion away from the gold substrate into regions with a higher electric field intensity. Interdiffusion can also be followed with an external reflection set-up using glass substrates and p-polarized infrared light. Interdiffusion of PVC and PMMA, free or grafted on a glass slide, was observed. Increasing the molecular weight of the PMMA slows down the interdiffusion rate, which might be a consequence of a reduction in the thermodynamic <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>for</b> <b>diffusion</b> or the molecular weight of PMMA. External reflection spectroscopy as well as attenuated total reflection experiments show that interdiffusion of PVC and PMMA grafted on a silicon slide was much slower than that of free PMMA of similar molecular weight. ...|$|E

The microstructure which is continuously evolving {{is known to}} have a strong influence on damage initiation and propagation. In order to make accurate lifetime predictions by numerical simulations, it is therefore necessary to take the microstructural evolution into account. In this work, this is accomplished by using a diffuse interface model based on a strongly nonlocal variable. It can be seen {{as an extension of the}} Cahn-Hilliard model, which is weakly nonlocal since it depends on higher-order gradients which are by definition confined to the infinitesimal neighborhood of the considered material point. Next to introducing a truly nonlocal measure in the free energy, this nonlocal formulation has the advantage that it is numerically more efficient. Additionally, the model is extended to include elastically stored energy as a <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>for</b> <b>diffusion,</b> after which the entire system is solved using the finite element approach.

This model assumes the chemical potential gradient as the <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>for</b> <b>diffusion</b> so that the concentration dependency of the surface diffusivity can be accounted for. The adsorbed species diffuse in both particle and microparticle (grain) coordinates.

The multicomponent adsorption equilibrium is calculated using the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) and a single-component isotherm equation. To validate the model, experiments on equilibria as well as dynamics are carried out. Single-component adsorption equilibrium data are obtained by using a volumetric measurement rig. The dynamic responses of single and binary systems are collected via a differential adsorption bed, with ethane, propane and n-butane as adsorbates.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the synthesis of oxide thin films {{have led to the}} discovery of novel functionalities that are not accessible in bulk structures. However, their physical properties are vulnerable to the presence of crystal defects, which can give rise to structural, chemical, and electronic modifications. These issues are central to optimizing the opportunities to create freestanding oxide films using the recently developed buffer layer Sr 3 Al 2 O 6, which is soluble in room temperature water. To evaluate the general possibility to create atomic scale freestanding oxide heterostructures, it is critical to understand the formation, structure, and role of defects as this buffer layer is employed. Here, using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy in combination with electron energy loss spectroscopy, we reveal cation segregation and diffusion along crystal defects that form during growth of an oxide multilayer structure on the Sr 3 Al 2 O 6 buffer layer. We demonstrate that mass transport of film material can occur either through open dislocation core channels or site-specifically in the crystal lattice, causing local variations in stoichiometry.

The effects of these various cation dopants have been correlated with dopant ion segregation to the a-A 1203 grain boundaries using ana-lytical electron microscopy. Elements such as Mn and V showed little effect on the oxide scale microstructure and were not observed to segregate. Elements such as Y, Nd, and Gd were found to have a positive effect on oxidation performance and segregated to scale grain boundaries, resulting in finei more columnar a-A 1203 grains. However, Ti, Ta, Ca, and Nb also were found to segregate but had less of an effect on oxidation behavior.
