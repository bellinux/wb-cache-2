In the fall of 1856, he enrolled at Columbian College in the District of Columbia as a freshman, even though he was only 14 years old.|$|E
500|$|The {{requirement}} that the action be dangerous was confirmed in R v Newbury, which applied the previous reasoning on R v Church: [...] "the unlawful act must be such that all sober and reasonable people would inevitably recognise it as an act which must subject the other person to at least the risk of some harm resulting therefrom albeit not serious harm". This is an (almost completely) objective test, it disregards whether the defendant in particular foresaw the danger, and requires only that it would create a risk of some harm. The ordinary person knows only what the defendant did, at least {{in relation to the}} susceptibility of the victim. R v Ball did, however, create a class of dangerous [...] that of the act itself [...] where the jury <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the defendant; in this case, whilst the defendant knew he was loading a blank cartridge, the jury was entitled to ascribe knowledge that it might be a live cartridge to the reasonable man. This has been criticised, and may not have been necessary. The act need not be directed at the victim: the killing of an innocent bystander by mistake could be manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{his career}} Monteux {{suffered}} from being {{thought of as}} a specialist in French music. The music that meant most to him was that of German composers, particularly Brahms, but this was often overlooked by concert promoters and recording companies. Of the four Brahms symphonies, he was invited by the recording companies to record only one, the Second. Recordings of his live performances of the First and Third have been released on CD, but the discography in Canarina's biography lists no recording, live or from the studio, of the Fourth. The critic William Mann, along with many others, regarded him as a [...] "supremely authoritative" [...] conductor of Brahms, though Cardus disagreed: [...] "In German music Monteux, naturally enough, missed harmonic weight and the right heavily lunged tempo. His rhythm, for example, was a little too pointed for, say, Brahms or Schumann." [...] Gramophones reviewer Jonathan Swain contends that no conductor <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Monteux about expressive possibilities in the strings, claiming that [...] "the conductor who doesn't play a stringed instrument simply doesn't know how to get the different sounds; and the bow has such importance in string playing that there are maybe 50 different ways of producing the same note"; In his 2003 biography, John Canarina lists nineteen [...] "significant world premieres" [...] conducted by Monteux. In addition to Petrushka and The Rite of Spring is a further Stravinsky work, The Nightingale. Monteux's other premieres for Diaghilev included Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé and Debussy's Jeux. In the concert hall he premiered works by, among others, Milhaud, Poulenc and Prokofiev. In a letter of April 1914 Stravinsky wrote [...] "everyone can appreciate your zeal and your probity in regard to the contemporary works of various tendencies that you have had occasion to defend." ...|$|E

Churchill referred to the Bletchley staff as [...] "the geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled". That said, occasional mentions of the work performed at Bletchley Park slipped the censor's net and appeared in print.|$|E

Europe is not [...] "retrying" [...] Sacco and Vanzetti or anything of the sort. It is saying what it thinks of Judge Thayer. Executing political opponents as political opponents after the fashion of Mussolini and Moscow we can understand, or bandits as bandits; but this business of trying and executing murderers as Reds, or Reds as murderers, seems to be a new and very frightening line for the courts of a State in the most powerful and civilized Union on earth to pursue.|$|E
2500|$|Beth Twitty alleged in {{televised}} {{interviews that}} Joran van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> they told, {{and that at}} least one of them sexually assaulted or raped her daughter. Holloway stated that she received copies of police statements stating that van der Sloot admitted having sex with Natalee at his home and described intimate details of her. She has never released copies of the alleged statement, though she characterizes them as admissions of [...] "sexual assault" [...] However, Vinda de Sousa, former Holloway/Twitty family attorney from Aruba understood that the admission may have been for consensual sex. In addition, former Aruban deputy police commissioner Gerold G. Dompig denied that any such statement was made, stating that Van der Sloot and the Kalpoe brothers consistently denied having sex with Natalee.|$|E

He took part in Mingus' big band recording Pre-Bird, and is featured on [...] "Bemoanable Lady". Later he joined Mingus' working band which also included Dannie Richmond and Ted Curson. They worked at the Showplace during 1960 and recorded two early albums together, Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus and Mingus at Antibes (the latter adding Booker Ervin on all tracks except [...] "What Love?" [...] and Bud Powell for [...] "I'll Remember April"). Dolphy, Mingus said, [...] "was a complete musician. He could fit anywhere. He was a fine lead alto in a big band. He could make it in a classical group. And, of course, he was entirely his own man when he soloed.... He had mastered jazz. And he had mastered all the instruments he played. In fact, he <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{was supposed to be}} possible to do on them." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{was seen}} as a great natural talent with a fantastic mezzo-soprano, but she had an easygoing {{character}} which made her indolent and uninterested in developing herself. [...] As her natural ability made many things simple for her, she never bothered to read notes—instead, she asked someone from the orchestra to sing and play her the part, and after hearing it, regardless of what instrument was used, she was able to sing it without much effort. The quality of her performance was said to have been dependent upon whether she liked a part or not, and she was described as bad and screamy in parts she did not care for, mediocre in parts she was indifferent to, and fabulous in parts she liked. [...] "If she pleased to adjust herself to the situation - and she could, when she wanted to - then this voice was irresistibly enchanting, intoxicating. The poetry of voice was something no singer <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> she". [...] She was called the [...] "Malibran of Sweden", as Orvar Odd wrote: [...] "A Malibran without learning but what voice, oh, thou nightingales!" ...|$|E
