The abutment pressure is big <b>and</b> <b>roadway</b> deformation is severe due to driving roadway along goaf with short pillar remained. In view of these problems, taking WuTongZhuang No. 182309 mining face as project background, {{the law of}} the abutment stress distribution was analyzed by use of numerical simulation software FLAC 3 D and field measurement study. The results showed that the influence scope of the lead abutment pressure was about 55 m, the peak value was about 6 m ahead of the mining <b>face</b> <b>and</b> the stress concentration factor is 3. 3. Based on the above study results, a scheme of advanced support was proposed which effectively controlled the <b>roadway</b> deformation <b>and</b> ensured the safety production of the mining face.

This has obviously a benefit on firedamp drainage efficiency, but also on the choice of nitrogen injection points and flowrates in case of spontaneous combustion in the goaf. The use of a CFD code, PHOENICS, has allowed Simulation of circulation of three gases : air, CH 4, and N 2.

40|$|Barapukuria {{coal mine}} (BCM) {{is located at}} Dinajpur district, NW Bangladesh. Total area is about 6. 68 km 2 and coal was {{encountered}} at a depth ranging between 118 and 509 m. Six major coal seams (seam I to seam VI) were identified at BCM, of which, thickest one is the seam-VI (~ 36 m). The estimated coal reserves is about 390 million tons and of this, nearly 64 million tons of coal is extractable. The annual production of coal is about 1 million ton. In this study several parameters were used to explore minimization of accidents and improvement of coal production in BCM. Considering the geological, hydrological and other technical parameters, longwall mining method is applied for extraction of coal. Longwall retreating mining method is also applied for extraction of coal from single face with the operational area protected by self-advancing hydraulic powered roof support (HPRS) system. These supports are moved forward causing the roof behind them to form an extensive abandoned area named goaf, which may lead to collapse with air blast. Coal in BCM is extracted from seam VI, using a multislice Longwall top coal caving method. Average ventilated air composition is ~ 20. 94 % oxygen, ~ 79. 00 % nitrogen, ~ 0. 04 % carbon monoxide, and minor water steam with huge dust. Production of coal was completed from 12 Longwall faces of 1 st slice from seam VI. During production period several accidents and troubles within BCM have occurred. Poisonous gases such as carbon monoxide were detected during/after development of 1110 Longwall face, which increases up to 6000 ppm, therefore, sealed-off the face with mining equipments. During the development of belt gate roadway of 1101 Longwall <b>face,</b> maximum temperature <b>and</b> humidity increases up to 37 oC and 100 %, respectively. Miners of BCM experienced some difficulties to work in that adverse environment. Air return roadway temperature was always 40 to 41 oC in 1101 Longwall face during production period, faces temperature 46 oC, water flow 600 m 3 /hr and humidity 100 %. Due to roof-fall, toxic gas and very high temperature and humidity in the <b>face</b> 1105 <b>and</b> 1108, some miners were highly injured and died. Therefore, taking necessary safety and risk measures during development of <b>face</b> <b>and</b> <b>roadway</b> in BCM, production will be sustained by controlling roof-fall. Strata pressure of every faces is monitor regularly through electromagnetic emission detector as well as changing sufficient ventilation system, accidents of BCM could be controlled. Adding earth filling materials (e. g. sand, silt etc.) in to the vacuum goaf area, air blast accident should be reduced and surface subsidence would also be controlled. Considering all the problems of 1 st slice and initiating extra caution for face development accident in BCM may reduce in 2 nd slice and overall production may be increased significantly...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: This study {{covers the}} design of ground facilities, or metroports, for a future form of short haul {{intercity}} air transportation, the VTOL Airbus system as described by previous M. I. T. Flight Transportation Laboratory reports. This system will use VTOL aircraft, such as compound helicopters or tilt wings, which will operate from metroports sited throughout a metropolitan region, and will provide frequent service between the regions which make up an urban corridor, or megalopolis. The metroports are conceived as relatively compact installations placed in city center areas <b>and</b> at major <b>roadway</b> <b>junctions</b> throughout the surrounding suburban region. By providing shorter access and egress times for short haul passengers, and by avoiding airport taxi times and delays due to congestion, the Airbus service will offer substantially improved megalopolitan travel times at total costs {{comparable to those of}} the present air system. The service will be all weather, night and day, using its own airspace at the metroports, and a segregated airspace when the metroport is co-located with an airport. The trip lengths will vary between 30 - 300 miles, which would include travel generated by business commuters in the corridor region, and the travel arising from collecting and distributing the long haul air passenger to and from the major airports in the corridor. Previous systems engineering studies discovered that the ground facilities for such a VTOL system are easily the most important component. The usual predominance of the design and operation of the air vehicle did not hold for this new system, since the ground operations costs were projected to be much higher, and at least twice as much investment was expected to be required for new ground facilities as for new vehicles. Additionally, the time savings offered by the system were far more sensitive to the number and distribution of metroports than to vehicle speed.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{based on}} field {{observations}} and theoretical analysis, {{we discussed the}} ground pressure behavior law and its characteristic at fully-mechanized <b>face</b> <b>and</b> the material <b>roadway</b> of 10 # seam in Fenxi-Shuguang coal mine. The analysis results indicates that ground pressure at material roadway increased sharply when the working face advanced to place 40 â¼ 50 m away from it, and as the advance of the working face, the deformation of the two-sides is clearly bigger than that at the roof and floor in material roadway; Therefore, support in material roadway should be strengthened to ensure the safe mining of working face. We use the ZDYJ-IIA type computer-round figure apparatus to observe the ground pressure of the fully-mechanized face, which can help us analyze {{the relation of the}} fully-mechanized mining technique with ground pressure as the advance of the working face, as well as obtain the ground pressure behavior law of fully-mechanized <b>face</b> <b>and</b> calculate pace length of the periodical roof pressure. Analysis on the real-time monitoring results of the setting load and the work resistance show that the hydraulic powered supports used at the working face can fulfill the needs of the working face pressure. Finally, we can obtain the conclusion that the method of the ground pressure observation is scientific and feasible, which includes the real-time monitoring on the fully-mechanized <b>face</b> <b>and</b> placing the observation stations in the material roadway to observe the deformation of material roadway...|$|R
