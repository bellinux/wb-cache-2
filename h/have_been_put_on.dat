5|$|In 2007, {{plans for}} {{expansion}} of Turf Moor were {{released to the}} public. The Burnley directors proposed a major development of the stadium, costing £20 million. The plans, which would incorporate the rebuilding of the Cricket Field Stand and the moving of the players' entrance tunnel, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold until the current financial climate improves. In 2009, following Burnley's promotion to the Premier League, {{the development of a}} second tier on the Bob Lord stand was announced. Director Paul Fletcher stated that the anticipated capacity of Turf Moor would eventually be 28,000 to cope with extra fans. However following the club's relegation from the Premier League in 2010, these plans were put on hold indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Early in October 1835, Yagan's {{head and}} the {{panoramic}} view were returned to Dale, then living in Liverpool. On 12 October he presented them to the Liverpool Royal Institution, where the head may have been displayed in a case along with some other preserved heads and wax models illustrating cranial anatomy. In 1894 the Institution's collections were dispersed, and Yagan's head was lent to the Liverpool Museum; it is thought not to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> display there. By the 1960s Yagan's head was badly deteriorated. In April 1964 the museum decided to dispose of it. It arranged burial of the head on 10 April 1964, together with a Peruvian mummy and a Māori head. They were buried in Everton Cemetery's General Section 16, grave number 296. In later years a number of burials were made around the grave. For example, in 1968 a local hospital buried directly over the box, 20 stillborn babies and two infants who died soon after birth.|$|E

25|$|Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls {{collection}} {{held by the}} Jordanian government {{prior to}} 1967 was stored in Amman {{rather than at the}} Palestine Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem. As a consequence, that part of the collection remained in Jordanian hands under their Department of Antiquities. In 2013 parts of this collection <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> display at The Jordan Museum in Amman, to which they were moved from the Jordan Archaeological Museum. Among the display items are artifacts from the Qumran site and the Copper Scroll.|$|E
25|$|Small {{portions}} of the Dead Sea Scrolls collections <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> temporary display in exhibitions at museums and public venues around the world. The majority of these exhibitions took place in 1965 in the United States and the United Kingdom and from 1993 to 2011 in locations around the world. Many of the exhibitions were co-sponsored by either the Jordanian government (pre-1967) or the Israeli government (post-1967). Exhibitions were discontinued after 1965 due to the Six-days War conflicts and have slowed down in post-2011 as the Israeli Antiquities Authority works to digitize the scrolls {{and place them in}} permanent cold storage.|$|E

25|$|Malaysia {{responded by}} {{deploying}} Malaysian troops, initially consisted of 219 army paratroopers and commandos. The soldiers {{were drawn from}} the 10th Brigade Paratroopers based in Camp Terendak, Malacca (Malaysia), and {{a unit of the}} army special force from Mersing Camp, Johor (Malaysia), headed by Col Ismeth Nayan Ismail. These formed part of the group of 275 military and 200 police personnel who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> alert for possible deployment.

These plans <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold by China and Thailand has changed its priority routes after its new administration was elected. It will involve the construction of 154 bridges, 76 tunnels, and 31 train stations. They had ground breaking at end December, 2015. The maximum speed will be about 170 kph.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the Osirian {{statues of}} Hatshepsut—as with other pharaohs—depict the dead pharaoh as Osiris, {{with the body}} and regalia of that deity. All of the statues of Hatshepsut at her tomb follow that tradition. The promise of resurrection after death was a tenet of the cult of Osiris. Since many statues of Hatshepsut {{depicted}} in this fashion <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> display in museums and those images have been widely published, viewers who lack {{an understanding of the}} religious significance of these depictions have been misled. Aside from the face depicting Hatshepsut, these statues closely resemble those of other kings as Osiris, following religious traditions.|$|E

25|$|In May 2008, Woerts {{announced}} further details: {{the club}} is aiming for a stadium with a capacity of around 100,000 seats. If possible, a capacity of over 130,000 should be realized according to Woerts, which would earn the title of biggest stadium in Europe. The club emphasized its efforts {{to make it a}} true football stadium with seats close to the pitch. The stadium will get a retractable roof so that other events can be held as well. According to plans in those days, the stadium should be ready in 2016. Due to financial difficulties for all parties involved {{and the fact that the}} Netherlands were chosen to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the plans for a new stadium <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold. A new stadium will most likely be built in the future, though it will likely not have a spectator capacity greater than 70,000.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Uchikoshi, the development team includes character designers Kinu Nishimura and Rui Tomono, and music composer Shinji Hosoe. The series was originally conceived when Chunsoft wanted Uchikoshi to write visual novels for a wider audience; {{he came up}} with the idea of combining the story with story-integrated puzzles. While Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors was initially planned as a stand-alone title, its success in North America led to the development of two sequels, intended to be paired as a set; however, as both Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and Virtue's Last Reward were commercial failures in Japan, the third game was announced to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold in 2014. In 2015, development for Zero Time Dilemma was announced to have been resumed, due to fan demand and the hiatus becoming big news. Critics have been positive to the series, praising its narrative for being experimental and for pushing boundaries for what video game narrative can be.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, {{there has}} been a greater {{awareness}} among Dublin's planners of the need to preserve Dublin's architectural heritage. Preservation orders <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> most of Dublin's Georgian neighbourhoods. The new awareness was also reflected in the development of Temple Bar, the last surviving part of Dublin that contained its original medieval street plan. In the 1970s, Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), the state transport company, bought up many of the buildings in this area, with a view to building a large modern central bus station on the site with a shopping centre attached. However, most of the buildings had been rented by artists, producing a sudden and unexpected appearance of a 'cultural quarter' that earned comparisons with Paris's Left Bank. The vibrancy of the Temple Bar area led to demands for its preservation. By the late 1980s, the bus station plans were abandoned and a master plan was put in place to maintain Temple Bar's position as Dublin's cultural heartland, with large-scale government support. That process has been a mixed success. While the medieval street plan has survived, rents have rocketed, forcing the artists elsewhere. They have been replaced by restaurants and bars which draw thousands of tourists but which has been criticised for over commercialisation and excessive alcohol consumption. Also, in the late 1980s the Grafton and Henry street areas were pedestrianised.|$|E
