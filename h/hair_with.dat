5|$|The killer murders another woman, {{disposing}} {{of the body}} in a post office's dead letter office. Investigating, Black finds a human <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> a message etched into it—"hair today, gone tomorrow"—which he takes as an indication that the murderer is lashing out at a world that he feels has treated him as insignificant. Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability.|$|E
5|$|Another Green Wing {{series of}} running jokes is about hair. One {{of the more}} notable was various cracks about Mac's untidy <b>hair,</b> <b>with</b> Sue lending him a hair tie and hair clips before he goes in for an interview. Another was the {{character}} Karen getting her hair trapped in a printer in the first episode. Mac was {{often referred to as}} a Ginger by the other characters. Guy's hair becomes gradually curlier as the series goes on and Rachel dyes her hair from blonde to brunette after the first series. Other recurring jokes include Boyce's practical jokes, the bizarre games played by the human resources staff and surgery scenes where Caroline, Guy and Mac mess around while performing operations.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} and micromorphology of the glandular trichomes and the chemical {{composition of the}} secreted essential oil of Perovskia atriplicifolia Benth. were studied. The leaves present numerous glandular trichomes of three morphological distinct types, all of them having a unicellular foot and stalk: 1) capitate <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> bi-cellular head, 2) peltate <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> tetra-cellular head and 3) peltate <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> multicellular (10 -celullar) head. Qualitative and quantitative GC-MS analyses of the essential oils revealed limonene (18 %), γ – terpinene (16 %), β - caryophyllene (13 %), α - caryophyllene (12 %) and cymene (11 %) as the main constituents...|$|R

5|$|Little {{more than}} a year after her birth, Maria Theresa was joined by a sister, Maria Anna, and another one, named Maria Amalia, was born in 1724. The portraits of the {{imperial}} family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna. The Prussian ambassador noted that she had large blue eyes, fair <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> a slight tinge of red, a wide mouth and a notably strong body. Unlike many other members of the House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents nor her grandparents were closely related to each other.|$|E
5|$|The nude {{female figure}} is realistically sculpted in high-relief. Her eyes, beneath distinct, joined eyebrows, are hollow, presumably to accept some {{inlaying}} material– a feature common in stone, alabaster, and bronze sculptures of the time, but {{not seen in}} other Mesopotamian clay sculptures. Her full lips are slightly upturned at the corners. She is adorned with a four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk. Her head is framed by two braids of <b>hair,</b> <b>with</b> the bulk of {{her hair in a}} bun in the back and two wedge-shaped braids extending onto her breasts.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} of Eskayan in the volunteer schools {{is one of}} the few remaining cultural practices of the Eskaya community. Formerly, Eskaya men would wear shirts made of piña raffia with a Chinese-style collar, black breeches, and cotton berets. Women wore piña dresses with bulging sleeves similar to the Spanish-influenced Boholano style (mostly in Biabas) and covered their <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> cotton habits (mostly in Taytay). Traditionally, women were not permitted to cut their hair short nor wear trousers, and drinking and dancing were universally prohibited. For the most part these customs have been discontinued, however traditional dress is sometimes worn on Sundays and special occasions.|$|E
50|$|In juveniles, {{the last}} shell whorl {{displays}} a distinct carina, {{and the shell}} contains grooves with 20 striae/mm between each groove. Juveniles also have a detailed pattern on their periostracum consisting of 2 apical and 3 body whorl rows of <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> long hooks on the ends, distinct ridges and many other <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> short hooks.|$|R
50|$|Mature {{individuals}} have brown carapaces <b>with</b> short golden <b>hairs</b> (setae) <b>with</b> a slight purple sheen. Females have abdomens with long greyish brown {{hairs on the}} front of the upper (dorsal) surface and the sides; males have these longer hairs evenly distributed. Both sexes have legs and palps <b>with</b> short brown <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> a pink sheen and long brown <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> darker bases and a whitish apex. The femora, tibiae and metatarsi of the legs have vivid yellow rings on the ends furthest from the body.|$|R

5|$|A louse's color {{varies from}} pale beige to dark gray; however, if feeding on blood, {{it may become}} {{considerably}} darker. Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are parthenogenetic, with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's egg is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond {{is very difficult to}} sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their eggs in parts of the body inaccessible to preening, such as the interior of feather shafts. Living louse eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead louse eggs are yellower. Lice are exopterygotes, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as nymphs. The young moult three times before reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.|$|E
5|$|As {{in falls}} one and two, Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo del Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo del Santo submit before Octagón saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise Octagón and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, a move that would have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin Octagón to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by Octagón being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo del Santo was actually able to kick out of the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja del Terror. At one point, both Hijo del Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his own on Barr in retaliation for what was done to Octagón. The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo del Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo del Santo and Guerrero still in the match. A minute or two later, Hijo del Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> a pair of scissors. This was followed by an AAA official shaving off the rest of their <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> electric clippers backstage.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{becoming}} {{friends with}} Lisa and Zara visit Abby Davies (Helen Noble) house with Steph promising to highlight Lisa's <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> blonde highlights. After Lisa's hair was {{revealed to be}} green, Zara and Abby accuse Steph of doing the hair wrong on purpose and make her leave the house claiming she was jealous of Lisa's good looks, Steph was devastated about losing her friends. An oblivious Steph did not realised that she is being stalked by serial killer, Toby Mills (Henry Luxemburg). It {{was part of a}} storyline that had been running in the background for while. He attacked her, and proceeds by stabbing her in the head and leaving her to die. Steph was then found unconscious and she woke up a week later in hospital where she was diagnosed with epilepsy. Steph {{was the only one of}} Toby's victim to survive an attack.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of {{three types of}} headed hairs has been studied: 1) <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> a unicellular stalk and a head divided vertically into two cells, 2) bottle-like hairs, 3) morel-like and two types of headless hairs: a) with a characteristic 2 - 3 -celled base, b) without the characteristic base in six representatives belonging to 4 sections of the genus Plantago L. The bottle-like and the morel-like hairs may have originated from the <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> a unicellular stalk and a head divided vertically into two cells. The Plantago sections characterized {{by the presence of}} the bottle-like and morel-like hairs are probably evolutionally younger than the sections characterized by the presence of <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> a unicellular stalk and a head divided vertically into two cells...|$|R

40|$|At Lamiaceae species the morphology, {{distribution}} {{and frequency of}} secretory hairs are used as taxonomic characters. At the most species from this family they {{are two types of}} secretory hairs: peltate and capitate, this types of hair can easily be distinguished after the number of cells of the secretory gland. For the investigation of secretory structures of Thymus vulgaris L. seedlings of different ages have been obtained. The secretory hairs from analyzed species present a basal cell, un unicellular stalk and based on numbers of cells ho form the gland, the hair can be: <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> an unicellular gland presents on all vegetative organs, <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> an bicellular gland presents only at the level of leafs primordium and <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> an pluricelullar glands presents on all vegetative organs...|$|R
5|$|Most mammals have agouti <b>hair,</b> <b>with</b> each {{individual}} hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to {{two different types}} of melanin pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single colour throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur. Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Ardhanarishvara {{originated}} in Kushan and Greek cultures simultaneously; the iconography {{evolved in the}} Kushan era (30–375 CE), but was perfected in the Gupta era (320-600 CE). A mid-first century Kushan era stela in the Mathura Museum has a half-male, half-female image, along with three other figures identified with Vishnu, Gaja Lakshmi and Kubera. The male half is ithyphallic or with an urdhvalinga and makes an abhaya mudra gesture; the female left half holds a mirror and has a rounded breast. This is the earliest representation of Ardhanarishvara, universally recognized. An early Kushan Ardhanarishvara head discovered at Rajghat is displayed at the Mathura Museum. The right male half has matted <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> a skull and crescent moon; the left female half has well-combed hair decorated with flowers and wears a patra-kundala (earring). The face has a common third eye. A terracotta seal discovered in Vaishali has half-man, half-woman features. Early Kushan images show Ardhanarishvara in a simple two-armed form, but later texts and sculptures depict a more complex iconography.|$|E

25|$|The {{practice}} of covering <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> wigs is debated among halakhic authorities. Many authorities, including Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, permitted it, and the Lubavitcher Rebbe actively encouraged it, while many other authorities, especially Sephardi rabbis, forbid it.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} the {{transition}} from traditional to contemporary. Kiki is shown to balance both of these qualities. For instance, Kiki observes the tradition of witches wearing black, but adorns her <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> a bright red bow. Kiki also engages in other traditional methods, such as baking with a wood-burning stove and flying her mother's old broom.|$|E

40|$|The hairs of one {{representative}} of the monotypic sectio Bauphula and of seven taxa of the section Arnoglossum were investigated. Unlike P. amplexicaulis (sectio Bauphula) the representatives of sectio Arnoglossum, {{were found to have}} headless hairs on the scape with cells overlapping in a characteristic manner. They had no <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> a unicellular stalk and head divided vertically into two cells, commonly occurring in the representatives of different sections of the genus Plantago: Polyneuron, Lamprosantha, Coronopus, Oreades, Leucopsyllium, Hymenopsyllium and Psyllium. Rahn's decision (1978) to transfer the sections Bauphula and Arnoglossum to the subgenus Psyllium seems incorrect. The representatives of the investigated sections, unlike the taxa of the sectio Psyllium, have no <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> multicellular stalks and unicellular heads, club-like hairs and iridoid-plantarenaloside, while they have morel-like <b>hairs,</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> overlapping cells and an iridoid-catalpol, lacking in the taxa of the subgenus Psyllium...|$|R

25|$|Albrecht Dürer was an {{apprentice}} under Wolgemut and learned {{the art of}} engraving {{from one of the}} most well known engravers of the time. Technically, the development of better printing presses in Nuremberg allowed for Dürer to include much more detail in his work, from depicting St. Michael’s <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> little curls to capturing the sails of two boats off in the distance. It also allowed for his work to be more easily distributed.|$|E
