5|$|Knox's {{death was}} barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was {{attended}} by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their letters that survive. Mary, Queen of Scots made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox's ideas more than Knox himself. He was a ruthless and successful revolutionary {{and it was this}} revolutionary philosophy that had a great impact on the English Puritans. Despite his strictness and <b>dogmatism,</b> he has also been described by partisans as contributing to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change.|$|E
5|$|St Petersburg {{academic}} psychiatrist professor Yuri Nuller {{notes that}} the concept of Snezhnevsky's school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors. The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders. It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia. Despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky's hypothesis has immediately acquired the status of dogma which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry. Snezhnevsky's concept, with its <b>dogmatism,</b> proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis. That carried a great danger: any deviation from a norm evaluated by a doctor could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia, with all ensuing consequences. It resulted in the broad opportunity for voluntary and involuntary abuses of psychiatry. But Snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock.|$|E

Psychology: The Briefer Course, was an 1892 abridgement {{designed as a}} less rigorous introduction to the field. These works criticized both the English associationist school and the Hegelianism of his day as competing <b>dogmatisms</b> of little explanatory value, and sought to re-conceive the human mind as inherently purposive and selective.|$|R
40|$|The Council of Europe’s 2008 White Paper on Intercultural Dialogue: ‘living {{together}} as equals in dignity’ {{points to the}} need for shared values upon which intercultural dialogue might rest. In order, however, to overcome the monologic separateness that threatens community, we must educate ourselves to recognize the dialogism of our humanity and to engage in deep encounters with others with a mature skepticism of all <b>dogmatisms,</b> including our own. In order to aid us in reaching the necessary insight, the author calls upon Bakhtin’s ideas of the dialogism of every utterance and of the unity and heteroglossia of language, Gadamer’s hermeneutical experience that shakes us loose from what we think we know, and Levinas’s description of that transcendent ideal of a dialogue beyond reciprocity. These perspectives break open our certainty that tribalism and individualism are fundamental, placing them instead as secondary phenomena that, though powerful, pronounce neither the initial nor the final word on our life together...|$|R

The presentation covered around these 5 themes which appear to librarians as ethical problems on {{the political and social}} scenarios where such reality expects that they assume their consequent responsibilities: 1) Social problems, 2) Lack of a social and political compromise, 3) causes of the lack of social and political compromise, 4) social and political challenges, 5) recommendations to librarians. It is noteworthy the remark that librarians should adopt ethical principles based on the reality, the materiality, and physical nature where libraries and users exist. They should embrace a critical, analitical, eskeptical and secular thought above all of their possible religious, mythological, or fantastical <b>dogmatisms</b> or of any other kind they may have as personal beliefs...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reflects}} on the Critical theory, stemming from the most important philosophical concepts and the modifications it has endured over time. Thereafter, we expose {{the contribution of the}} Critical theory to Nursing. This emphasizes on the contextual analysis of the phenomena and it is a self-critique to prevent <b>dogmatisms</b> and totalitarianisms. It postulates that in order to establish a truth, we must consider the historical conditions within which said truth emerges. Jürgen Habermas, with his Theory of Communicative Action, reorients the original postulates of the Critical theory, making it more coherent from the social point of view, through the Guiding Interests of Knowledge. Nursing professionals who follow the Critical theory highlight the need to improve the description of the construction of knowledge with an emancipating and liberating purpose, which permits Nursing to provide responses to approach reality through a global and dialectic vision and from a democratic position of knowledge, construct research from the social situational reality that is part of its daily experience; everything that can be unified as a "Philosophy of Nursing Care", which should be incorporated onto the professional formation of the discipline and onto the research area...|$|R

40|$|K. R. Popper, {{because of}} his standpoints on {{philosophy}} and methodology of science and also his attitudes on political thought, has gained a dignity in history of ideas of the twentieth century. Popper's significant contribution to philosophy of science is mainly concerned with the critique of "Inductionism" and defense of "Falsifiability "; and his significant contribution to political science is rooted in his defense of "Open Society". His emphasis is on "critical rationalism" in both methodology of science and political thought. Science and its method {{has been a great}} inspiration for his whole philosophy. But his perceptions on philosophy and methodology of science has been encountered some critics. If we accept that Popper's political philosophy has been created in his methodological frame work, then some of limitations of his methodology should be verified in order to reveal incompetences of his research program on "Open Society". This article claims that Popper's research program on his "Open Society" has been created in his methodological framework and suffers some defects and limitations. This article, with a critical view, illustrates some limitations of research program and <b>dogmatisms</b> of Popper's "Open Society". It seems that Popper's research program on "Open Society" is vulnerable when it is judged by "fundamental pluralism" criterion- the epistemological foundation of open society...|$|R
25|$|Sangharakshita {{was ordained}} in the Theravada school, {{but said he}} became disillusioned by what he felt was the <b>dogmatism,</b> formalism, and {{nationalism}} {{of many of the}} Theravadin bhikkhus he met and became increasingly influenced by Tibetan Buddhist teachers who had fled Tibet after the Chinese invasion in the 1950s. Two years after his meeting with Lama Govinda he began studying with the Gelug Lama, Dhardo Rinpoche. Sangharakshita also received initiations and teachings from teachers who included Jamyang Khyentse, Dudjom Rinpoche, as well as Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. It was Dhardo Rinpoche who was to give Sangharakshita Mayahana ordination. Later, Sangharakshita also studied with a Ch'an teacher, Yogi Chen (Chen Chien-Ming), along with another English monk, Bhikkhu Khantipalo. Together, the three men turned their ongoing seminar on Buddhist theory and practice into a book, Buddhist Meditation, Systematic and Practical.|$|E
25|$|It was the {{tendency}} of the philosophy of Cousin to outline things and to fill up the details in an artistic and imaginative interest. He was observational and generalizing rather than analytic and discriminating. His search into principles was not profound, and his power of rigorous consecutive development was limited. He left no distinctive permanent principle of philosophy, but he left very interesting psychological analyses, and several new, just, and true expositions of philosophical systems, especially that of Locke and the philosophers of Scotland. He was {{at the same time}} a man of impressive power, of rare and wide culture, and of lofty aim,--far above priestly conception and Philistine narrowness. He was familiar with the broad lines of most systems of philosophy. His eclecticism was proof of a reverential sympathy with the struggles of human thought to attain to certainty in the highest problems of speculation. It was a doctrine of comprehension and toleration, forming a marked and valuable contrast to the arrogance of absolutism, to the <b>dogmatism</b> of sensationalism, and to the doctrine of church authority, preached by the theological school of his day. His spirit saved the youth of France from these other influences. As an educational reformer and a man of learning, who greatly influenced others, Cousin stands out among the memorable Frenchmen of the 19th century.|$|E

40|$|In “Statistical Rules of Thumb, ” Gerald van Belle {{covers a}} wide range of topics, everything, it seems, except a {{definition}} of the phrase “rule of thumb. ” Wikipedia offers a useful definition (Wikipedia, 2009). “A rule of thumb is a principle with broad application that is not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable for every situation. It is an easily learned and easily applied procedure for approximately calculating or recalling some value, or for making some determination. ” The key words in the definition that you need to keep in mind are “not intended to be strictly accurate or reliable for every situation. ” No one ever got thrown in jail for ignoring a rule of thumb. So although this reviewer is sorely tempted to say “yes but ” to about half of the rules in this book, he will resist the temptation. Dr. van Belle, himself, often acknowledges these “yes buts ” in his book. This requires a careful balance. He avoids a rigid listing of statistical <b>dogmatisms</b> but doesn’t timidly offer all possible perspectives as if they carried equal weight. Dr. van Belle wrote these rules of thumb partly from his own experience but more from discussions with other statisticians and a review of the classic reference...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1950 s, Willlard Quine’s Two Dogmas of Empiricism offered a devastating {{critique}} of logical positivism {{and the effort}} to distinguish “science” from “metaphysics. ” Quine demonstrated that the positivists relied on dogmatic oversimplifications of both the world and human practices, and, in the end, suggested that our holistic natural experience cannot be reduced to purely logical explanations. In this piece, I argue that constitutional originalism—which, too, seeks to define a constitutional “science”—relies on similar <b>dogmatisms.</b> In particular, I contend that the “fixation thesis,” which claims that the constitutional judge’s first task is to fix the text’s semantic meaning at a particular historical moment, does not accurately describe the bulk of our current judicial practice. And, because semantic meaning arises predominantly from practice, the text’s semantic meaning does not depend upon an interpretive act of historical fixation. I also challenge the so-called “constraint principle,” which asserts that the text’s fixed semantic meaning should constrain judicial efforts to construct legal rules. I suggest that we should think of this principle as embodying a particular normative theory of adjudication—one that would radically reduce both the number and kind of interpretive tools we have developed through centuries of practical experience. Thus, in the end I side with Edmund Burke and the English conservatives, who caution against replacing the collected wisdom of lived experience with the supposed certainties of abstract theory...|$|R
40|$|This paper makes a {{beginning}} {{in developing a}} systematic Marxist reflection {{on the theme of}} death. The effort faces some stiff opposition: some of the leading Marxist figures alive today aver that they are interested in life, not death. In order to find some substantial reflections on death in the Marxist tradition, it is necessary to go back to Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno and Ernst Bloch. The paper deals, first, with the differences and overlaps between Horkheimer and Adorno. From there the author moves on to explore Bloch's various and uneven efforts at making death a central feature of Marxist philosophy. While finding Bloch's championing of the kernel or soul in Traces problematic, the author is more enamored with his argument against <b>dogmatisms</b> on the matter of death (neither dogmatic religious belief nor dogmatic materialist denial of the possibility of something after death), with his distinction between physical death and the ontological status of death, and with ten metaphors of gate and door, journey and unknown destination. Perhaps the most pointed treatment of all appears in a discussion between Bloch and Adorno called "something, missing. " While Bloch reiterates his better earlier arguments, Adorno suggests that the resistance to the possibility of overcoming death is resistance to utopia/socialism itself, for it is an attachment to the status quo. Indeed, utopia cannot be imagined without the elimination of death...|$|R

60|$|He {{got down}} from the Wingdam coach amid {{considerable}} local enthusiasm. Apart {{from the fact that}} it was well known that he was a rich San Francisco banker and capitalist, his brusque, sharp energy, his easy, sceptical familiarity and general contempt for and ignoring of everything but the practical and material, and, above all, his reputation for success, which seemed to make that success a wholesome business principal rather than good fortune, had already fascinated the passengers who had listened to his curt speech and half oracular axioms. They had forgiven <b>dogmatisms</b> voiced in such a hearty manner, and emphasised possibly with a slap on the back of the listener. He had already converted them to his broad materialism--less, perhaps, by his curt rhetoric than by the logic of his habitual business success, and the respectability that it commanded. It was easy to accept scepticism from a man who evidently had not suffered by it. Radicalism and democracy are much more fascinating to us when the apostle is in comfortable case and easy circumstances, than when he is clad in fustian, and consistently out of a situation.

30|$|Phenomenology as {{style or}} {{attitude}} (Merleau-Ponty 1965, p. 4) {{has always been}} concerned with the question whether methodizing the phenomenological approach complies with the fundamental phenomenological attitude. According to this fundamental stance, a scientific and objective quality is not only achieved through method but through an orientation towards the matter or phenomenon, aiming at reflexively-critically decoding the phenomenon, which is what shows itself in itself. The relation to the matter also entails a circularity of phenomenological research between matter and our own experience of the matter, between acts of interpretation and acts of deprivation of meaning, between activity and passivity. Such a stance {{is characterized by a}} focus on plurality and multidimensionality of meaning and experience and takes ambiguities, phenomena of deprivation, transgression and estrangement into account. Aligned with it is a general skepticism towards scientific <b>dogmatisms</b> and universalized methods, as they rather lead to a reduction, de-contextualization and logification of live-world meaning (Brinkmann et al. 2015) than to a pluralization of meaning. The following account of analytical steps is therefore an endeavor in rationalizing a circular research process infused with manifold reflective loops from an ex-post perspective and grouping the different steps so they can be retraced methodically. This paper does not claim to present a finalized method or the phenomenological method. Our method entails two phases. In the first phase (6.1), which involves five steps, experiences are collected, put into writing and are documented for video analysis. In the second phase (6.2), which involves six further steps, the collected experiences are analyzed with regard to phenomenological methodology and by using the transcription software Feldpartitur (Moritz 2010).|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} role of the idea of “God” in the {{systematic}} metaphysics of rationality found in Kant’s and Hegel’s work. It surveys some basic structural components of their views of theoretical and practical reason and argues for the centrality of certain theological commitments to their broader metaphysical positions. The connection between these theological commitments and a broader metaphysical program is instituted in theories of conceptual determination constitutive of both transcendental idealism and absolute idealism. The connection is found in Kant’s view of the limits of human knowledge and action; these are seen as problematic given the way such limits are supposedly at once both a priori restrictions and yet also incomprehensible. The obscurity of this view has made it a well-known target of attack from Hegelian quarters, and the thesis proceeds by defending certain components of this Kantian view, while making concessions to the Hegelian view that Kant’s retention of such a problematic perspective on unconditioned knowledge and moral perfection was a mistake. The first part of the work takes account of some general prejudices found in discourse about both philosophical theology and philosophical anthropology, and makes some remarks about the kind of metaphysical <b>dogmatisms</b> which should be discarded in these arenas. Part two involves an examination of certain metarepresentational structures in Kant’s philosophy and seeks to undermine some of them by appeals to Hegelian theses about rational, conceptual determination. This discussion is connected with Hegel’s reflections on religion. In the third part Kant’s principle of complete determination is examined; its connection with his theology and theory of judgment is discussed, and a Hegelian response to it is recommended. The overall conclusion is that Hegel’s theological views are connected with a more plausible thesis of the nature of normative constraint...|$|R

He was naturally much given to analogy; every train of thought in his mind set up induced parallel currents. He had likened himself to the Anglican church, to the whole Christian body, as, for example, in his imagined second conversation with the angel of God. But now he found himself associating himself with a still more far-reaching section of mankind. This excess of solicitude was traceable perhaps in nearly every one in all the past of mankind who had ever had the vision of God. An excessive solicitude to shield those others from one's own trials and hardships, to preserve the exact quality of the revelation, for example, had been the fruitful cause of crippling errors, spiritual tyrannies, <b>dogmatisms,</b> dissensions, and futilities.
