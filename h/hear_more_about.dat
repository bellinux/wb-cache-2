25|$|Of course, we may {{expect to}} <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> {{this part of}} the question; but even supposing Sir Morton Peto's apology to be true in point of fact, what a pitiful apology it is! He, an {{experienced}} man of business, and the regular financial adviser to the company, disclaims all responsibility for unjustifiable financial actions, if only the company's solicitors tell hint that it is all right. Surely it is not a legal question, but a moral question, whether it is permissible to concoct fictitious documents for the purpose of evading the provisions of an Act of Parliament.|$|E
2500|$|The {{months before}} the 1922 {{football}} season also brought change to athletic administration in the Big Ten Conference. [...] The member schools created a new position for a commissioner of athletics and appointed John L. Griffith to the post. [...] In August 1922, Yost, {{who was a member}} of the committee that chose Griffith, rejected suggestions that Griffith's appointment was an indication that there were compliance problems that needed to be corrected. [...] Rather, Yost described the appointment as a [...] "progressive move" [...] toward solving future problems. [...] Yost noted, [...] "At least ninety-five percent of the men are good, perhaps five percent are bad, yet we <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the five percent who go wrong than the much greater number who play the game on the square." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of 1921, Phan studied Socialism and the Soviet Union {{in the hope of}} gaining {{assistance}} from the Soviet Union or socialist groups. He translated a book called [...] "An Account of the Russian Revolution", by Fuse Katsuji into Chinese. He then went to Beijing to meet with Soviet representatives, Grigori Voitinsky and Lap. Lap said that the Soviet Union would educate, train and pay for, any Vietnamese students Phan wanted to send, provided they would engage in social revolution and teach socialism in Vietnam afterwards. Lap was keen to <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the political situation in Vietnam, since Phan was the first Vietnamese revolutionary to come into contact with them. Lap requested Phan write a book in English about the situation, but Phan was unable to do so as he spoke no English. Phan wrote of the Russians: [...] "One thing I cannot forget is how dignified, courteous, and sincere the Russians appeared to me. Their language and their expression was at times calm, at times vigorous." ...|$|E

5000|$|However, Coates had a {{profound}} dislike of writing film music and turned down their numerous requests. It was not until they told him that this was [...] "a film of national importance" [...] that he agreed. On <b>hearing</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> the film, {{he came to the}} conclusion that the piece he had just finished would be perfect overture. The march was performed for the film by The Associated British Studio Orchestra.|$|R

6000|$|... "You'll <b>hear</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> him {{in spite}} of yourself. I can't, no, I really can't resist the {{impression}} that he's a big man." [...] I was already mastering--to my shame perhaps be it said--just the tone my old friend least liked.|$|E

She also learns {{that he had never}} fooled around with girls, despite his free-spirited lifestyle. Her brother tells her that {{it would be the first}} time that Jayakrishnan had {{proposed}} to a woman. For the first time, Radha sees Jayakrishnan for the sincere person that he is. She begins to fall in love with him, and agrees to his marriage proposal. She meets Jayakrishan to express her feelings towards him, and apologizes for her brusque behavior in the past. However, Jayakrishnan has now begun to feel differently. He tells Radha that he does not regard himself as being the right person for her. When questioned by Radha for the reason behind his change of heart, he discloses everything that transpired between him and Clara. Radha is not offended by his behavior at all.
