5000|$|In April a {{pilot scheme}} was tested by a {{partnership}} {{consisting of the}} Centre for Sustainable Energy, Scottish and Southern Energy, and Sedgemoor, Taunton Deane and West Somerset local authorities. The [...] "Somerset West Hard to Treat" [...] pilot scheme was so successful {{it led to the}} creation of a much larger programme aimed at better understanding of the Green Deal and ECO. In a speech about the <b>ECO</b> <b>programme</b> Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: [...] "It is shameful that the UK still has so many families unable to heat their homes." [...] The government has now passed a legal obligation onto the energy companies to meet the full costs of implementing the ECO. DECC has stated that the emergence of a competitive Green Deal Provider market would be likely to lead to cost efficiencies, lowering the cost of delivering ECO.|$|R
50|$|After the {{introduction}} of FIT scheme passed through parliament by the Labour government on 1 April 2010, HomeSun planned to install 100,000 panels worth £1 billion over three years {{as part of their}} ‘free solar’ scheme. The new Conservative government’s introduction of financial caps on this scheme led to fears that the solar industry would suffer, however Daniel Green, CEO of HomeSun, maintained that the benefits of solar energy would still be felt by ordinary households.The HomeSun free solar panel installation scheme was highly commended by the Microgeneration UK Awards in 2011, (while the company’s partner Carillion Energy Services won the Commercial Innovation award for Project Bright, a privately financed end-to-end delivery model for installing solar PV).Now, HomeSun have received funding for free cavity insulation which comes from the utilities as part of their government-led <b>ECO</b> <b>programme.</b> HomeSun has been selected to install ECO measures and the funding they receive covers everything from surveys, access equipment, market-leading insulation products, and the guarantee. However, just like the solar subsidies, this government-led funding is due to be cut March 2014.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- It {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that environmental degradation is caused mainly by human anthropogenic activities. Indeed, injudicious exploitation towards natural resources has caused many negative externalities. Hence, cultural efforts are need- ed due to prevent further degree of degradation. According to the aforementioned goals, people behavior becomes a key factor of realizing sustainable environment. And this change of behavior can be achieved through education. As pertained to the im- portance of education in environmental conservation Toyota has contributed to to this good programme trough the programme called the Toyota Eco-Youth (TEY). This green programme is performed towards students of SMA Negeri 1 Depok. A research about environmental awareness then is needed to assess student’s motivation {{to participate in the}} Toyota <b>Eco</b> Youth <b>programme.</b> This research is considered as a quantitative research. Questionnaire was used to collect the data from all the responden. Samples are taken randomly in a proportional manner. The collected data were descriptively analyzed by using descriptive statistic. The result of this research shows that student of SMA Negeri 1 Depok is higly motivated in performing environmentally friendly action. This condition is a good physiological capital to realize chapaign to promote a good environmenta attitude towards the youth.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} contradictions of India s {{development}} trajectory by taking {{the case of the}} tribal population in the state of Kerala. The wide appreciation for the Kerala Model of development (characterised by significant achievements in social development, without corresponding economic development) within academic and policy circles, often neglects the impact of such a development trajectory on the marginalised populations of the state. Based on its performance during the past decade, Kerala has been assessed by the Govt. of India as the best performing state with respect to democratic decentralisation and panchayati raj. However, even the much celebrated decentralisation process in Kerala {{has not been able to}} deliver development benefits to the tribal population which was in most need of it. Has it ensured the participation of tribal communities in planning and vital decision making processes? Have they been empowered to do so? These are critical questions explored in this paper. The study area (Attapady Block in Palakkad district of Kerala) is afflicted by serious environmental degradation and resource depletion, as well as social inequities of a high order. The typical state response was to formulate and implement an externally assisted massive <b>eco</b> restoration <b>programme,</b> with a special emphasis on the tribal population. It was assumed by the state that the implementation of this special programme in conjunction with the decentralised planning process would ensure economic and social justice. While such a process has generated large-scale wage labour, it has not made any significant impact on access to critical resources, or to the process of political decisionmaking. Tribals continue to be at the margins, empowered to become beneficiaries, but not enlightened citizen...|$|R
40|$|MEd, Education Management, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2012 The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how effective School Management Teams were in the management of healthy school environments in the Gert Sibande District. This was a qualitative study which employed two data collection strategies: face to face interviews and photographs. A literature review on this study revealed vital aspects, that a healthy school environment: can directly improve children’s health and effective learning; the school is strategically positioned to reach large numbers of the population to teach them to understand the importance of investing in health. Literature indicated collaboration and synergy as essential aspects, and policies as cornerstones that underpin the health promotion initiatives. Selection of sites was purposefully done as three of the four schools in this study were part of the <b>Eco</b> Schools <b>programme.</b> The study revealed that there was disconnect between the SMTs and committees that were involved in health promotion: in coordinating plans; and monitoring and evaluating the implementation of programmes. This therefore, means that there was no support for the committees from the SMT. It was also found that there were committees that: did not have plans; did not sit for meetings and the reluctance of the SMT to address these challenges compounded the situation and contributed to some committees being dysfunctional. The failure of the SMT to guide and provide leadership in their engagement with community members who provided assistance in terms of basic needs to learners indicated a need for the development of a cadre of leaders that are capable of working beyond the borders of schools. In all the committees that were interviewed, the Environmental Committee came up to be more effective and organized than others in three schools. The health committee was lacking in the area of training especially in the prevention of communicable diseases. The study provided recommendations to assist the SMT in their endeavors to promote healthy environments in their schools. Master...|$|R
