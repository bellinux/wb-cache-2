5|$|Fungi are {{the sources}} of many types of {{medicinal}} drug including antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and statins. Major classes of antibiotics, the penicillins and the cephalosporins, are derived from substances produced by fungi. So also are the <b>immunosuppressant</b> macrolides, the cyclosporins.|$|E
5|$|Mitoxantrone is an <b>immunosuppressant</b> {{also used}} in cancer {{chemotherapy}} which was approved for MS in the year 2000; whereas natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that was initially approved in 2004.

30|$|Patients on {{corticosteroids}} (N[*]=[*] 4, 568), <b>immunosuppressants</b> (N[*]=[*] 5, 466), and biologics (N[*]=[*] 1, 694) {{formed the}} study population. Baseline PMPM inpatient admission rates were 0.029 for patients on corticosteroids, 0.044 for patients on <b>immunosuppressants,</b> and 0.045 for patients on biologics (p[*]<[*] 0.001 <b>immunosuppressants</b> or biologics versus corticosteroids); during treatment, PMPM inpatient admissions increased to 0.044 and 0.048 for patients taking corticosteroids and <b>immunosuppressants,</b> respectively, but decreased to 0.024 for patients taking biologics (p[*]<[*] 0.001 versus corticosteroids and p[*]=[*] 0.003 versus <b>immunosuppressants).</b> Baseline average PMPM costs for patients taking corticosteroids, <b>immunosuppressants,</b> and biologics were US$ 935, US$ 1, 738, and US$ 1, 439 (p[*]<[*] 0.001 between groups), while on-treatment PMPM costs excluding drug costs increased to US$ 1, 129 for patients taking corticosteroids but lowered to US$ 1, 592 for patients taking <b>immunosuppressants,</b> and US$ 918 for patients taking biologics (p[*]<[*] 0.001 versus corticosteroids or <b>immunosuppressants).</b>|$|R

50|$|Systemic disease-modifying {{treatment}} with <b>immunosuppressants</b> is often used. <b>Immunosuppressants</b> used in its treatment include azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, sirolimus, alefacept and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib.|$|R
5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an <b>immunosuppressant</b> during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E

40|$|Mono- or combine <b>immunosuppressants</b> are {{commonly}} used for psoriasis; however the side effect caused by potent systemic <b>immunosuppressants</b> frequently incurred; moreover the inflammation flares up shortly after <b>immunosuppressants</b> are discontinued. An alternative nonimmunosuppressive therapy was introduced to psoriasis subjects. A retrospective observational study consisted of 1583 psoriasis patients who were treated with Herose Psoria capsule 1440 [*]mg three times daily at two clinical centres, one in China, the other in Singapore, from 1 January 2000 to 1 January 2011. Psoriasis lesion evolution was photographed at monthly visit, and efficacy and safety were assessed using psoriasis area severity index PASI score grading, renal and liver function testing, and adverse event reporting and supplemented by information obtained during targeted telephone interviews. The effectiveness of Herose on psoriasis was inversely associated to prior <b>immunosuppressants</b> exposure (r = 0. 9154), significant improvements occurred in non-immunosuppressants subjects, and complete clearance was achieved in 8 months (87. 5 %, 14 of 16); the wavelike evolution of psoriatic lesion appeared in prior <b>immunosuppressants</b> subjects...|$|R
25|$|For {{systemic}} symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, myositis and neuropathy, biologic <b>immunosuppressant</b> {{drugs such}} as rituximab and belimumab that work via B-cell pathology are often used and have less toxic profiles than traditional immunosuppressive regimens.|$|E

A major contributor to tissue damage results from activation of regulated necroptosis, which could include contributions from both necroptosis and mitochondrial permeability transition. Treatment with the drug cyclosporine, which represses the mitochondrial permeability transition effector Cyclophilin D, improves tissue survival primarily by inhibiting necrotic cell death, rather than its additional function as an <b>immunosuppressant.</b>|$|E

40|$|Among our {{cases of}} liver {{transplantation}} (LTx), one OLT patient (Patient A) has not required immunosuppressive drugs {{for the last}} 5 years, following post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). This patient's serum interleukin- 2 levels were undetectable following withdrawal suppressive therapy among transplant recipients simply to investigate its natural course. In our series of 245 living donor reliable marker for allograft tolerance is available allowing safe termination of <b>immunosuppressants</b> at a stage following transplantation, similar recipients may avoid developing PTLD. Our objective is to investigate cytokines and proteins in the Transplant Immunology 17 (2007 of <b>immunosuppressants.</b> The same serum taken after discontinuing the <b>immunosuppressants</b> inhibited concanavalin A blast cultured cells and up-regulated the IL- 4 /IFN-γ gene expression ratio. These results suggested that other proteins were induced following withdrawal of <b>immunosuppressants.</b> Proteomic assay demonstrated 12 differentiated spots exclusive to this patient where <b>immunosuppressants</b> have been discontinued. Haptoglobin, found to have immunosuppressive activity in vitro, may {{play an important role}} in the maintenance of drug-free tolerance as a natural immunological suppressor after cessation of immunosuppression.

25|$|Initially, rapamycin was {{developed}} as an antifungal drug against Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans. Few years later its immunosuppressive properties were detected. Later studies {{led to the}} establishment of rapamycin as a major <b>immunosuppressant</b> against transplant rejection, along with cyclosporine A. By using rapamycin in combination with cyclosporin A, it enhanced the rejection prevention in renal transplantation. Therefore, it was possible to use lower doses of cyclosporine which minimized toxicity of the drug.|$|E

25|$|Transplantation {{medicine}} {{is one of}} the most challenging and complex areas of modern medicine. Some of the key areas for medical management are the problems of transplant rejection, during which the body has an immune response to the transplanted organ, possibly leading to transplant failure and the need to immediately remove the organ from the recipient. When possible, transplant rejection can be reduced through serotyping to determine the most appropriate donor-recipient match and through the use of <b>immunosuppressant</b> drugs.|$|E
