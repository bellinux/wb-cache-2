40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for evaluating how market participants' beliefs about foreign exchange target zones change as they learn about central bank intervention policy. In order to examine this behavior, we first generalize the standard target zone model to allow for <b>intra-marginal</b> <b>intervention.</b> <b>Intra-marginal</b> <b>intervention</b> implies that the position of market participants' beliefs about the target zone can be determined from their beliefs about the likelihood of intervention. As an application of this model, we estimate a probability of intervention model using daily exchange rates and market observations of central bank interventions following the Louvre Accord. Interestingly, even over this relatively stable Louvre Accord period, {{we find that the}} market's views of intervention target zones would have varied quite a bit over time. ...|$|E

Stochastic differential equations are combined with information related to the Colombian currency band to estimate competing models of the behaviour of the Colombian peso within the limits of the currency band. The resulting moments of the density function for the simulated returns describe adequately most of the characteristics of the sample returns data. The factor included to account for the <b>intra-marginal</b> <b>intervention</b> performed to drive the rate towards the Central Parity accounts only for 6. 5...|$|E

Official intraday data on Danish intervention transactions in the ERM II, the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Union, facilitates our analysis. We show that intervention purchases and sales both exert a significant influence on the exchange rate spread, but in opposite directions. Intervention purchases of the small currency, on average, narrow the spread while intervention sales of the small currency, on average, widen the spread. This is a novel finding that differs from those of existing studies that find intervention always widens the exchange rate spread and increases market uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|This work {{selectively}} {{reviews the}} literature on exchange rate target zones and their theoretical and empirical methodologies and examines whether {{they can be used}} to clarify to what extent this type of exchange rate regime could contribute to greater exchange rate stability. We discuss the main contributions of the first and second generations of exchange rate target zone models. In an attempt to reconcile the poor empirical performance of the Krugman (1991) model with the reality of exchange rate target zone regimes, this line of research integrates target zones with alternative underlying economic models, such as imperfect credibility, <b>intra-marginal</b> <b>interventions</b> and sticky price models. It was thus possible to understand the correlations observed between the exchange rate, its fundamentals determinants and the interest rate differential, and to explain the fact that the statistical distribution of the exchange rate is hump-shaped rather than U-shaped. This implies that the initial emphasis of target zone models on nonlinearities, “honeymoon effect”, “smooth pasting” and marginal interventions has vanished. Exchange rate target zones are better described as similar to managed floating regimes with <b>intra-marginal</b> <b>interventions,</b> with some marginal interventions when the exchange rate reaches the edges of the floating band. Exchange rate target zones, imperfect credibility, <b>intra-marginal</b> <b>interventions</b> realignments and sticky prices. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the paper are threefold: (1) to test target zone models using more e cient and direct econometric methodology than previous research, (2) to identify an implicit band, if it exists, from observed data and to test target zone models based on the estimated implicit band rather than the stated o cial band, and (3) to examine whether the exchange rate can be modeled as a managed oat system with a central parity that lacks a band.

40|$|We {{extend a}} target zone model {{to allow for}} {{occasional}} changes in the policy regime which change the stochastic process driving fundamentals. A scenario we have {{in mind is that}} macroeconomic policy alternates between relatively tight and loose regimes. A key implication of our analysis is that occurrences which have the appearance of speculative attacks on a currency may be associated with market perceptions of a policy regime switch having taken place. This applies both to a sudden weakening and strengthening of a currency. Our model provides an explanation, based on fundamentals, why large changes in the exchange rate might be associated with no discernible contemporaneous change in the fundamental. Therefore the model provides an explanation for this phenomenon that is an alternative to explanations based on self-fulfilling expectations. Compared with most other models of target zones, other than those relying on <b>intra-marginal</b> <b>intervention,</b> this model is better able to reproduce key features of empirical distributions of exchange rates within the band. The distribution generated by our model has more mass at the centre and less {{at the edges of the}} band than is the case for most other models. stochastic regime-switching, exchange rates, target zones.

40|$|Hong Kong¡¯s Linked Exchange Rate system (LERS) {{has been}} in {{operation}} for 25 years during which time many other fixed exchange rate systems have succumbed to shocks and/or speculative attacks. This fact alone suggests that the LERS is a robust system which enjoys a large measure of credibility in financial markets. This paper intends to investigate whether this is indeed the case, and whether {{it has been the}} case throughout its 25 -year history. In particular we will use the tools of modern finance to extract information from financial-asset prices about market expectations that are related to the credibility of the LERS. The main focus is on how market participants 'judged' the various changes made to the LERS, such as the 'seven technical measures' introduced in September 1998 and the 'three refinements' made in May 2005. These changes have been characterised as making the system less discretionary over time, and we hypothesise that they have also made it more credible as revealed in the prices of exchange rate-related asset prices. We also investigate the relationship between interest rates and exchange rates in the current system in light of modern models of target-zone exchange rate systems. We will examine whether the <b>intra-marginal</b> <b>intervention</b> in November 2007 changed the dynamic properties of the exchange rate as suggested by such models.

40|$|Europe {{increasingly}} strengthens its {{credentials as}} a stable currency zone and large trading block. The European Exchange Rates Systems forms an important building block of these developments. The European Currency Unit (ECU) constitutes {{the core of}} this system. This paper analyses the construction of the ECU and explains how compulsory and <b>intra-marginal</b> <b>interventions</b> as well as the convergence of national economic policies ensure the continued existence of a grid of fixed bilateral exchange rates amongst the member countries of the European Community. This system of exchange rate management appears to have substantially reduced intra-community exchange rate variability. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{stabilization policy}} {{in the presence of}} bands for the exchange rate. The bands are modelled in a probabilistic sense: monetary policy has to be such as to keep the probability, that the exchange rate stays within the bands, above a certain threshold. In contrast to other models of target zones, this formulation leads to a linear decision rule and implies sizeable <b>intra-marginal</b> <b>interventions,</b> which corresponds to the experience in the EMS. The extent to which short-run monetary policy is constraint by the bands depends on its own long-run components and on fiscal policy. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the well-known policy recommendations of tight fiscal and monetary policies to curb inflation in traditional stabilization programs, the disinflation attempt in Mexico relied on the exchange rate as a nominal anchor. The exchange rate regimen evolved from a publicly announced rate of devaluation of the peso to a fully-fledged exchange rate band. The gradual widening of the band and its asymmetric feature combined a considerable degree of certainty with {{a greater degree of}} flexibility. The paper analyses the role played by exchange rate policy in Mexico’s stabilization effort and its monetary policy implications. Special emphasis is given to <b>intra-marginal</b> <b>interventions</b> by the Central Bank. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{forthcoming}} EU enlargement {{raises a}} series of questions related to the new entrants’ entry to Exchange Rate Mechanism II and their subsequent adoption of the single currency. In this paper, the issue of how to determine the central parity for the acceding countries with which to enter ERM-II is tackled. This is followed by a discussion of the asymmetric nature of the fluctuation bands around the central parity that could be deemed as compatible with the Maastricht criterion on exchange rate stability, i. e. + 2. 25 %/- 15 % within the officially announced ± 15 % fluctuation margins. Then, practices of the European Monetary Institute/ECB and the European Commission are compared when assessing the criterion on exchange rate stability. With this as a background, hypothetical ERM-II is constructed for 4 acceding countries with flexible exchange rate regimes so as to assess ex post the sustainability of these countries’ participation in ERM-II. Based on this, given ex post exchange rate variability and the limited <b>intra-marginal</b> <b>intervention</b> facilities ERM-II participant countries have at their disposal, the defence of the asymmetric band appears a tricky task even though the + 2. 25 % limit on the weaker side of the band is rendered somewhat intangible by a 10 -day moving average rule used by the EMI/ECB and further flexibility is given to the system in that a depreciation of more than 2. 25 % is not automatically viewed as a non-fulfilment of the criterion on exchange rate stability...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a regime where several target zones coexist. Parities are defended by manipulating money supplies in participating countries. As a result, interventions aimed at one given exchange rate influence other exchange rates as well. Such ‘externalities’ are {{shown to have}} dramatic implications; shocks on each fundamental affect {{the whole range of}} exchange rates involved, <b>intra-marginal</b> <b>interventions</b> arise endogenously, and the exchange rate distribution does not exhibit the u-shaped pattern which is typical of traditional target zone models. Moreover, we compute the stationary distribution of exchange rates and fundamentals, and show that both are influenced by the ‘rules of the game’, i. e. currency used in interventions, sterilization procedures, etc. Central Bank Intervention; Key-currency Regimes; Target Zone...|$|R
