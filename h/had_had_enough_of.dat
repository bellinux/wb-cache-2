25|$|In 1451, Thüring von Aarburg sold Schenkenberg to Hans und Markwart von Baldegg. The new {{rulers and}} Brugg soon found {{themselves}} in conflict with one another over Brugg’s right to use the Bruggerberg. The Baldeggs, who had demonstratively aligned themselves with the Austrians, considered their territory on the northern bank of the Aare to be their personal property and took offense at the town’s claims upon it. By 1460, Bern <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> the constant harassment of its subject town and seized the dominion.|$|E
25|$|Although Richthofen {{had managed}} to prevent {{aircraft}} design from heading into mediocrity, and had kept them specialised for particular tasks, Udet still influenced {{the selection of the}} multi-purpose Messerschmitt Bf 110 and the Schnellbomber (fast bomber) designed Junkers Ju 88 by the end of 1936. With the Ju 88, he insisted it should have a dive bombing capability, although it was more suited to, and ideal for, the level bombing Schnellbomber concept. By the autumn, 1936, Richthofen decided he <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> working with Udet, whose ideas he thought were totally wrong. With an expanding Luftwaffe and a civil war starting in Spain, an opportunity came for a field command.|$|E
25|$|Until his death, Borel {{attended}} the lycée professionnel Georges-Cisson in Toulon, {{where he studied}} electromechanics and did quite well academically. He {{was said to be}} a disciplined and quiet student. However, in his last year at school there was a radical change in behavior. He skipped classes without permission or explanation and became unaffable. He regularly said that he could not bear it anymore at home, that he <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> doing housework and being called names, and often stated his wish to join the military, like his father and grandfather. Apparently, the week prior to the shooting, he also told one of his classmates that he would commit suicide, but not before killing two or three people.|$|E

25|$|Williams and Adams both {{departed}} {{at the end}} of the season, Williams {{because he}} <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> the programme after three seasons in charge, and Adams to concentrate on his increasingly successful Hitchhiker's franchise. Williams recommended to the Head of Series & Serials, Graeme MacDonald, that he be replaced by his Production Unit Manager, John Nathan-Turner. Although MacDonald agreed with the principle of appointing someone familiar with the workings of the show, he first offered the job to Nathan-Turner's predecessor George Gallaccio, who after leaving Doctor Who in 1977 had already gained experience as a producer on the BBC Scotland drama The Omega Factor. However, Gallaccio turned the role down, and MacDonald offered it instead to Nathan-Turner, who accepted, and became the new producer.|$|E
25|$|After an {{indifferent}} reception to his {{solo show}} in London, featuring mostly his nocturnes, Whistler abruptly decided he <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> London. He and Trixie moved to Paris in 1892 and resided at n° 110 Rue du Bac, Paris, with his studio {{at the top}} of 86 Rue Notre Dame des Champs in Montparnasse. He felt welcomed by Monet, Auguste Rodin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and by Stéphane Mallarmé, and he set himself up a large studio. He was {{at the top of}} his career when it was discovered that Trixie had cancer. They returned to London in February 1896, taking rooms at the Savoy Hotel while they sought medical treatment. He made drawings on lithographic transfer paper of the view of the River Thames, from the hotel window or balcony, as he sat with her. She died a few months later.|$|E

He went into downtown Tulsa, walked into a hardware store, and asked its owner to lend him $200 for the train trip to New York. The owner asked Gleason why he thought anyone would lend a stranger so much money. Gleason identified himself and explained his situation. The store owner said he would lend the money if the local theater had a photo of Gleason in his latest film. But the publicity shots showed only the principal stars. Gleason proposed to buy two tickets to the movie and take the store owner; {{he would be able}} to see the actor in action. The two men watched the movie for an hour before Gleason appeared on screen. The owner gave Gleason the loan, and he took the next train to New York. There he borrowed $200 to repay his benefactor.|$|E

500|$|The {{exact number}} of those killed and injured at Peterloo has never been {{established}} with certainty. Sources claim 11–15killed and 400–700injured. The Manchester Relief Committee, a body set up to provide relief {{for the victims of}} Peterloo, gave the number of injured as 420, while Radical sources listed 500. The true number is difficult to estimate, as many of the wounded hid their injuries for fear of retribution by the authorities. Three of William Marsh's six children worked in the factory belonging to Captain Hugh Birley of the Manchester Yeomanry, and lost their jobs because their father had attended the meeting. James Lees was admitted to Manchester Infirmary with two severe sabre wounds to the head, but was refused treatment and sent home after refusing to agree with the surgeon's insistence that [...] "he <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> Manchester meetings".|$|E

500|$|Friday {{was marked}} {{during the game}} by Mark Lawrenson, who so {{frustrated}} the Cardiff forward with his close attention that Friday waited for Lawrenson to attempt a slide tackle and then {{kicked him in the}} face. After receiving a red card, Friday left the ground with the game still going on; according to legend, before leaving he broke into the Brighton dressing room and defecated in Lawrenson's kit bag. Cardiff eventually lost 4–0. [...] "I am sick and tired of it", Andrews told the South Wales Echo on 1 November. [...] "To be sent off in his first game back is as much as a man can stand". Friday was transfer-listed and served a three-match suspension before making his final appearance on 10 December in Cardiff's 6–3 away defeat against Bolton. Liza was by now the mother of Friday's second daughter, Arabella, but around this time began divorce proceedings. Friday claimed that he <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> people telling him what to do, and walked into Andrews's office on 20 December 1977 to announce that he was retiring from professional football. The club promptly released him and cancelled his contract.|$|E
500|$|Bridget Louise [...] "Didge" [...] Parker is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Eloise Mignon. In 2007 {{the show was}} revamped to boost falling ratings in Australia. As part of this, the show's focus returned to family dynamics and the character of Bridget and her family were created and introduced. Bridget made her first on-screen appearance on 23 July 2007. She arrived in Erinsborough from Sydney with her father and mother, Steve and Miranda. During her time in Neighbours, Bridget's storylines included being run over by Susan Kennedy, {{falling in love with}} Declan Napier, finding her birth mother and falling pregnant at seventeen. In March 2009, the decision was taken to write the Parker family out of the show after both Mignon and Steve Bastoni quit. Mignon wanted to return to her studies and she <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> Neighbours. Bridget died on-screen on 21 July 2009 after suffering internal injuries, which she sustained in a car crash. The character was popular with viewers and her pregnancy storyline was voted the best of 2008 during a poll on the official website.|$|E

Bowes believes the season suffered from the [...] "sentimental boy-girl storyline", but that die-hard Superman fans would still be taken in by this incarnation of the character's early years. A common criticism for the first season {{was the use of}} [...] "villain of the week" [...] storylines. By the time the first seven episodes aired, at least one journalist <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> the villain of the week format. Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Rob Owen stated the series works best with its [...] "character interaction and a nice performance by John Schneider as Pa Kent", but that the show needs more than the [...] "'monster of the week' stories seen so far". Jordan Levin, president of The WB's Entertainment division, recognized the concerns that the show had become a villain of the week series. Levin announced that season two would see more [...] "smaller mini-arcs over three to four episodes, to get away from some of the formulaic storytelling structure" [...] the series has fallen into.|$|E

500|$|In February 1777, the Bound Brook outpost {{consisted}} of 1,000 men {{under the command}} of Major General Benjamin Lincoln, but this was reduced by expiring militia enlistments to 500 in mid-March. [...] The troops that remained were from the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment, a company from the 4th Continental Artillery, and two independent companies from the Wyoming Valley in what is now northeastern Pennsylvania, but was then also claimed by Connecticut as Westmoreland County. [...] Lincoln expressed concern over his exposed position to General Washington, noting that many units were {{not in a position to}} [...] "render the least assistance to this post in case it is attacked", and that he was keeping wagons ready in case a precipitate departure was needed. [...] Lieutenant General Lord Charles Cornwallis, in command of the British forces in New Jersey, <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> the ongoing petite guerre, and organized a reprisal action against the Bound Brook outpost. [...] According to the Hessian jäger Captain Johann Ewald, Cornwallis asked him to draft a plan of attack in February, but the plan could not be executed until springtime because it necessitated fording the Raritan. [...] On the night of April 12, the plan was put into action.|$|E
500|$|In 1677, a {{particularly}} brutal German General Kops leading {{the forces of}} Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I designed to keep Hungary dominated by the Germans, rather than to become dominated by the Turks, began impaling and quartering his Hungarian subjects/opponents. An opposing general for the Hungarians, , responded in kind, by flaying alive Imperial troops, and fixing sharp iron hooks in fortress walls, upon which he threw captured Germans to be impaled. Finally, Emperor Leopold I <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> the mutual bloodshed, and banished Kops {{in order to establish}} a needed cessation of hostilities. After the Treaty of The Hague (1720), Sicily fell under Habsburg rule, but the locals deeply resented the German overlords. One parish priest (who exhorted his parishioners to kill the Germans) is said to have broken into joy when a German soldier arrived at his village, exclaiming it was gone a whole eight days since last he killed a German, and shot the soldier off his horse. The priest was later impaled. [...] In the short-lived 1784 Horea Revolt against the Austrians and Hungarians, the rebels gained hold of two officers they promptly impaled. On their side, the imperial troops got hold of Horea's 13-year-old son, and impaled him. That seems to have merely inflamed the rebel leader's determination, although the revolt was quashed shortly afterwards.|$|E
