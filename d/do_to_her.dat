5|$|Jadzia confides in Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) {{that she}} feels obligated to pursue Curzon's oath, but Kira warns her about what killing someone will <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Kang, likewise, tells Jadzia {{that she is not}} bound by Curzon's oath, but she insists on joining their quest. Kor, as buoyant as ever, is delighted to have her along. Koloth is dismissive, until she shows him her skills with a Klingon bat'leth. Kang refuses to accept her, until she shames him with his own devotion to Klingon honor, and insists that she have the chance to avenge her godson. Before Jadzia can request a leave of absence, Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) confronts her in her quarters, refusing her request before she can make it. Jadzia tells him that she is going and begs him not to make her disobey a direct order. He does not give her {{permission}} to go but does not stop her either.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, the financially {{strapped}} author Pamela [...] "P. L." [...] Travers reluctantly travels {{from her home}} in London to Los Angeles to work with Walt Disney at the urging of her agent, Diarmuid Russell. Disney has pursued the film rights to her Mary Poppins stories for twenty years, having promised his daughters that he would produce a film based on them. Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney's efforts because she fears what he would <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> character. However, she has not written anything in a while and her book royalties have dwindled to nothing, so she risks losing her house. Still, Russell has to remind her that Disney has agreed to two major stipulations—no animation and unprecedented script approval—before she agrees to go.|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, a Daytime Emmy Awards [...] "final push" [...] by Canyon News {{suggested}} that Case's performance needed more Emmy attention. Soap Opera Digest praised Phyllis finding {{the evidence that}} freed Sharon from prison in 2011, writing: [...] "The twist that Phyl hijacked the glory from both Adam and estranged sister Avery was downright delicious—and made Sharon beholden her worst enemy. The cherry on top? Sharon giving Adam an overdue verbal beatdown. Justice has finally been served." [...] Case's performance in 2012, described as a [...] "whirlwind year", was met with critical acclaim due to writing by Bell (which, in turn, was criticized). On-Air On-Soaps commented, [...] "Surviving {{probably one of the}} worst on-screen character assassinations in soap opera history, which virtually left viewers wondering, what the heck are the writers doing to the integrity of Sharon Newman, the once befallen heroine of Genoa City?, Case rebounded by making her performances noteworthy, no matter what the creative teams decided to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> character." [...] This led Soap Opera Uncensored to name her Entertainer of the Year in January 2013. In December 2015, Soap Opera Digest praised her portrayal of the character's [...] "emotional roller coaster" [...] and remarked, [...] "Sharon Case has a knack for bringing emotional depth and reality to even the most outrageously soapy situations".|$|E

500|$|One of Nick's {{most notable}} {{returns to the}} series {{occurred}} in 1990. Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim {{that he was a}} born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her £1000 win on the bingo. EastEnders writer Sarah Phelps explained: [...] "For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick knew that. It was sort of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet." [...] With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his new-found faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. Discussing the storyline, scriptwriter Colin Brake has indicated that at first it was not clear to the audience whether Nick had reformed or not, but as the weeks passed it became obvious that he did intend to kill his mother, as he was shown practising a fake suicide note in Dot's handwriting– a foil to cover the intended murder; according to Brake, Dot remained blithely and perhaps purposefully ignorant to his wrongdoing. The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast consisting of Nick, Dot, Nick's estranged father Charlie, Dot's close friend Ethel Skinner and Alistair the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the [...] "one time we saw a glimmer of Nick’s good side", Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Micky {{takes the}} {{occasional}} {{phone call from}} an angry Rudi, now returning from a boxing match in Birmingham (where all his fighters lost). Paige gets increasingly fearful of what he will <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> when he returns, but Micky refuses {{to change his mind}} – not because he wishes this on her, but because he is doing his job. In spite of this, Paige rescues Micky when Arabella takes an interest in his boxing career, claiming he was brilliantly successful when in fact he was a dismal failure. After Arabella falls and breaks fourteen glasses, the evening starts to fall flat. Derek makes a few lame jokes that his family find hilarious, then attempts to start a couple of racist jokes. Undeterred, Julie-Ann insists on Justin's speech. Justin attempts to start with [...] "It's with great pleasure ..." [...] but keeps stalling on [...] "It's ...", and instead breaks into It's a Long Way to Tipperary.|$|E
