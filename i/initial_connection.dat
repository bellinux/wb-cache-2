5|$|Michael Lynch and Richard Oram portray David {{as having}} little <b>initial</b> <b>connection</b> {{with the culture}} and society of the Scots; but both {{likewise}} argue that David became increasingly re-Gaelicised in the later stages of his reign. Whatever the case, David's claim to be heir to the Scottish kingdom was doubtful. David {{was the youngest of}} eight sons of the fifth from last king. Two more recent kings had produced sons. William fitz Duncan, son of King Donnchad II, and Máel Coluim, son of the last king Alexander, both preceded David in terms of the slowly emerging principles of primogeniture. However, unlike David, neither William nor Máel Coluim had the support of Henry. So when Alexander died in 1124, the aristocracy of Scotland could either accept David as King, or face war with both David and Henry I.|$|E
5|$|Except for his juvenilia, {{little of}} which has survived, Mahler {{composed}} only in the media of song and symphony, with a close and complex interrelationship between the two. Donald Mitchell writes that this interaction is the backcloth against which all Mahler's music can be considered. The <b>initial</b> <b>connection</b> between song and symphony occurs with the song-cycle Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen and the First Symphony. Although this early evidence of cross-fertilisation is important, it is during Mahler's extended Wunderhorn phase, in which his Second, Third and Fourth Symphonies were written, that the song and symphony genres are consistently intermingled. Themes from the Wunderhorn song Das himmlische Leben ("The Heavenly Life"), composed in 1892, became {{a key element in}} the Third Symphony completed in 1896; the song itself forms the finale to the Fourth (1900) and its melody is central to the whole composition. For the Second Symphony, written between 1888 and 1894, Mahler worked simultaneously on the Wunderhorn song, Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt ("The Sermon of St Anthony of Padua to the Fishes"), and on the Scherzo based on it which became the symphony's third movement. Another Wunderhorn setting from 1892, Urlicht ("Primal Light"), is used as the Second Symphony's fourth (penultimate) movement.|$|E

He mentioned that holding the grip longer than two seconds will result in a stop in the verbal conversation, thus the nonverbal will override the verbal communication.|$|E

25|$|As {{with the}} <b>initial</b> <b>connection</b> between Three Bridges and East Grinstead, {{the impetus for}} an {{extension}} to Tunbridge Wells came from local landowners who, as early as 1855, had enquired as {{to the possibility of}} an extension east. The East Grinstead, Groombridge and Tunbridge Wells Railway Act (c.ccvii), passed on 7 August 1862, authorised this extension and a company of the same name oversaw the scheme. Just one year previously, the Brighton, Uckfield and Tunbridge Wells Railway Act (c.clxxiv) had been adopted, sanctioning an extension of the Wealden Line from its terminus at Uckfield to Tunbridge Wells. Construction works were already underway.|$|E

Both historians likewise argue that David became increasingly re-Gaelicized in the later stages of his reign. Other historians, such as R.

40|$|Asymptotic {{behavior}} of a recurrent neural network changes qualitatively at certain points in the parameter space, which are known as "bifurcation points". At bifurcation points, the output of a network can change discontinuously with the change of parameters and therefore convergence of gradient descent algorithms is not guaranteed. Furthermore, learning equations used for error gradient estimation can be unstable. However, some kinds of bifurcations are inevitable in training a recurrent network as an automaton or an oscillator. Some of the factors underlying successful training of recurrent networks are investigated, such as choice of <b>initial</b> <b>connections,</b> choice of input patterns, teacher forcing, and truncated learning equations. 1 Introduction Recurrent neural networks {{are expected to have}} versatile capabilities for modeling and controlling dynamical systems.
