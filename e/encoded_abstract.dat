40|$|Perhaps the {{simplest}} and most complete description of the cerebral cortex {{is that it is}} a sensorimotor controller whose primary purpose is to represent stimuli and movements, and adaptively control the mapping between them. However, in order to think, the cerebral cortex has to generate patterns of neuronal activity that <b>encode</b> <b>abstract,</b> generalized information independently of ongoing sensorimotor events. A critical question confronting cognitive systems neuroscience at present therefore is how neural signals <b>encoding</b> <b>abstract</b> information emerge within the sensorimotor control networks of the brain. In this review, we approach that question in the context of the neural representation of space in posterior parietal cortex of nonhuman primates. We describe evidence indicating that parietal cortex generates a hierarchy of spatial representations with three basic levels: including 1) sensorimotor signals that are tightly coupled to stimuli or movements, 2) sensorimotor signals modified in strength or timing to mediate cognition (examples include attention, working memory, and decision processing), as well as 3) signals that <b>encode</b> frankly <b>abstract</b> spatial information (such as spatial relationships or categories) generalizing across a wide diversity of specific stimulus conditions.

40|$|The {{ability to}} encode rules and to detect rule-violating events outside {{the focus of}} {{attention}} is vital for adaptive behavior. Our brain recordings reveal that violations of abstract auditory rules are processed even when the sounds are unattended. When subjects performed a task related to the sounds but not to the rule, rule violations impaired task performance and activated a network involving supratemporal, parietal and frontal areas although none of the subjects acquired explicit knowledge of the rule or became aware of rule violations. When subjects tried to behaviorally detect rule violations, the brain’s automatic violation detection facilitated intentional detection. This shows the brain’s capacity for abstraction – an important cognitive function necessary to model the world.

Monkeys performed a task in which stimulus-reinforcement contingencies varied between two sets of associations, each defining a context. Reinforcement prediction required identifying a stimulus and knowing the current context. Behavioral evidence indicated that monkeys utilized this information to perform inference and adjust their behavior. Neural representations in both amygdala and PFC reflected the linked sets of associations implicitly defining each context, a process requiring a level of abstraction characteristic of cognitive operations.  Surprisingly, when errors were made, the context signal weakened substantially in the amygdala.

A cognitive model is described that <b>encodes</b> <b>abstract</b> concepts with small sets of concrete, related concepts (directing), and that also decodes such signs (matching). Learning captures conventionalized signs. Relatedness of concepts is characterized by a mixture of shared and individual knowledge, which we sample from a text corpus. Simulations show vocabulary convergence of agent communities of varied structure, but idiosyncrasy in vocabularies of each dyad of models. Convergence is weakened when agents do not alternate between encoding and decoding, predicting the necessity of bi-directional communication. Convergence is improved by explicit feedback about communicative success. We hypothesize that humans seek out subtle clues to gauge success in order to guide their vocabulary acquisition...|$|R

All rats could learn this task reliably when it consisted of one kind of object stimulus (A). Since spatial locations of objects were changed trial by trial, a spatial position of the stimuli could not be an effective discriminative cue. Utilization of olfactory cue of food reinforcers also could be rejected because food rewards were set in the rear of all stimuli but rats could get it only when a correct response was made. When the stimulus type increased to three (A, B and C), three of the ve rats could learn this task reliably. In the transfer test, a novel object D was inserted as a probe test to the original training. On a probe trial, response to the second, third or fourth object were reinforced indifferentially.

It is generally believed that this transformation is performed along the auditory hierarchy, with low-level physical cues computed at early stages of the auditory system and high-level abstract qualities at high-order cortical areas. The functional position of primary auditory cortex (A 1) in this scheme is unclear – is it ‘early’, encoding physical cues, or is it ‘late’, already <b>encoding</b> <b>abstract</b> qualities? Here we argue that neurons in cat A 1 show sensitivity to high-level features of sounds. In particular, these neurons may already show sensitivity to ‘auditory objects’. The evidence for this claim comes from studies in which individual sounds are presented singly and in mixtures. Many neurons in cat A 1 respond to mixtures in the same way they respond to one of the individual components of the mixture, and in many cases neurons may respond to a low-level component of the mixture rather than to the acoustically dominant one, even though the same neurons respond to the acoustically-dominant component when presented alone...|$|R

The fundamental assumption is that nominals encode substance, be it concrete or abstract, and that verbals <b>encode</b> <b>abstract</b> substance with time. The theoretical backdrop is provided by Derek Bickerton's Roots of Language (1981) and "The Language Bioprogram Hypothesis" (1984) in which he proposes a set of conceptually fundamental distinctions. These distinctions: the state/process; the durative/punctual; the realis/irrealis; and the anterior/non-anterior; are discussed in relation to four dynamicity values of verbal nuclei: stative; processive; eventive; and telic. These are proposed by the present author, but draw on Bernard Comrie's aspectual analysis in Aspect (1976). Three different layers of analysis are put forward: (1) the nucleic, which consists of the verbal carrying the meaning core of a situation; (2) the verbal constituency, in which we find all TMA encoding, that is, the tense, mood and aspect of the situation; and (3) the (verbal) situation, which is conceived of as a superordinate, maximum unit of description.

40|$|The {{classical}} McCulloch and Pitts neural unit {{is widely}} used today in artificial neural networks (NNs) and essentially acts as a non-linear filter. Classical NN are only capable of approximating a mapping between inputs and outputs {{in the form of}} a lookup table or “black box” and the underlying abstract relationships between inputs and outputs remain hidden. Motivated by the need in the study on neural and neurofuzzy architectures, for a more general concept than that of the neural unit, or node, originally introduced by McCulloch and Pitts, we developed in our previous work the concept of the morphogenetic neural (MN) network. In this paper we show that in contrast to the classical NN, the MN network can <b>encode</b> <b>abstract,</b> symbolic expressions that characterize the mapping between inputs and outputs, and thus show the internal structure hidden in the data. Because of the more general nature of the MN, the MN networks are capable of abstraction, data reduction and discovering, often implicit, relationships. Uncertainty can be expressed by a combination of evidence theory, concepts of quantum mechanics and a morphogenetic neural network. With the proposed morphogenetic neural network it is possible to perform both rigorous and approximate computations (i. e. including semantic uncertainty).

Across three experiments, we habituated infants to sequences of four moving/sounding elements- three of the elements varied in their ordinal position whereas the position of one target element was invariant (e. g., ABCD, CBDA). We next tested whether infants detected {{a change in the}} target’s position. Results showed that infants detected an ordinal change only when it disrupted the statistical co-occurrence of elements but not when statistical information was controlled. We conclude that 4 -month-olds learn the order of sequence elements by tracking their statistical associations but not their invariant ordinal position.

From a developmental perspective, sequences are particularly important because they provide infants with ready-made information regarding the structured nature of their world.

40|$|Background: Extraction of linguistically {{relevant}} auditory features {{is critical}} for speech comprehension in complex auditory environments, in which the relationships between acoustic stimuli are often abstract and constant while the stimuli per se are varying. These relationships {{are referred to as}} the abstract auditory rule in speech and have been investigated for their underlying neural mechanisms at an attentive stage. However, the {{issue of whether or not}} there is a sensory intelligence that enables one to automatically <b>encode</b> <b>abstract</b> auditory rules in speech at a preattentive stage has not yet been thoroughly addressed. Methodology/Principal Findings: We chose Chinese lexical tones for the current study because they help to define word meaning and hence facilitate the fabrication of an abstract auditory rule in a speech sound stream. We continuously presented native Chinese speakers with Chinese vowels differing in formant, intensity, and level of pitch to construct a complex and varying auditory stream. In this stream, most of the sounds shared flat lexical tones to form an embedded abstract auditory rule. Occasionally the rule was randomly violated by those with a rising or falling lexical tone. The results showed that the violation of the abstract auditory rule of lexical tones evoked a robust preattentive auditory response, as revealed by whole-head electrical recordings of the mismatch negativity (MMN), though none of the subjects acquired explicit knowledge of the rule or became aware of the violation. Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate that there is an auditory sensory intelligence in the perception o...|$|R
40|$|How does {{linguistic}} structure {{relate to}} how we construe reality? In many languages, countable individuals like objects are typically labeled by count nouns (e. g., two rabbits, every truck, etc.), while unindividuated masses like substances are typically labeled by mass nouns (e. g., much mud, barrel of oil, etc.) (Quine WVO. Word and Object. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; 1960). These facts have led researchers to propose that learning mass–count syntax affects how speakers perceive objects and substances or alternatively that an understanding of this distinction—or one between individuals and nonindividuals—scaffolds the acquisition of mass and count nouns. Here, we evaluate these ideas and describe how recent developments in the literature have fundamentally changed {{our understanding of the}} mass–count distinction and how it relates to individuation. Across three sections, we show that a simple distinction between countable individuals and nonindividuals cannot provide a foundation for the mass–count distinction (e. g., because many mass nouns like furniture and luggage can denote individuals). Furthermore, we show that mass–count syntax does not shape whether items are construed as individuals or not, but instead allows speakers to select from a set of universally available meanings (e. g., because speakers of all languages quantify objects and substances similarly). We argue that a complete understanding of how mass–count syntax encodes reality requires understanding how different aspects of language—syntax, lexical roots, word meanings, and pragmatic inference—interact to <b>encode</b> <b>abstract,</b> countable individuals...|$|R
