40|$|Abstract: Based on the Knowledge Production Function {{framework}} {{given by}} Griliches (1979), we slightly modify {{it so that}} the innovative output depends upon a set of factors related to the firm internal characteristics and are influenced by the environment. Specifically, regarding the firm internal determinants the effect of the concentration of the ownership, the composition of the boards of directors and the effect {{of the nature of the}} ownership (foreign and public) are analyzed. Additionally, in order to capture the determinants of the environment in which the firm operates other variables concerning the <b>internationalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>market,</b> the agglomeration economies and the regional knowledge externalities are also considered. In order to assess the impact of these determinants on the number of patents and models of use awarded by the firm, the discreteness of the latter variable has to be taken into account. We apply Poisson and Negative Binomial models for a more comprehensive evaluation of the hypothesis in a panel of Spanish manufacturing firms. The results show patenting activity is positively favoured by being located in an environment with a high innovative activity, due to the existence of knowledge spillovers and agglomeration economies...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{possible}} determinants {{of the use}} of incentive pay for managers in European companies. Data from 5, 000 firms in 15 countries are used to analyze the degree to which incentive pay is associated with national embeddedness, local labour market institutions, ownership, and <b>internationalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets.</b> We find that companies in countries with high scores on power distance and individualism tend to use incentive schemes for managers more frequently than companies with lower scores on these cultural dimensions. Centralized wage bargaining and unionization at the firm level tend to reduce the prevalence of such schemes. Incentive pay is less common in state-owned companies than in privately owned firms. The findings also reveal that the more global the market in which a firm operates, the greater the probability that it will implement incentive pay elements for its managers. Our results suggest that unions, national labour market institutions and social and cultural norms serve as buffers against the introduction of US-style compensation system...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSome of the {{phenomena}} where the “globalization” concept is applied include the <b>internationalization</b> <b>of</b> <b>markets,</b> globalization of culture, polítical hegemony of world by some states, {{or groups of}} states, the increasing power of supranational institutions, {{and the development of}} a global division of labour. A starting point to understand the global division of work is the study of how companies are re-structuring, once they are the key-actors in the decision on which work should be found and where. The “value chains” describe each step in the productive process of a final product or service. Separated units of value chains can be in the same company (in-house) or in different companies (outsourced). Similarly they can be in a same local, or in other location. Normalization of business processes, combined with digitalization of information and the development of telecommunication networks made possible the tele-mediated work.
