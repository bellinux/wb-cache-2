5|$|Rather {{than try}} to fit more guns onto a ship, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} the power of each gun. This could be done by increasing either the calibre of the weapon and hence the weight of shell, or by lengthening the barrel to increase muzzle velocity. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.|$|E

5|$|While docked for repairs, Iéna was gutted on 12 March 1907 by a {{magazine}} explosion {{caused by the}} decomposition of well-aged Poudre B propellant. While <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> repair her, the ship was not thought worth the time or expense.

Users {{who have a}} good track record of {{complying}} with the site's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as live streams, which requires verifying the account, normally through a mobile phone. When YouTube was launched in 2005, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> upload longer videos, but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found {{that the majority of}} videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films. The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010. In the past, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> upload videos longer than 12 hours. Videos can be at most 128 GB in size. Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.|$|E

5|$|Back in Kristiansund, Løvold {{started working}} {{with the idea of}} {{building}} a subsea road tunnel from Kristiansund to the mainland. He discussed the issue in Foreningen Kristiansunderen where it received support. Løvold was an important enthusiast for the fixed link project, which would materialize as the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link in 1992. The local press dubbed him the fixed link general. In 1955 he organized an inspection of Freifjorden; using echo sounding <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> survey the depth of the fjord. Afterwards he took contact with County Governor Olav Oksvik and the two started working towards implementing the plans.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, UK and France were {{developing}} a new aircraft which could fill the RAF tactical strike and reconnaissance missions: the SEPECAT Jaguar was introduced into service in 1974, {{and led to a}} re-think of the Phantom's role as, at the same time, the limitations of the Lightning as an interceptor were becoming more apparent. The conversion of the RAF's FGR.2 squadrons to operate the Jaguar, combined with its use of the Blackburn Buccaneer, meant that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> begin transferring Phantoms to operate purely as interceptors in the air defence role.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of Muhammad's life, the Quraysh tribe he belonged to became a {{dominant}} force in western Arabia. They formed the cult association of hums, which tied members of many tribes in western Arabia to the Kaaba and reinforced the prestige of the Meccan sanctuary. To counter the effects of anarchy, Quraysh upheld the institution of sacred months during which all violence was forbidden, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> participate in pilgrimages and fairs without danger. Thus, although the association of hums was primarily religious, it also had important economic consequences for the city.|$|E

5|$|In interviews, Colbert has {{described}} his parents as devout people who also strongly valued intellectualism and taught their children that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> question {{the church and}} still be Catholic. The emphasis his family placed on intelligence and his observation of negative stereotypes of Southerners led Colbert to train himself to suppress his Southern accent {{while he was still}} quite young.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{the price}} of raccoon pelts rose again {{to a high of}} 25 to 30 dollars each, and some people made their entire income from coon hunting. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> catch ten {{raccoons}} per night in well-populated areas, with good dogs. One outdoors writer estimated that in 1985 there were 30 to 40 thousand coon hunters in Michigan alone. This market hunting largely died out by the late 1980s, and it is estimated that during the fur boom trapping took more raccoons than hunting with dogs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{deciphering}} of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe {{would have been able to}} write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.|$|E

5|$|Ken Ralston and {{his team}} at Industrial Light & Magic were {{responsible}} for the film's visual effects. Using CGI techniques, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands. Hanks was first shot against a blue screen along with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage. To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the new dialogue. Archival footage was used {{and with the help of}} such techniques as chroma key, image warping, morphing, and rotoscoping, Hanks was integrated into it.|$|E
5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from very early on. The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts {{were made in the}} 1880s to apply them to telegraphy, these designs proved inadequate for successful frequency-division multiplexing. Network analysis was not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex filters and progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} I argue that {{pedagogical}} reform {{is needed in}} the current Westernized teaching of sociology to create a new, more equal, humane and ecologically sound world. Present teaching methods encourage instrumental approaches to studying and learning. As a result, students seem to have grown indifferent to learning, becoming mere reflections of their study environment. In confronting the needed pedagogical reform, I focus on the smallest particle of higher education – {{the structure of the}} teaching and learning process in the sociology classroom, and suggest the implementation of collaborative learning situations.
