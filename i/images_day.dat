5000|$|In 1989 Day had {{her first}} meeting with Phil Bicker, the art {{director}} of The Face. Through Bicker, Day met stylists Anna Cockburn and Melanie Ward, with whom she was to create some of her most iconic images. Day's photographs came to public attention through her fashion editorial for The Face titled, [...] "The Third Summer of Love" [...] published in July 1990. Commissioned by Bicker and styled by Ward, the story used Kate Moss as the model in an eight-page fashion story, showcasing garments by Romeo Gigli, Joseph Tricot, Ralph Lauren, and a feather head-dress from the now-defunct Covent Garden boutique World. Taken during a day trip to Camber Sands, {{a number of the}} photographs depicted the teenage Moss semi-nude and laughing on the beach. The photograph of Moss wearing the feather head-dress featured on the front cover of the magazine is now one of Day's most recognised <b>images.</b> <b>Day</b> had previously worked with Moss on the Levi's 'Levis for Girls' campaign with The Design Corporation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- With the {{improvement}} of Synthetic Aperture Radar, the satellite imagery process becomes easier, because of the characteristic of SAR, which can take <b>images</b> <b>day</b> and night, and back from the clouds. With the help of these characteristics, Automatic Target Detection/Recognition becomes more important. Bridge detection {{is one of the}} subjects of ATD/R. The information gathered by finding bridge locations, can be used in both civil and military applications. In this paper we studied a new algorithm that finds the bridge positions in SAR image. The algorithm consists of some image processing applications, such as; filtering, segmentation, morphology, connectivity and edge detection. After using these algorithms we applied a “distance finding ” algorithm to find the locations of bridges...|$|E

The bulk of the research has been directed at nonproliferation applications, but it has also proven useful in environmental monitoring and assessment, and land/water management. The contents of this issue are: using AMPS technology to detect proliferation and monitor resources; combining multisensor data to monitor facilities and natural resources; planning a AMPS mission; SAR pod produces <b>images</b> <b>day</b> or night, rain or shine; MSI pod combines data from multiple sensors; ESI pod will analyze emissions and effluents; and accessing AMPS information on the Internet...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is {{considered}} as {{a useful tool for}} sea surface monitoring, thanks to its capability to acquire <b>images</b> <b>day</b> and night and in all weather conditions. In particular, SAR is extensively used to detect oil slicks on the sea surface. Since the early 90 s SAR acquisitions were routinely available with C-band sensors (such as ERS- 1 and 2, Envisat, Radarsat 1 and 2). More recently, also L-band (ALOS PALSAR 1 and 2) and X-band (Terrasar X, COSMO/SkyMed constellation) sensors became operational. In this framework we developed a new software called SEASAFE (Slick Emissions And Ship Automatic Features Extraction), able to process SAR data in C- L- and X-bands. Moving from previous experience, new features have been added such as an enhanced land masking algorithm and oil spill characterization. Modules for ship detection and wind and wave evaluation are also available. The new improved system is here described; detection capabilities are evaluated, overall performances are described...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{cerebral}} infarction correlates with {{increased risk of}} intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) following recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) administration. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used, validated method which assesses involvement of 10 selected regions of the MCA territory. An ASPECTS score > 7 {{is associated with a}} higher risk of ICH following thrombolysis than lower scores. To understand the internal structure of the ASPECTS template better, we estimated the infarct volume corresponding to each region. We hypothesized that, in the ASPECTS scoring system, the striatocapsular region is weighted disproportionally. Four experienced radiologists rated individual ASPECTS regions on subacute CT <b>images</b> (<b>day</b> 5 –day 10) of 19 patients with MCA territory stroke. Infarct volume was determined from manual segmentation of infarcts on CT images. Linear regression was used to estimate the regional volume associated with each ASPECTS region. The ASPECTS regions are weighted unequally with the striatocapsular region accounting for 21 % of the MCA territory infarct volume. Together, the 10 ASPECTS regions account for approximately 51 % of the maximum MCA infarct territory volume. These findings should provide impetus for research to develop a scoring system explicitly based on regional hemorrhage risk as an aid to selecting patients for thrombolysis...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first 3 D tomographic reconstructions of the coronal {{electron}} density from an extended, high-cadence sequence {{of images of}} the corona's polarized brightness (pB). While the standard LASCO synoptic sequence is only 1 pB <b>image</b> per <b>day,</b> during the 14 day period covering 2006 June 9 - 22, the C 2 coronagraph took about 6. 5 pB <b>images</b> per <b>day.</b> We show that the high cadence dramatically improves {{the quality of the}} tomographic reconstructions when compared to a reconstruction that only uses one <b>image</b> per <b>day.</b> In particular, the reconstruction that uses only one <b>image</b> per <b>day</b> misses important features and has lower spatial resolution. We find that the spatial resolution of the tomographic inversion is ultimately limited by smearing due to coronal dynamics that take place during the 14 days required for data acquisition. We show that when only C 2 images are available, about 4 pB <b>images</b> per <b>day</b> are enough for nearly optimal tomographic reconstruction, but more will be required when STEREO observations are included in the tomographic analysis.
