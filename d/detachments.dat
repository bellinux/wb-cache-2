5|$|On 26 September 1941, the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan <b>Detachments</b> of Yugoslavia held {{a conference}} at Stolice in the German-occupied {{territory}} of Serbia, {{at which it}} adopted a standard structure for the military organisation of the resistance. The General Staff was renamed the Supreme Staff, and the Military Staff of each province became the General Staff. The basic Partisan unit {{was to be a}} company of 80–100 soldiers, composed of platoons and sections. Two to four companies were to make up a battalion, and three to four battalions formed a detachment, the largest unit of the Partisan forces. Each detachment would have a staff consisting of a commander and deputy, with a political commissar and deputy, and the detachment staff would be directly responsible to the General Staff. On that basis, the existing Partisan units operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina were re-organised in October and November 1941 into ten <b>detachments,</b> six in east Bosnia, three in Bosanska Krajina, and one in Herzegovina. The Sarajevo and Tuzla Military Staffs were dissolved and <b>detachments</b> in those regions were placed under the direct control of the General Staff for the People's Liberation Partisan <b>Detachments</b> of Bosnia-Herzegovina.|$|E

On 30July, contrary to Stojanović's direct order, the insurgents attacked Veliko Palančište and rescued fifteen hostages held by the Ustaše.

A front line stabilised {{after three days of}} fighting, leaving the Prijedor Company in control of seven villages. Railway traffic between Ljubija and Zagreb was disrupted, stopping the export of iron ore from Ljubija to Germany. The uprising in Kozara also involved the districts of Dubica and Novi. By mid-August, five <b>detachments</b> of Partisans had been formed within the territory held by the Kozara insurgents. These <b>detachments,</b> including the Prijedor Detachment commanded by Stojanović, together held the front line facing Kozarac, Prijedor, Lješljani, Dobrljin, Kostajnica, and Dubica.|$|E

5|$|In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, General der Artillerie (General) Paul Bader, issued orders giving unit numbers C39 to C101 to the Pećanac Chetnik <b>detachments,</b> {{which were}} put {{under the command}} of the local German {{division}} or area command post. These orders also required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all <b>detachments</b> engaged in operations, and limited their movement outside their assigned area. Supply of arms and ammunition was also controlled. In July 1942, Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor.

5|$|Many of the RAAF's C-130s were redeployed to South Vietnam {{shortly before}} the end of the war in 1975. The rapid North Vietnamese advance during the Spring Offensive {{displaced}} hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians, and the Australian Government deployed a detachment of Hercules to Saigon in March 1975 as part of an international aid effort coordinated by the United States. This force, which was designated <b>DetachmentS,</b> had an average strength of seven C-130s and about one hundred air and ground crew, and was initially used to transport civilian refugees away from the front lines. After South Vietnamese soldiers were reported to have been transported alongside civilians, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam directed that the Hercules were to only carry humanitarian cargo. As the North Vietnamese advanced on Saigon, <b>DetachmentS</b> was moved to Bangkok in Thailand, but continued to fly into South Vietnam each day. Overall, <b>DetachmentS</b> had carried 1,100refugees and 900tonnes of supplies by the end of the war. On 4and 17April, aircraft of the detachment flew 271orphaned children to Bangkok as part of the US-led Operation Babylift. In late April, two of No.37 Squadron's C-130Es were assigned to the United Nations to transport supplies throughout Southeast Asia; this force was designated DetachmentN. The C-130Es began operations on 3May, and were mainly used to fly supplies into Laos. The aircraft transported cargo between Thailand, Butterworth, Hong Kong and Singapore; by the time this mission ended in early June, the two Hercules had conducted 91sorties for the UN. Aircraft of <b>DetachmentS</b> evacuated Australian embassy personnel from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, as well as Saigon, {{shortly before the}}y fell to Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese forces in April 1975, after which the force returned to Australia. DetachmentN also evacuated the Australian embassy in Vientiane, Laos, during early June 1975.|$|E

5|$|Operation Trio {{coincided with}} {{and contributed to}} the {{polarisation}} of the almost exclusively Serb rebels in eastern Bosnia into two groups: the Serb-chauvinist Chetniks and the multi-ethnic and communist-led Partisans. Encouraged by Chetnik propaganda against Croats and Bosnian Muslims and repelled by the sectarian left-wing policies and actions of the communists, many Serb peasant fighters were swayed to the Chetnik cause. Violent coups occurred against the communist leadership of {{all but one of the}} Partisan <b>detachments</b> in eastern Bosnia, and these <b>detachments</b> effectively defected to the Chetniks. Most of the surviving communist fighters from these <b>detachments</b> rejoined the Partisan forces, and many withdrew with Tito to western Bosnia during the Partisan Long March. Within a few weeks of the end of Operation Trio only 600 Partisan fighters were left in eastern Bosnia, comprising the Group of Shock Battalions and the Birač Partisan Detachment. All these forces sought refuge in the Birač region. The Chetnik movement in eastern Bosnia, at best a confederacy of local warlords, was strengthened by mass defections from the Partisans. For a time they ruled large parts of the region, after making accommodations with the Ustaše regime in May and June 1942.|$|E
