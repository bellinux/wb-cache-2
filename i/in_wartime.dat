5|$|At the Tehran Conference Winston Churchill {{made his}} famous remark that <b>in</b> <b>wartime</b> 'truth is so {{precious}} {{that she should}} always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.’ Clarke's principle was the opposite.

The government amended the Seat of Government Act providing for the new federal capital {{to be in the}} Yass-Canberra area, passed the Manufacturers' Encouragement Act to provide bounties for iron and steel manufacturers who paid fair and reasonable wages, ordered three torpedo boat destroyers, and assumed local naval defence responsibility and placed the Australian Navy at the disposal of the Royal Navy <b>in</b> <b>wartime.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{remained}} in Swansea for another year, {{working in the}} local steelworks whilst playing local football, until Swansea Town manager Haydn Green visited Ford's home. Green had taken over Swansea in 1939 and had set about establishing the side as a feeder club for local youth talent {{due to a lack}} of finances, offering 17 year old Ford an amateur contract in 1940 before signing him to his first professional contract with Swansea two years later. With the Football League suspended due to the Second World War, Ford featured for the club <b>in</b> <b>wartime</b> Combination leagues. Having spent his youth career as a defender, during his war service, Ford grew substantially in both height and weight and the Sergeant Major in charge of the local army football side switched him to centre-forward where he flourished, scoring 41 times between 1945 and 1946 in regional wartime competitions. After he was moved from his original army posting in Rhyl to new barracks in Colchester, Ford appeared for Leyton Orient <b>in</b> <b>wartime</b> fixtures, scoring three times in four appearances for the side. Following the return of league football after wartime, he made his fully professional competitive debut and played sixteen times in the first half of the 1946–47 season for the Swans in the Second Division before moving to Aston Villa in January 1947 for a fee of £9,500 plus Tommy Dodds.|$|E

50|$|The Fortress of Ulm {{was with}} the spread out defences {{on both sides of}} the Danube the central point and main {{training}} area for the defence of southern Germany. It was built as one of the biggest fortresses in Europe under the administration of the Prussian construction manager Moritz Karl Ernst von Prittwitz und Gaffron. It surrounded the cities of Ulm in Württemberg and Neu-Ulm in Bavaria and had 16 detached forts and an extensive moat system. <b>In</b> <b>wartimes</b> it was planned to place 20,000 men in the fortress - Ulm had at this time 16,000 citizens—an expansion to hold 100,000 men was planned. In peacetimes it was mostly occupied by 5,000 men of the federal army. As it was never armed <b>in</b> <b>wartimes,</b> the fortress was not designated for destruction after World War I and most works survived use as emergency shelters during World War II, so today about two thirds of the fortifications are preserved.|$|R

5|$|Military {{service is}} voluntary, though {{conscription}} may occur <b>in</b> <b>wartime</b> through the Selective Service System. American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Force's large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navy's 11 active aircraft carriers, and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navy's Atlantic and Pacific fleets. The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad, and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries.|$|E
5|$|Miller was Australia's top-scorer {{during the}} Victory Tests {{and came to}} the fore with his fast bowling. Miller was {{acclaimed}} for his free-spirited and adventurous batting, which he attributed to the triviality of sport in comparison to war. This was particularly exhibited in his 185 from 165 minutes for Dominions against England. It was through his involvement <b>in</b> <b>wartime</b> cricket that Miller met many of his future international colleagues, such as England's Denis Compton, Bill Edrich and Len Hutton.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1917, the United States {{declared}} war on Germany over its unrestricted submarine warfare campaign. Florida participated <b>in</b> <b>wartime</b> readiness exercises in 1917, before steaming across the Atlantic with Battleship Division 9. The division, which consisted of Florida, , , and , left the United States on 25 November. The division was sent to European waters to reinforce the British Grand Fleet in the North Sea. After arriving in Scapa Flow, Battleship Division 9 became the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet.|$|E

5|$|One {{issue that}} was {{foreseen}} {{as a potential}} problem was the supply of skilled officers to the Army <b>in</b> <b>wartime,</b> and a committee was established in 1906 under Sir Edward Ward to study the matter. It issued two reports, one focusing on university and school corps, {{and one on the}} Special Reserve. The main recommendation of the former was to reorganise the existing school Cadet Corps and university Rifle Corps, which had been formed on an ad-hoc basis as part of the broader Volunteer movement, into a uniform force, administered and supported by the War Office.|$|E
5|$|Referring to {{the cases}} in which the High Court had upheld the wartime {{legislation}} allowing indefinite administrative detention, Kirby said that equivalent decisions in other countries had come to be regarded as embarrassing and incorrect, and should be likewise regarded in Australia. While conceding that the scope of the Parliament's powers with respect to defence will be greater <b>in</b> <b>wartime</b> than in peacetime, Kirby said that they could not extend so far as to displace fundamental constitutional requirements such as those in Chapter III.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Tillman {{was born}} in Bedford County, Tennessee, near modern Shelbyville on October 3, 1847, one of several sons of Lewis Tillman and his wife Mary C. Davidson Tillman. The younger Tillman and his {{brothers}} were raised on the family plantation <b>in</b> <b>wartime</b> Tennessee {{during much of the}} American Civil War. Tillman left the farm in 1864 to attend Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, but left after a year to accept an at-large appointment to the United States Military Academy in July, 1865, months {{after the end of the}} rebellion.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade {{varied in}} size and {{structure}} each time it was created. Headquarters and Service Company, the company comprising the headquarters staff and support personnel, was {{much smaller than the}} equivalent company in standard Marine brigades. Each iteration of the brigade was assigned provisional military police, signal and other supporting companies and platoons. This was not an uncommon practice for the U.S. Marine Corps, which created such ad hoc units regularly <b>in</b> <b>wartime.</b> During World War II two other provisional Marine brigades were formed, which eventually expanded into divisions.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} appears on most {{official}} seals of the U.S. government, including the presidential seal, the presidential flag, {{and in the}} logos of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer's right), which {{gave rise to the}} urban legend that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows <b>in</b> <b>wartime.</b>|$|E

The site of the exchange sidings and junction is {{at the rear of}} the Pets At Home offices on Epsom Avenue. The depot had its own shunting locomotives, which were stored in an engine shed that stood at the Wilmslow bound exit slip road for the Handforth Dean shopping centre.|$|E
