5|$|At Saladin's {{death in}} 1193, rival Ayyubid factions led by Saladin's sons {{established}} themselves in Egypt, Aleppo, <b>Damascus,</b> and Iraq. Al-Afdal, Saladin's eldest son and emir of <b>Damascus,</b> was initially {{recognized by the}} younger sons as their overlord. However, hostilities broke out in 1194 between Al-Afdal and Al-Aziz Uthman, Saladin's second-oldest son and Ayyubid sultan of Egypt. In 1196, Al-Aziz and Saladin's brother Al-Adil captured <b>Damascus,</b> except for the citadel, where Al-Afdal had taken refuge. After negotiations, Al-Afdal surrendered the citadel and his titles to Al-Aziz and was exiled to Salkhad in the Hauran. Al-Adil recognized the overlordship of Al-Aziz and became ruler of <b>Damascus.</b> At the death of Al-Aziz in 1198, several members of Saladin's family, including Al-Afdal and Az-Zahir Ghazi, ruler of Aleppo, allied themselves against Al-Adil and marched on <b>Damascus.</b> Al-Afdal and Az-Zahir besieged <b>Damascus</b> in 1200 and 1201, but both attempts were unsuccessful. Al-Adil eventually negotiated a peace with Al-Afdal and Az-Zahir, who recognized Al-Adil's suzerainty as sultan of Egypt and emir of <b>Damascus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Defeat at the Battle of Ajnadayn left Syria {{vulnerable}} to the Muslim army. Khalid decided to capture <b>Damascus,</b> the Byzantine stronghold. At <b>Damascus,</b> Thomas, son-in-law of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, {{was in charge of}} the city's defense. Receiving intelligence of Khalid’s march towards <b>Damascus</b> he prepared the city's defences. He wrote to Emperor Heraclius, who was at Emesa that time, for reinforcement. Moreover, Thomas, in order to delay or halt Khalid's advance and to attain time to prepare for a siege, sent his armies to move forward. Two of his armies were routed first at Yaqusa in mid-August and the other at Maraj as-Saffar on 19 August. Meanwhile, Heraclius' reinforcements reached <b>Damascus</b> before the other column of Heraclius reached the city which Khalid laid siege to on 20 August. To isolate <b>Damascus</b> from the rest of the region, Khalid placed the detachments south on the road to Palestine and in north at the Damascus-Emesa route, and several other smaller detachments on routes towards <b>Damascus.</b> Heraclius' reinforcements were intercepted and routed by Khalid at the Battle of Sanita-al-Uqab 30km from <b>Damascus.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} {{to the arrival of}} the Crusaders, the regent of <b>Damascus,</b> Mu'in ad-Din Unur, started making feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of <b>Damascus,</b> ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road to <b>Damascus</b> destroyed or diverted. Anur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of <b>Damascus.</b> It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to <b>Damascus</b> out of the hope that their rival Anur might lose his city to the Crusaders.|$|E
5|$|Khalid's spy {{informed}} {{him about the}} move, Khalid having received permission from Abu Ubaidah, quickly moved towards <b>Damascus</b> with his mobile guard. While Abu Ubaidah fought and defeated the Roman army in the Battle of Maraj-al-Rome, Khalid moved to <b>Damascus</b> with his Mobile guard attacking and routing General Theodras in the 2nd battle of <b>Damascus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nasib {{was born}} in <b>Damascus</b> in 1888 to father 'Ata al-Bakri. Nasib was the second oldest of five sons. 'Ata was an {{influential}} official {{in the city and}} district councils of <b>Damascus</b> between the 1890s and 1914, {{and was one of the}} most prominent Arabs to serve in the imperial Ottoman court of Sultan Abdul Hamid II in Constantinople. The al-Bakri family were Sunni Muslims and claimed descent from the Islamic prophet Muhammad. They were landowners, possessing lands, homes and commercial venues in their native al-Shaghour quarter and in Qaboun, a village in the Ghouta countryside of <b>Damascus.</b> They also owned land in Jaramana, a Druze village outside of <b>Damascus</b> and maintained good relations with the local Druze chiefs.|$|E
5|$|Qutlubugha's {{recognition}} of Ahmad as sultan was officially {{an act of}} mutiny since it was done while al-Ashraf Kujuk technically held office. It led to divisions among the Syrian Mamluk leadership, with the governors of Safad, Tripoli and Homs led by Altunbugha al-Salihi of <b>Damascus</b> supporting Qawsun, while Tashtamur, Qutlubugha, the governor of Gaza, the Al Fadl tribe of Palmyra, {{and a number of}} Damascene emirs supporting an-Nasir Ahmad. As Altunbugha left <b>Damascus</b> to lead an expedition against Tashtamur, pursuing the latter to southeastern Anatolia, Qutlubugha moved into <b>Damascus</b> where he proclaimed an-Nasir Ahmad sultan and began to reorganize the bureaucracy with the support of Damascene emirs opposed to Altunbugha. Qutlubugha prepared to strike Altunbugha, who attempted to wrest back control of <b>Damascus,</b> but most of his forces defected and he escaped to Cairo. Afterward, the governors of <b>Damascus,</b> Safad, Gaza, Hama, and Baalbek formally recognized an-Nasir Ahmad as sultan, with apparent popular support. Nonetheless, Ahmad insisted that he remain in al-Karak instead of assuming the sultanate in <b>Damascus</b> unless Tashtamur, his most loyal supporter, accompanied him to <b>Damascus</b> from Anatolia. In the meantime, he gave Qutlubugha the authority to appoint Syrian governors as the new na'ib al-saltana (viceroy) of Syria. At one point during the political machinations in al-Karak, some of Ahmad's mamluks killed Shuhayb, an act which emotionally traumatized Ahmad.|$|E
5|$|Shukri Quwatli {{was born}} in <b>Damascus</b> in 1891. He {{received}} his elementary education at a Jesuit school in the city, then studied at the preparatory high school of Maktab Anbar in the Jewish quarter of <b>Damascus.</b> He obtained his baccalauréat in 1908. He then moved to Istanbul where he studied political science and public administration. Quwatli graduated from the Mekteb-i Mülkiye in 1913. He returned to <b>Damascus</b> in 1913 after receiving his diploma, and started working for the Ottoman civil service.|$|E
5|$|Trade and {{economics}} prospered {{in the city}} and under the Umayyads, <b>Damascus</b> remained one of the most dazzling cities of the world, until in 750, when it fell to the Abbasids. On August 25, 750, the Abbasids, having already beaten the Umayyads in the Battle of the Zab in Iraq, conquered <b>Damascus</b> after facing little resistance. With the heralding of the Abbasid Caliphate, <b>Damascus</b> became eclipsed and subordinated by Baghdad, the new Islamic capital.|$|E
5|$|When the Mongols invaded Syria and {{threatened}} <b>Damascus</b> after conquering Aleppo in 1260, An-Nasir fled from <b>Damascus,</b> leaving the city virtually undefended. The notables of <b>Damascus</b> started {{negotiations with the}} Mongol ruler Hulagu Khan; the city was handed over to his general Kitbuqa in 1260. When the Mongol army left <b>Damascus</b> to quell rebellions in the countryside, the Ayyubid garrison of the citadel revolted, {{as they had been}} instructed to do by An-Nasir. In response, the Mongols besieged the citadel in 1260. The garrison surrendered after heavy bombardments and without hope of being relieved by An-Nasir. The defences of the citadel were then largely dismantled.|$|E
5|$|While the Arabs {{administered}} {{the city of}} <b>Damascus,</b> the population of <b>Damascus</b> remained mostly Christian—Eastern Orthodox and Monophysite—with a growing community of Arab Muslims from Makkah, Madinah, and the Syrian Desert.|$|E
5|$|After the Mamluk defeat by the Ottoman army under Sultan Selim I in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516, <b>Damascus</b> and {{the citadel}} {{surrendered}} peacefully to the Ottomans. <b>Damascus</b> {{was given to}} Janbirdi al-Ghazali, a Mamluk who had submitted to Selim I. When Selim I died in 1520, al-Ghazali revolted and took the citadel. He marched upon Aleppo to expand his realm, but had to retreat and was eventually defeated and killed {{in the vicinity of}} <b>Damascus</b> in 1521. <b>Damascus</b> again changed hands, to the Ottomans. From 1658 onward, the citadel was controlled by the Janissaries—Ottoman infantry units. In 1738 and in 1746, they were involved in conflicts with the governors of Damascus; the Janissaries temporarily lost control of the citadel in 1746. The north gate of the citadel collapsed in 1752, and sustained heavy damage due to a severe earthquake in 1759. According to contemporary accounts, both the western and southern walls collapsed, but the damage was quickly repaired in 1761.|$|E
5|$|Along with Sa'd, he also gained {{prestige}} {{among the}} people of <b>Damascus,</b> with whom he continued the commercial relationships established by his father. Among the contacts Zahir made there was the Muslim scholar Abd al-Ghaffar al-Shuwaki, who introduced Zahir to Sayyid Muhammad of the al-Husayni family, which provided the sharifs of <b>Damascus</b> at the time; Zahir married Sayyid Muhammad's daughter and moved to Nazareth because she considered Arraba too small. When Sayyid Muhammad died, Zahir inherited his fortune.|$|E
5|$|As the qabaday (local youth boss) of the al-Shaghour {{quarter of}} <b>Damascus,</b> al-Kharrat was {{connected}} with Nasib al-Bakri, a nationalist from the quarter's most influential family. At al-Bakri's invitation, al-Kharrat joined the revolt in August 1925 {{and formed a}} group of fighters from al-Shaghour and other neighborhoods in the vicinity. He led the rebel assault against <b>Damascus,</b> briefly capturing the residence of French High-Commissioner Maurice Sarrail before withdrawing amid heavy French bombardment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Damascus</b> {{subsequently}} {{became the}} capital of the Ummayad Caliphate and all of the surplus revenue of the Ummayad Caliphate's provinces were forwarded to the treasury of <b>Damascus.</b> Arabic was also established as the official language, giving the Arab minority of the city an advantage over the Greek-speaking Christians in administrative affairs.|$|E
5|$|Faeq al-Mir became {{actively}} involved in the Syrian uprising (2011–present) right from the beginning. As a result, he went into hiding in Ghouta near <b>Damascus</b> to avoid arrest by the security agencies of the Syrian government. However, on Monday October 7, 2013, he was arrested during a visit to the city of <b>Damascus.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following its demolition, it is {{not known}} how long Darum {{remained}} deserted, but it was eventually resettled during Mamluk rule which began in 1250. For much of the Mamluk era, the town came under the administration of the politically important Niyabah of Gaza (Province of Gaza), part of the larger Mamlaka of <b>Damascus</b> (Kingdom of <b>Damascus.)</b> Along with Karatiyya and Beit Jibrin, Darum was an amal (district) of the Province of Gaza with its own wali (governor).|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after this}} {{operation}} was over, Khalid and his mobile guard moved north {{to pursue the}} retreating Byzantine soldiers; he found them near <b>Damascus</b> and attacked. In the ensuing fight Vahan, who had escaped the fate of most of his men at Yarmouk, was killed. Khalid then entered <b>Damascus</b> where he {{was said to have}} been welcomed by the local residents, thus recapturing the city.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Nur ad-Din's {{death in}} 1174, <b>Damascus</b> {{was seized by}} Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt. In that year, Saladin rode from Egypt past the Crusader states to <b>Damascus</b> with only 700 horsemen. The city opened its gates to Saladin without resistance, except for the citadel, which surrendered to him later that year. Saladin added a tower to the citadel and refurbished the residential buildings. Like his predecessor Nur ad-Din, Saladin died of an illness in the citadel on 4 March 1193. He was initially buried inside the citadel, but later reburied in a mausoleum near the Umayyad Mosque in <b>Damascus.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 1936, rebel {{operations}} temporarily ceased {{after the}} Arab Higher Committee (AHC), the revolt's political leadership, accepted calls by the generally pro-British royals of Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia for a cessation of hostilities. In return, the Arab royals would lobby the British Mandatory authorities to address Palestinian Arab concerns about Zionist activity in Palestine. That month, al-Qawuqji left Palestine. Al-Hajj Muhammad followed suit {{and headed for}} <b>Damascus</b> to evade arrest; the British had placed a bounty of 500 pounds on him. While in <b>Damascus,</b> al-Hajj Muhammad raised funds and purchased weapons for the revolt. He also began working with Syrian and Lebanese nationalists to smuggle the arms into Palestine. Al-Hajj Muhammad later left <b>Damascus</b> for the Lebanese mountain village of Qarnayel east of Beirut. From there, he maintained regular communications with his forces.|$|E
5|$|In the East the {{situation}} was much darker for the Christians. In the Holy Land, the Second Crusade had disastrous long-term consequences for Jerusalem. In 1149, the atabeg Anur died, {{at which point the}} amir Abu Sa'id Mujir al-Din Abaq Ibn Muhammad finally began to rule. The ra'is of <b>Damascus</b> and commander of the ahdath milita Mu'ayad al-Dawhal Ibn al-Sufi feel that since his ahdath had {{played a major role in}} defeating the Second Crusade that he deserved a greater share of the power, and within two months of Anur's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq. The in-fighting within <b>Damascus</b> was to lead to the end of the Burid state within five years. <b>Damascus</b> no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad-Din after a short siege in 1154.|$|E
5|$|It was in Transjordan, {{and later}} in <b>Damascus</b> and Beirut, that Mansur {{completed}} his primary and secondary education.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Seljuq Zengi, Atabeg of Mosul, {{had added}} to his rule in 1128 Aleppo, the key to power in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and <b>Damascus.</b> Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their {{attention}} towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the great city in 1129. <b>Damascus,</b> ruled by the Burid Dynasty, later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140; the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler Usamah ibn Munqidh.|$|E
5|$|Nur ad-Din ruled as Zengid emir of <b>Damascus</b> from 1154 {{until his}} death in 1174. He took up {{residence}} in the citadel and rebuilt or refurbished its residential structures. After an earthquake hit <b>Damascus</b> in 1170, Nur ad-Din built a wooden house for sleeping and prayer next to the original stone residence of the citadel. In addition, he built a mosque and a fountain in the citadel. Between 1165 and 1174, Nur ad-Din re-fortified <b>Damascus</b> with a concentric wall, and it is possible that he also strengthened the defences of the citadel. Nur ad-Din died of an illness in the citadel on 15 May 1174 and was buried there; his body was later transferred to the Nur ad-Din Madrasah in <b>Damascus.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 12 February 2008, Imad Mughnieh {{was killed}} by a car bomb in <b>Damascus,</b> Syria.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 7–8 March, tanks and units loyal to the {{conspiracy}} began moving on <b>Damascus.</b> Al-Hariri led a brigade from the Syrian front towards Israel, while Ba'athists were able {{to gain control of}} a second brigade stationed in Suwayda. Caught in a pincer movement, the commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade, Lieutenant General Abd al-Karim surrendered to the plotters – Umran took over as acting commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade. The potentially hostile unit stationed in Qatana, south-west of <b>Damascus,</b> did not intervene – probably because Widad Bashir had taken control over communications in the <b>Damascus</b> area. With the forces in al-Kiswah defeated and Qatana neutralised, al-Hariri's forces marched upon <b>Damascus</b> and began to set up road-blocks in the city, {{while at the same time}} seizing critical facilities such as the central post office. Captain Salim Hatum, a party officer, seized the radio station. The Ministry of Defence headquarters were seized without a fight, and General Zahr al-Din, the commander-in-chief, was put under arrest. Both al-Kudsi and al-Hawrani were easily tracked down and arrested. Salah Jadid bicycled into the city that morning, and captured the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, which later became his personal fiefdom.|$|E
5|$|Saladin's brother Al-Adil {{rebuilt the}} citadel {{completely}} between 1203 and 1216 {{in response to}} the development of the counterweight trebuchet. After his death, power struggles broke out between the other Ayyubid princes and although <b>Damascus</b> switched hands several times, the citadel was taken by force only once, in 1239. The citadel remained in Ayyubid hands until the Mongols under their general Kitbuqa captured <b>Damascus</b> in 1260, thereby ending Ayyubid rule in Syria. After an unsuccessful revolt broke out in the citadel, the Mongols had most of it dismantled. After the defeat of the Mongols in 1260 by the Mamluks, who had succeeded the Ayyubids as rulers of Egypt, <b>Damascus</b> came under Mamluk rule. Except for brief periods in 1300 and 1401, when the Mongols conquered <b>Damascus,</b> the Mamluks controlled the citadel until 1516. In that year, Syria fell into the hands of the Ottoman Empire. <b>Damascus</b> surrendered without a fight and from the 17th century onward the citadel functioned as barracks for the Jannisaries—Ottoman infantry units. The citadel started to fall into disrepair in the 19th century and its last military use was in 1925, when French soldiers shelled the old city from the citadel {{in response to the}} Great Syrian Revolt against the French Mandate of Syria. The citadel continued to serve as a barracks and prison until 1986, when excavations and restorations started. As of 2011, excavation and restoration efforts are still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Sarrail, {{who was not}} in <b>Damascus</b> at {{the time}} of the rebel assault, ordered aerial {{bombardment}} of the city, leading to the destruction of whole neighborhoods and the deaths of hundreds of <b>Damascus</b> residents. By 24 October, the rebels were routed, and al-Bakri escaped. He became the target of criticism among other rebel leaders, namely Said al-'As. Al-'As stated that al-Bakri sought personal glory when he decided to prematurely launch a mostly uncoordinated attack with small numbers of armed volunteers, instead of waiting for the arrival of al-Atrash's reinforcements, who numbered around 1,000. Al-Bakri was the only member of the <b>Damascus</b> nationalist elite to directly participate in the fighting on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Shukri's grandfather, Abd al-Ghani was {{involved}} in finance, {{as well as his}} great-uncle, Ahmad, who was the president of the Agricultural Bank of <b>Damascus.</b> His other great-uncle, Murad, {{was a member of the}} Administrative Council for the city. His father's wealth rested on the highly-fertile lands he owned, and later bequeathed to Shukri and his siblings, in the Ghouta. His older brother, Hasan, was elected President of the <b>Damascus</b> Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Some of the barons {{native to}} Jerusalem {{pointed out that}} it would be unwise to attack <b>Damascus,</b> as the Burid dynasty, though Muslim, were their allies against the Zengid dynasty. Imad ad-Din Zengi had besieged the city in 1140, and Mu'in ad-Din Unur, a Mamluk acting as vizier for the young Mujir ad-Din Abaq, {{negotiated}} an alliance with Jerusalem through the chronicler Usama ibn Munqidh. Conrad, Louis, and Baldwin insisted, <b>Damascus</b> was a holy city for Christianity. Like Jerusalem and Antioch, it would be a noteworthy prize in the eyes of European Christians. In July their armies assembled at Tiberias and marched to <b>Damascus,</b> around the Sea of Galilee by way of Baniyas. There were perhaps 50,000 troops in total.|$|E
5|$|Soon, however, Saladin's sons squabbled {{over the}} {{division}} of the empire. Saladin had appointed al-Afdal to the governorship of <b>Damascus</b> with the intention that his son should continue to see the city as his principal place of residence in order to emphasize the primacy of the jihad (holy struggle) against the Crusader states. Al-Afdal, however, found that his attachment to <b>Damascus</b> contributed to his undoing. Several of his father's subordinate emirs left the city for Cairo to lobby Uthman to oust him on claims he was inexperienced and intended to oust the Ayyubid old guard. Al-Adil further encouraged Uthman to act in order prevent al-Afdal's incompetence putting the Ayyubid empire in jeopardy. Thus, in 1194, Uthman openly demanded the sultanate. Uthman's claim to the throne was settled in a series of assaults on <b>Damascus</b> in 1196, forcing al-Afdal to leave for a lesser post at Salkhad. Al-Adil established himself in <b>Damascus</b> as a lieutenant of Uthman, but wielded great influence within the empire.|$|E
5|$|Strategically located, <b>Damascus</b> {{attracted}} merchants {{from all}} over the world. The city was known as the paradise of Syria.|$|E
5|$|The Quwatlis were {{a family}} of merchants, who became wealthy from trading with Arabia, and moved to <b>Damascus</b> from Baghdad in the 18th-century. The family {{established}} itself {{in the district of}} al-Shaghour in <b>Damascus,</b> and by 1860, some of the family's wealth was invested in buying large tracts of land in the Ghouta farms surrounding <b>Damascus.</b> The family's notable status was owed to their wealth, rather than an aristocratic or religious lineage, and their traditional spheres of activity were commerce and the Ottoman civil service.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of <b>Damascus</b> {{took place}} between 24 July and 29 July 1148, during the Second Crusade. It ended in a decisive crusader defeat {{and led to the}} {{disintegration}} of the crusade. The two main Christian forces that marched to the Holy Land in response to Pope Eugene III and Bernard of Clairvaux's call for the Second Crusade were led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany. Both faced disastrous marches across Anatolia in the months that followed, with most of their armies being destroyed. The original focus of the crusade was Edessa (Urfa), but in Jerusalem, the preferred target of King Baldwin III and the Knights Templar was <b>Damascus.</b> At the Council of Acre, magnates from France, Germany, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem decided to divert the crusade to <b>Damascus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The citadel {{is located}} in the {{northwest}} corner of the old walled city of <b>Damascus,</b> between the Bab al-Faradis and the Bab al-Jabiyah. Whereas most medieval Arabic castles are located on prominent hilltops, the citadel of <b>Damascus</b> was built on flat ground at the same level {{as the rest of the}} city, a feature it shares with the Citadel of Bosra. The location of the citadel ensured that it could control the Barada River, which flows north of the citadel. The location of the river also offered protection against attack from that side of the citadel. The Nahr Aqrabani, a canal branching off the Barada, flowed immediately below the northern wall and provided additional protection. The dry moats on the other sides of the citadel could be filled from these streams. Another branch of the Barada, the Nahr Banyas, entered the city under the citadel. Hydraulic structures below that made control of the flow of water into <b>Damascus</b> possible from within the citadel were probably constructed under Al-Adil. The citadel was fully integrated into the defences of <b>Damascus,</b> with the city walls abutting the citadel on its southwest and northeast corners.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat at}} Alexandretta {{was a major}} blow to Fatimid morale. Coupled with news of an advance against <b>Damascus</b> of the Qarmatians, a radical Isma'ili group {{originating}} from Eastern Arabia, Ibn Falah ordered Futuh to raise the siege of Antioch in early July 971. The army returned to <b>Damascus,</b> whence the various contingents dispersed to their home districts.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's {{siege of}} Shaizar was unsuccessful, but Shaizar was heavily damaged. After the siege, Usama left Zengi's service {{and went to}} <b>Damascus,</b> which was ruled by Mu'in ad-Din Unur, the atabeg of the Burid dynasty. Zengi was {{determined}} to conquer <b>Damascus,</b> so Usama and Unur turned to the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem for help. Usama was sent on a preliminary visit to Jerusalem in 1138, and in 1139 Zengi captured Baalbek in Damascene territory. In 1140 Unur sent Usama back to Jerusalem to conclude a treaty with the crusaders, and both he and Unur visited their new allies numerous times between 1140 and 1143. Afterwards, Usama was suspected {{of being involved in}} a plot against Unur, and he fled <b>Damascus</b> for Fatimid Cairo in November, 1144.|$|E
