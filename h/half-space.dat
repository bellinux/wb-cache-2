Over nearlyuniform distributions, it runs in polynomial time for up to O(log n= log log n) <b>half-spaces</b> or, more generally, {{for any number of}} <b>half-spaces</b> whose normal vectors lie in an O(log n= log log n) dimensional subspace. Over less restricted "non-concentrated" distributions it runs in polynomial time for a constant number of <b>half-spaces.</b> This generalizes an earlier result of Blum and Kannan [4]. The algorithm is simple and is based on random sampling. 1 Introduction In this paper we consider the problem of learning the intersection of k <b>half-spaces</b> in n dimensions from labelled examples.

500|$|One of {{the main}} {{drawbacks}} of the image parameter design method in this, as in other, filters is that the impedance match at the terminations is not good.

[...] These add considerably to the overall length of the filter.Matthaei et al., pp.397–408 [...] A small improvement to matching can be had by starting and ending the filter on a <b>half-space</b> instead of a full tooth or space. [...] The lumped circuit equivalent of this is T-half-sections terminating the filter at either end. [...] Starting and ending on a half-tooth instead of a half space is the equivalent of Π-half-sections.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{tolerancing}} analysis area, {{a classical}} approach consists in handling sets of linear constraints. These sets of constraints characterize {{the boundaries of}} the relative displacements between two surfaces of the same workpiece or between two surfaces of two different parts, potentially in contact. The relative position between any two surfaces of a mechanism is determined by operations on these sets of constraints (Minkowski sum and intersection). A method for solving these operations is to model each set of constraints by a polytope, which by definition is a bounded intersection of many finitely closed <b>half-spaces</b> in some. However, the intersection of <b>half-spaces</b> simulating geometric constraints or contact is generally not bounded. This is due to the degree of invariance of a surface and the degree of freedom of a joint characterizing theoretically unbounded displacement. This article introduces the concept of “cap” <b>half-spaces</b> to delimit sets of constraints in. They are added to the operand set and in this way determining the relative position of two surfaces of a mechanical system is based solely on operations on operand polytopes generating a calculated polytope. By checking that a calculated polytope is included within a functional polytope the conformity of a mechanical system can be simulated with respect to a functional requirement. The addition of cap <b>half-spaces</b> to the operand sets will affect the topology of a calculated polytope. Hence it has to be possible to differentiate among all the facets of a calculated polytope between those that are generated by the cap <b>half-spaces</b> and the others generated by <b>half-spaces</b> that derive from geometric and contact constraints. This is essential in order to validate the geometric tolerances that ensure that a mechanical system is compliant in relation to a functional requirement. This article describes how to identify the facets generated by the cap <b>half-spaces</b> of a polytope resulting from a Minkowski sum or an intersection between two operand polytopes...|$|R

A special role in the analysis is played by probabilistic methods and approximation of Gaussian functions. The result is then applied to functions that have variation Vf {{with respect to a}} class of ellipsoids. Two hidden layer feedforward sigmoidal neural nets are used to approximate such functions. The approximation error is shown to be bounded by a constant times Vf/T 1 / 21 +Vfd/T 1 / 42, where T 1 is the number of nodes in the outer layer and T 2 is the number of nodes in the inner layer of the approximation fT 1, T 2...|$|R
