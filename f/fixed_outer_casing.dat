40|$|Cased {{petroleum}} wells must be logged {{to determine}} the bonding and hydraulic isolation properties of the cement. Ultrasonic logging of single casings has been widely studied and is commercially available. However, ultrasonic logging in multiple-casing geometries is an unexplored topic despite its importance in plug and abandonment operations. Therefore, current logging technologies should be studied to evaluate whether they indicate the potential for multiple-casing logging. In this study, we used two finite-element models of pulse-echo logging. The first model represents logging in the transverse cross section of a double-casing well. The second model is {{a copy of the}} first, but with the <b>outer</b> <b>casing</b> and formation removed so that the pulse-echo transducer receives only a resonant first interface echo from the inner casing. By subtracting the received signals of the second model from those of the first, we can recover the third interface echo (TIE) signal representing the resonant reflection from the <b>outer</b> <b>casing.</b> This signal is used to study what information can, in principle, be drawn from TIEs in double-casing geometries, with the caveat that TIEs can only approximately be recovered in practical cases. We simulated variations of the material in the annulus beyond the <b>outer</b> <b>casing,</b> of the thickness of the <b>outer</b> <b>casing,</b> and of the eccentering of the <b>outer</b> <b>casing.</b> We have determined that the first two of these variations have only weak effects on the TIE, but that the eccentering of the <b>outer</b> <b>casing</b> can, in principle, be found using the TIE arrival time...|$|R

50|$|This {{original}} detuner was a straight-through silencer, {{a simple}} acoustic tube. A later version consisted of four acoustic sections with a plain entry section inside the test cell, flanged and bolted together, mounted on wheels, and installed on rails to permit {{fore and aft}} movement. Each acoustic section consisted of an inner and outer casing: the <b>outer</b> <b>casing</b> was plain mild steel plate and the inner casing was perforated mild steel plate. The cavity between inner lining and <b>outer</b> <b>casing</b> was tightly packed with an acoustic absorbent material known as rock (mineral) wool.|$|R
