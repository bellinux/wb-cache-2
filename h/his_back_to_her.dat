25|$|Mrs. Elspeth McGillicuddy {{has come}} from a {{shopping}} expedition to visit her old friend Jane Marple for Christmas. On the way, her train passes another train running parallel to her. Then, a blind {{in one of the}} compartments flies up and she sees a man with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> strangling a woman. She reports it to a ticket collector who does not believe her. When arriving at Miss Marple's cottage, she tells all to her. Mrs. McGillicuddy describes the woman as having blonde hair and wearing a fur coat. Only Miss Marple believes her story as {{there is no evidence of}} wrongdoing. The first task is to ascertain where the body could have been hidden. Comparison of the facts of the murder with the train timetable and the local geography lead to the grounds of Rutherford Hall as the only possible location: it is shielded from the surrounding community, the railway abuts the grounds, and so on. Lucy Eyelesbarrow, a young professional housekeeper and an acquaintance of Miss Marple, is sent undercover to Rutherford Hall.|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll think I'm cheeky," [...] {{her brother}} returned, {{looking down at}} his papers with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and his hands in his pockets.|$|E
60|$|He made an {{enormous}} effort, {{and then with}} her quick help and with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> knee, had raised himself on his elbows.|$|E
6000|$|Sir Claude {{looked from}} <b>his</b> {{stepdaughter}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> governess. [...] "Do you mean leave {{this house and}} take up my abode with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can nothing {{be done to}} save them?" [...] {{cried the}} missionary as he kindly but firmly dragged <b>his</b> {{daughter}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> former position.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Verrian sighed, {{and again}} she gave <b>his</b> letter <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> son. [...] "Perhaps you are right, Philip. She is {{probably}} so tough {{as not to}} feel it very painfully." ...|$|R
60|$|At length {{she slipped}} {{from her own}} bed {{and came over to}} him. He {{remained}} rigid, <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> He was all but unconscious.|$|E
6000|$|... "And what is worse," [...] said he, turning <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> suddenly, and writhing in his chair, [...] "you {{have made}} a rogue of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could forget}} what I have been!" [...] muttered David, turning <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and kicking a log that had {{rolled out of}} place.|$|E
6000|$|... "The gold Virgin?" [...] he vaguely echoed. But {{it brought}} <b>his</b> eyes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as if after an instant {{he could see}} the place and the thing she named--could see her sitting there alone. [...] "While I break with Mrs. Beale?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{presence}} of wise literary speculation, as she calculated, restored William's {{confidence in his}} security, and he replaced the book in the bookcase, keeping <b>his</b> <b>back</b> turned <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as he did so, and taking advantage of this circumstance to summon his thoughts together.|$|R
50|$|Goodman and Lesley's son, James William Goodman, {{was born}} 26 January 1981, {{but at the}} age of 12 moved with <b>his</b> mother <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> native Isle of Wight after Lesley and Goodman broke up. As of 2012, James teaches Latin and ballroom dancing at his father's Goodman Dance Centre.|$|R
60|$|He obeyed {{without a}} word, and, {{passing through the}} gate, {{sat down on the}} edge of the cliff with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> looking out over the sea.|$|E
6000|$|When he {{took this}} up {{it was still}} with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "If I don't strike you as having already spoken it, our time has been {{singularly}} wasted." ...|$|E
6000|$|NAPOLEON. HIS career! The fellow is {{not worth}} the {{gunpowder}} {{it would cost to}} have him shot. (He turns contemptuously and goes to the hearth, where he stands with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the age of}} twelve, Lloyd's father died. He {{accompanied}} <b>his</b> mother <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> parents' home in Brooklyn, New York in 1901. By 1904, he {{was already}} exploring wireless and became an amateur radio operator. He later worked for the United Wireless Telegraph Company. He graduated from the Pratt Institute in electrical engineering in 1909.|$|R
6000|$|This {{was perhaps}} just what Mrs. Elmore {{did not choose}} to say. She was silent a long time,--so long that Elmore said, [...] "But there's really no haste about it," [...] and took some notes of his history out of a drawer, and began to look them over, with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> turned <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
50|$|Juliet {{is trying}} to attend Mercutio's funeral but is stopped by her father who also tried <b>to</b> hit <b>her</b> after finding out about the wedding between her and Romeo. Jess pulls her father away and escapes <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{apartment}} in despair. Romeo tells Juliet he is making <b>his</b> way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and posted a poem about his dead friend.|$|R
60|$|Capt. H. (Subdued, {{but still}} sulky, with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her).</b> You {{want to see}} the things. That's what you're after. Well, no, not even you. Not till Harry has had his first look.|$|E
60|$|And she glided stealthily {{as a cat}} {{toward the}} hammock, while her cowardly {{companion}} stood shivering {{at the other end}} of the cabin, and turned <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> that he might not see the deed.|$|E
60|$|He {{had changed}} his place. He {{was sitting at the}} table in the corner--still with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> writing. This time his quick ears had not served him; this time she caught him in the fact.|$|E
60|$|Her husband stopped, with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> turned <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> {{but without}} {{releasing}} the child. He {{was still talking}} to the vicaress, but this good lady, I think, had lost the thread of her attention. She looked at Mrs. Ambient and at Dolcino, and {{then she looked at}} me, smiling very hard, in an extremely fixed, cheerful manner.|$|R
5000|$|James {{was born}} in Brisbane, the eldest of three sons but in 1871, his mother brought him and <b>his</b> {{siblings}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own mother's house, [...] "Pantlludw" [...] on the River Dovey in Wales. His father died in Brisbane in the following year. James was much influenced by his grandmother and acquired from her an egalitarian instinct and a distaste for sanctimonious posturing.|$|R
50|$|After {{several days}} of this, the baron heard this and eavesdropped. When the girl began to whet the knife, he broke {{into the kitchen and}} took it from her. Then he put Lisa in the care of a relative, where she regained her health and beauty. The baron brought <b>her</b> <b>to</b> his own home, {{dismissed}} <b>his</b> wife <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> relatives, and in due course married off his niece.|$|R
60|$|He {{remained}} with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She rose and went slowly to him. He let go the curtain, turned, hesitating, towards her. She {{stood with her}} hands behind her back, {{looking up at him}} in a heavy, inscrutable fashion.|$|E
60|$|As Mr. Wilding, <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> a moment, {{closed the}} door, Ruth slipped the paper hurriedly into {{the bosom of}} her low-necked gown. He turned to her, calm but very grave, and his dark eyes seemed to reproach her.|$|E
6000|$|He turned <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{and stood}} with his nose at {{the glass of the}} chimneypiece while he brushed specks of ash out of his beard. Then he {{abruptly}} said: [...] "Do you know anything about your brute of a mother?" ...|$|E
50|$|Because Tấn was not {{pregnant}} {{after three}} year of marriage, Lau was forced <b>to</b> send <b>his</b> wife <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> family due <b>to</b> local custom.

He died on August 13, 1976 in Bac Lieu.|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} {{as a series of}} communiqués between a sister, Jean Arbalaid, and her brother, Harry Felton, {{recently}} retired from the military. Jean and her husband, Mark, are renowned and well-connected psychologists. Since he is unemployed, Jean sends Harry on a series of trips to investigate some extreme cases of feral children. <b>His</b> reports <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> confirm her hypothesis that children are a result of their environment.|$|R
6000|$|He put <b>his</b> hands <b>to</b> the <b>back</b> of the wheeled chair, and {{muttering to}} himself, slowly wheeled <b>his</b> {{mistress}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> cabinet. 'Now,' he resumed, standing behind her: 'in case I should go away leaving things half done, and so should be wanted again {{when you come}} to the other half and get into one of your flights, has Arthur told you what he means to do about the business?' ...|$|R
60|$|He turned <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> then, {{and began}} {{clipping}} away as before. Beth sprang up and {{laid a hand}} upon his arm, arresting him. Again he turned to stare at her, and in his eyes was a look almost of fear.|$|E
60|$|Jethro, arose {{abruptly}} and flung {{a piece of}} wood into the stove, and then he stood with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Her instinct told her that he was suffering, though she could not fathom the cause, and she rose swiftly and drew him down into the chair beside her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks awfully; you're tremendously kind. I shouldn't {{think of}} that." [...] Nick Dormer got {{up as he}} spoke, {{and walked to the}} window again, his companion's eyes resting on him while he stood with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "I shall manage it somehow," [...] he wound up.|$|E
6000|$|A great {{sculptor}} {{once said}} to the statesman who was to be his model: [...] "Wear your old coat. There is {{as much of a}} man in the <b>back</b> of <b>his</b> old coat, I think, as there is in his face." [...] As Honora halted on the threshold, Peter was standing looking out of the five-foot plate-glass window, and <b>his</b> <b>back</b> was <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
50|$|Davies {{was born}} in Treorchy in the Rhondda Valley, Wales. His father, a clerk at a coalmine, died a few months later, and his mother took Donald and <b>his</b> twin sister <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> home town of Portsmouth, where he went to school.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heron and <b>his</b> hell-hounds went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lodgings last night," [...] he said, {{speaking}} {{as if he}} were still a little out of breath. [...] "They hoped to get me, no doubt; not finding me there, they took her. Oh, my God!" ...|$|R
