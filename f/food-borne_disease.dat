In addition, siRNA {{has been found to}} be successful in preventing the replication of the Tulane virus, part of the Caliciviridae family of viruses, by targeting both its structural and non-structural genes.

Understanding of factors is developed using system-based methods and their impact is discussed in relation to current events and predictions of future trends. These factors come {{from a wide range}} of spheres relevant to food and include political, economic, social, technological, regulatory and environmental drivers. The degree of certainty in assessing the impact of important driving factors is considered in relation to <b>food-borne</b> <b>disease.</b> The most important factors driving an increase in the burden of <b>food-borne</b> <b>disease</b> in the next few decades were found to be the anticipated doubling of the global demand for food and of the international trade in food next to a significantly increased consumption of certain high-value food commodities such as meat and poultry and fresh produce. A less important factor potentially increasing the <b>food-borne</b> <b>disease</b> burden would be the increased demand for convenience foods. Factors that may contribute to a reduction in the <b>food-borne</b> <b>disease</b> burden were identified as the ability of governments around the world to take effective regulatory measures as well as the development and use of new food safety technologies and detection methods. The most important factor in reducing the burden of <b>food-borne</b> <b>disease</b> was identified as our ability to first detect and investigate a food safety issue and then to develop effective control measures.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Food-borne</b> <b>disease</b> outbreaks, {{especially}} food poisoning, {{are known}} to be common occurrences that are not reported timeously (or not at all) and consequently are not investigated, controlled and prevented. Environmental health practitioners (EHPs) are responsible for conducting an environmental health investigation when a <b>food-borne</b> <b>disease</b> outbreak has occurred or a case of <b>food-borne</b> <b>disease</b> is reported, to ensure that findings of epidemiological and laboratory investigations are supported as most of the <b>food-borne</b> <b>disease</b> occurrences are due to environmental factors. This motivated the researcher to conduct a quantitative, descriptive study to determine the current practices and perceptions of EHPs when conducting outbreak investigations of <b>food-borne</b> <b>disease.</b> The target population comprised registered EHPs working at Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality. A simple random sampling technique was used to select the participants and data was collected using a structured questionnaire. The data was captured using the Statistical Package Social Science (SPSS) software programme, then converted and analysed using Microsoft Excel. The tools for data collection were piloted prior to commencing the study and errors in methods and procedures were identified and corrected. Ethical considerations were adhered to at all the stages of the study. The results indicated that there were gaps and challenges in knowledge and practice; however the attitude of EHPs was positive with regard to their role in outbreak investigations. The study recommended improvements that could be implemented in the current practices. M. Tech. (Environmental Health...|$|E

40|$|Sustainability {{relies on}} the environmental, social and {{economical}} systems: the three pillars of sustainability. The social sustainability mostly advocates the people’s welfare, health, safety, and quality of life. In the agricultural food industry, the aspects of social sustainability, such as consumer health and safety have gained substantial attention due to the frequent cases of <b>food-borne</b> <b>diseases.</b> The <b>food-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> due to the food degradation, chemical contamination and adulteration of food products pose {{a serious threat to}} the consumer’s health, safety, and quality of life.

This research proposes an ePedigree (electronic pedigree) traceability system based on the integration of RFID and sensor technology for real-time monitoring of the agricultural food to prevent the distribution of hazardous and adulterated food products.

Standard public health procedures typically use case-control studies and tracings along food shipping chains. These methods are time-consuming and suffer from biased data collected slowly in patient interviews.

The bacteria Escherichia coli # 916 was sourced from the institute Environmental Science and Research Limited (ESR) New Zealand. Alfalfa sprouts were inoculated with high and low counts of E. coli and enumerated by direct plating on MacConkey agar and Plate count agar. The antibacterial capacity of plant bioactives was screened using a micro broth dilution assay to determine their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The MIC experiments showed that the polyphenol gallic acid had antibacterial activity against E. coli: In the assays, its effect on controlling bacterial growth in inoculated sprouts by plate method was investigated and the biofilms produced were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). ...|$|R
