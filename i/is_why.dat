5|$|Because {{almost all}} {{other species of}} amphidromine gastropods, such as ones within the genera Partula and Achatinella, have already become extinct, the genus Amphidromus, {{containing}} over 110 species, is uniquely useful {{for the study of}} the evolution of asymmetry in animals, and this <b>is</b> <b>why</b> the conservation of this genus is of essential importance to biologists.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium's {{chemical}} {{behavior is}} largely {{a result of its}} small atomic and ionic radii.

5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks.

5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, Category5 hurricanes usually occur only in El Niño years.

5|$|Note that labour {{is assumed}} to be a 'bad', i.e., a {{commodity}} that a consumer doesn't like. Its presence in his consumption basket lowers the utility he derives.
