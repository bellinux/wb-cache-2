5|$|Banksia speciosa is {{extremely}} sensitive to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi and numbers in Cape Le <b>Grand</b> <b>and</b> Cape Arid National Parks have been drastically reduced as whole populations of plants have perished after exposure.

5|$|Jack White's {{voice is}} a singular, evocative {{combination}} of punk, metal, blues, and backwoods while his guitar work is <b>grand</b> <b>and</b> banging with just enough lyrical touches of slide and subtle solo work...

All D.I.Y. punk-country-blues-metal singer-songwriting duos should sound this good.|$|E

5|$|After the Revolution of 1848, then-Count Wilhelm {{became the}} first duke of Urach. A passionate {{artillery}} officer, he desired to improve the defenses of his castle and so began to build pre-outwork caponiers {{in the style of}} the imperial Fortress of Ulm (though not on a scale as <b>grand)</b> <b>and</b> a trench along the fortress to deter attack. Later he had cannons placed in the bastions on the walls. From 1898 to 1901 the two buildings left of the main gate, the Ducal Palace and the old groundskeepers house, were constructed and expanded respectively. A motion to build a cableway up to the castle in 1911 was rejected because it was believed it would ruin the beauty of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Although Innis remains {{appreciated}} {{and respected}} for the <b>grand</b> <b>and</b> unique {{nature of his}} later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in Empire and Communications has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively non-linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis. Biographers have suggested that this style {{may have been a}} result of Innis' illness late in his career.|$|E
5|$|American {{publisher}} William Randolph Hearst bought {{parts of}} the monastery in 1931 {{with the intention of}} using its stones in the construction of a <b>grand</b> <b>and</b> fanciful castle at Wyntoon, California, but after some 10,000 stones were removed and shipped, they were abandoned in San Francisco for decades. These stones are now in various locations around California: the old church portal was erected at the University of San Francisco, and the chapter house was reassembled by Trappist monks at the Abbey of New Clairvaux in Vina, California. Other stones are serving as simple decorative elements in Golden Gate Park's botanical garden. To support the chapter house project, a line of Belgian-style beers was produced by Sierra Nevada Brewing Company under the Ovila Abbey brand.|$|E

5|$|By 1934, {{there was}} a large system of {{interconnected}} bridle paths along trails and park roads. One bridle path ran close by to the lake, intersecting with Mosholu Avenue, before looping around the Parade Ground and diverging in the Northwest Woods. The Van Cortlandt Golf Course also had trails, as did the Old Croton Aqueduct and near Jerome Avenue and Holly Lane. However, as the primary roads through the park such as Jerome, <b>Grand,</b> <b>and</b> Mosholu Avenues were constantly maintained and upgraded, secondary roads fell into a state of neglect. One such road was Rockwood Drive, which was closed in 1936 and became a bridle path.|$|E
5|$|Compositional {{information}} from the visible and infrared spectrometer (VIR), gamma-ray and neutron detector (<b>GRaND),</b> <b>and</b> framing camera (FC), all indicate {{that the majority of}} the surface composition of Vesta is consistent with the composition of the howardite, eucrite, and diogenite meteorites. The Rheasilvia region is richest in diogenite, consistent with the Rheasilvia-forming impact excavating material from deeper within Vesta. The presence of olivine within the Rheasilvia region would also be consistent with excavation of mantle material. However, olivine has only been detected in localized regions of the northern hemisphere, not within Rheasilvia. The origin of this olivine is currently uncertain.|$|E

5|$|In November 1889, the CLR {{published}} a notice {{of a private}} bill that would be presented to Parliament for the 1890 parliamentary session. The bill proposed an underground electric railway running from the junction of Queen's Road (now Queensway) and Bayswater Road in Bayswater to King William Street in the City of London with {{a connection to the}} then-under construction, City and South London Railway (C) at Arthur Street West. The CLR was to run in a pair of tunnels under Bayswater Road, Oxford Street, New Oxford Street, High Holborn, Holborn, Holborn Viaduct, Newgate Street, Cheapside, and Poultry. Stations were planned at Queen's Road, Stanhope Terrace, Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Southampton Row, Holborn Circus, St. Martin's Le <b>Grand</b> <b>and</b> King William Street.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 496 (I-496) is an {{auxiliary}} Interstate Highway that passes through downtown Lansing in the US state of Michigan. Also {{a component of}} the State Trunkline Highway System, the freeway connects I-96 to the downtown area. It has been named the R.E. Olds Freeway (sometimes just Olds Freeway) for Ransom E. Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile and the REO Motor Car Company. I-496 runs east–west from I-96/I-69 near the downtown area and north–south along a section that runs concurrently with US Highway127 (US127). The trunkline also passes a former assembly plant used by Oldsmobile and runs along or crosses parts of the <b>Grand</b> <b>and</b> Red Cedar rivers.|$|E
5|$|Some {{residents}} of Glenwood Springs have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely, {{as it did}} in Basalt. They contend that a replacement bridge would add even more traffic to <b>Grand</b> <b>and</b> make downtown less attractive to those who would like to shop there rather than just pass through on the way to destinations up the valley. The bypass, they claim, is more in keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less. They have lobbied Glenwood Springs' city council to be more active in pressuring CDOT to reconsider the bypass.|$|E

5|$|The {{book has}} been called engagingly written, wisely researched, and {{honestly}} told. Critics admired the wit and humour.

5|$|The second error charged (with some exaggeration) {{was that}} the Petrobrusians said, “Edifices for temples and churches should not be erected...The Petrobrusians are quoted as saying, 'It is {{unnecessary}} to build temples, since the church of God does not consist in a multitude of stones joined together, but in {{the unity of the}} believers assembled.'” On the other hand, the medieval Church taught that cathedrals and churches were created to glorify God, and believed it appropriate that those buildings should be as <b>grand</b> <b>and</b> beautiful as wealth and skill could make them.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{staircase}} exits: two {{going up to}} the northeastern corner of the intersection of <b>Grand</b> <b>and</b> Chrystie Streets, and one {{going up to the}} northwestern corner. The station originally only had the two street stairs to the northeastern corner of the intersection, but due to growing ridership over the years—mainly by commuters from various Brooklyn neighborhoods to Manhattan's Chinatown—the third staircase to the northwestern corner was added in 1999.|$|E
5|$|This design {{followed}} the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms {{scattered over the}} two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on {{the first and second}} floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be <b>grand</b> <b>and</b> imposing, rose to {{the east side of the}} house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second. This older concept is more clearly exemplified at the Elizabethan Hardwick Hall in neighbouring Derbyshire.|$|E
5|$|Among Wetherby's other accomplishments {{were the}} {{creation}} of a Department of Mental Health and the construction of fifteen hospitals and thirty health centers throughout the state. In 1952, he created the Youth Authority as a central point for the administration of services to delinquent children. He constructed new state prisons, modernized the probation and parole systems, and established a more orderly system of selecting <b>grand</b> <b>and</b> petit juries. He also oversaw some voting reform measures, including the provision of funds to purchase voting machines in areas where they were desired. He was not as successful in the area of government reform. He failed in his efforts to amend the state's constitution to allow the governor to succeed himself in office. He was also unable to win support for a plan to consolidate some of Kentucky's counties. In 1955, the state's voters approved a constitutional amendment granting suffrage to eighteen-year-olds over Wetherby's objections.|$|E
