[...] The City of Schenectady then sued American Tax Funding for the right to continue its <b>foreclosure</b> <b>action.</b> To complicate matters, in 2006 the City of Schenectady sold ATF multiple invalid tax liens filed inadvertently by the City on various non-for profits, such as a Hindu Temple and various churches.

40|$|Four {{years into}} the {{mortgage}} meltdown, the home foreclosure crisis in New York State continues unabated, particularly in low income neighborhoods and communities of color. Recent reports on foreclosures in New York cite a decline in <b>foreclosure</b> <b>actions</b> filed in New York courts. These reports, however, fail to include key information needed to understand the true foreclosure picture and formulate effective public policy. According to NEDAP's analysis of new mortgage default and delinquency data, foreclosure risk remains disturbingly high in New York. NEDAP {{found that more than}} 345, 000 mortgages were in default or delinquent in New York State, in 2011. This staggering number [...] based on 90 -day preforeclosure notices that New York now requires servicers to send to homeowners [...] indicates severe mortgage distress and risk of foreclosure and destabilization for huge numbers of families and communities throughout the state. The number of <b>foreclosure</b> <b>actions</b> (lis pendens) filed against New York homeowners has indeed dropped, notwithstanding the extremely high number of mortgage defaults and delinquencies. The decline in foreclosure filings, however, is largely attributable to banks' inability to produce documentation required to initiate foreclosure cases, as New York courts heighten their scrutiny of banks' foreclosure filings.

This Article evaluates in detail the legal and market responses to mortgage default after the storm that contributed to the reduction in <b>foreclosure</b> <b>actions.</b> Secondary mortgage market initiatives provided the principal means for relief; however, even though these initiatives were successful in protecting mortgage debtors after Katrina, their limited scope make them inadequate to address the years of financial distress that might likely follow any future disaster of Katrina 2 ̆ 7 s magnitude.

40|$|The rise in {{subprime}} {{lending and}} the ensuing wave of foreclosures was partly a result of market forces that have been well-identified in the literature, {{but it was also}} a highly racialized process. We argue that residential segregation created a unique niche of minority clients who were differentially marketed risky subprime loans that were in great demand for use in mortgage-backed securities that could be sold on secondary markets. We test this argument by regressing <b>foreclosure</b> <b>actions</b> in the top 100 U. S. metropolitan areas on measures of black, Hispanic, and Asian segregation while controlling for a variety of housing market conditions, including average creditworthiness, the extent of coverage under the Community Reinvestment Act, the degree of zoning regulation, and the overall rate of subprime lending. We find that black residential dissimilarity and spatial isolation are powerful predictors of foreclosures across U. S. metropolitan areas. To isolate subprime lending as the causal mechanism through which segregation influences foreclosures, we estimate a two-stage least squares model that confirms the causal effect of black segregation on the number and rate of foreclosures across metropolitan areas. We thus conclude that segregation was an importan...|$|R
