25|$|With {{their wedding}} hours away, Tyrion Lannister visits Sansa Stark to ease her {{apprehension}} {{at the prospect}} of being his wife. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sept</b> of Baelor, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister threatens Margaery Tyrell with the story of House Reyne, former Lannister vassals who her father Tywin exterminated when they rebelled against their liege lord. After arriving at the Sept, Sansa is walked down the aisle by King Joffrey Baratheon. In an effort to embarrass Tyrion, Joffrey removes the stepstool Tyrion was to use to cloak Sansa with the Lannister colors. After some snickering from the crowd, Tyrion gets Sansa to kneel, and they are married.|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also {{praised the}} {{direction}} of the King's Landing story, and Lena Headey's portrayal of Cersei, saying in his review [...] "Ms. Headey's performance was but one element in a sequence that, technically, ranks among the show's best. Miguel Sapochnik, who directed last week's battle-heavy episode, brought a different kind of precision and urgency to Sunday's installment. Cersei's scheme unspooled amid insistent strings and a series of shots — those vicious little birds taking out Pycelle, Lancel and the dwindling candle-fuse, Margaery's growing concern and rising tension <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sept</b> — that built inexorably to the High Sparrow's realization that he wasn't as smart as he thought." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly stated he felt the episode introduced new conflicts to look forward to in the next season, saying [...] "Though the finale shifted from the battlefield, the events were, if anything, far more seismic, with game-changing revelations and huge moves from every corner of the realm that established some very clear new conflicts going into season 7." [...] Sarah Larson of The New Yorker wrote in her review, [...] "It's a beautiful image. Boats, clouds, sun, dragons, and two female ship captains, pointing their armada toward a Westeros ruled by a queen." [...] James Hunt of WhatCulture wrote in his review, [...] "What a way to go out. Season 6 has already proved to be a great season of TV, but it saved its best for last." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com called the episode, [...] "the best episode ever." [...] Brian Lowry of CNN wrote in his review for the episode, [...] "At this point it's hard to second-guess producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, who, working with Martin, have created a series for the ages."
