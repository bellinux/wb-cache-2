5|$|A {{somewhat}} similar hypothesis was advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. He contends that more comets are {{arriving in the}} inner Solar System from a particular region of the postulated Oort cloud than {{can be explained by}} the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit. This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had <b>defined</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|Harrington died in January 1993, {{without having}} found Planet X. Six months before, E. Myles Standish had used data from Voyager 2s 1989 flyby of Neptune, which had revised the planet's total mass {{downward}} by 0.5%—an amount {{comparable to the}} mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. When Neptune's newly determined mass {{was used in the}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental Ephemeris (JPL DE), the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a PlanetX, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 that {{can be attributed to the}} gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System. Today, most astronomers agree that PlanetX, as Lowell <b>defined</b> <b>it,</b> does not exist.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{transcriptional}} regulation of EFS, but several transcriptional regulators for EFS have been proposed based on consensus binding sites in its promoter region for ATF (Activating transcription factor), NF-κβ, NF-κβ1, GATA-3, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), glucocorticoid receptors α and β, and p53. Expression of isoforms 1 and 2 has been detected in multiple tissues, with maximal expression in the placenta, and the embryonal central nervous system, heart, testes and lungs. Although its expression has been reported as lower in thymus and lymphocytes, functional studies of EFS to date have best <b>defined</b> <b>it</b> as important for immune system function. One screen for implantation-related genes regulated by progesterone found that EFS was downregulated by 17β-estradiol and progesterone in explants of late proliferative phase endometrium.|$|E
5|$|The First Point of Aries, the {{location}} of the vernal equinox, is named for the constellation. This is because the Sun crossed the celestial equator from south to north in Aries more than two millennia ago. Hipparchus <b>defined</b> <b>it</b> in 130 BC. as a point south of Gamma Arietis. Because of the precession of the equinoxes, the First Point of Aries has since moved into Pisces and will move into Aquarius by around 2600 AD. The Sun now appears in Aries from late April through mid May, though the constellation is still associated with the beginning of spring.|$|E

5|$|The first {{hurricane}} in November since 1991 {{formed from}} a tropical disturbance. Although the circulation was initially poorly <b>defined,</b> <b>it</b> later acquired enough organization and {{was classified as}} a tropical depression on November 7. It moved north until a trough of low pressure turned it to the northeast. It was named on November 8, and was upgraded to a hurricane the next day. It reached its peak intensity of 100mph (160km/h) and 973mbar (hPa). Rick made landfall in Oaxaca– the same area devastated by Hurricane Pauline one month earlier– and quickly weakened, dissipating early on November 11.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} facility for Daicon IV {{was in a}} dedicated studio in a building called the Hosei Kaikan that was owned by a textile union. Takeda <b>defined</b> <b>it</b> as a literal anime sweatshop, the building was shutdown at 9:00 pm {{and a majority of}} the staff would be locked inside and working through the night without air conditioning. The Daicon IV film officially credits a production crew of twelve people. Hiroyuki Yamaga directed the production of Daicon IV with Hideaki Anno and Takami Akai as animation directors. Toru Saegusa did the artwork and the animations were done with Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Mahiro Maeda, Norifumi Kiyozumi; additional animation was provided by Ichiro Itano, Toshihiro Hirano, Narumi Kakinouchi, Sadami Morikawa, Kazutaka Miyatake. Originally, Daicon IV was supposed to be fifteen minutes long, but the difficult production resulted in the cut time.|$|E
5|$|The {{success and}} {{expansion}} of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, {{such as those of}} Byzantines and Persians. With such contact, new problems emerged for Islamic law to tackle. Moreover, there was a significant distance between Medina, the Islamic capital, and the Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law (back in Medina). During the Umayyad dynasty, the concept of qiyas was abused by the rulers.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on May 14, which {{is believed to have been}} the impetus to Barbara. The wave axis crossed Central America on May 25 and emerged into the eastern North Pacific Ocean the next day. Interacting with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a broad surface low pressure area developed within the area on May 27, and as it drifted northward the system maintained limited and disorganized convection. On May 29, convection increased and became concentrated near the low pressure center, and banding features developed in its eastern semicircle as the circulation became better <b>defined.</b> <b>It</b> is estimated the system formed into Tropical Depression Two-E at 1800UTC on May 29 about 115miles (185km) southeast of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was stationary in an area with warm sea surface temperatures, very light wind shear, and favorable upper-level conditions.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of Pluto's moon Charon allowed the measurement of Pluto's mass for the first time: roughly 0.2% that of Earth, and far too small {{to account for the}} discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by Robert Sutton Harrington, failed. In 1992, Myles Standish used data from Voyager 2s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the estimates of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished. Today, the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell <b>defined</b> <b>it,</b> does not exist. Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual orbit and its position at that time; Ernest W. Brown concluded soon after Pluto's discovery that this was a coincidence, a view still held today.|$|E
5|$|The {{cyclogenesis}} of Tropical Storm Emily was complicated, extending {{over several}} days from late July into early August. An easterly tropical wave—an equatorward trough of low pressure—exited the west African coast {{in the fourth}} week of July, at which point it became largely embedded within the monsoon trough. Located {{to the south of}} a ride of high pressure, the wave moved west-northwestward across the open Atlantic; it retained a broad circulation with little to no precipitation for a day or two. Over time, clusters of convection increased around the broad system, and it developed two distinct centers of circulation on July30. During the morning of July 31, the large low markedly gained in organization, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted it was close to becoming a tropical depression. Later that day, however, the main circulation became increasingly elongated; its westernmost component soon detached to form a separate tropical wave. This new disturbance featured widely scattered convection and rainbands, which briefly affected the Lesser Antilles. The next day, a new area of deep convection with a dominant center formed as the circulation became better <b>defined.</b> <b>It</b> passed through the Leeward Islands with some improvement in its structure, and the surface winds rose to near tropical storm force. A reconnaissance flight into the system revealed the circulation center had become well defined near the deep convection. The system was upgraded to tropical storm status and given the name Emily at 0000UTC on August2, when it was located to the south of Dominica. During the initial stages of its existence, the storm accelerated toward the west-northwest in response to the strong high pressure to its north.|$|E
