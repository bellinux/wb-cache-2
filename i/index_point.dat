40|$|Holocene {{stratigraphy}} from Skelwith Pool, on {{the northern}} side of Morecambe Bay, is described. Diatom and pollen analyses and radiocarbon dating have been undertaken for three sampling sites, from which eight sea-level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> have been obtained. These <b>index</b> <b>points</b> come from a small homogeneous area and similar palaeoenvironments. Some published sea-level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> from Morecambe Bay have been re-evaluated and validated by means of diatom analysis. An enhanced sea-level database with 28 <b>index</b> <b>points</b> {{has been used for}} the reconstruction of Holocene sea-level history. Relative sea-level rose rapidly around 6870 - 6510 BC at a maximum rate of + 36. 7 mm yr- 1. Subsequently, the rate of sea-level change has varied between - 8 mm yr- 1 and + 12 mm yr- 1. The rate of relative sea-level changes for the last 3500 years is not clear. Uplift driven by deglaciation {{is believed to have been}} interrupted in the early Holocene by a rapid rise in relative sea-level. Uplift restarted at 6510 BC but soon declined as glacio-isostatic recovery ended around 3800 BC in the Morecambe Bay area. Since then, crustal movements in the Morecambe Bay area have been minimal. Factors affecting the attitudes of the <b>index</b> <b>points</b> such as sediment compaction of the basal peat and variations in palaeotidal range during the Holocene have been considered. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|A proper methodological {{approach}} of investigating Holocene sea level changes {{is a prerequisite}} in order that the sea-level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> can be useful and significant. This requires the correct identification of the indicative meaning. The indicative meaning of the sea level indicator {{is defined as the}} altitudinal relationship of the local environment in which it accumulated to the contemporaneous reference tide level. This study identifies the <b>index</b> <b>points</b> using the litho-, bio-, and chrono-stratigraphic approach. The sea level indicator is derived from the regressive contact of the intercalated peat and marine clastic sequence, while the indicative meaning is estimated based upon the relationship with the contemporary samples. The study was carried out at two contrasting coastal locations, the fossil sites from Meru and Mardi in Kelang in the west and Penur (north and south transects) in Kuantan in the east, while the contemporary sites are from various ecological environments from both areas. Microfossil analysis of pollen and diatoms indicates that the former are more applicable, and defined the changing microfossil assemblages within the regressive contact of the sea level indicator samples. Seven sea level <b>index</b> <b>points</b> are identified. The finding agrees to the general assumptions of high mid-Holocene sea level history in peninsular Malaysia. A relative sea level difference between the west and east coast is indicated, but the significance, if any, is dealt with caution.

40|$|Weather {{conditions}} are commonly believed to influence musculoskeletal pain, however {{the evidence for}} this is mixed. This study aimed {{to examine the relationship}} between local meteorological conditions and online search trends for terms related to knee pain, hip pain, and arthritis. Five years of relative online search volumes for these terms were obtained for the 50 most populous cities in the contiguous United States, along with corresponding local weather data for temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, and precipitation. Methods from the climate econometrics literature were used to assess the casual impact of these meteorological variables on the relative volumes of searches for pain. For temperatures between - 5 °C and 30 °C, search volumes for hip pain increased by 12 <b>index</b> <b>points,</b> and knee pain increased by 18 <b>index</b> <b>points.</b> Precipitation had a negative effect on search volumes for these terms. At temperatures > 30 °C, search volumes for arthritis related pain decreased by 7 <b>index</b> <b>points.</b> These patterns were not seen for pain searches unrelated to the musculoskeletal system. In summary, selected local weather {{conditions are}} significantly associated with online search volumes for specific musculoskeletal pain symptoms.

40|$|Holocene {{relative}} sea-level reconstructions {{provide information}} on differential land movements, palaeo-landscapes, occupational history, palaeo-ecology of coastal areas and are important for climate change studies. For The Netherlands most coastal regions have a well-established sea level curve. However, {{this is not the}} case for the Wadden area. Up until recently, there were not enough reliable <b>index</b> <b>points</b> to establish a separate curve for the Northern Netherlands. Van de Plassche (1982) assumed on the basis of the little basal peat data available (two <b>index</b> <b>points)</b> that the curve for the Western Netherlands was also applicable to the North of the country. Using a modelling approach, Kiden (2002) suggested a lower curve based on postglacial isostatic subsidence. The data to support such hypothesis was expanded recently to 15 <b>index</b> <b>points</b> as presented by Kiden & Vos (in prep). We now present data on a sea level curve valid for the Dutch Wadden area, based on published and previously unpublished data to a dataset of 49 basal peat 14 C samples. First results suggest that in the early Holocene, the relative sea level curve is below the curve for the Western Netherland, but after around 7000 cal BP, the sea level rises comparably with the Western Netherlands curve...|$|R

5000|$|The Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Indices are repeat-sales house price indices for the United States. There are {{multiple}} Case-Shiller home price indices: A national home price index, a 20-city composite index, a 10-city composite index, and twenty individual metro area indices. These indices are calculated and kept monthly by Standard & Poor's, with data points {{calculated for the}} time period of January 1987 through the present. The indices kept by Standard and Poor are normalized to have a value of 100 in January 2000. These Indices are based on original work by economists Karl Case and Robert Shiller, in which their team calculated the home price index back to 1890. That index is normalized to have 1890 have a value of 100. The Case-Shiller Index being kept on Shiller's website (http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm) is updated quarterly. Due to the different set reference points, and perhaps calculation differences, the index numbers provided in each data set can be very different. For example, in 4th quarter 2013, the Standard and Poor 20 city <b>index</b> <b>point</b> was in the 160's, while the <b>index</b> <b>point</b> for 4th quarter on the Shiller data was in the 130's.
