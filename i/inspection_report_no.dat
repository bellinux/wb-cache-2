30|$|A {{check-up}} after 10 days revealed, by speculum inspection, a well-healed suburethral wound without {{signs of}} inflammation. The patient was continent. After 5  weeks, {{she had no}} complaints. A careful vaginal examination showed a well-healed scar {{at the site of}} vaginal incision. Inspection of the vaginal cuff revealed no bleeding or atypical discharge. Five months postoperatively, during a vaginal irrigation, the patient felt a rigid rough surface over the anterior wall of the vagina. At inspection, a 1.5 -cm-long erosion was visible at the site of suburethral incision with extrusion of the mesh. An office cystourethroscopy showed normal findings. Under local analgesia, we performed an excision of the exposed piece of mesh. The fibrotic wound wedges were also removed. The margins were approximated by interrupted resorbable stitches. No evidence of bacterial colonisation of the mesh was found. The patient was discharged on oral Levofloxacin 250  mg OD for 7  days. At the 5 -month follow-up visit, the patient had no evidence of recurrence at <b>inspection</b> and <b>reported</b> <b>no</b> urinary or vaginal symptoms.|$|R
