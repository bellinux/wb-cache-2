50|$|The ride {{is located}} {{at the front of the}} park in the Ghosttown area, {{although}} the theme of the coaster doesn't match the rest of the park section. The single blue train rides on orange and yellow rails held by blue (formerly green) structural supports. The coaster features a single loop and a double corkscrew. The actual ride time is very short, as the roller coaster completes the 1,565 <b>foot</b> <b>run</b> in approximately 37 seconds. The ride only has the ability to run one 28 seat train due to lack of block brakes/sections.|$|E
5000|$|The {{outer cover}} was also giving cause for concern. An {{inspection}} by Michael Rope and J. W. W. Dyer, {{head of the}} Fabric Section at Cardington, undertaken on 20 January 1930 revealed serious deterioration of the fabric {{on the top of}} the airship in areas where rainwater had accumulated, and a decision was made to add reinforcement bands along the whole length of the envelope. Further tests undertaken by Rope had shown that its strength had deteriorated alarmingly. The original specified strength for the cover was a breaking strain of 700 lb per <b>foot</b> <b>run</b> (10 kN/m): the actual strength of samples was at best 85 lb (1.24 kN/m). The calculated load at a speed of 76 mph was 143 lb per <b>foot</b> <b>run</b> (2.09 kN/m). A further inspection of the cover on 2 June found many small tears had developed. [...] An immediate decision was taken to replace the pre-doped cover with a new cover which would be doped after fitting. This would take place following the flights which had been planned for June with the purpose of displaying R101 to the public at the Hendon Air Show. For these flights the cover would be further reinforced. Confirmation of the poor state of the cover came on the morning of 23 June when R101 was walked out of the shed. It had been at the mast for less than an hour in a moderate wind when an alarming rippling movement was observed and shortly afterwards, a 140 ft tear appeared on the right-hand side of the airship. It was decided to repair these at the mast and to add more strengthening bands. This was done by the end of the day but the next day a second, shorter, split occurred. This was dealt with in the same way, and it was decided that if the reinforcing bands were added to the repaired area the scheduled appearance at the RAF pageant at Hendon could be made.|$|E

5000|$|The {{conflict}} began {{sometime after}} noon, according to Waco police {{who had been}} monitoring motorcycle club activity at the Twin Peaks restaurant. Initial reports say the original conflict began, allegedly over a parking spot where [...] "someone had their <b>foot</b> <b>run</b> over", and the fight escalated from there. At 12:24 p.m., gunfire erupted. Waco Police Sergeant W. Patrick Swanton declined to reveal details regarding {{how many of the}} dead and injured were shot by police, though he added it was possible that some of the victims had been shot by officers, saying that [...] "They started shooting at our officers and our officers returned fire." [...] In total, nine bikers died and eighteen others were hospitalized with injuries. Later the number of injured was amended to twenty. Swanton also related that officers invoked the [...] "Active Shooter" [...] protocols, which are rules of engagement newly designed and implemented to give first responding law enforcement officers quicker permission to engage with deadly force to sociopathic mass shooters intent on random deaths and then suicide, before a command and control structure is in place. It's unclear how this situation merited such a response. All of the fatalities, as well as the majority of those injured during the melee, suffered gunshot wounds. The shootout was the deadliest and most high-profile event in the Waco area since the Waco siege of the Branch Davidian compound in 1993.|$|E
40|$|Starting with a well file {{provided}} by Groundwater Management Area 12, pumping was adjusted {{to try to}} match adopted desired future conditions adopted on May 26, 2010. An exact match to the desired future conditions (Table 1) could not be achieved because pumping in one area affects drawdown {{in the same area}} and in adjoining areas. Two best fit scenarios were determined: (1) average drawdowns do not exceed the desired future conditions by more than 1 <b>foot</b> (<b>Run</b> 33) and (2) average drawdowns are within 5 feet of the desired future conditions (Run 34). In comparison to the submitted pumping file, Run 33 results in an overall increase in pumping of about 5, 000 acre-feet per year and Run 34 results in an overall increase in pumping of about 9, 000 acre-feet per year. On a district level, a comparison of Runs 33 and 34 to the submitted well file shows pumping increases in Post Oak Savannah and Mid-East Texas groundwater conservation districts and decreases in Lost Pines, Fayette County, and Brazos Valley groundwater conservation districts.
