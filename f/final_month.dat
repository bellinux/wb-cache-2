5|$|The {{activity}} in the first twomonths of the season were limited in tropical cyclogenesis, with the second tropical depression of the season not developing until July 22. Following that, the season was very active, {{and there was a}} quick succession of tropical cyclone development from late-July to mid-August. The Atlantic briefly remained dormant, and activity resumed on August 24 with the development of Tropical Depression Eight (Hurricane Gustav). Although August was a very active month, there were only two named storms in September, both of which became hurricanes. Activity in October was high then average, with five tropical cyclones to either form or exist in the month. Following an active October, no tropical cyclogenesis occurred in the <b>final</b> <b>month</b> of the season, which is November.|$|E
5|$|The <b>final</b> <b>month</b> {{of the war}} {{offered little}} respite to the battalion. In {{the days leading up}} to the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the Liverpool Scottish helped to secure {{numerous}} villages without opposition and crossed the River Scheldt on 9 November. On the day of the Armistice, the Liverpool Scottish was situated at Villers-Notre-Dame. With the 165th and 166th brigades, the battalion had been readied to assault German positions obstructing passage into the town of Ath. Such a prospect was averted, however, when the 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers attacked and seized one of the bridges before it could be demolished.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclogenesis}} first {{occurred in}} the month of June, with two tropical depressions developing in the Atlantic.

September was more active, with seven named storms forming; that month featured Hurricane Keith, the strongest system of the 2000Atlantic hurricane season. In addition, a quick succession of eight storms occurred in September, and lasted into early October. Six tropical cyclones existed in October and one additional subtropical storm developed in the last week of the month.

5|$|Rivera rebounded in 2008 {{and began}} the year with 16consecutive {{scoreless}} innings pitched and 28consecutive save opportunities converted, both personal bests to start a season. His first-half performance, highlighted by a 1.06ERA and 23saves in as many opportunities, garnered him his ninth All-Star selection. Leading up to the 2008 MLB All-Star Game, which was held at Yankee Stadium in the venue's final year of existence, a few sportswriters proposed making Rivera the AL's starting pitcher {{as a tribute to}} him and his home ballpark. He instead was used as a reliever in the AL's extra-inning win. In the <b>final</b> <b>month</b> of the season, he recorded two milestones: on September15, he recorded his 479th save to pass Lee Smith for second all-time in regular season saves; on September21, in the final game at Yankee Stadium, Rivera threw the final pitch in the venue's history, retiring Brian Roberts of the Baltimore Orioles on a ground-out. After the Yankees missed the postseason {{for the first time in}} his career, Rivera disclosed that he had suffered from shoulder pain throughout the year. Tests revealed calcification of the acromioclavicular joint in his throwing shoulder, for which he underwent minor arthroscopic surgery in the offseason.|$|E
5|$|Bengaluru FC {{began the}} season in good form and {{finished}} the first month {{on top of the}} table. Defeat to the previous season league champions Mohun Bagan in February saw the club slip into second place until the <b>final</b> <b>month</b> of the season. However, the club then went seven games unbeaten to return {{to the top of the}} table by April. The title was secured on 17 April when Bengaluru FC defeated Salgaocar at home. After the I-League season, the club were knocked out of the Federation Cup in the first round of the competition by Aizawl. The club started their AFC Cup campaign slowly, losing their first two group stage matches. Three victories in a row however saw Bengaluru FC qualify for the knockout stages. In the Round of 16 the club defeated Kitchee to qualify for the quarter-finals for the first time in club history. 26 different players represented the club in three competitions and there were 12 different goalscorers. Bengaluru FC's top goalscorer was Sunil Chhetri, who scored 9 goals in 20 games. This season was also the last that Bengaluru FC would be under their first coach Ashley Westwood. Westwood left the club after the season concluded.|$|E
5|$|Brandon {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with Division Two side Chesterfield, {{and made his}} debut against Queens Park Rangers {{on the first day}} of the 2002–03 season. Chesterfield lost the game at Loftus Road 3–1. Brandon's first goal for Chesterfield came a week later when he scored a 12-yard overhead kick to give them a late 2–1 victory over Port Vale. He scored again just ten days later as Chesterfield defeated Northampton Town 4–0. His third goal was another volley during a 1–0 victory over Stockport County. However, he was substituted at half-time, and he did not play for another two weeks because of suspension, until he scored again in a League Cup game against West Ham United live on television, which Chesterfield lost on penalties. He scored in both the first and second rounds of the Football League Trophy, but Chesterfield were defeated on penalties by Port Vale in the second round. He finished the season with ten goals but also 11yellowcards. However, he played only one game during the <b>final</b> <b>month,</b> with his last game coming on 21 April 2003, when Chesterfield finished with just nine players because of serious injuries to Brandon and striker Caleb Folan. Chesterfield picked up four points in their final two games without Brandon, and avoided relegation by just one position, finishing two points above Cheltenham Town. Brandon's ten goals meant he finished as Chesterfield's top goalscorer and also helped Brandon win three awards at the club's end of season awards, as well as reported interest from nearby Nottingham Forest, who had missed out on promotion to the Premier League.|$|E

5|$|During the <b>final</b> <b>month</b> {{of the war}} heavy {{fighting}} had occurred across the central and eastern fronts. Yet in the Commonwealth sector itself the only Chinese attacks had been made against 2 RAR holding The Hook on the nights of 24–25 and 25–26 July. The action {{was part of a}} larger attack against the US 1st Marine Division, with only diversionary assaults mounted against the Australians. 1st Commonwealth Division intelligence staff believed that the Chinese had been attempting to make a breakthrough to the Imjin River along the divisional boundary in order to turn the US 1st Marine Division's flank, yet with well-coordinated indirect fires from the divisional artillery and support from the British tanks, 2 RAR had been able to successfully thwart both assaults. Meanwhile, the US Marines had endured the brunt of a divisional-size attack, repelling the Chinese onslaught for the loss of 43 killed and 316 wounded over the two nights; total Marine casualties for July included 181 killed and 1,430 wounded. Indeed, with the Chinese determined to gain local territorial advantage prior to signing the ceasefire, the United Nations Command had suffered 65,000 casualties during the final three months of the war, while the Chinese lost at least 135,000.|$|E

5|$|On July 20, 2006, Booth {{signed with}} the Panthers. Joining the organization, he was {{assigned}} to the Panthers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Rochester Americans, to start the 2006–07 season. Within two months, he was called up to the Panthers on November 20. Making his NHL debut that night against the Boston Bruins, he registered 11-and-a-half minutes of ice time in a 3–2 win.

5|$|That same offseason, Trevor Hoffman {{retired as}} the all-time regular season saves leader {{with a final}} tally of 601, leaving Rivera as the active leader in saves and 42 behind Hoffman's record to start 2011. Rivera's season was marked by several milestones. He broke the all-time record for games finished, and in May, he became the 15th pitcher to make 1,000appearances {{and the first to}} do so with a single team. He was named an All-Star for the 12th time with a 1.85ERA and 22saves in 26opportunities at the midseason break, but for the second {{consecutive}} year, he skipped the game to rest injuries. His pursuit of Hoffman's saves record reached a climax in the <b>final</b> <b>month</b> of the season; on September13, he collected his 600th save, making him just the second pitcher to accomplish the feat. Four days later, he saved his 601st game, tying him with Hoffman for the most in MLB history. Rivera broke the record on September19 at Yankee Stadium by closing out a 6–4 win against the Twins, the final out by strikeout. After the game, Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli called him to offer his congratulations. Rivera finished the season with a 1.91ERA, a 0.90WHIP, and 44saves in 49opportunities, making him the first pitcher over the age of 40 to save at least 40games in a season. In the offseason, he underwent throat surgery to remove polyps from his vocal cords.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season saw a vast {{improvement in}} White's personal performance, as {{he enjoyed the}} finest season of his career, winning Melbourne's best-and-fairest, receiving All-Australian selection, and ranking second in the league for total number of hit-outs. He reached the top ten in the 2004 Brownlow Medal with 15votes, including four best-on-ground displays, with dominant performances against North Melbourne and Fremantle among them. His most productive period came between Rounds 9 and 16, where he recorded three best-on-ground displays, averaged 25hit-outs and received 13Brownlow Medal votes. His Round 6 performance against Carlton is also noted {{as one of his}} career-best performances, with Melbourne winning by more than 100points, as White recorded 26disposals, took eight marks, kicked one goal, and received the three Brownlow votes for his influential display. Coinciding with White's career-best form, Melbourne sat atop the AFL ladder after Round 18, but in the <b>final</b> <b>month</b> of the season, the team lost its last five matches, finishing fifth after Round 22, and losing to Essendon in the Elimination Final. The 2005 season was less successful for both White and Melbourne, with the club struggling to cement a place in the top eight during the year, although they managed to finish seventh after a strong finish to the minor round, and qualify for the club's second consecutive finals series—the first time it had competed in consecutive finals series since 1991. Melbourne again lost in the Elimination Final, this time to Geelong. It was during this match that White sustained his career-threatening facial injury.|$|E
