50|$|The Code which {{applies to}} new gas {{carriers}} (built after 30 June 1986) is the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk. In brief, this Code {{is known as}} the <b>IGC</b> <b>Code.</b> The <b>IGC</b> <b>Code,</b> under amendments to International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), is mandatory for all new ships. As proof that a ship complies with the Code, an International Certificate of Fitness for the Carriage of Liquefied Gases in Bulk should be on board.In 1993, the <b>IGC</b> <b>Code</b> was amended and the new rules came into effect on 1 July 1994. Ships on which construction started on or after 1 October 1994 should apply the amended version of the Code but ships built earlier may comply with previous editions of the <b>IGC</b> <b>Code.</b>|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{analyses}} for intergroup complementary (<b>IGC)</b> <b>code</b> and zero correlation zone complementary code, a novel <b>IGC</b> <b>code</b> has been proposed to adapt M-ary orthogonal code spreading spectrum system or quasi-synchronous CDMA system. The definition and construction methods of the new IGC codes are presented and an applied example is given in this paper. Theoretical research and simulation results show that the main advantages of the novel <b>IGC</b> <b>code</b> are as following: The code sets of the novel <b>IGC</b> <b>code</b> is more than <b>IGC</b> <b>code</b> under the same code length. The zero correlation zone length is longer than the intergroup <b>IGC</b> <b>code,</b> but shorter than the intergroup <b>IGC</b> <b>code.</b> Under the same code length, the auto-correlation performance of the novel <b>IGC</b> <b>code</b> is better than that of the <b>IGC</b> <b>code,</b> and both are of similar cross-correlation performance...|$|E
40|$|LNG is {{becoming}} a common fuel for shipping. With an increasing demand for bunkering possibilities, bunkering vessels for LNG are being built. This report {{is based on the}} theory that a ship-to-ship bunkering operation and a conventional loading/discharging operation at a terminal are different and require different skills from the staff on board. The main questions this report tries to answer is whether the safety risks of the different operations differ and what specific educational demands are placed on those working on board bunkering vessels for LNG and gas tankers for LNG. Today, there is a regulatory framework that both vessel types shall obey, the <b>IGC</b> <b>Code.</b> In addition to the <b>IGC</b> <b>Code,</b> {{there are a variety of}} local rules and guidelines relating to the various operations. We want to see if there is need for a type-specific training for staff who work on board bunkering vessels. A triangulating approach has been the method used during the process. The background section has largely been based on a literature review of previous works and scientific articles relating to the subject. In the discussion and result chapters we have then been able to both verify and question our findings in the background chapter, using information taken from interviews and observations. The result shows that the operations bunkering ship-to-ship vs. loading/unloading at a terminal does not differ in any significant way. The operations are not significantly affected by the size of the ship. However, the result shows that there are in fact different safety hazards onboard the different ships that co-relates with their differences in design, systems, purpose, and the vessels operational pattern. Training requirements do not differ between the two ship types. The report shows that both systems on board the vessels, as well as risks during operations differ. Thus pointing out that further training and education for staff working onboard bunkering vessels is advised...|$|E
40|$|There are {{different}} ways to transport natural gas. One way is to cool it to a temperature of - 162 °C and transport it in liquefied form (LNG). This is both a well known and often used method in the shipping industry. It is also possible to compress the natural gas (CNG) and contain it in cylinders / bottles. The development of the latter has only recently begun, and for now, the only real option {{when it comes to}} transportation of gas at sea is LNG. Nevertheless, the concept of CNG is still very interesting because it has the capability of reaching stranded gas reservoirs. Whereas exploitation of these areas using vessels transporting LNG would be far too expensive, shipping companies have with the introduction of CNG developed a much more cost-effective and less time consuming method. CNG has been discussed within the shipping industry since the 1960 s, but it is recently that the technology has become sufficiently developed. It is only just now that one has obtained the means to finance the project and been able to make it profitable. Unfortunately, since CNG only exists in theory and on paper, the regulatory framework around the concept is not completely developed. In an attempt to explain the CNG concept, I will therefore look at not only the technical, but also the economical and legal aspects concerning the subject. In this paper I will show {{that there is a need}} for CNG and that it is a better economical alternative to the LNG system when it comes to transporting gas over shorter distances. I will also show that although well known international classification societies, such as Det Norske Veritas (DNV) and American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), have developed their own CNG standards it does not mean that the concept is also covered by the mandatory international regulations produced by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). After analysing the legislations of several international maritime conventions and codes, I will demonstrate that there exists a definition problem in the different conventions and that CNG falls outside the scope of some of the most significant codes. I will firstly evoke the technical aspect of the concept by considering the need for this new type of innovation, before I look into the differences between CNG and LNG to verify the cost-effectiveness of the two methods of transportation. The Norwegian shipping company Knutsen OAS is currently developing a CNG vessel and it will therefore be used as an example to illustrate how the system works in practice. The papers fifth section examines if the international maritime classification societies have acknowledged the CNG concept and what the consequences of this is. I will then look at IMO in the attempt to answer the question if CNG is in compliance with the international conventions SOLAS and MARPOL, before I look into the problems of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods code (IMDG) and the more important International Gas Carrier <b>code</b> (<b>IGC).</b> This is important whereas to the survival of CNG. Finally I will also take into consideration the legal aspects of liability using the Harmful and Noxious Substances convention (HNS) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor shuttle {{transport}} of liquid CO 2 in ship-based CCS, the cargo conditions were investigated {{in view of}} the pressure tank manufacturability, the cost of the tanks and the carrier vessel, the total energy efficiency of the CO 2 flow, etc. In a CCS chain, since the critical path might be the injectivity of the well, the unit cargo of a carrier vessel is set to 3000 tonnes, which is equivalent to the Sleipner case, annual injection rate of ca. 1 million tonnes. The physical properties of CO 2, specifically the vapor liquid equilibrium properties of CO 2, are such that the design of a storage tank for the containment of liquid carbon dioxide is very similar to existing designs for intermediate pressure liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) containment systems. The design methodology for LPG cargo tanks is well understood and is regulated by international standards (specifically the “International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk”; <b>IGC</b> <b>code)</b> and Classification Societion Societies (such as DNV, BV and LRS) The disign methodology employed in this study, which is for the marine {{transport of}} LCO 2 is exactly the same as described by the <b>IGC</b> <b>code</b> and subject to Classification Society rules. These design rules are well proven with literally hundreds of LPG carriers operating worldwide in an industry that has an excellent safety record since the advent of LPG bulk marine transport in the early 1960 s. The proposed ship design which installs two cargo tanks was as follows:-the volume of the tanks is about 1500 m 3 and design pressure and temperature are 3. 10 MPa and munus 10 degC, respectively. -The shape of the tanks is a cylindrical bilobe with single cylinder radius of 3. 50 m and 26. 96 m in lengthThe necessary facilities for LCO 2 loading from land-based storage tanks are also examined, including CO 2 buffer storage tanks, the loading pumps, the loading arms, and so on. The offshore delivery and injection system are investigated and the resultant design proposal was as follows: the temperature of the cargo LCO 2 is raised to 5 degC by on-board heat exchange system using the ambient seawater. The cost estimate of the proposed system will be also given in the presentation. The study {{is a part of the}} Preliminary Feasibility Study on CO 2 Carrier for Ship-based CCS and its follow-up study sponsored by Global CCS Institute and conducted by Chiyoda Corporation. The other technical parts of the study are Ship-based offshore CCS featuring CO 2 shuttle ships equipped with injection facilities by M Ozaki et al, “Offshore operational availability of onboard direct injection of CO 2 into sub-seabed geological formations” by T Miyazaki et al, and “Onboard CO 2 injection into subseabed geological formation via picked-up flexible pipe by N.

40|$|ABSTRACTThree {{materials}} SUS 304, 9 % Ni {{steel and}} Al 5083 -O alloy, which are considered possible candidate for International Maritime Organization (IMO) type B Cargo Containment System, were studied. Monotonic tensile, fatigue, fatigue {{crack growth rate}} and Crack Tip Opening Displacement tests were carried out at room, intermediate low (- 100 °C) and cryogenic (- 163 °C) temperatures. The initial yield and tensile strengths of all materials tended to increase with decreasing temperature, whereas the change in elastic modulus was not as remarkable. The largest and smallest improvement ratio of the initial yield strengths due to a temperature reduction were observed in the SUS 304 and Al 5083 -O alloy, respectively. The fatigue strengths of the three materials increased with decreasing temperature. The largest increase in fatigue strength was observed in the Al 5083 -O alloy, whereas the 9 % Ni steel sample showed the smallest increase. In the fatigue crack growth rate test, SUS 304 and Al 5083 -O alloy showed {{a decrease in the}} crack propagation rate, due to decrease in temperature, but no visible improvement in da/dN was observed in the case of 9 % Ni steel. In the Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) test, CTOD values were converted to critical crack length for the comparison with different thickness specimens. The critical crack length tended to decrease in the case of SUS 304 and increase for the Al 5083 -O alloy with decreasing temperature. In case of 9 % Ni steel, change of critical crack length was not observed due to temperature decrease. In addition, the changing material properties according to the temperature of the LNG tank were analyzed according to the international code for the construction and equipment of ships carrying liquefied gases in bulk (<b>IGC</b> <b>code)</b> and the rules of classifications...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{the natural}} gas {{consumption}} is substantially increasing and the forecast for the future indicates that the consumption will keep on increasing. The result {{of this is that}} new innovative solutions are introduced to satisfy the demand from the customers. One of the latest ideas is to use a so-called FSRU GTW-unit, which is a floating unit that contains all the necessary process steps to produce electricity from LNG. This means that the unit will import LNG from a shuttle tanker and export electricity to shore. The objective with this thesis is to identify the hazards relevant to an FSRU GTW-concept and present requirements and recommendations. The hazards in question are those that can risk the safety of personnel, operability and structural integrity. The requirements and recommendations are based on an evaluation of how the hazards are addressed in existing rules and regulations provided by DNV and IMO. This can then be used as input to future rule development. In order to present relevant requirements and recommendations, it is essential to study existing rules in order to find what is applicable on an FSRU GTW-unit, and if there are any gaps or contradictions that need consideration. The rules and regulations that are thoroughly analysed are those provided by DNV and IMO. This analysis is preceded by a thorough study of related technologies and an evaluation of what hazards that are explicitly related to an FSRU GTW-unit. This is done according to IMO’s FSA-methodology with the aid of experts in the fields of electrical equipment, rotating machinery and offshore gas projects at DNV in Hövik, Norway. The FSA-methodology is a risk-based approach used for developing rules and the parts used in this work are those concerning the identification of hazards. It is concluded that there are contradictions and gaps in DNV’s present rules and regulations when applying these on an FSRU GTW-unit. It is, for example, stated by IMO in the <b>IGC</b> <b>Code</b> that boilers, machinery and such should be segregated from the storage facilities. This imposes a problem since the power plant, which consists of such equipment, will most probably be mounted on top of the storage tanks. Furthermore, there exist no explicit rules or design guidelines concerning electrical transmission through a turret. These kinds of contradictions and gaps show {{that there is a need}} for assembling various applicable rules and design guidelines together with additional requirements in a Classification Note for regasification vessels with power generation...|$|E
