From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the <b>killings</b> <b>in</b> Sudan as genocide. Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court.|$|E

5|$|John Bellinger III, {{who served}} as the U.S. State Department's senior lawyer during President George W.

The assassination prohibition does not apply to <b>killings</b> <b>in</b> self-defense.|$|E

5|$|Ranko Marijan, the Justice Minister {{in a new}} government, criticised his {{predecessors}} and the police for their failure to pursue the case, but the authorities failed to protect Levar, who was murdered by car bomb on 30 August 2000. The investigation of the <b>killings</b> <b>in</b> Gospić was a contributing factor in the criticism of the government's efforts by seven active duty and five retired Croatian generals who issued the Twelve Generals' Letter making their grievance public. That led to sacking of the seven active duty officers, including by President Stjepan Mesić. The group included Norac, who had held the rank of major general since September 1995.|$|E

5|$|Accusations of Żydokomuna {{accompanied}} the incidents of anti-Jewish violence in Poland during Polish–Soviet War of 1920, legitimized as self-defense against {{a people who}} were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were enemies of the Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anticommunist sentiment was implicated in anti-Jewish violence and <b>killings</b> <b>in</b> a number of towns, including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, were murdered, and the Lwów pogrom during the Polish-Ukrainian War, in which 72 Jews were killed. Occasional instances of Jewish support for Bolshevism during the Polish-Soviet War served to heighten anti-Jewish sentiment.|$|E
5|$|During the {{genocide}} {{and in the}} months following the RPF victory, RPF soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting {{the genocide}}. Many of these soldiers were recent Tutsi recruits from within Rwanda who had lost family or friends and sought revenge. The scale, scope, and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed. Human Rights Watch, as well as scholars such as Prunier, allege that the death toll might be as high as 100,000, and that Kagame and the RPF elite either tolerated or organised the <b>killings.</b> <b>In</b> an interview with journalist Stephen Kinzer, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control. The RPF killings gained international attention with the 1995 Kibeho massacre, in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in Butare Province. Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed, while the Rwandan government claimed that the death toll was 338.|$|E

5|$|During the {{remainder}} of the day, the Italians collected the bodies of their dead from the rebel ambush on 28 June, and rescued some Home Guard troops that had escaped Avtovac, but then returned to Plana, just north of Bileća. The value of further operations in the Gacko and Avtovac areas was brought into question when the Italians reported that both towns had been burned to the ground, and all the inhabitants had been massacred. The Italians blamed Montenegrins attached to the rebels for the destruction and <b>killings</b> <b>in</b> the two towns. The Italian estimate of rebel strength was around 3,000 armed with machine guns, artillery and anti-aircraft guns. A German intelligence officer from Sarajevo arrived at Prpić's headquarters in Mostar to receive a briefing on the situation. The small garrison of Gacko was anticipating an attack by rebels during the night, but in the afternoon 180 Home Guardsmen that had withdrawn from Avtovac arrived to bolster their position, and the night passed without incident.|$|E
5|$|Following the inquiry, Lyubov {{visits the}} Athshean town {{he had been}} studying. He meets Selver, hoping to rebuild their friendship, but Selver rebuffs him, telling him {{to stay away from}} the town center. Two nights later, Selver leads the Athsheans in a massive attack on Centralville. Although the attack {{deliberately}} avoids Lyubov's house, Lyubov leaves during the attack and is killed by a collapsing building. The attack kills all of the women in the colony; the men that survive are herded into a compound and held prisoner. Selver tells them that the attack was in retaliation for Davidson's <b>killings</b> <b>in</b> the south, which the survivors are ignorant of. Selver states that if the Terrans agree to restrict themselves to a small area and agree to avoid conflict with the Athsheans, they will be left in peace until the next Terran ship arrives to take them off the colony. The survivors agree to his terms, and order all their remaining outposts to withdraw, including the one at which Davidson lives.|$|E
5|$|Standish {{called all}} of the Wessagusset colonists into the stockade for defense. The {{following}} day, several natives including the local chief, Pecksuot, were at Wessagusset. Historical sources give different accounts of the <b>killings.</b> <b>In</b> some manner, four of the natives, including the local chief, {{were in the same}} room as Standish and several of his men. One source, from the 1880s, suggests that it was the natives that arranged to be alone with Standish to allow them to attack the colonist. Others sources state that it was Standish who had invited the natives into the situation on peaceful pretenses. When four of them, including the local chief, were in a room within the village, Standish gave the order to strike, quickly killing Pecksuot with his own knife. Several other natives in the village were attacked next; only one escaped to raise the alarm. As many as five Englishmen were also killed in the brief battle and one native's head was cut off, to be displayed in Plymouth as a warning to others.|$|E
