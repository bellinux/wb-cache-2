25|$|In 1836, the <b>Gobir</b> kingdom revolted {{against the}} Sokoto Caliphate, which had ruled <b>Gobir</b> since its initial conquest in 1808. To crush the rebellion, Sokoto Sultan Muhammed Bello {{and several of}} his allies marched to meet the rebels at Gawakuke, in {{northern}} <b>Gobir</b> territory. Bello's soldiers routed the assembled insurgent army, killing <b>Gobir</b> Sultan Ali, before embarking on a murderous campaign throughout the <b>Gobir</b> kingdom, burning villages and slaughtering peasants.|$|E
25|$|The {{founder of}} the Sokoto Caliphate, Usman dan Fodio, conquered <b>Gobir</b> in 1808 {{towards the end of}} the Fulani War, and annexed the kingdom. However, the <b>Gobir</b> populace despised Sokoto rule, {{engaging}} in frequent revolts and rebellions accompanied by an extensive guerrilla warfare campaign against Sokoto merchants which severely compromised trade within the sultanate. In 1830 the Sokoto Sultan Muhammed Bello agreed to a truce with the <b>Gobir</b> Sultan Ali, splitting the territory in conflict between Sokoto and <b>Gobir</b> control.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Gawakuke was an {{engagement}} fought between the Sokoto Caliphate and the <b>Gobir</b> city-state at Gawakuke in northern Nigeria on 9 March 1836. The battle {{was a victory}} for Sokoto, and secured the <b>Gobir</b> kingdom's subordination to the caliphate.|$|E

25|$|Fulani {{innovations}} in infantry tactics. The cavalrymen of <b>Gobir,</b> under their leader Yunfa, initially mocked {{the inability of}} the Fulani to use horses effectively, but the Fulani replied with their own trump card, massed arrow fire, at the Battle of Tabkin Kwotto. Ordinarily, such fire would have been delivered by scattered bowmen in loose formation, vulnerable to quick charges by the <b>Gobir</b> chevaliers. In this particular battle however, the Fulani anchored their formation in a fairly wooded area, with one flank of their army resting on a lake. Although the cavalry of <b>Gobir</b> outflanked their opponents, the center of the Fulani formation held this strong position. Rather than deploy in the usual open skirmishing order, the Fulani bowmen adopted a square, grouping their archers in a compact block, and concentrating the firepower of their poisoned arrows. This broke the back of the <b>Gobir</b> formations, despite their armor.|$|E
25|$|Two sources {{estimate}} {{the number of}} <b>Gobir</b> casualties to be somewhere between twenty and twenty-five thousand killed.|$|E
25|$|Members of the <b>Gobir</b> aristocracy, however, were {{angered by}} the terms of the truce, and plotted to disrupt the peace. The {{collaborators}} sent a package to Sultan Ali, who had been living in Sokoto territory, containing a set of butcher's knives. As per tradition, this intended insult implied Ali was a slave of the Sokoto Caliphate, outraging the <b>Gobir</b> Sultan. Ali felt he had endured enough ridicule for his peace with the Sokoto and renounced his allegiance to the Caliphate before fleeing to <b>Gobir</b> in order to gather forces. Sultan Ali persuaded other kingdoms in northern Sokoto territory to ally themselves with him, including the Tuareg and Maradi tribes, before leading an assault on the undefended town of Karatu and killing its inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|In 1804 Usman dan Fodio {{launched}} a jihad against <b>Gobir</b> which lasted {{about four years}} and ended in victory for the Muslims.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his life, Bayajidda {{is said to}} have fathered three {{children}} with three different women. Bawo fathered six of his own sons, whose names were Daura, <b>Gobir,</b> Kano, Katsina, Rano, and Zaria (also known as Zazzau).|$|E
25|$|The {{victory was}} the final battle in {{a long history of}} {{conflict}} between <b>Gobir</b> and Sokoto, and secured the kingdom's status as a protectorate of the Sokoto Caliphate. Muhammed Bello established a ribat, or fortified town, in the area to maintain the peace and prevent further uprisings.|$|E
25|$|Sultan Ali and Maradi Chief Raudi were slain in battle, but Tuareg Chief Ibra and Baciri {{managed to}} escape. After the victory, Muhammed Bello and his army rampaged {{throughout}} <b>Gobir</b> territory and slaughtered those {{under the age}} of fifteen as punishment for the attack on Karatu.|$|E
25|$|This {{battle was}} the last {{in a series of}} {{conflicts}} between the <b>Gobir</b> kingdom and Sokoto Caliphate that had lasted for nearly three decades. Muhammed Bello, the Sultan of Sokoto and commander of the army that defeated the rebels, died one year after the battle in 1837, at the age of 56.|$|E
25|$|Talk in Gurina also {{concerned}} events in Hausaland. Word had arrived that Usman dan Fodio had declared a militant jihad on the Hausa leaders. He had installed himself at Gudu and subsequently defeated non-Fulani leaders at <b>Gobir</b> and Kébbi. Usman had now {{turned his attention}} to Bornu and to the vast southlands of Fumbina (modern-day Northern Cameroon).|$|E
25|$|The insurgent {{army was}} {{composed}} of camel-mounted cavalry, archers, and infantry spearmen {{under the leadership of}} <b>Gobir</b> Sultan Ali, Tuareg Chief Ibra, Maradi Chief Raudi, and Ali's brother, Baciri. Their assembled forces met Muhammed Bello's army on 9 March 1836; the armies faced one another in silence before commencing the pitched battle. After a fierce bout of fighting, the Tuareg contingent under Chief Ibra broke, and his troops were scattered. Muhammed Bello's forces pressed the attack and overpowered the remaining rebels, winning a decisive victory.|$|E
25|$|In {{the city}} of <b>Gobir,</b> Usman dan Fodio (1754–1817) accused the Hausa {{leadership}} of practicing an impure version of Islam and of being morally corrupt. In 1804, he launched the Fulani War as a jihad among a population that was restless about high taxes and discontented with its leaders. Jihad fever swept northern Nigeria, with strong support among both the Fulani and the Hausa. Usman created an empire that included parts of northern Nigeria, Benin, and Cameroon, with Sokoto as its capital. He retired to teach and write and handed the empire to his son Muhammed Bello. The Sokoto Caliphate lasted until 1903 when the British conquered northern Nigeria.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the breakup}} of Mali, a local leader named Sonni Ali (1464–1492) founded the Songhai Empire {{in the region of}} middle Niger and the western Sudan and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized Timbuktu in 1468 and Jenne in 1473, {{building}} his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor Askia Mohammad I (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship. By the eleventh century, some Hausa states – such as Kano, jigawa, Katsina, and <b>Gobir</b> – had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing caravans, and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were {{on the periphery of the}} major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.|$|E
2500|$|... (Some {{versions}} of the tale leave Bawo and Magaram out entirely, with Biram, Daura, <b>Gobir,</b> Kano, Katsina, Rano, and Zaria being the sons of Bayajidda and Daurama). Karbagari's descendants, meanwhile, founded the seven [...] "illegitimate" [...] states, the Banza Bakwai.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional weapons saw {{substantial}} use {{well into}} the century, and weapons systems such as cavalry, archers, and spearmen clashed in many areas. The Mandingo horsemen of the Liberian hinterland for example were said to call out to fearful or fleeing infantry opponents with two options: [...] "Stand {{and you are a}} slave; run and you are a corpse." [...] Mounted troops however were far from invincible. Bowmen made up the bulk of infantry strength in many areas, and the use of poisoned arrows and a rapid volume of fire partially offset weaknesses in bow strength and unfletched arrows. Against determined combinations of archers and spearmen, properly positioned and deployed, cavalry could be beaten. Just such a scenario unfolded in 1804, when Fulani groups proclaimed a jihad against the cavalry heavy state of <b>Gobir,</b> in what is today's Northern Nigeria. The Fulani, under Usman Dan Fodio, a religious reformer and teacher, suffered a number of initial setbacks against the fast-moving <b>Gobir</b> cavalry, most notably at the Battle of Tsuntua where some 2,000 men were lost.|$|E
2500|$|Six {{important}} Hausa city states existed Kano, Katsina, Daura, <b>Gobir,</b> Zazzau, and Biram. Kano was {{the most}} important. The city {{was surrounded by a}} wall of reinforced ramparts of stone and bricks. Kano contained a citadel near which the royal class resided. Individual residence was separated by [...] "earthen" [...] wall. The higher the status of the resident the more elaborate the wall. The entranceway was mazelike to seclude women. Inside near the entrance were the abode of unmarried women. Further down were slave quarters.|$|E
2500|$|Continued {{relevance}} of the cavalry-infantry combination. Cavalry still continued to be relevant in the 19th century. The Caliphate of Sokoto, was West Africa's largest single state during this period, and had its genesis in the many Muslim jihads across the region. Sokoto's core strike force was cavalry, although the bulk of its armies consisted of archers and spearmen. On the flat terrain of the savannahs, this combination did relatively well against indigenous opponents, although deployment in forested regions, and operations against fortifications suffered from the problems of earlier eras. Infantry, and their muskets, became increasing more important and dominant in some savannah areas as the decades progressed. Sokoto and several other cavalry-elite empires like <b>Gobir</b> however, continued to place their trust in the traditional weapons and fighting styles. This [...] "old ways" [...] approach of Sokoto {{can be seen in}} such battles as the 1826 clash with the state of <b>Gobir,</b> where some elite units of armored Sokoto cavalry had to be lifted onto their horses, like the medieval knights of Europe. It should be noted however that the cavalry-elites depended heavily for their successes on cooperation with lesser esteemed infantry, who were critical in opening opportunities for attack, fixing an enemy into an unfavorable position, or in suppressing deadly counterfire by poisoned arrows. This conservatism in methods was to continue on into the 20th century, when the Sokoto hosts clashed with the modern weaponry of the British Empire.|$|E

50|$|Usman dan Fodio, an Islamic {{scholar and}} an {{urbanized}} Fulani, had been actively educating and preaching {{in the city}} of <b>Gobir</b> with the approval and support of the Hausa leadership of the city.

When the <b>Gobir</b> Sultan revolted against the Sokoto Caliphate that same year, Sokoto Sultan Muhammed Bello crushed the rebellion at the Battle of Gawakuke.

5000|$|Usman dan Fodio, born in 1751, {{joined a}} growing number of {{traveling}} Islamic scholars through the Hausa kingdoms in the 1770s and became quite popular in the 1790s. [...] Originally, dan Fodio's preaching received the support of the leadership of Gobir; however, as his influence increased and as he began to advocate for self-defense arming by his followers, his favor with the leadership decreased. Sarkin <b>Gobir</b> Nafata, the king of <b>Gobir,</b> placed a series of restrictions on dan Fodio's preaching. [...] In 1801, Sarkin <b>Gobir</b> Yunfa, a former pupil of dan Fodio, replaced Nafata as king of <b>Gobir.</b> However, Yunfa increased the restrictions on dan Fodio and exiled him from <b>Gobir</b> to the village of Degel. A crisis developed later in 1803 when Yunfa attacked and captured many of the followers of a group associated with dan Fodio. Yunfa then marched the prisoners through Degel, enraging many of dan Fodio's followers, who attacked the army and freed the prisoners. Yunfa gave dan Fodio the option of exile before destroying Degel, which led to the large-scale hijra of dan Fodio's community to Gudu. So many people went with dan Fodio throughout the state that on February 21, 1804, Yunfa declared war on dan Fodio and threatened punishment to anyone joining him. [...] Followers of dan Fodio declared him to be the Amir al-Mu'minin, commander of the faithful, and denounced their allegiance to <b>Gobir.</b>|$|E
