25|$|Henry was {{a member}} of the United States Lighthouse Board from 1852 until his death. He was {{appointed}} chairman in 1871 and served in that position the remainder of his life. He was the only civilian to serve as chairman. The United States Coast Guard honored Henry for his work on lighthouses and <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> acoustics by naming a cutter after him. The Joseph Henry, usually referred to as the Joe Henry, was launched in 1880 and was active until 1904.|$|E
25|$|Two {{substantial}} foghorns {{with concrete}} housings {{were built in}} 1866, one {{at the north end}} of the island near the Swine Cave reached by 'the Loups' path and the other at East Trammins on the south end. Both were powered by compressed air that was piped from the lighthouse, where a gas powered compressor was housed until 1911 when oil-powered engines were installed. One of the compressed air pipelines can still be seen within 'the Loups' path that was constructed above it. The compressed air cylinders that held the required store of air are still prominent features, especially at the Trammins foghorn. Both foghorns were decommissioned in 1966 and a Tyfon <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> was used until 1987 when improvements in ship navigation made it also redundant.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{propensity}} for heavy fog {{in some parts}} of the British Isles, <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> rules were established on the UK railway system to keep train traffic moving without incurring the severe delays that would be necessary if drivers had to stop or travel slowly up to each signal and read its indication. During heavy fog, fogsignalmen would be stationed at distant signals with a lantern and detonators – small explosive charges that could be strapped to the rail to be exploded by the wheels of a train. The fogsignalman's duty was to repeat the indication of the signal using his lantern; the semaphore arm was usually obscured by fog and hence invisible to the driver of a moving train. If the distant signal were displaying 'caution' (warning that a signal ahead was at 'danger'), the detonators remained on the rail and the fogsignalman would show a yellow lamp to show 'caution'; if the distant signal were clear, the detonators would be removed from the rails and a green lamp would be displayed.|$|E

500|$|Foundations for a {{lighthouse}} on Lundy were laid in 1787, {{but the first}} lighthouse (now known as the Old Light) was not built until Trinity House obtained a 999-year lease in 1819. The [...] granite tower, on the summit of Chapel Hill, was designed by Daniel Asher Alexander, and built by Joseph Nelson {{at a cost of}} £36,000. Because the site, Beacon Hill, is [...] above sea level, the highest base for {{a lighthouse}} in Britain, the light was often obscured by fog. To counter this problem, the <b>Fog</b> <b>Signal</b> Battery was built about 1861.|$|E
500|$|Completed in 1871, the rebuilt {{light had}} a {{dwelling}} with the attached tower containing a fourth-order Fresnel lens. It retained the original fixed red light, but {{also included a}} fog bell. In 1900, the lighthouse was identified in the Light List as having a red screw-pile structure, a white tower and dwelling with a slate-gray Mansard roof topped with a black lantern. The lighthouse had a <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> that sounded every 15 seconds and was operated by machinery. Although the focal height of the light is unlisted, {{the center of the}} light stood [...] above the ground.|$|E
500|$|In the 1890s, the {{lighthouse}} was first formally proposed {{to mark the}} Norwalk Harbor. In 1899, the United States Congress appropriated $60,000 {{for the establishment of}} a light and <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> at Greens Ledge. In 1900, the Philadelphia Construction Company was contracted to construct the foundation and the superstructure. The design for this type of lighthouse was first realized in 1873, from Major Eliiot of the Lighthouse Board. The foundation form is made of identical curved-iron plates with top inward-pointing flanges that are bolted together and secured with knees. The assembled rings are lowered into the water and filled with concrete or stone, concrete for the Greens Ledge Light. A series of photographs from the work in 1901 shows the assembly of the three lower courses at Wilson's Point, the lowering of the cylinder and the light in the fall of 1901 prior to a deposit of protective riprap.|$|E

500|$|Until 1961 the {{lighthouse}} was administered as a shore station, and subsequently (after the resident population of Stroma had left) {{as a rock}} station. An electric lamp with a maximum power of 1.1 million cp was installed in 1972, utilising a sealed beam optic mounted on a gearless revolving pedestal. By this time the keepers and their families {{were the only people}} living on Stroma. A helicopter pad was installed to enable supplies and personnel to be flown in. In 1997 the station was converted to automatic operation, utilising a 250 watt metal halide lamp which rotates on a gearless pedestal. A lens system from Sule Skerry lighthouse was refitted in the Stroma lighthouse. The old air-driven fog horn was removed and replaced by an electric <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> which is installed on the balcony of {{the lighthouse}}.

40|$|A crucial step {{in early}} {{embryonic}} {{development is the}} determination of different cell fates along the dorsoventral (DV) axis. These cell fates are defined by the spatially and temporally restricted expression of gene sets, controlled by complex gene regulatory networks (GRN). Here, we address {{the evolution of the}} DV-GRN within insects. In the highly derived group of the drosophilids, dorsoventral patterning is dominated by Toll-signaling, which directly controls BMP-signaling. Whereas the DV-GRN of Drosophila melanogaster is well understood, {{little is known about the}} GRN that acts during establishment of the DV axis in more basally branching insects like the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. This work aimed to identify new potential DV patterning genes in Tribolium. To achieve this goal, a comparative transcriptome analysis after knockdown of Toll signaling and BMP signaling components by RNAi was performed. I analyzed the expression patterns of selected subgroups of the 796 differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, functional studies for genes exhibiting typical dorsoventral expression patterns were performed. The results suggest that some of the conserved DV-GRN components (e. g. Tartan) have a stronger and earlier influence on DV patterning in Tribolium. In addition, the expression of Notch signaling components clearly differs from the expression pattern of their Drosophila homologs. But the most striking finding was the identification of Zfh- 1, which is required for maintaining Tc-twist expression during germ band extension and is thus essential for mesoderm development in Tribolium. Besides the establishment of the body axis, morphogenetic movements of epithelial sheets significantly contribute to the development of complex embryonic structures. The <b>Fog</b> <b>signaling</b> pathway is one of the best studied processes in initiating early morphogenetic movements by cell shape changes. Modifications of the acto-myosin cytoskeleton by <b>Fog</b> <b>signaling</b> result in apical cell constrictions which enable bending of epithelial sheets. In Drosophila, loss of <b>Fog</b> <b>signaling</b> causes defects in mesoderm and posterior midgut internalization. So far, it was assumed that <b>Fog</b> <b>signaling</b> is exclusively involved in gastrulation in some highly derived flies. In the second part of this work the role of <b>Fog</b> <b>signaling</b> was analyzed in Tribolium, which possesses a more ancestral mode of embryogenesis. Interestingly, knockdown of important <b>Fog</b> <b>signaling</b> components in Tribolium cause similar defects in ventral furrow formation and internalization of the posterior endoderm. This indicates the conservation of <b>Fog</b> <b>signaling</b> in tissue internalization during gastrulation outside of higher dipterans. In addition, this work presents so far unknown functions of the <b>Fog</b> <b>signaling</b> pathway in formation of the posterior amniotic fold, positioning of the primordial germ cells and spreading of the serosa. Furthermore, the results suggest another conserved more general role of Fog in coordinating cell shape changes in the blastoderm. ...|$|R

50|$|Several {{advances}} in the technology of <b>fog</b> <b>signals</b> were made during the 1850s. In 1851, an experimental air fog whistle and reed horn was installed at Beavertail Lighthouse {{at the entrance to}} Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. At first this sound signal was powered by a horse-operated treadmill and later by an internal combustion steam engine. Around 1851, mechanically rung fog bells were introduced. The striking mechanism was governed by a weight attached to a flywheel, and later internally run by clockworks. The strokes of the <b>fog</b> <b>signals</b> were timed deliberately to afford each signal a unique sound characteristic. The bell signal was gradually replaced by three variations of that instrument. The first was an ordinary locomotive whistle, enlarged and modified and blown by steam from a high-pressured tubular boiler. The second was a reed-trumpet, and in 1866 the third variation, a siren-trumpet. Although the <b>fog</b> bell <b>signal</b> was still used for warning vessels over short distances, other <b>fog</b> <b>signals</b> started to supersede the smaller bell signal. Bells were also used on buoys; later whistling buoys were invented by J. M. Courtenay and were first in use in 1876. The first gas-lighted buoy was installed in 1882. The gong buoy was invented in 1923.|$|R

2500|$|In March 1911 {{the island}} {{was hit by a}} cyclone, {{stripping}} it of soil and vegetation, and damaging the station buildings. As preparation for transferring the light from the Queensland Government to the Commonwealth Lighthouse Service, an evaluation was made by Commander Brewis in 1912, which recommended an upgrade of the light to incandescent mantle and a change of the characteristic to one flash every ten seconds, as well as the installation of a <b>fog</b> <b>signal.</b> The station was transferred to the Commonwealth in 1915, and it was only in 1923 that the recommendation was acted upon, and the light source was upgraded to vapourised kerosene with an intensity of 100,000cd. At the same time, the characteristic was altered, and again in 1930.|$|E
2500|$|The first European {{to record}} Point Arena was Spaniard Bartolomé Ferrer in 1543, who named it Cabo de Fortunas (Spanish for [...] "cape of fortunes"). The cape was renamed to Punta Delgado (narrow point) in 1775 by {{lieutenant}} Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra (commander of the schooner Sonora), {{part of a}} royal expedition chartered {{by the government of}} Mexico to map the north coast of Alta California. Later the point, and the small harbor town south of it, were called Barra de Arena (i.e. sandbar) and finally Point Arena (literally [...] "sand point"). [...] Point Arena is a narrow peninsula jutting around 1/2 mile (800 m) into the Pacific Ocean. This sandbar creates a natural hazard to navigation, and hence the need for a lighthouse and <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> here.|$|E
