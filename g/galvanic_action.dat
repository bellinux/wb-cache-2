60|$|The {{state of}} {{political}} parties in England {{in the spring of}} 1841 offered a most remarkable contrast to their condition at the period commemorated in the first chapter of this work. The banners of the Conservative camp at this moment lowered on the Whig forces, as the gathering host of the Norman invader frowned on the coast of Sussex. The Whigs were not yet conquered, but they were doomed; and they themselves knew it. The mistake which was made by the Conservative leaders in not retaining office in 1839; and, whether we consider their conduct in a national and constitutional light, or as a mere question of political tactics and party prudence, it was unquestionably a great mistake; had infused into the corps of Whig authority a kind of <b>galvanic</b> <b>action,</b> which only the superficial could mistake for vitality. Even to form a basis for their future operations, after the conjuncture of '39, the Whigs were obliged to make a fresh inroad on the revenue, the daily increasing debility of which was now arresting attention and exciting public alarm. It was clear that the catastrophe of the government would be financial.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Effect of {{activating}} {{device on}} the property of tap water was studied by surface tensiometer and pH meter. The {{results showed that the}} surface tension of tap water activated by the device reduced and pH value increased. The variations of surface tension and pH value are connected with flow rates. The larger flow rate, the less variation of surface tension and pH value when at the same cycle time, however, the more variation of surface tension and pH value when at the same activating time. Activated by the device, 17 O NMR half width of tap water reduced from 70. 79 Hz at the inlet to 60. 87 Hz at the outlet. Reduction of surface tension were caused by hydrogen bonds in water clusters which were weakened or broken by far-infrared radiation of functional ceramic ball and <b>galvanic</b> cell <b>action</b> of copper-zinc alloy. Increment of pH value were caused by H in water exchanging with metal cations on surface of far-infrared ceramic balls and dissolved oxygen getting electron and forming OH- 1 with the function of copper-zinc alloy. 1...|$|R

There were veteran Alpine men--steady, quiet, bronzed-looking fellows, some of them--who {{looked as if they}} had often [...] "attacked" [...] and conquered the most dangerous summits, and meant to do so again. There were men, and women too, from England, America, Germany, France, and Russia. Some had been at Chamouni before, and wore the self-possessed air of knowledge; others had obviously never been there before, and were excited. Many were full of interest and expectation, a few, chiefly very young men, wore a blase, half-pitiful, half-patronising air, as though to say, [...] "that's right, good people, amuse yourselves with your day-dreams while you may. We have tried a few weeks of this sort of thing, and have done a summit or two; in imagination we have also been up Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa, and the Matterhorn, {{and a few of the}} Hymalaya peaks, and most of the mountains in the moon, and several of the fixed stars, and--haw--are now rather boa-ord with it all than otherwise!" [...] There were men who had done much and who said little, and men who had done little and who spoke much. There were [...] "ice-men" [...] who had a desire to impart their knowledge, and would-be ice-men who were glad to listen. Easy-going men and women there were, who flung the cares of life behind them, and [...] "went in," [...] as they said, for enjoyment; and who, with abounding animal spirits, a dash of religious sentiment, much irrepressible humour and fun, were really pleasant objects to look at, and entertaining companions to travel with. Earnest men and women there were, too, who gathered plants and insects, and made pencil-sketches and water-colour drawings during their rambles among mountains and valleys, and not a few of whom chronicled faithfully their experiences from day to day. There was a Polish Count, a tall, handsome, middle-aged, care-worn, anxious-looking man, who came there, apparently in search of health, and who was cared for and taken care of by a dark-eyed little daughter. This daughter was so beautiful, that it ought to have made the Count well--so thought most of the young men-- simply to look at her! There was a youthful British Lord, who had come to [...] "do" [...] Mont Blanc and a few other peaks. He was under charge of a young man of considerable experience in mountaineering, whose chief delight seemed to be the leading of his charge to well-known summits by any other and more difficult tracks than the obvious and right ones, insomuch that Lewis Stoutley, who had a tendency to imprudent remark, said in his hearing that he had heard of men who, in order to gain the roof of a house, preferred to go up by the waterspout rather than the staircase. There was an artist, whom Lewis--being, as already observed, given to insolence--styled the mad artist because he was enthusiastic in his art, <b>galvanic</b> in his <b>actions,</b> and had large, wild eyes, with long hair, and a broad-brimmed conical hat. Besides these, there was a Russian Professor, who had come there for purposes of scientific investigation, and a couple of German students, and a Scotch man of letters, whose aim was general observation, and several others, whose end was simply seeing the world.|$|R
60|$|As {{summaries}} {{have been}} given to most of the chapters, it will be sufficient here to recapitulate, as briefly as I can, the chief points. In the first chapter a preliminary sketch was given {{of the structure of the}} leaves, and of the manner in which they capture insects. This is effected by drops of extremely viscid fluid surrounding the glands and by the inward movement of the tentacles. As the plants gain most of their nutriment by this means, their roots are very poorly developed; and they often grow in places where hardly any other plant except mosses can exist. The glands have the power of absorption, besides that of secretion. They are extremely sensitive to various stimulants, namely repeated touches, the pressure of minute particles, the absorption of animal matter and of various fluids, heat, and <b>galvanic</b> <b>action.</b> A tentacle with a bit of raw meat on the gland has been seen to begin bending in 10 s., to be strongly incurved in 5 m., and to reach the centre of the leaf in half an hour. The blade of the leaf often becomes so much inflected that it forms a cup, enclosing any object placed on it.|$|E

5000|$|Polymer {{degradation}} by <b>galvanic</b> <b>action</b> {{was first}} {{described in the}} technical literature in 1990. This was the discovery that [...] "plastics can corrode", i.e. polymer degradation may occur through <b>galvanic</b> <b>action</b> {{similar to that of}} metals under certain conditions and has been referred to as the [...] "Faudree Effect". In the aerospace field, this finding has largely contributed to aircraft safety, mainly those aircraft that use CFRP and has resulted in a wide body of follow-up research and patents. Normally, when two dissimilar metals such as copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) are put into contact and then immersed in salt water, the iron will undergo corrosion, or rust. This is called a galvanic circuit where the copper is the noble metal and the iron is the active metal, i.e., the copper is the positive (+) electrode and the iron is the negative (-) electrode. A battery is formed. It follows that plastics are made stronger by impregnating them with thin carbon fibers only a few micrometers in diameter known as carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). This is to produce materials that are high strength and resistant to high temperatures. The carbon fibers act as a noble metal similar to gold (Au) or platinum (Pt). When put into contact with a more active metal, for example with aluminum (Al) in salt water the aluminum corrodes. However, in early 1990, it was reported that imide-linked resins in CFRP composites degrade when bare composite is coupled with an active metal in salt water environments. This is because corrosion not only occurs at the aluminum anode, but also at the carbon fiber cathode {{in the form of a}} very strong base with a pH of about 13. This strong base reacts with the polymer chain structure degrading the polymer. Polymers affected include bismaleimides (BMI), condensation polyimides, triazines, and blends thereof. Degradation occurs in the form of dissolved resin and loose fibers. The hydroxyl ions generated at the graphite cathode attack the O-C-N bond in the polyimide structure. Standard corrosion protection procedures were found to prevent polymer degradation under most conditions.|$|E

Soon after the {{building}} of ships with iron was commenced, this composite system of construction was adopted in the British merchant service, and some very fast and celebrated vessels were thus constructed. The iron framing, with wooden skin planking, admitted of considerable strength being obtained, and the possibility of sheathing the bottom with metal in order to avoid fouling, appeared to be another advantage in favor of the composite system. Soon, however, it was shown that the <b>galvanic</b> <b>action</b> set up between the copper on the [...] "yellow metal" [...] sheathing, and the iron frames tended to rapidly deteriorate the ironwork, and perhaps, sooner or later, hasten the loss of the vessel. So rapid, indeed, was this wasting of the frame found to be, that for some time past the composite system has been, so far as regards merchantmen, quite abandoned. Some ships, however, are still built [...] "composite" [...] for the Royal Navy, especially such craft as are intended for use on foreign stations, and whose duties would render frequent docking impossible. Such vessels are built with frames of steel, then sheathed with wood, and coppered.|$|E
5000|$|Oxide of iron is used chiefly {{as a base}} in paints {{used for}} {{covering}} ironwork, the theory being that no destructive <b>galvanic</b> <b>action</b> can be set up, as might {{be the case with}} lead paint when used on iron. A variety of red pigments are made from oxide of iron, varying in hue from a pale to a deep brownish-red. They are quite permanent, and may be used under any conditions. The vehicle is a liquid in which the particles of the base are held in suspension, enabling a thin coat of paint to be formed, uniform in color and consistency, and which on drying forms a kind of skin over the surface to which it is applied. For oil paint the vehicles used are oils; for distemper water is employed. The oils used as vehicles are chiefly linseed oil, raw and boiled, and poppy-seed oil. Nut oils are occasionally used for inferior work because they are much cheaper. Linseed oil, the one most commonly used, is obtained from the seeds of flax by warming it and squeezing out the oil under hydraulic pressure. The resultant, which is of a transparent amber color, is known as [...] "raw oil". It is used principally in interiors for light, bright colors, drying somewhat slowly and giving a firm elastic coat. The oil improves by keeping, and is sometimes refined with acids or alkalis.|$|E

Hybrid paint coatings were formulated with 3. 21 wt. % polypyrrole (PPy) deposited alumina-MWCNT inhibitor particles (PDAMIPs) and 70 wt. % zinc contents. Corrosion protection behaviour of the hybrid coatings was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), glow-discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GD OES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and FT-Raman spectroscopy. Immersion and salt-spray chamber tests gave evidence of improved galvanic protection and barrier nature of the hybrid coatings over the conventional ZRPs, whereas inhibited zinc corrosion and ignorable steel corrosion underwent besides lower degradation of the binder. Zinc-rich hybrid paints with either high relative amount of polyelectrolyte-modified or low proportion of functionalised MWCNTs afforded enhanced corrosion prevention.

Polarization experiments were conducted on 6061 -T 6 Al and conductive CFR PMC electrodes to study the mechanisms governing galvanic corrosion in solutions ranging from 0 ppm chloride (Cl−) to 20, 000 ppm Cl − concentrations. Based on the electrochemical characteristics of Al and the CFR PMC and the ohmic loss within the galvanic couple, a model was developed that related the galvanic corrosion rate (iGalv) to the value of ls/m′, which is the ratio of the insulating skirt length to salt loading. Experimental data from the polarization experiments as well as data from monitoring the galvanic couples in the humidity-chamber galvanic experiments were used to generate plots of log ls/m ′ vs log iGalv, which can be used in design to determine proper skirt length for various environments (based on salt-loading levels) to limit the galvanic corrosion rate to a specified value. © The Author(s) 2015.

40|$|The {{electron}} microprobe {{was used}} to study tooth discoloration caused by old silver amalgam fillings. Oscilloscopic displays were obtained for the distribution of tin, silver, and mercury. In addition, a linear graphic display technic on the Enhancitron was used. The oscilloscopic displays showed the migra-tion of tin from the amalgam into the enamel and dentin as opposed to silver or mercury, or both. These findings confirm that tooth discoloration {{is due to the}} presence of tin from the process of corrosion rather than from mercury. Silver amalgam {{remains one of the most}} widely used filling materials in restorative dentistry. However, it becomes tarnished in the oral environment and tends to discolor the tooth substance.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{hydrogen}} absorbed by a high-strength steel during cathodic polarization in near-neutral solutions using rigidly controlled experimental conditions. Direct hydrogen analysis by the vacuum heating technique has been utilized and it has been established that use of high extraction temperatures (i. e. > 300 °C) can lead to errors which are probably associated with a reaction between adsorbed water and the steel. Extraction at 200 °C has been found to give satisfactory results free from this error. The linear relationship between hydrogen absorption and time observed during the early stages of polarization in solutions above pH 4. 0 was considered to be characteristic of a rate-controlled slow discharge mechanism of hydrogen evolution. The relationship between hydrogen absorption and overvoltage has been studied in the range pH 4 - 10; the results were found to conform with those anticipated from the kinetics of hydrogen evolution. Metallurgical structure was found to exert a strong influence on the ability of the steel to absorb hydrogen, and a modification of previous theories on delayed failure due to hydrogen has been proposed {{on the basis of the}} present study. The influence of arsenic additions to the solution on hydrogen absorption during cathodic polarization have been studied. It has been found that there is a region of pH and overvoltage where hydrogen uptake is inhibited and these results have been correlated with sustained load experiments.

40|$|Aluminized steel Type 2 (AST 2), {{often used}} for culvert pipes, is subject to {{corrosion}} {{which is the most}} important durability limitation factor. It was desired to determine if the outer aluminized layer will retain passivity and if protective <b>galvanic</b> <b>action</b> will develop. Thus, corrosion of unblemished and blemished AST 2 surfaces was investigated in simulated natural waters. Experiments with unblemished specimens showed passive corrosion rates (0. 06 µm/yr) in scale-forming, 0. 01 M Cl- solutions but sustained corrosion in other less protective media (with rates 3 10 µm/yr). Corrosion was manifested macroscopically by discoloration and few macro pits, but it likely proceeded also microscopically at the Fe-rich inclusion space scale. For blemished specimens, the aluminized coating galvanically protected to some extent the steel in all solutions. However, in 0. 01 M Cl- solutions, protection was delayed until after some steel corrosion had occurred. In some solutions, complete consumption of the outer aluminized coating around exposed steel was noted. Elsewhere, coating appearance was {{similar to that of the}} unblemished condition. Nominal durability projections made for 16 -gage AST 2 ranged from 3 ̆e 100 yr for unblemished AST 2 to 10 yr for the blemished condition. The present findings were used as a first step in proposing refinements of presently used durability guidelines of AST 2 culvert pipe. Cyclic cathodic polarization tests to examine O 2 and H 2 reduction at the Fe-rich inclusions showed significant hysteresis, more pronounced with decreasing scan rate. The effect was tentatively associated to the amount of Fe+ 2 being deposited during the downward scan, a hypothesis supported by results from a physical model. A static polarization model was formulated for the blemished configuration. Results matched experimental trends and permitted evaluating the effect of solution conductivity s beyond the experimental range. Exposed steel corrosion rates at the steel were increasingly large for decreasing s. For the lowest s, corrosion rates at the exposed steel center were distinctly larger than at the edge, consistent with experiments. An impedance behavior model was also formulated. Results showed frequency dependent current distribution and predicted relatively small artifacts that were and not evident experimentally, but should be considered when exploring other system conditions...|$|E
