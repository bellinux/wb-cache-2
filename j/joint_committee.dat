5|$|After Republicans {{gained control}} of the Senate in 1981, Mathias sought the {{chairmanship}} of the Judiciary Committee but was relegated to the relatively mundane chairmanship of the Rules Committee. He was also appointed chairman of the Government Operations Subcommittee on Government Efficiency and the District of Columbia, and accepted a seat on the influential Foreign Relations Committee, though he had to sacrifice his seat on the Appropriations Committee to do so. In 1982, Mathias chaired a bipartisan Senate inquiry into the methods used by the FBI in the Abscam corruption investigation, which found that dozens of officials had been named for accepting bribes without basis. He also served as co-chair of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Committee</b> on Printing from 1981 to 1983 and 1985 to 1987, and {{as a member of the}} <b>Joint</b> <b>Committee</b> on the Library from 1983 to 1987.|$|E
5|$|As he had as {{governor}} of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on the <b>Joint</b> <b>Committee</b> on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government {{millions of dollars in}} printing costs by printing in volume and using recycled paper. In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would have eliminated the <b>Joint</b> <b>Committee</b> on Printing, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the administrator of the Government Printing Office. It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Committee</b> on Printing in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.|$|E

30|$|They {{are called}} <b>joint</b> <b>committees</b> (‘commissions paritaires’) because {{employers}} and employees are equally represented. As the notion of economic sector is sometimes very narrowly defined, the number of <b>joint</b> <b>committees</b> exceeds 100. The outcome of these sector-specific negotiations cannot undercut the legally determined guaranteed minimum wage. The actual minimum pay by sector, occupation and sometimes age or tenure, defined within <b>joint</b> <b>committees,</b> therefore exceeds the legally guaranteed minimum.

5|$|The MS {{changed its}} name to the Great Central Railway (GCR) in 1897 and the Great Central Main Line from London Marylebone to Manchester Central opened for {{passenger}} traffic on 15 March 1899. Negotiations about the line between the GCR and the Met took several years and in 1906 it was agreed that two tracks from Canfield Place to Harrow would be leased to the GCR for £20,000 a year and the Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Railway was created, leasing the line from Harrow to Verney Junction and the Brill branch for £44,000 a year, the GCR guaranteeing to place at least £45,000 of traffic on the line. Aylesbury station, which had been jointly run by the GWR and the Met, was placed with a <b>joint</b> <b>committee</b> of the Great Western & Great Central and Metropolitan & Great Central Joint Committees, and generally known as Aylesbury Joint Station. The Met & GC <b>Joint</b> <b>Committee</b> took over the operation of the stations and line, but had no rolling stock.

The Met maintained the line south of milepost 28.5 (south of Great Missenden), the GCR to the north.|$|E
