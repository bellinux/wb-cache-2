5|$|Some {{scientists}} <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> life on Earth {{could have}} been blasted into space by asteroid collisions and arrived on the moons of Jupiter in a process called lithopanspermia.|$|E
5|$|Many authors <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> at {{the core}} of this {{symbolic}} explosion, and in tandem, was the development of syntactic language that evolved through a highly specialized social learning system providing the means for semantically unbounded discourse. Syntax would have {{played a key role in}} this process and its full adoption could have been a crucial element of the symbolic behavioral package in the MSA.|$|E

50|$|Calic <b>has</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> {{the first}} page of the {{original}} shorthand text is lost.|$|R
50|$|The {{automotive}} press <b>has</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> some GMT900 SUV models {{may move}} to the GM Lambda platform.|$|R
5|$|Some <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> a {{contributor}} to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation. By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the haute cuisine style of cooking, {{although much of the}} lighter presentations and new techniques remained.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the cats}} were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the import certificates, {{and because the}} Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> the Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, {{as well as the}} Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|E
5|$|From ca. 1088 on, he {{used his}} base at Smyrna to wage war against the Byzantines. Employing Christian craftsmen, he built a fleet, with which he {{captured}} Phocaea and the eastern Aegean islands of Lesbos (except for the fortress of Methymna), Samos, Chios and Rhodes. A Byzantine fleet under Niketas Kastamonites was sent against him, but Tzachas defeated it in battle. Some modern scholars <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> his activities during this time {{may have been in}} conjunction, and perhaps even coordination, with two contemporary Byzantine Greek rebels, Rhapsomates in Cyprus, and Karykes in Crete.|$|E
50|$|One source <b>had</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> the {{red lights}} {{may have been}} sky {{lanterns}} released during a celebration.|$|R
50|$|Boris Vipper <b>has</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> Rastrelli's last (and unfinished) {{design was}} for the Neoclassical Zaļenieki Manor near Mitava.|$|R
500|$|Other scientists' views differ. Sara Seager at MIT <b>has</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> Gliese 581c {{and other}} five-Earth-mass planets could be: ...|$|R
5|$|No {{music that}} can be {{definitively}} traced to Nero has been identified, although Handel scholars <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> some of {{it may have been}} used in later works, particularly Agrippina which has a related storyline and some of the same characters. Fragments of music from Florindo and Daphne have been preserved, although without the vocal parts, and some of these elements have been incorporated into an orchestral suite first recorded in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Some science-fiction fans <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> the Quatermass serials in general, and Quatermass II in {{particular}} — with its elements including a {{conspiracy of silence}} in the government concerning extraterrestrial life, secret government facilities for alien use, and the silencing of any critic who opposes the government's plans — influenced the successful American series The X-Files (1993–2002). Kneale was invited to write for The X-Files during the 1990s, but declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|The {{extinction}} {{of the dinosaurs}} {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period is generally thought to have been caused by the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event, which created the Chicxulub crater, demonstrating that impacts are a serious threat to life on Earth. Astronomers <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> without Jupiter to mop up potential impactors, extinction events might have been more frequent on Earth, and complex life might not have been able to develop. This is part of the argument used in the Rare Earth hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|Christian Settipani <b>has</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> Valerius Maximus {{married the}} {{daughter}} of Septimius Bassus and had a son Valerius Maximus.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Johnson was apprenticed to George Keith, a London {{bookseller}} {{who specialized}} in publishing religious tracts such as Reflections on the Modern but Unchristian Practice of Innoculation. As Gerald Tyson, Johnson's major modern biographer, explains, it was unusual for the younger son of a family living in relative obscurity to move to London and to become a bookseller. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> Johnson was indentured to Keith because the bookseller was associated with Liverpool Baptists. Keith and Johnson published several works together later in their careers, {{which suggests that the}} two remained on friendly terms after Johnson started his own business.|$|E
5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might have destroyed the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and {{had started to}} climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E
50|$|Welles never {{recorded}} the opening narration. Bogdanovich <b>has</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> {{he could do}} the narration instead, in character as Otterlake.|$|R
50|$|Elisa Kay Sparks <b>has</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> Lily Briscoe, a {{character}} in Virginia Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse, was named after Bristow.|$|R

5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of the Catholic faith, and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E
5|$|Flint scrapers, {{knives and}} other {{materials}} associated with neolithic humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local antiquarians such as Charles Roeder. The Roman road from Manchester (Mamucium) to Ribchester (Bremetennacum) roughly followed {{the line of the}} A56 road (Bury New Road) which is just to the east of Kersal Moor. There was a Roman camp at Rainsough just to the west, and some <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> {{there may have been a}} second camp to the east, in the area known as Castle Hill, making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of Mamucium.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of Elizabeth's reign, it was {{expected}} that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships, or that she knew herself to be infertile. She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.|$|E
50|$|Some reviewers <b>had</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> {{he could}} <b>have</b> been Charlie Pickett, the Tennessee-based guitarist who {{recorded}} for Vocalion Records in 1937.|$|R
25|$|The {{battle is}} not {{mentioned}} in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and H. P. R. Finberg <b>has</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> this is because Wessex was defeated.|$|R

5|$|In 1977, Charles Kowal {{discovered}} 2060 Chiron, an icy planetoid with {{an orbit}} between Saturn and Uranus. He used a blink comparator, the same device that had allowed Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto nearly 50 years before. In 1992, another object, 5145 Pholus, {{was discovered in}} a similar orbit. Today, an entire population of comet-like bodies, called the centaurs, is known {{to exist in the}} region between Jupiter and Neptune. The centaurs' orbits are unstable and have dynamical lifetimes of a few million years. From the time of Chiron's discovery in 1977, astronomers <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> the centaurs therefore must be frequently replenished by some outer reservoir.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Wilders {{was elected}} for the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) to the {{municipal}} council of Utrecht, {{the fourth largest}} city of the Netherlands. He lived in Kanaleneiland, a suburb with cheap social housing and high apartment blocks, which has a relatively high number of immigrants. While a city councilor, Wilders was mugged in his own neighbourhood; some <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> this may have catalysed his political transformation. He was not rewarded for his time on the municipal council of Utrecht, for in the following elections he would score well {{below the national average}} in the University city.|$|E
5|$|Structure 4 {{is another}} pyramid-temple {{base on the}} west side of Plaza C. It has a low {{platform}} at its southeastern corner, where 48 severed heads were excavated immediately to the west. Schele and Mathews <b>have</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> these may be the heads of the K'iche' kings Tepupul and Itzayul together with other members of the K'iche' court who were captured by the Kaqchikels and decapitated. Most of the skulls were found with associated obsidian blades. Most of the skulls had been individually buried in pits cut into the floor of the plaza, although a few were grouped into small lots.|$|E
50|$|Grumeaza <b>has</b> <b>speculated,</b> <b>that</b> {{after this}} victory, Diurpaneus {{received}} {{the name of}} Decebalus, a term he translated as meaning as strong as ten wild men.|$|R
50|$|Steven Bird <b>has</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> E1b1b1a {{was spread}} during the Roman era through Thracian and Dacian populations from the Balkans {{into the rest}} of Europe.|$|R
50|$|Historian Peter M. Bowers <b>has</b> <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> the V.1-V.3 {{were in fact}} {{proof of}} concept {{aircraft}} as they were too under-powered for actual use as fighters.|$|R
