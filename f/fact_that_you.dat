500|$|The song created {{controversy}} over the writing credits. Steve Wallace, an Indiana songwriter, claimed he wrote [...] "Sometimes" [...] in 1990, but didn't copyright it until 2003, four years after Spears registered the song's copyright. Wallace claimed Spears confessed he wrote the song, by showing to the court a possible e-mail from the singer, which said, [...] "I now know for a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wrote [...] But there's nothing I can do about it. That's all I can say about it." [...] The e-mail was considered fake and the lawsuit was dismissed on October 31, 2005, when Judge John D. Tinder claimed the singer didn't steal the song.|$|E

[...] The songs, described by Rolling Stone as [...] "guitar-light, electronics heavy, with uncharacteristically subtle choruses", were missing what the Edge called [...] "the hallmarks of [...] work—the big music." [...] The band also took to heart advice that producer Rick Rubin had given them during recording sessions with him in 2006; Rubin pointed out that the group used unique sounds and arrangements to [...] "disguise the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't have a song", and he stressed the importance of songcraft and writing music that could play well even when stripped down to vocals and piano.|$|E

Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. [...] "I think [...] cast women down in the earlier books, {{but when you look}} at The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman." [...] Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because [...] "The kids are growing up.

[...] He knew it had to be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but [...] " [...] the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can have a wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{wrote that}} the episode was [...] "just right" [...] for the series, and that it {{highlighted}} the fact that [...] "the ending was more about the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> took a journey with these characters."

[...] Poniewozik was slightly critical of Pam and Jim's story, noting that {{in the grand scheme of}} the show it was successful, but that it makes slightly less sense when one examines it closely; however, he felt that even [...] "if the details don't add up, the emotions do". He concluded that the episode [...] "worked mostly as an epilogue" [...] and allowed the cast of the series to have their final moments.|$|E
500|$|The {{central theme}} of the movie is {{discussed}} in the film's fourth scene. Witwer discusses the PreCrime system with the division's staff. He believes that its main [...] "legalistic drawback" [...] is that it [...] "arrests individuals who have broken no laws." [...] Jad responds, [...] "But they will!" [...] When Anderton later arrives upon this discussion, he acknowledges the paradox Witwer raises; that the precogs' prevent an event accepted as fact, but one which will never happen. To show him that people regularly use predetermination, Anderton picks up a wooden ball and rolls it toward Witwer, who catches it before it lands on the ground. When asked why he caught the ball, Witwer says [...] "Because {{it was going to}} fall." [...] Anderton replies, [...] "But it didn't." [...] Then confidently tells him, [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> prevented it from happening doesn't change {{the fact that it was}} going to happen." [...] Kowalski feels this example is faulty in the sense that the ball has no free will; it merely acts according to the laws of physics, but he acknowledges that if an individual were to have freely chosen to commit murder, then it would hold. Film scholar Stephen Mulhall points out that unlike the laws of physics which have a series of scientifically testable causal laws, Anderton merely has the visions of the precogs', whose psychic abilities are not fully explained by science.|$|E

500|$|After Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite was completed, the {{finished}} recordings {{were presented to}} Columbia Records in mid 1995. It was shelved for nearly a year, because of issues with Columbia's management, the label's extensive reorganization, and record executives' doubts regarding the album's commercial potential. The marketplace dominance of hip hop soul in 1995 was in contrast with Maxwell's monogamous themes and older soul influences, which Columbia worried would be interpreted as old-fashioned. The label's executives also feared that his romantic concept and image would not appeal to listeners. Maxwell made matters worse by refusing to allow his picture {{to be placed on}} the album's front cover; instead he preferred to have the track listing and other information he felt was more important about the album in place of his photo. Regarding the cover, Maxwell later said [...] "I wanted people to have the facts: the title, the selections and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had to basically buy it. I wanted people to come to the music and not base any opinion on the image". Columbia reached a compromise with Maxwell and used a promotional shot of him as the back cover. The album's front cover art also features a picture of a pair of golden women's shoes {{on the floor of a}} hotel room, with the bar coding prominently displayed. In the period before its release, Maxwell wrote and demoed songs for a subsequent studio album, and embarked on an African American college tour with Groove Theory and the Fugees.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Forget About Us" [...] is a mid-tempo song lasting {{three minutes}} and fifty-three seconds, while drawing {{influence}} from pop and R with downtempo beats music genres. Written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox and Johntá Austin, and {{produced by the}} former three, the song drew comparisons to Carey's [...] "We Belong Together". According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, the song features a similar tempo, lyrical style, instrumentation and production as the latter song, and incorporates a reminiscent vocal performance from Carey. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 72 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of G minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of D3 to the high-note of F6. Lyrically, the song describes the potency of a [...] "first love", and features a protagonist pleading to her lover to [...] "not forget about them". Critics noted that the song's lyrics both let go of a lover, as well as cherishing their memory. Carey sings, [...] "You just let it die / With no goodbyes", indicating a relationship that has long decayed, and how she has let it drift away, while also adding, [...] "There's only one me and you / And how we used to shine / No matter what you go through / We are one, that's a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't deny", indicating that while {{they are no longer}} together, she will continue to cherish the memory of them and how strong their love was. According to Carey, she refrained from giving away too much of the song's lyrical meaning, in order to allow fans to possibly interpret the song in their own way: ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline a [...] "much less extreme reversal" [...] of the season two episode [...] "The Story on Page One", in which Peter {{attempts}} to seduce actor Luke Perry. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "It was disappointing to see Family Guy bury a guest star like Kaitlin Olson in the background for much of her episode as Quagmire's sister last week, but it was even worse {{to see the show}} waste Ryan Reynolds." [...] He continued, [...] "He may not fit an empirical definition of a movie star, but I think he’s worth more as a guest than a tired trope like playing himself as a sexual predator towards Peter." [...] McFarland also criticized the episode's two storylines, noting, [...] "Both plots paint themselves into a corner with no time to get out. In the third act, Stewie is trapped at Consuela's house and Peter hadn't succumbed to Reynolds' repetitive and slowly escalating advances or done anything about them, so the show snaps its fingers and ends each one prematurely." [...] He graded the episode as a C-. In a much more positive review, Terron R. Moore of Ology criticized the episode for not featuring Griffin family siblings Chris and Meg, but praised the series for adopting a Stewie-centric storyline. Moore noted of the storyline involving Reynolds, [...] "All pretty funny stuff, but Ryan Reynolds' entire guest slot is based on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> like Ryan Reynolds and his occasionally homoerotic humor, which I can definitely appreciate." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "Not the best Family Guy, but a definite improvement on the week before, using some of the elements it knows best." [...] Andy Neuenschwander of Yidio also gave mixed reaction to the episode, writing, [...] "Something happens whenever a celebrity shows up on [...] "Family Guy" [...] and plays themselves. I can't quite put my finger on it, but everything just feels a bit off. This episode, which featured Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds, only confirmed that feeling." [...] He also compared it to The Simpsons, noting, [...] "Maybe it's the way the celebrity is treated as a character: in shows like The Simpsons, celebrities who play themselves appear as a relatively normal version of themselves [...] But on Family Guy, celebrities tend to appear as some bizarro version of themselves." ...|$|E
