50|$|Ben and Norah, whose {{relationship}} is floundering, tour {{an island in}} Asia. However, they find that mutant giant animals are wreaking havoc, and they are desperate to escape. At {{the beginning of the}} tour, Ben appears nervous, while Norah attempts to calm him down. One of their guides is killed by a large tarantula, terrifying the both of them. They are then given FN FAL assault rifles with which to defend themselves against the spider swarms. Eventually, their vehicle crashes; however, before they can ask the driver what happened, the driver exits the vehicle and runs away in panic. They immediately discover why; a giant, <b>purple</b> <b>tarantula</b> has found them. They manage to escape it by driving their vehicle over a broken bridge, jumping over a cliffside in the process. Ben's map shows them that they have two options where to go next: a cave or a river.|$|R
50|$|On {{the third}} stage (which is {{compulsory}} to play on), the player(s) travel through an abandoned village, only to be attacked by more tarantulas and mutated fleas, as they leave the village they are attacked by pillbugs. They must also travel across several stone pillars by pressing the button {{at the right time}} to avoid the attention of another large <b>purple</b> <b>tarantula</b> (Similar to the one seen on the first stage). They cross a river (due to the bridge being broken) and must fight off schools of mutated piranha fish, the tree frogs again, and several mutated crustaceans that resemble pond skaters. They hear a young boy calling for help and the player must use the buttons to help him save his elephant by hitting mutated fleas off its body. The boy then thanks them by letting them ride his elephant to the heli-pad, which will help them escape. On the way they encounter yet another tarantula, this time with mushrooms growing out of its back. The player fatally injures it but does not kill it, instead its falls off the cliff that they are on, into the sea.|$|R
