50|$|The priory complex also {{incorporated}} a substantial gatehouse {{as well as}} columbarium, the inside walls of which are built in square compartments in regular tiers to a height of fifteen feet. There are some three hundred and fifty two niches, divided into eleven tiers each containing thirty-two compartments. The tiers begin above ground level so as {{to allow for the}} collection of droppings and end well below the <b>flight</b> <b>hole</b> in the roof since doves will not perch near busily frequented exits. The columbarium at Ballybeg, is typically located away from the main priory buildings, and still conserves a string course around the circumference of the building which served not only as a structural strengthening of the building but also to prevent weasels, martens or other vermin from scaling the walls to the entrances. The columbarium's importance stemmed from its having been a source of revenue for the priory as its principal agricultural purpose was the production of fertiliser. Pigeon fertiliser (guano) was essential for herb gardens and economically more highly valued than equivalents produced by cattle, sheep or pigs. It was also a sine qua non for the successful growing of hemp which was widely used for cloth, rope and sack making. An example of the economic importance attached to pigeon guano may be gauged from the miniature for the month of February, painted by the Limburg brothers in 1416, in the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, presently conserved at Chantilly, in the Musée Condé (Ms 65).|$|E
40|$|The pine {{bark beetle}} {{is a general}} term for those beetles which {{penetrate}} the bark {{and live in the}} bast and sap wood, such as Ipidae, Curculionidae, Cerambycidae and so on. But much in this field is left ecologically unexplored, and the students are by no means many. The writer studied th typical species from the standpoint of physiological ecology and arrived at some conclusions concerning the effect of temperature on the activities of adult and larva, hatching, growth rate during the period of larva, and the development at every stage of population. 1) Thermal reaction was studied after Motomura's rising temperature method (1938). As a result of experiments, it was revealed that, Ipidae can withstand both high and low temperatures, and show great adaptability. Cerambycidae are affected by low temperatures most easily of all kinds of pine bark beetles, but can withstand high temperatures. In the case of Curculionidae, adult has a wider range of activity than larva, and this species stands in between the above-mentioned two species in activity. Their activities in the field were also observed. Ipidae are active both in winter and in midsummer, and are distributed throughout the country. Cerambycidae do much damage in high summer, and many kinds are of southern origin. Their distribution is limited to Honsyu and southward. Ceramb ycrdaeaie activ eduring the damp season of May and June. Most of this species are of southern origin and primary harmful insects. Those northern origin are few. 2) Relations between the hatching of Ipidae and temperature were studied using over-saturated salt solutions of ZWOLLEFER. Hatching took place at temperatures ranging from 13 °C to 33 °C, and relative humidity was 90 % with Myelophilus piniperda Linnaeus, and more than 70 - 80 % with Cryphalus fulvus Niijima. A considerably high humidity is required. It seems that this is because egg are lacking the controlling mechanism against physical loss of water, but since in the field they are laid beneath the bark where the humidity is high, it is inferred that the hatching rate is considerably high, The length of time necessary for hatching shortens according as the temperatures rises, but the length of time is not uniform at low temperatures. In the case of Myelophilus piniperda Linnaeus, the period of egg stage shortens with a fall in humidity, {{and in the case of}} Cryphalus fulvus Niijima, the period of egg stage lengthens with a fall in humidity. 3) Individual breeding of pine bark beetles was carried out, and date for determining instar were obtained by measuring the head width. Growth rate was apploied to various formula, and their adaptability was tested, and at the same time individual variation was discussed. In the case of Myelophilus piniperda L., the growth rate is almost the same in every instar, and the growth rate is applicable to GAINES and CAMPBELL's formula the best. In the case of Cryptorrhynchus insidiosus Roelofs, there are the 7 th and 8 th instar larvae, and in both cases the growth rate applies to GAINES and CAMPBELL's formula and Tokunaga's formula the best. In the case of Monochamus tesserulla white, the number of moulting is not definite, but the 7 th, 8 th and 9 th instar larvae are found. It seems that this variation is due to the influence of temperature, humidity and nourishment. The growth rate applied to GAINES and CAMPBELL's formula the best in the　 7 th and　 8 th instar larvae. Myelophilus piniperda L. have the least individual variations, while Monochamuo tesserul White are most varies both in number of moulting and growth rate, and Cryptorrhynchus insidiosus Roelofs stands between the two. 4) The development of population of Ipidae was studied using boxes of　fixed temperature (30 °c, 24 °c and 16 °c). In the case of Myelophilus piniperda Linnaeus, at 24 °c, larva group appears 5 - 20 　days later, pupa group 25 days later and new adult group appears 35 days later, and then <b>flight</b> <b>hole</b> takes place in 40 days. At 16 °c, larva group appears 15 - 45 　days later, pupa group 55 days later and adult group appears 65 days later, but the process is not uniform. In the case of Cryphalus fulvus Niijima, at 30 °c, larva group appears after the lapse of 5 - 15 days, and though pupa group is not marked because of the short period, adult group appear in some 20 days and at the same time <b>flight</b> <b>hole</b> takes place. Adults live for about 30 days, and eggs are laid for 20 days. At 16 °c, larva group appears 5 - 30 days later, pupa group 35 - 40 days later and at the same time adult group appears sporadically. <b>Flight</b> <b>hole</b> takes place on the 45 th day, but few of the new adults fly out because of the low temperature. Adults can live for about 40 days, and at the same time eggs are laid little by little...|$|E

50|$|This balloon was {{launched}} from an outdoor skating rink at Sherwood Park, Alberta, Canada, on August 5, 2000. It reached 30,322 meters (99,481 feet) before the balloon burst. It {{landed in the}} Battle River south of New Norway, but was successfully recovered. This payload contained the same tracking system as proven on BEAR-1, {{as well as a}} highly modified Icom IC-24AT handheld configured for crossband repeating. The radio was configured to receive on 446.100 MHz in the UHF band, and repeat the audio automatically on 146.520 MHz in the VHF band. Contacts were made with stations from Cold Lake, AB to Swift Current, SK as well as numerous contacts in the Edmonton, Red Deer, Calgary corridor in Alberta. A last-minute addition to the payload was an inexpensive digital camera. This camera was found to cause interference with the crossband radio on board, and was therefore turned off for the <b>flight.</b> The <b>hole</b> in the payload container for the camera ended up becoming an entry point for water from the river, causing major damage to the onboard electronics. This flight was originally scheduled to fly on July 15, 2000, but was scrubbed early in the evening of July 14 due to a tornado touching down at Pine Lake. Frequency and personnel resources were needed for disaster recovery efforts {{over the next few days}} dealing with the aftermath of the event, which left 12 dead.|$|R
2500|$|On 10 July 1972, while moored at Pier 12, Norfolk, Forrestal {{was once}} again {{the scene of a}} catastrophic fire.

30|$|PC {{oscillations}} {{are visible}} also in superlattice structures [24], {{but they are}} based to the strong carrier coupling among the wells, leading to the occurrence of negative differential resistance (NDR) via sequential resonant tunnelling between adjacent QWs. However, because of the thick GaAs barriers between adjacent QWs in our structures, sequential resonant tunnelling is unlikely to occur. Hence, {{we did not observe}} any NDR. Thermionic emission from the QWs and Fowler-Nordheim [33] tunnelling from the well adjacent to the n-type bulk region are instead the two likely electron escape mechanisms. The hole capture time by the QWs is much longer than the <b>hole</b> <b>flight</b> time between adjacent wells so that the holes transfer rapidly to the p-region of the device without being captured [31]. This results in the net negative charge accumulation in the wells. PC oscillations do not occur in samples with a strong hole confinement, i.e. in samples with high In concentration as implied by Chen et al. [34] where the indium concentration was 35 % and the nitrogen 0.23 %, with ΔEC[*]=[*] 510  meV and ΔEV[*]=[*] 130  meV.|$|R
50|$|Star Wars (1977) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) were box-office hits {{that brought}} about a huge {{increase}} in science fiction films. In 1979, Star Trek: The Motion Picture brought the television series {{to the big screen}} for the first time. It was also in this period that the Walt Disney Company released many science fiction films for family audiences such as The Island at the Top of the World, Escape to Witch Mountain, The Black <b>Hole,</b> <b>Flight</b> of the Navigator, and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. The sequels to Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), also saw worldwide box office success. Ridley Scott's films, such as Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982), along with James Cameron's The Terminator (1984), presented the future as dark, dirty and chaotic, and depicted aliens and androids as hostile and dangerous. In contrast, Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), {{one of the most successful}} films of the 1980s, presented aliens as benign and friendly, a theme already present in Spielberg's own Close Encounters of the Third Kind.|$|R

Artist Karen Wolff designed the terrain by combining large topographic maps into a [...] "mosaic", which recreated the elevations and depressions of the Seattle area. The satellite imagery was layered over the resultant polygonal mesh. Real elevation data was also used for the eight lower-resolution Western American states outside of the Seattle area. Budget concerns and the storage limitations of the CD-ROM format prevented the team from rendering the entire United States, despite fan demand.

5000|$|Starting {{from their}} characters' Headstones, players {{take it in}} turns to roll the dice and move {{clockwise}} around the board and can choose to roll one or two dice each time. Whenever the Gatekeeper appears on-screen, all players must stop, listen and do exactly what he says (e.g. when the Gatekeeper asks whose turn it is, they must answer with [...] "Yes, my Gatekeeper"); {{failure to do so}} will result in punishment (a player must end their turn if they're in the middle of one when the Gatekeeper appears). Players start collecting keys by either landing on a space marked with a key on the game board or taking them from other players by duels. Players must collect all six different color keys, placing any keys they have in their rack facing towards them to hide the colors from opponents. Although players only need one key per color, players can collect more which prevent other players from completing the game. Should the Gatekeeper tell a player to take a key, they must take it from the realm they are in unless instructed otherwise. A Black Key is also on the board and must be avoided, otherwise the player who picks it up is [...] "cursed" [...] and unable to win the game as long as it's in their possession, even if they have one key of each color. Players can get rid of the Black Key by passing it on to another player when their pieces both occupy the same space or try to lose it in a duel. If a player lands on their own Headstone, they can earn a key from their realm by roling their own key rack number on the die; likewise, if an opponent lands on it, the player can take a key from that opponent by rolling their number. During the game players may come across objects to either make the game harder or easier, these include <b>flight,</b> dueling, black <b>holes,</b> Fate cards and Time cards. Flight allows players to travel from one flight stone on the game board to another unoccupied flight stone. Dueling allows players to duel other players to steal one of the players' keys, as long as the two players have keys of their own. A player can either be banished to a Black Hole by the Gatekeeper or stumble into one on the game board, temporarily rendering them unable to play. Players are only released from a Black Hole either by the Gatekeeper, having a Fate or Time card that releases them, trying to get their number on a dice roll each time their turn comes around or having possession of their corresponding colored key. In each case, a player must still move to a nearby Black Hole and wait for their next turn before being released. Fate cards are cards with instructions which the player must follow. The Gatekeeper will require a player to pick up a Fate card during the game. Just like Fate cards, Time cards have instructions which the player must follow, but players only carry out these instructions at a certain time in the game as defined on the card. The inner track (which is the only place on the board that players can travel in both directions) can be used at any time as a shortcut, though punishment will come to players if the Gatekeeper catches them there without six keys.|$|R
