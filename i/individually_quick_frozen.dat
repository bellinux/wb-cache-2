The sprila freezing tunle with - 30 C° was also used for preparation the <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> sample. The <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> samples were then stored at - 18 C°for six months.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used for study {{on the effects of}} the frozen condition on the microstructure of the fillets. Results indicated that two different frozen methods had significantly different effects {{on the quality of the}} fillets. Most of the proximate composition (protein, moistre and fat) reduced during the storage. <b>Quick</b> <b>frozen</b> filets had significantly (P< 0. 05) lower reduction than slow frozen samples.

In these paramethers, the slow freezing had higher changes than quick freezing metods (P< 0. 05). The microbial properties of the samples showed decrese during the storage. Lower amont of total cuont was observed at the end of the storage time in the <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> samples than slow frozen once (P< 0. 05).

30|$|The {{moisture}} {{retention capacity}} of phosphates could improve the weight and volume of CSB significantly, while the hardness of steamed bread was reduced as the water absorption increased [55]. Besides, the leaven function was enhanced due to the sequestration of minerals and enhanced protein–starch interactions caused {{by the addition of}} phosphates [56]. It has been reported that the phosphate also contributed to the whiteness of steamed bread, which mainly due to a more intense and uniform crumb was formed after the addition of phosphate [57]. Phosphates are commonly used in the quality improvement of <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> foods. <b>Quick</b> <b>frozen</b> dumplings accounts for 33 % of the total <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> foods in China [58], however, the common problems, such as frost cracking, outflow of stuffing juice, sticky texture, poor elasticity, browning and cooking loss, appeared in the practical production retarded its industrialization [59]. Therefore, phosphates were used as additives to alleviate the above-mentioned challenges in production. Phosphates added in frozen dumplings gave cracking resistance and good appearance for frozen dumplings due to their water-holding capacity, in which STPP showed the best performance in all the applied phosphates [59]. For the browning inhibiting, the function of phosphates can be explained in two ways. First, the enzymatic browning was delayed by the sequestering of metal ions [60]. Second, the water-holding rate was increased by the phosphates, which prevented the browning reaction caused by the outflow of stuffing [61].|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) infects red {{raspberry}} {{and black}} raspberry worldwide. Infection causes reduced vigor and drupelet abortion leading to crumbly fruit and reduced yields.

Sequencing of cloned coat protein genes of the NWREC RBDV isolates revealed little to no difference between the RBDV isolates from raspberry and blackberry. The consensus coat protein gene of the NWREC RBDV is different from that of RBDV isolates from France, Canada, Russia and Scotland. The lack of variability among coat protein genes of RBDV from raspberry and blackberry suggests that mutation in the coat protein did not cause the recent appearance in blackberry...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Maintaining the {{structural}} integrity of cell walls largely determines {{the texture of}} fruit products during freezing processes. Strawberries undergo major textural changes when frozen, and varietal differences in quality after thawing are not readily predicted from mechanical and sensory testing of the fresh fruit. The objectives {{of this study were}} to develop a quantitative sensory texture profile of three strawberry varieties, <b>individually</b> <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> (IQF), to determine differences in cell wall composition and structure, and to relate the sensory and compositional profiles to differences in instrumental values of firmness. Intervarietal differences in IQF strawberries of Benton, Totem, and Selva varieties were examined and a summary of major findings follows. Drip-loss measurements, and work-of-compression on thawed berries were correlated to sensory ratings. Puree viscosity was highest in Selva samples, lowest in Bentons and shows potential as a screening test for strawberry cultivars. Firmness of thawed, whole Selva berries was rated 4 x and 2 x as compared to Bentons and Totems, respectively, via sensory profile evaluation with magnitude estimation scaling. Fractionation of fruit cell walls showed Selva had the highest percentages of acetone-insoluble solids. Total pectin content and absolute weight percentages of uronic acids and neutral sugars did not show major differences. Ratios of: 1) uronic acids to neutral sugars, 2) uronic acids to rhamnose, and 3) neutral sugars to rhamnose followed trends of increasing with varietal firmness in water-soluble polysaccharides (WSP) and decreasing in chelator-soluble polysaccharides (CSP). Ratios of galactose to arabinose decreased with increasing firmness scores in WSP and increased in CSP.

In the first study, IQF blueberries were treated with varying degrees of laser perforation (i. e., 3 levels of perforation density x 3 levels of perforation depth = 9 treatment combinations) and then subjected to stepwise sugar infusion using low solution concentration increments (5 °Brix/day) to a final °Brix of 70 with a high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) solution. The effects of the perforation density: depth combinations were evaluated against a traditional mechanical treatment in terms of fruit weight change and final product characteristics. A clear, systematic tendency of increasing final fruit weight was observed as the two perforation parameters were increased. The increase in the two parameters also contributed to producing infused blueberries that were maintaining the original shape and appearance with reduced product shrinkage and texture hardening as a result of enhanced solute impregnation. Due to the invasive nature of the treatment, blueberries that were subjected to the mechanical treatment showed considerable rupture {{at the end of the}} infusion process. The second study was carried out under a sugar infusion condition using higher solution concentration increments (10, 20 and 30 °Brix/day). Due to the increased osmotic gradient, the time required for the fruit to reach the target soluble solid content (70 ± 0. 5 °Brix) was markedly shortened. A systematic increase in the final fruit weight with increasing perforation density and depth was again observed. However, only the fruit that was subjected to the greatest laser perforation exhibited promoted solute gain, thereby attaining a moderate final process yield with reduced product shrinkage. Overall, the results of the two studies demonstrate the ability of CO₂ laser perforation as a non-contact, minimally invasive skin pretreatment for the sugar infusion of frozen blueberries that significantly enhances solute impregnation, leading to improved process yield, process efficiency, and final product quality...|$|E
