It also receives heat from the predominant high pressure fronts which bring warm air from the Atlantic to the Barents Sea. The town has its lowest temperatures during February, at an average [...] and a high average of [...] during July. The sun does not set from 18 April to 24 August (midnight sun) and does not rise from 25 October to 17 February (polar night). But there is no nautical twilight between December 11 to December 30, it only has 24 <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> called astronomical twilight.

50|$|Although the {{flowering}} hormone in most plants (including cannabis) is present during {{all phases of}} growth, it is inhibited by exposure to light. To induce flowering, the plant must be subject to at least 8 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> per day; this number is very strain-specific and most growers use 12 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness.</b>|$|R

The face he raised to her, {{as he leaned}} forward under the direct light of the sun, was so colourless, cadaverous and haggard, the thought crossed her mind that it did indeed seem {{little more than a}} shadowy mask that but one <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> might dispel.|$|E
60|$|The brief <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> {{that preceded}} the dawn was that night {{intensified}} by a dense smoke, which, after blotting out horizon and sky, dropped a thick veil on the high road and the silent streets of Indian Spring. As the buggy containing Sheriff Dunn and Brace dashed through the obscurity, Brace suddenly turned to his companion.|$|E

60|$|When on the {{previous}} night Pierre had left the farm-house where Isabel harbored, it will be remembered that no hour, either of night or day, no special time at all had been assigned for a succeeding interview.

60|$|As {{the words}} passed his lips, his {{factitious}} spirits deserted him. He left his seat, impenetrably deaf to all Allan's efforts at rallying {{him on his}} extraordinary answer, and resumed his restless pacing of the deck in dead silence.

60|$|It was now {{within an}} <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness,</b> and as I was nearly famished, I {{led the way}} back {{about a quarter of}} a mile to a low meadow where we had seen {{antelope}} and small horses a short time before. Here I brought down a young buck, the report of my rifle sending the balance of the herd scampering for the woods, where they were met by a chorus of hideous roars as the carnivora took advantage of their panic and leaped among them.|$|E

60|$|So Dorothy's beauty {{had taken}} London by storm, {{even as it}} had conquered Annapolis! However, 'twas small {{consolation}} to me to hear his Grace of Chartersea called a pig and a profligate while better men danced her attendance in Mayfair. Nor, {{in spite of what}} his Lordship had said, was I quite easy on the score of the duke. It was in truth no small honour to become a duchess. If Mr. Marmaduke had aught to say, there was an end to hope. She would have her coronet. But in that <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> I counted upon my lady's spirit.|$|E

The poet is dead in me." [...] And years afterward in a letter to an artist friend, W. Collins (December, 1818): [...] "Poetry is out of the question. The attempt would only hurry me into that sphere of acute feelings from which abstruse research, the mother of self-oblivion, presents an asylum." ...|$|E
60|$|Such is the American Issue. Our statesmen and thinkers {{have helped}} to evolve it, our people with their blood and {{treasure}} are consecrating it. And these statesmen and thinkers, of whom our American President is not the least, are of democracy the pioneers. From the mountain tops on which they stand they behold {{the features of the}} new world, the dawn of the new day hidden as yet from their brothers in the valley. Let us have faith always that it is coming, and struggle on, highly resolving that those who gave their lives in the <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> shall not have died in vain.|$|E

60|$|To some persons it {{may seem}} strange advice to tell them, that in the <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness,</b> doubt, and sorrow, they will find no comfort like that of meditating on the Name of the Ever-blessed Trinity. Yet {{there is not a}} prophet or psalmist of the Old Testament who does not speak of 'The Name of the Lord,' as a kind of talisman against all the {{troubles}} which can befall the spirit of man. And we, as Christians, know, or ought to know, far more of God than did even prophets or psalmists. If they found comfort in the name of God, we ought to find far more.|$|E
60|$|Instead of {{avoiding}} society, {{as was his}} wont in the old days, the Archbishop sought it. And there was nothing exclusive in his social habits; all classes and all creeds, all conditions and orders of men, were alike interesting to him; {{they were part of}} the mighty community, with all whose pursuits, and passions, and interests, and occupations he seemed to sympathise, but respecting which he had only one object--to bring them back once more to that imperial fold from which, in an <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> and distraction, they had miserably wandered. The conversion of England was deeply engraven on the heart of Penruddock; it was his constant purpose, and his daily and nightly prayer.|$|E
60|$|I must add a last {{touch to}} the picture of Malie and the pretender's life. About four in the morning, the visitor in his house will be awakened by the note of a pipe, blown without, very softly and to a {{soothing}} melody. This is Mataafa's private luxury to lead on pleasant dreams. We have a bird here in Samoa that about the same <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> sings in the bush. The father of Mataafa, while he lived, was a great friend and protector to all living creatures, and passed under the by-name of the King of Birds. It may be it was among the woodland clients of the sire that the son acquired his fancy for this morning music.|$|E
40|$|Exogenous {{acetylcholine}} (ACh), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, {{as well as}} agonists and antagonists of ACh receptors applied on the cotyledons of 5 -day-old seedlings of Pharbitis nil {{during a}} 16 -hour long inductive night or during a 12 -hour long subinductive night, do not essentially influence the flower bud formation. Also the application of above mentioned substances to the seedlings growing under the conditions <b>of</b> 72 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness,</b> 24 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> light and then 24 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> does not influence in an essential way flowering of P. nil. On the other hand, applying these substances on the cotyledons of P. nil during 24 -hour-long inductive night, preceded by 72 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> and then 24 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> light of lowered intensity finished by 15 -minute-long impulse of far red light which inhibit flowering, caused the reversion {{of the effect of}} far red light irradiation and stimulated the flowering.

60|$|We thank Thee, Lord, for {{the glory}} of the late days and the {{excellent}} face of Thy sun. We thank Thee for good news received. We thank Thee for the pleasures we have enjoyed and for those {{we have been able to}} confer. And now, when the clouds gather and the rain impends over the forest and our house, permit us not to be cast down; let us not lose the savour of past mercies and past pleasures; but, like the voice of a bird singing in the rain, let grateful memory survive in the <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness.</b> If there be in front of us any painful duty, strengthen us with the grace of courage; if any act of mercy, teach us tenderness and patience.|$|E
6000|$|Then I {{departed}} on {{my usual}} evening pilgrimage. I entered the flower garden {{by a little}} iron gate, and walked slowly amongst my roses. Here the air was full of delicate scents--lavender insistent; mignonette faint, but penetrating; homely wall-flowers, sweet even as the roses themselves. Night insects now were buzzing around me; the bushes took to themselves phantasmal shapes; even the path, very narrow and overgrown, was hard to find. I filled my hand with flowers and made my way slowly back to the cedar-tree. The shadows were deeper now. It was the one <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> before the rising of the late moon. I threw myself into a low chair, and the flowers on to the seat which encircled the cedar-tree. Oh, wonderful Feurgéres, who had taught me the sweetness of such moments as this! ...|$|E
60|$|Calling for my greatcoat, {{and paying}} no heed to the jeers {{of the company}} for leaving before the toasts and the play, I fairly ran to Arlington Street. I was in a passion of remorse. Comyn had been but just. Granting, indeed, that she had refused to marry me, was that any reason why I should desert my life-long friend and playmate? A hundred little tokens of her affection for me rose to mind, and last of all that rescue from Castle Yard {{in the face of}} all Mayfair. And in that <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>darkness</b> the {{conviction}} that something was wrong came back upon me with redoubled force. Her lack of colour, her feverish actions, and the growing slightness of her figure, all gave me a pang, as I connected them with that scene on the balcony over the Park.|$|E
