50|$|Cold {{water was}} available, but the detainees had no soap, towels, toilet paper or detergent. Some {{of these were}} later provided, but were always scarce. Consequently, hygiene was non-existent. For months, the prisoners weren't able to shave or wash and became infested with lice, upon which they were sprayed with {{insecticide}} by the guards. The prisoners were given soap and toilet paper only when the Commission came to inspect the camp - but these were taken away the moment the <b>inspection</b> <b>ended.</b> After {{two and a half}} months, the prisoners were finally allowed to bathe due to ICRC pressure, which occurred only during inspections. During the night, a strong light was constantly on, preventing prisoners from sleeping easily.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} a four-week post-deployment standdown, the guided-missile {{destroyer}} began {{preparations for}} a series of engineering and general survey inspections set for late spring. Those <b>inspections</b> <b>ended</b> late in June, and July passed relatively slowly, marked by an overnight [...] "tiger cruise" [...] for crew dependents on the 18th, and a port visit to Hilo, Hawaii, between 19 and 25 July. A week after that, Benjamin Stoddert departed Pearl Harbor for two weeks of law enforcement operations with the United States Coast Guard. The warship used her surface search radars and other equipment to spot small craft, which were then boarded by Coast Guard detachments in search of drug smugglers. Back in port on 11 August, Stoddert spent the next week training submarine prospective commanding officers.|$|R

25|$|Lastly {{once the}} President of Singapore has arrived (after the playing of the Presidential Fanfare by the Fanfare Trumpeters of the SAF), the Parade Commander will {{call for a}} full (Presidential) salute, during which the National Anthem, Majulah Singapura, will be played {{accompanied}} by a fly-past of the State Flag, and from 2011, would also require raising it as well on a separate flagpole. After that (and the following aerial salute by the RSAF), the Parade Commander will request that the President inspects the parade. During this inspection, the President will be accompanied by the Chief of Defence Force and the Parade Commander, and the Army GOH Contingent Commander would later join them once they approach the Guard-of-Honour (recent parades have seen a motorized inspection by the President while riding a Land Rover). A presidential 21-gun salute is also given to the President during this time by a select battery from the Singapore Artillery. It is customary that the President speaks to {{some members of the}} Guard-of-honor contingents as he passes by. After the <b>inspection</b> <b>ends,</b> the President will return to the podium before the Guard-of-honor contingents presents a Feu-de-Joie led by the Parade Commander.|$|R
50|$|The parade since 2010 {{starts with}} the President of Mexico, the First Lady, the National Defense and Navy Secretaries, commanders {{of the armed forces}} and the Federal Police, the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, and the President of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation walking towards the {{national}} flagpole in the Zócalo to raise the large Flag of Mexico. It is raised first to the Toque de Bandera by the drummers and buglers of the massed Corps of Drums and later with the massed military bands, together with the choirs of the National Defense and Navy Secretaries performing a rendition of the Canto a la Bandera or Song to the Flag (the Himno Nacional Mexicano was played during the 2013 flag raising). After the flag raising the President and the National Defense and Navy Secretaries ride on a military vehicle to inspect the parade on the Zócalo. When the <b>inspection</b> <b>ends</b> the three disembark as the vehicle arrives at the National Palace. The parade is later ordered by the Principal Bugler of the massed Corps of Drums to order arms and stand at ease.|$|R

5000|$|The {{production}} of sexually explicit materials is regulated under 18 U.S.C. 2257, requiring [...] "original" [...] producers to retain records showing that all performers were {{over the age}} of 18 {{at the time of the}} production for inspection by the Attorney General. The 18 U.S.C. 2257 disclaimer is common on Internet sites distributing pornography, but the Department of Justice has rarely if ever enforced the provision. Although the law had been on the books for over 10 years, the Justice Department never actually inspected anyone. It was not until pressure from Congress, and conservative religious groups spurred the administration of George W. Bush and Attorney General Gonzales to begin inspections of larger commercial porn companies primarily in the Los Angeles area. Despite fearing mass inspections, harassment, and prosecution, the Justice Department inspected less than two dozen companies (out of several thousand operating), and no prosecutions resulted from any of the inspections. Retired FBI agents conducted the inspections, and generally arrived with a list of videos whose records they wanted to examine (most likely, to avoid potential Fourth Amendment conflicts on issues of probable cause). According to porn executives, the agents were always courteous and professional, suggesting changes or modifications to the companies' record-keeping processes. Once Attorney General Alberto Gonzales left the Justice Department, the <b>inspections</b> <b>ended.</b>|$|R

The techniques, instruments and specific data for such components mentioned here are synthesized results from primary research and knowledge available in this area, in order to produce coherent argument focused on quality control of end fittings. ...|$|R
25|$|The parade set out at 2:30 pm {{with the}} tug McCaulley acting as {{flagship}} {{followed by two}} police boats; however, {{at the insistence of}} Commodore Adams, Ice Boat No. 3 was given pride of place behind McCaulley due to the former's complement of councillors. The parade then steamed upriver to the Arch Street wharf where it circled the anchored Raleigh, to the cheers of thousands of onlookers ashore, after which guests from the various watercraft were invited aboard the cruiser for an <b>inspection.</b> Festivities <b>ended</b> about 4:15, about which time Ice Boat No. 3 returned her passengers to their embarkation point before proceeding to her usual berth at the House of Corrections wharf, arriving there 6:15 pm.|$|R
50|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} {{respondents}} wanted {{the government to}} wait for the UN <b>inspections</b> to <b>end,</b> and only 31% supported using military force immediately. This same poll showed that a majority believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but did not expect UN inspectors to find them. These numbers indicated a dramatic drop in support, as, two months prior, most polls showed about two-thirds of those polled supporting military action. However, about 60% of those polled also supported, if necessary, the use of military action to remove Saddam from power which closely mirrored recent polls taken by Time Magazine, CNN, Fox News, USA Today, CBS News, and other news organizations. Polls also showed that most Americans did not think that Saddam was co-operating with inspectors.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this contract between Oceaneering Space Systems (OSS) and the Department of Energy (DOE) {{was to provide a}} tool for the DOE to inspect the inside tank walls of underground radioactive waste storage tanks in their tank farms. Some of these tanks are suspected to have leaks, but the harsh nature of the environment within the tanks precludes human inspection of tank walls. As a result of these conditions only a few inspection methods can fulfill this task. Of the methods available, OSS chose to pursue Alternating Current Field Measurement (ACFM), because it does not require clean surfaces for inspection, nor any contact with the Surface being inspected, and introduces no extra by-products in the inspection process (no coupling fluids or residues are left behind). The tool produced by OSS is the Robotic Tank <b>Inspection</b> <b>End</b> Effector (RTIEE), which is initially deployed on the tip of the Light Duty Utility Arm (LDUA). The RTEE combines ACFM with a color video camera for both electromagnetic and visual inspection The complete package consists of an end effector, its corresponding electronics and software, and a user's manual to guide the operator through an inspection. The system has both coarse and fine inspection modes and allows the user to catalog defects and suspected areas of leakage in a database for further examination, which may lead to emptying the tank for repair, decommissioning, etc [...] The following is an updated report to OSS document OSS- 21100 - 7002, which was submitted in 1995. During the course of the contract, two related subtasks arose, the Wall and Coating Thickness Sensor and the Vacuum Scarifying and Sampling Tool Assembly. The first of these subtasks was intended to evaluate the corrosion and wall thinning of 55 -gallon steel drums. The second was retrieved and characterized the waste material trapped inside the annulus region of the underground tanks on the DOE's tank farms. While these subtasks were derived from the original intent of the contract, the focus remains on the RTIEE...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{focused on}} studying the {{statistical process control}} tool in manufacturing systems with the broad aim of upgrading them to improve on quality and cost effectiveness. It represents an attempt to address the deficiency {{in the literature of}} SPC implementation. With emphasis on early detection and prevention of the problems, SPC was shown to have a distinct advantage over quality methods such as <b>inspection</b> of <b>end</b> product. There was need to check gauges and machines, and determine need for some maintenance or overhaul work to be carried out as faulty machines could not produce quality good products. There was need for operators to be trained, new documents to be produced and actions for the future to be agreed on. A system of reviewing the progress and monitor the result was to be effected with as much priority as that given to financial results...|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{cystoscopy}} {{at the end}} of laparoscopic hysterectomy is {{as important}} as hemostasis inspection. It enables immediate recognition and correction of a possible ureteral injury in the same session and, as a result, a decreased morbidity rate. The cystoscopy also gives confidence to the surgeon and patient. In patients presenting with urinary complaints during the recovery period, cystoscopic <b>inspection</b> at the <b>end</b> of laparoscopic hysterectomy prevents the need for expensive and invasive tests (which are also inconvenient for the patient), the vast majority of which will show no injury.|$|R

However, there is less data available regarding the impact of inspections on different defect types and almost no data quantifying the link between <b>inspections</b> and desired <b>end</b> product qualities. This paper addresses this issue by investigating whether design inspection checklists can be tailored so as to effectively target certain defect types without impairing the overall defect detection rate. The results show that the design inspection approach used here does uncover useful design quality issues and that the checklists can be effectively tailored for some types of defects...|$|R
