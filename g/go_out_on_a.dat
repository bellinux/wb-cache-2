5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E
5|$|The new format {{meant that}} all cars {{took to the}} track quickly in Q1, with {{everyone}} setting lap times on the super-soft compound, the fastest tyre available at the event. The two Manor drivers were first to be eliminated, having set only one timed lap each, as were both Haas cars after them, being unable to cross the finishing line in time. The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber drivers were able to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last {{to go out in}} Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was able to avoid elimination, setting a faster time {{towards the end of the}} session.|$|E

She tells Santana of Rory's supposed magical powers, and Santana later coerces Rory into telling Brittany that Santana has wished for her to join Shelby's glee club. Brittany believes she must obey that wish, but her third wish is that doing so does not hurt anybody's feelings. New Directions co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) tries to persuade Brittany not to leave: he tells her that leprechauns are not real and that she is being stupid. Brittany, insulted, quits anyway.|$|E

At the end of Happy Hour she had been living with Goblin, but in Zero Hour it was shown that she still pined for the then presumed-dead Joker, much to Goblin's dismay. At the conclusion of Zero Hour she chooses to give up on the Joker and joins the Goblin in the parallel reality that Darkseid intended to house a 'rebooted' version of the world of the combined universe which Stan's Place inhabited. Both she and the Goblin are apparently replaced by their 'reboot' counterparts in the main reality at the end of Zero Hour. The reboot versions appear to have no romantic feelings towards one another. The fate of the original versions, presumably still in the 'rebooted' universe are currently unknown.|$|E

500|$|Starting in November 1966, {{the band}} adopted an {{experimental}} attitude during recording sessions for the album.

[...] Their recording of [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] required a forty-piece orchestra, which Martin and McCartney took turns conducting. The sessions produced the double A-side single [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever"/"Penny Lane" [...] in February 1967, and the LP followed in June. McCartney's [...] "She's Leaving Home" [...] was an orchestral pop song. MacDonald described the track as [...] " [...] the finest work on Sgt. Pepper—imperishable popular art of its time". Based on an ink drawing by McCartney, the LP's cover included a collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, featuring the Beatles in costume as the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, standing {{with a host of}} celebrities. The heavy moustaches worn by the Beatles reflected the growing influence of hippie style trends on the band, while their clothing [...] "spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions", wrote Gould.

500|$|... "Mrs. California" [...] {{received}} mixed {{responses from}} critics. The A.V.

He suggested that the writers could tell jokes, but could not successfully [...] "break a story anymore". He also called the subplot a mixed bag for featuring Dwight as a caricature of his former self, but complimented the character development for Darryl which started in [...] "Lotto". He gave the episodes a C+. Hannah Lawrence of Hollywood.com called the episode a large improvement over [...] "Gettysburg" [...] and also called it possibly her [...] "favorite episode of the season so far". Chris Plante of New York called Robert California the worst part of The Office and said that he kept Andy from being more of a lead character for the series. TV Guide writer Bruce Fretts criticized the episode for under using guest star Maura Tierney. He also said that the episode suffered without former series star Steve Carell to serve as the comic foil. IGN writer Cindy White said the episode did not feel like The Office and called it [...] "the exact opposite". Despite this, she went on to compliment Susan asking Andy on a date and the pairing of Darryl and Val as a couple, saying that the latter had possibilities. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5/10. Joseph Kratzer from What Culture? gave the episode three out of five stars and wrote, [...] "I'm going to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bit of a limb here and say that while 'Mrs. California' was of course not a return to form for The Office, it was {{a good example of how}} the series might define itself in this new Michael-less era." [...] M. Giant of Television without Pity gave the episode a B+. [...] After viewing [...] "Mrs. California," [...] Washington Post writer Hank Stuever named The Office one of the ten best TV shows of 2011 and said that the episode proved the series could still deliver cringe humor without Carell. Multiple critics complimented the cold open to the episode.|$|E
