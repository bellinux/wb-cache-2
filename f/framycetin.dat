Age groups of patients ranged from 25 - 45 years. Eighteen (85. 7 &#x 0025;) were young adults, 30 - 40 years of age. Fifteen (71. 4 &#x 0025;) were men and 6 (28. 6 &#x 0025;) were women. All the cases were hospitalized in ICU, till the acute phase of the disease subsided. Complete hematological profile, urinalysis, serum biochemistry and repeated bacterial cultures from the skin were carried out in all patients at the time of admission and thereafter weekly. The treatment comprised of potassium permanganate lotion bath (1 : 10000) and 1 <b>framycetin</b> gauze dressing of the denuded areas, maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance. All suspected infections and septicemia were treated with appropriate antibiotics. The corticosteroids were usually administered as a single dose of prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day. Cyclophosphamide was given at an initial dose of 50 mg/day and the dose was escalated to 100 mg/day. Once the bulk of the lesions were healed, the dose of corticosteroids was gradually lowered by approximately 50 &#x 0025; every two weeks and cyclophosphamide was continued till patients were symptomfree. Out of 21 patients receiving corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and other supportive therapy, 20 (95 &#x 0025;) had undergone clinical resolution of the disease. During follow up study 15 (71. 4 &#x 0025;) patients remained symptom-free and undergone clinical remission. Five patients (23. 8 &#x 0025;) had relapse, out of which 4 (19 &#x 0025;) remained symptom free, after subsequent treatment. There was one death (4. 7 &#x 0025;) in our study...|$|E
40|$|Aim: This study {{evaluated}} the antimicrobial and antioxidant effects of Crinum jagus (J. Thomps.) Dandy methanolic bulb extract in wound healing. Methods: Phytochemical screening revealed {{the presence of}} alkaloids, glycosides, tannins and saponins in the extract. In vitro antimicrobial activity of the extract was determined by agar well diffusion method. In vivo antimicrobial activity of the extract was determined by assay of excision wound in rats contaminated with Staphylococcus (S.) aureus, Bacillus (B.) subtilis, Pseudomonas (P.) areuginosa and Candida (C.) albicans and treated with 300 mg/kg body weight (bw) of 10 and 5 % methanolic Crinum jagus bulb extract ointment (MCJBEO), respectively. Enzymatic antioxidant effect of the extract was determined by assaying superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in excision wound biopsies of rats treated with 10 and 5 % MCJBEO, respectively. Non-enzymatic antioxidant effect of the extract was determined in vitro using diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method. Results: The extract exhibited in vitro antimicrobial effect in a concentration-dependent manner with 100 mg/ml having the highest inhibitory zone diameter (IZD) for B. subtilis (25 mm), S. aureus (21 mm) and C. albicans (14 mm). B. subtilis, S. aureus and C. albicans were not isolated from wounds of animals treated with both extract concentrations, and reference drug (<b>framycetin</b> sulphate/clotrimazole). SOD and CAT in wound biopsies treated with 10 % MCJBEO were significantly (p < 0. 05) higher than those treated with 5 % MCJBEO. Significantly (p < 0. 05) decreased MDA level of wound biopsies from extract-treated rats was observed. The extract exhibited non-enzymatic antioxidant (DPPH) effect in a concentration-dependent manner. Conclusion: Antimicrobial and antioxidant effects could possibly be part of mechanism by which Crinum jagus bulb extract promote wound healing process.

40|$|Crinum jagus (J. Thomps.) Dandy {{commonly}} called Harmattan or St. Christopher's lily {{belonging to the}} family Lilliaceae is widely used traditionally in Southeastern Nigeria for treatment of skin sores. This study investigated the wound healing potentials of methanolic Crinum jagus bulb extract (MCJBE) using incision, excision and dead space wound healing models. Phytochemical screening showed the presence of alkaloids, glycosides, tannins, saponins in the extract but absence of flavonoids. In the incision and dead space wound models, rats were dosed orally with 300 mg/kg body weight (bw) of 10 and 5 % of methanolic Crinum jagus bulb extract (MCJBE) solution, respectively, while in the excision wound model, rats were treated topically with 10 and 5 % methanolic Crinum jagus bulb extract ointments (MCJBEO), respectively. The 10 % MCJBE gave significantly (p< 0. 05) highest percentage rate of wound contraction, shortest re-epithelialization and complete healing time when compared with 5 % MCJBE and reference drug, <b>framycetin</b> sulphate. The extract of Crinum jagus showed significant (p< 0. 05) concentration-dependent wound healing activity in incision, dead space and excision wound models. No contaminating microbial organism was isolated from wound sites of the rats dosed and treated with MCJBE throughout the study period. At day 7 post infliction of excision wound, histomorphological and histochemical studies revealed more fibroblasts and type 1 collagen deposits in wound site sections of rats treated with both 10 and 5 % MCJBEO while those of the control showed more inflammatory cells and fewer type 1 collagen deposits. At day 14 post infliction of excision wound, more epithelial regeneration with overlying keratin were seen in the histological sections of wounds of rats treated with both 10 and 5 % MCJBEO while histochemical study showed more type 1 collagen deposits in wound site sections of rats in 10 % MECJ treated group. This study established that methanolic Crinum jagus bulb extract potentiates wound healing. The study thus validated the folkloric use of Crinum jagus bulb {{in the management of}} skin sores and boils. [J Intercult Ethnopharmacol 2015; 4 (3. 000) : 194 - 201...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The correct {{choice of}} {{antimicrobial}} agents as inter-appointment medicaments {{is as important}} as the instrumentation and irrigation to remove pathogens from infected root canals. Calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH) 2] and <b>framycetin</b> sulfate (Septomixine) are common endodontic medicaments. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of either calcium hydroxide or Septomixine in eliminating residual intra-canal bacteria, particularly Actinomyces spp., during inter-appointment interval in endodontic therapy using molecular methods. METHODS: A total of 31 single-rooted teeth with primary root canal infections were studied immediately after opening the canals and subsequently after instrumentation, irrigation with sterile saline and 1 -week medication with either Ca(OH) 2 (n = 25) or Septomixine (n = 6). Whole bacterial genomic DNA was isolated directly from samples and PCR with universal primers performed to detect total intra-canal bacteria. The variable regions of 16 S rDNA of bacteria were amplified and labeled with digoxigenin for further hybridization to detect Actinomyces spp. A total of seven oligonucleotide probes specific for A. bovis, A. gerencseriae, A. israelii, A. meyeri, catalase-negative A. naeslundii (genospecies 1 and 2), catalase-positive A. naeslundii genospecies 2 and A. odontolyticus were used to detect Actinomyces spp. in 22 of 31 medicated root canals [Ca(OH) 2 : n = 17; Septomixine: n = 5]. RESULTS: The PCR results showed that 25 of 31 examined canals were positively detected with residual microorganisms after instrumentation, irrigation with sterile saline and I -week medication with either Ca(OH) 2 (n = 20) or Septomixine (n = 5). Thus, only six canals [Ca(OH) 2 : n = 5, Septomixine: n = 1] were aseptic after treatment. Hybridization results showed higher detection frequency of both A. odontolyticus and A. gerencseriae after treatment. Significant correlation was found between exposed pulp before treatment and positive detection of Actinomyces spp., particularly A. odontolyticus on the second visit (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The conventional, 1 -week medication of either Ca(OH) 2 or Septomixine in endodontic therapy may not effectively inhibit residual bacterial growth in all root canals during inter-appointment intervals. Further investigations using, for instance quantitative real-time PCR analyses, are required to substantiate the present findings. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
