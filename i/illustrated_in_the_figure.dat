5|$|Conversely, {{one might}} expect that {{inertial}} motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used to}} define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E

25|$|Electrotyping is {{activated}} by electric currents that flow between anode wires {{that are also}} immersed in the solution and the wire connected to the coated mold (the cathode). For copper electrotyping, a typical aqueous electrolyte contains copper sulfate (CuSO4) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and the anode is also copper; the arrangement is <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure.</b> The electric current causes copper atoms to dissolve from the anode's surface and to enter the electrolyte as copper ions (Cu++ in the figure). Copper ions are {{taken up by the}} mold's conducting surface at the same rate at which copper dissolves from the anode, thus completing the electrical circuit. When the copper layer on the mold grows to the desired thickness, the electric current is stopped. The mold and its attached electrotype are removed from the solution, and the electrotype and the mold are separated. An animation of the electrotyping process was produced in 2011 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Other metals besides copper can be electrotyped; similar procedures apply, but each different metal needs its own anode and electrolyte chemicals.|$|E

500|$|The {{first new}} effect is the {{gravitational}} frequency shift of light. Consider two observers aboard an accelerating rocket-ship. [...] Aboard such a ship, {{there is a}} natural concept of [...] "up" [...] and [...] "down": the direction in which the ship accelerates is [...] "up", and unattached objects accelerate in the opposite direction, falling [...] "downward". Assume that one of the observers is [...] "higher up" [...] than the other. When the lower observer sends a light signal to the higher observer, the acceleration causes the light to be red-shifted, as may be calculated from special relativity; the second observer will measure a lower frequency for the light than the first. Conversely, light sent from the higher observer to the lower is blue-shifted, that is, shifted towards higher frequencies. Einstein argued that such frequency shifts must also be observed in a gravitational field. This is <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> at left, which shows a light wave that is gradually red-shifted as it works its way upwards against the gravitational acceleration. This effect has been confirmed experimentally, as described below.|$|E

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{overview}} semiconductor mixers designed for good large signal performance. Twelve different mixers were compared utilizing pn diodes, bipolar transistors, and/or junction field effect transistors. The main aspect of comparison is the third-order intercept point (IP 3), and both circuit analysis and measurement results have been considered. IP 3 has been analyzed by the program AWR (NI AWR Design Environment) and measured by two-tone test (Keysight Technologies). We provide three ways of improvement of large signal performance: application of a diplexer at the RF port, reduction of DC currents, and exploiting a region of RF input power with infinite IP 3. In addition to that, our contributions are several modifications of existing mixers and a new mixer circuit (as <b>illustrated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>figures).</b> It is widely believed that {{the slope of the}} third-order intermodulation product versus input power is always greater than that of the first-order product.
