5|$|Soviet {{equipment}} losses {{during the}} German offensive came to 1,614tanks and self-propelled guns destroyed or damaged of the 3,925 vehicles {{committed to the}} battle. The Soviet losses were roughly three {{times larger than the}} German losses. During Operation Kutuzov, 2,349tanks and self-propelled guns were lost out of an initial strength of 2,308; a loss of over 100percent. During Polkovodets Rumyantsev 1,864tanks and self-propelled guns were lost out of the 2,439 employed. The loss ratio suffered by the Soviets was roughly 5:1 in favour of the German military. However, large Soviet reserves of equipment and their high rate of tank production enabled the Soviet tank armies to soon replace lost equipment and maintain their fighting strength. The Red Army repaired many of its damaged tanks; many Soviet tanks were rebuilt up to four times to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fight. Soviet tank strength went back up to 2,750 tanks by 3 August due to the repair of damaged vehicles.|$|E

25|$|In Alaska, {{attrition}} {{and a lack}} {{of spare}} parts led to the withdrawal of the F-82 from the USAF inventory. Initially, 16 of the 36 aircraft became hangar queens and were the main source for spare parts to keep the others operational. By the spring of 1953, the number of aircraft available had dwindled to a handful, with two or three operational aircraft kept flying by cannibalizing others which were incapable of being repaired. Each aircraft were flown about 48 hours per month until it was impossible to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air on a reliable basis.|$|E
25|$|The London Library {{acquired}} {{its first}} own building in 1879. In 1896–1898 {{it was completely}} rebuilt {{and became one of}} the first steel frame buildings in London. Its present-day eclectic facade, Main Hall and Reading Room date back to Wright's time; the library as a whole has been substantially expanded in 1920s, 1930s and 1990s. The library stock grew through purchases and private donations to 250,000 volumes in 1913 and to 400,000 volumes in 1928 (the 500,000 mark was passed in 1950). When notable book collections were slated to be auctioned to foreign buyers, as was the case of Sir Henry Clinton's library, Hagberg publicly rallied to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E

25|$|In World War I, the US, Britain, and Russia {{had been}} allies for seven months, from April 1917 until the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in November.

Nonetheless, once the Bolsheviks took Moscow, the Allies formally began talks to try and <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war effort. The Communists embraced this as a way to explore trade negotiations, as well as the possibility of turning Germany into a socialist state. In January 1918, President Wilson of the US took inspiration from several ideas promoted in the Soviets' Decree on Peace, including self-determination, for his own Fourteen Points program for post-war order.|$|E
25|$|With frame {{buildings}} and wood-burning fireplaces and stoves, fire {{was always a}} risk in the city. Chimney fires were frequent. On March 18, 1741, the governor's house in Fort George caught on fire, and soon the church connected to his house was ablaze too. People tried to save it, but the fire soon grew beyond control. The fire threatened to spread to another building, where all the city documents were kept. The governor ordered the windows smashed and documents thrown out to save them. Later the practice was to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> City Hall. A week later another fire broke out, but was put out quickly. The same thing happened the next week at a warehouse. Three days later a fire broke out in a cow stable. On the next day a person walking past a wealthy neighborhood saw coals by the hay in a stable and put them out, saving the neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|In this double-overtime thriller, Kentucky {{started out}} well and led Michigan State by four at halftime, but Michigan State {{caught up in}} the second half, {{actually}} leading 70-62 with 5:43 to play. Kentucky rallied back, however, cutting the lead to one when Kelenna Azubuike drained a three with 1:19 to play. After Patrick Sparks missed the front end of a one-and-one with 41 seconds to play, Michigan State's Shannon Brown appeared to ice the game with two free throws with 20 seconds to play. But with time expiring, Sparks put up a prayer from three, and the ball bounced around the rim four times before falling in. After the referees spent nearly ten minutes reviewing the play, they upheld that Sparks' shot was a three pointer, sending the game into overtime. In the first overtime, neither team relented, and Brown hit a key three-point basket for Michigan State to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. Kentucky's Azubuike missed a three as time expired to send the game into double overtime. In the second overtime, Michigan State's mettle finally won the game for them, as they scored 11 of their 13 points from the free throw line to finally seal the game and send them to the Final Four for the fourth time under coach Tom Izzo.|$|E

I feel I haven't played as much as I would love to because of the great players we have at Barcelona". Fellow Barcelona player Giovanni van Bronckhorst was emotional as he won against his former club: [...] "It's special to win the final, and even more special to do it against your old team". Samuel Eto'o, scorer of Barcelona's first goal, cited Liverpool's comeback against Milan as inspiration for Barcelona's victory: [...] "After having seen what Liverpool did last year, we told ourselves not to throw in the towel. We followed Liverpool's example". Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard praised the role of goalkeeper Victor Valdés in their victory, stating {{that he made a}} number of important saves to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match: [...] "Valdes played a decisive role.

By holding their vibrissae steady, pinnipeds are able to maximize their detection ability. The vibrissae of phocids are undulated and wavy while otariid and walrus vibrissae are smooth. Research is ongoing to determine the function, if any, of these shapes on detection ability. The vibrissa's angle relative to the flow, not the shape, however, {{seems to be the}} most important factor. The vibrissae of some otariids grow quite long—those of the Antarctic fur seal can reach [...] Walruses have the most vibrissae, at 600–700 individual hairs. These are important for detecting their prey on the muddy sea floor. In addition to foraging, vibrissae may also play a role in navigation; spotted seals appear to use them to detect breathing holes in the ice.|$|E

2500|$|The {{director}} {{wanted to}} make an independent film and collaborate with people who could work fast, like cinematographer Robby Müller and his handpicked crew who were non-union members.

He did not like to rehearse but would create situations where the actors thought they were rehearsing a scene when actually they were shooting a take. Friedkin did this just in case he got something he could use. To this end, he let scenes play out and allowed the actors to stay in character and improvise. For example, during the scene where Chance visits Ruthie at the bar where she works, Friedkin allowed Petersen and actress Darlanne Fleugel to devise their own blocking and told Müller, [...] "Just shoot them.

The board's decision to reject Villa's offer of [...] "a big transfer fee and a benefit match in addition" [...] for the services of centre-forward Bob McRoberts was vindicated when he top-scored with 17 goals. Average attendances rose from 5,500 to 13,000 for 1901–02, but finishing the season with a six-match unbeaten run was not enough to escape relegation. A fifth change of division in eleven seasons– they reached the top two places by mid-November 1902 and remained there for the rest of the campaign– gained Small Heath the reputation of a yo-yo club. This time, a late run proved enough to <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> division, in contrast to 1904–05 when they reached second place in mid-February, one point behind Everton, but lost six of the last ten games to finish seventh.|$|E
