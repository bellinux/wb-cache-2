5|$|The Second Avenue Subway (SAS), {{a planned}} line {{going back to}} the late 1910s, was to be {{constructed}} from Water Street in the Battery to East 180th Street <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx.</b> The line was to be completed in three phases. The first phase, Route 132–A would have built the line from 34th Street to 126th Street, with connections to the 63rd Street Tunnel. The next phase, Route 132–B would continue the line farther north to East 180th Street <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx,</b> and this phase would connect with three existing lines. The final phase, Route 132–C would extend south from 34th Street to Bridge and Water Streets near the Battery. The SAS was prioritized due to overcrowding on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, which was the only remaining rapid transit service on the east side in Midtown and Upper Manhattan. The Upper Manhattan portion of the Second Avenue line, from 63rd Street in Manhattan to 138th Street <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx</b> (near the current Third Avenue–138th Street station), would be built as two tracks. Stops for the SAS were proposed at Broad, Houston, 34th, 48th, 57th, 86th, 106th, and 125th Streets. Originally, Upper East Side residents complained about the lack of stations at 72nd and 96th Streets; while the 72nd Street station was later inserted into the SAS's construction plan, the 96th Street station did not get added.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the plans}} were revised, with new plans {{such as a}} line to Staten Island and a revised line to the Rockaways. In the late 1940s and 1950s, a Queens Bypass line via the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line was first {{proposed}} as {{a branch of the}} still-planned Second Avenue Subway. In addition, capacity on existing lines would have been improved through the construction of strategic connections such as the Culver Ramp, the 60th Street Tunnel Connection, and the Chrystie Street Connection, and through the rebuilding of DeKalb Avenue Junction. These improvements were the only things to come out of these plans. Eventually, these plans were modified to what became the Program for Action, which was put forth by the New York City Transit Authority in 1968. This was the last plan for a major expansion of the subway system. The plan included the construction of the Second Avenue Subway, a Queens Bypass line, a line replacing the Third Avenue El <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx,</b> and other extensions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronx,</b> Queens, and Brooklyn. While ambitious, very little of the plan was completed, mostly because of the financial crisis during the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|To {{display the}} extent of {{variations}} in mortality according to geographic regions in New York City, we have compared mortality in New York City as a whole with that of <b>the</b> South <b>Bronx.</b> Mortality records for 1988 to 1992 and 1990 US census data for New York City were linked. The 471, 000 residents of <b>the</b> South <b>Bronx</b> were younger, less educated, {{and more likely to}} lack health insurance than other New Yorkers. Using age- and gender-stratified populations and mortality in New York City as standards, age-adjusted death rates and excess mortality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Bronx</b> were determined. All-cause mortality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Bronx</b> was 26 % higher than the city as a whole. Mortality for AIDS, injury and poisoning, drug and alcohol abuse, and cardiovascular diseases were 50 % to 100 % higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Bronx</b> than <b>in</b> New York City; years of potential life lost before age 65 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Bronx</b> were 41. 6 % and 44. 2 % higher for men and women, respectively, than in New York City; AIDS accounted for the largest single share of excess premature deaths (21. 8 %). In summary, inequalities in health status, reflected by higher mortality rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Bronx,</b> are consistent with, and perhaps caused by, lower socioeconomic status and deficient medical care among residents of this inner-city community...|$|R
