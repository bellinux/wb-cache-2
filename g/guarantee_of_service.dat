40|$|In this article, <b>Guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> (GoS) {{is defined}} as a {{proposal}} to improve the integration of Mission Critical Networking (MCN) services in the Internet, analyzing the congestion impact on those privileged flows with high requirements of trust and delay. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a technology that offers flow differentiation and QoS in the Internet. Therefore, in order to improve network performance in case of congested domains, GoS is proposed as a technique that allows the local recovering of lost packets of MPLS privileged flows. To fulfill the GoS requirements for integration of MCN in MPLS, a minimum set of extensions to RSVPTE has been proposed to provide GoS capable routes. Moreover, we have carried out an analytical study of GoS scalability and a performance improvement analysis by means of simulations.

This work does exactly that, taking into account two key aspects of a service allocation problem in the Fog, namely modeling cost of executing a given set of services, and the randomness of resources availability, which may come from pre-existing load or server mobility.

In this chapter, we analyze the problem of pricing and capacity investment for an integrated-services network with <b>guaranteed</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Based on an optimal control model formulation, we develop a 3 -stage procedure to determine the optimal amount of capacity and the optimal price schedule.

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{virtualization}} {{technologies have}} recently gained {{a lot of}} interest in Grid computing as they allow flexible resource management, the most common way to exploit grids still relies on dedicated services like resource management systems (RMSs) to get resources at a particular time. To improve resource usage, most of these systems provide a best-effort mode where lowest priority jobs can be executed when resources are idle. This particular mode does not provide any <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and jobs may be killed at any time by the RMS when the nodes they use are subject to higher priority reservations. This behaviour potentially leads to a huge waste of computation time or at least requires users to deal with checkpoints of their best-effort jobs. In this paper, we present Saline, a generic and non-intrusive framework to manage best-effort jobs at grid level through virtual machines (VMs) usage. We discuss the main challenges concerning the design of such a grid system, focusing on VM snapshot management and network configuration. Results of preliminary experiments show the interest of our proposal to ensure an efficient execution of best-effort jobs through the whole grid...|$|E

This thesis {{acknowledges}} {{the extent to}} which the South African society has been polarised by the policies and practices resulting from Apartheid. The safeguarding of rights, equal access to and the <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> delivery to all South African citizens became one of the cornerstones of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (Act 108 of 1996) and one of the vehicles of change and redress. The legislative framework created guides the manner in which the three spheres of government achieve these objectives as one in which they work in a cooperative manner to secure its developmental objectives as captured by the United Nations in the Millennium Development Goals. The growth and development strategies, for which the three spheres of government are responsible, are identified, outlined and analysed to demonstrate the common developmental thread of the three spheres of government. A case is built for the use of the Human Development Index (HDI) as one of indices that could be used as a means of assessing human development. It is further described as an effective methodology in determining the developmental level of people. This methodology is used as an illumining tool to provide support for the provisional comparative analysis of the growth and development strategies of the three spheres of government on the City of Cape Town and the alignment of these strategies to the MDG. The writer will calculate the HDI of the inhabitants of the City of Cape Town and compare these to the provincial and national HDI. The results and findings will be analysed and recommendations and conclusions will follow. The calculations and provisional tentative findings of the HDI of the three spheres of government are provided in Appendix A. Interrelatedness of strategies and deliberate cascading of objectives will be emphasised in terms of the benefit of directive focusing of energies for all three spheres of government. The writer will demonstrate the degree to which these strategies have been deliberately integrated and jointly coordinated by the three spheres of government. The difficulty experienced in accessing adequate data sets has emphasised the need for all three spheres of government to prioritise the coordinated collection, compilation and making data available to ensure that the policy options that are chosen are evidence based and outcomes focussed. This is a significant concern since UN based funding is dependant on well-documented and researched policy options.
