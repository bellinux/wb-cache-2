5|$|Wilber's {{interpretation}} of Aurobindo's philosophy {{differed from the}} notion of dividing reality as a different level of matter, life, mind, overmind, supermind proposed by Aurobindo in The Life <b>Divine,</b> <b>and</b> terms them as higher- or lower-nested holons and states {{that there is only}} a fourfold reality (a system of reality created by himself).|$|E
5|$|Beliefs in the <b>divine</b> <b>and</b> in {{the afterlife}} were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E

5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a <b>divine</b> <b>and</b> not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E
5|$|Eclogue 4, {{also known}} as the Fourth Eclogue is the name of a Latin poem by the Roman poet Virgil. Part of his first major work, the Eclogues, the piece was written around 40 BC, during a time of {{temporary}} stability following the Treaty of Brundisium; it was later published in and around the years 39–38 BC. The work describes the birth of a boy, a supposed savior, who once of age will become <b>divine</b> <b>and</b> eventually rule over the world. During late antiquity and the Middle Ages, a desire emerged to view Virgil as a virtuous pagan, and as such, early Christians, such as Roman Emperor Constantine, early Christian theologian Lactantius, and St. Augustineto varying degreesreinterpreted the poem to be about the birth of Jesus Christ.|$|E
5|$|In this, the milieu is {{interested}} in developing unified world views to discover {{the nature of the}} <b>divine</b> <b>and</b> establish a scientific basis for religious belief. Figures in the New Age movement—most notably Fritjof Capra in his The Tao of Physics (1975)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of mysticism, thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science. Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.|$|E

5|$|The {{canon law}} of the Catholic Church is the system of laws and legal {{principles}} made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities to regulate the church's external organisation and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics towards the church's mission. In the Catholic Church, universal positive ecclesiastical laws, based upon either immutable <b>divine</b> <b>and</b> natural law, or changeable circumstantial and merely positive law, derive formal authority and promulgation {{from the office of}} pope who, as Supreme Pontiff, possesses the totality of legislative, executive and judicial power in his person.

5|$|However much it was believed, the king's divine {{status was}} the {{rationale}} {{for his role as}} Egypt's representative to the gods, as he formed a link between the <b>divine</b> <b>and</b> human realms. The Egyptians believed the gods needed temples to dwell in, as well as the periodic performance of rituals and presentation of offerings to nourish them. These things were provided by the cults that the king oversaw, with their priests and laborers. Yet, according to royal ideology, temple-building was exclusively the pharaoh's work, as were the rituals that priests usually performed in his stead. These acts were a part of the king's fundamental role: maintaining maat. The king and the nation he represented provided the gods with maat so they could continue to perform their functions, which maintained maat in the cosmos so humans could continue to live.|$|E

5|$|Josephine {{grew up in}} a well-to-do and {{politically}} connected progressive family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married George Butler, an Anglican <b>divine</b> <b>and</b> schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a bannister. The death was a turning point for Josephine, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local workhouse. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases—particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy—through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Josephine also formed the International Abolitionist Federation, a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Justinian saw the orthodoxy of {{his empire}} {{threatened}} by diverging religious currents, especially Monophysitism, which had many adherents {{in the eastern}} provinces of Syria and Egypt. Monophysite doctrine, which maintains that Jesus Christ had one divine nature or a synthesis of a <b>divine</b> <b>and</b> human nature, had been condemned as a heresy by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and the tolerant policies towards Monophysitism of Zeno and Anastasius I had {{been a source of}} tension in the relationship with the bishops of Rome. Justin reversed this trend and confirmed the Chalcedonian doctrine, openly condemning the Monophysites. Justinian, who continued this policy, tried to impose religious unity on his subjects by forcing them to accept doctrinal compromises that might appeal to all parties, a policy that proved unsuccessful as he satisfied none of them.|$|E
5|$|Most Christians {{believe that}} Jesus was {{both human and}} the Son of God. While there has been {{theological}} debate over his nature, Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate to the Father, and others considered him {{an aspect of the}} Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with Jesus both fully human and fully God. Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is the Logos, God's incarnation and God the Son, both fully <b>divine</b> <b>and</b> fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E

5|$|Three legends are narrated to the {{establishment}} of the monastery. In the first legend it is said that location of the present Monastery was selected by a horse which belonged to Merag Lama Lodre Gyatso who was on a mission assigned to him by the 5th Dalai Lama to establish a Monastery. After an intense search, when he failed to locate a suitable place, he retired into a cave to offer prayers seeking divine intervention to choose the site. When {{he came out of the}} cave, he found his horse missing. He then went in search of the horse and finally found it grazing at the top of a mountain called Tana Mandekhang, which in the past was the palace of King Kala Wangpo. He took this as a <b>divine</b> <b>and</b> auspicious guidance and decided to establish the monastery at that location. Seeking the help of the local people, Mera Lama established the monastery at that location in the latter part of 1681.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the regular}} Sharingan, which appears {{identical}} from user to user, the Mangekyō Sharingan's tomoe seal differs between individuals. Its abilities were usually derived from Japanese mythology, hence giving the interpretation {{that they are}} one of the <b>divine</b> <b>and</b> most powerful ninja techniques ever used. Also, the Mangekyō seems to grant different kinds of abilities to each of its users, though some might share the same jutsu, as Sasuke and Itachi share the ability to perform Amaterasu, while all members have the potential to construct a Susanoo. Features of the Mangekyō Sharingan include Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu. When the user has mastered the full power of both of their eyes, regardless of what kind of Mangekyō abilities they have, the user gains the ability to create a construct of chakra called a Susanoo. Other Mangekyō abilities include Kamui and , awakened in Shisui's Mangekyō Sharingan, which granted him the ability to control other people's minds without them knowing.|$|E

5|$|Virgil C Aldrich {{reviewed}} the book alongside Religion and the Modern Mind and The Gate of Silence, also by Stace {{and published in}} 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a Hume or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive <b>divine</b> <b>and</b> religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because {{it is difficult to}} determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.|$|E
5|$|Newton's {{monument}} (1731) {{can be seen}} in Westminster Abbey, at {{the north}} of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect William Kent. The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism. The Latin inscription on the base translates as:Here is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of mind almost <b>divine,</b> <b>and</b> mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced. Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners.
