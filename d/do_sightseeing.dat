2500|$|He {{was born}} into {{privilege}} in Düsseldorf, Germany, in 1869. [...] As a young child he was largely tutored, due to having an illness following a chest injury. He was also frequently in trouble due to his free-spirited nature. [...] He spent time in London, England, following his graduation from secondary education, due to his parents' wanting him to learn the English language. [...] While there {{he spent much of}} his time going to various museums and historical places; his liberal allowance from his parents meant plenty of time to learn English and <b>do</b> <b>sightseeing.</b> After his time in London, as two of his paternal uncles were living in Indianapolis, Indiana, he decided to go to the Hoosier state in 1891. This was with his parents' blessing: they feared he was gaining socialism's attitudes from his time in London after a Christmas trip back to Düsseldorf. His first job in America was working as a reporter for the Indiana Tribune, eventually marrying Emma Rappaport, the daughter of the owner. After the sale of the paper, he started his own personal businesses. Liking the freedom he felt in America, he publicly forsook his German citizenship.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—People <b>do</b> <b>{{sightseeing}}</b> {{in their}} spare time to relax, and sightseeing {{is an important}} industry for some regions. The satisfaction of tourists critically depends on weather during their tours. In order to give people maximum satisfaction, {{we have to take}} care of the weather when planning a schedule. However, if there are many possible patterns for weather changes, the number of possible schedules will be very large, and in this case, it is difficult to find a good schedule. In this paper, we formulate the problem to compose schedules for probabilistically changing weather when the probability of future weather is given. We also propose an approximation algorithm for this problem based on the greedy search and the neighborhood search techniques. To evaluate the proposed method, we compare our method with Brute force method and a greedy method for an instance of Beijing sightseeing. As a result, the proposed method found the optimal solution in 6 sec, while the Brute force method took 16 hours. The proposed method composed a schedule whose expected satisfaction is 17. 9 % higher than that composed by the greedy method, for an instance with 20 destinations. I...|$|E

500|$|The {{journey to}} Philadelphia was Mason's first beyond Virginia and Maryland. According to Josephine T. Pacheco {{in her article}} about Mason's role at Philadelphia, [...] "since Virginia's leaders {{regarded}} [...] as a wise, trustworthy man, {{it is not surprising}} that they chose him as a member of the Virginia delegation, though they must have been surprised when he accepted". Broadwater suggested that Mason went to Philadelphia because he knew the federal congress needed additional power, and because he felt that body could act as a check on the powers of state legislatures. As the Virginians waited for the other delegates to arrive, they met each day and formulated what became known as the Virginia Plan. They also <b>did</b> some <b>sightseeing,</b> and were presented to Pennsylvania's president, Benjamin Franklin. Within a week of arrival, Mason was bored with the social events to which the delegates were invited, [...] "I begin to grow tired of the etiquette and nonsense so fashionable in this city".|$|R

How I do admire {{a man who can}} sit down and whale away with a pen just the same as if it was fishing--or something else as full of pleasure and as void of labor. I can't do it; else, in common decency, I would when I write to you. Joe, if I can make a book out of the matter gathered in your company over here, the book is safe; but I don't think I have gathered any matter before or since your visit worth writing up. I do wish you were in Rome to <b>do</b> my <b>sightseeing</b> for me. Rome interests me as much as East Hartford could, and no more. That is, the Rome which the average tourist feels an interest in; but there are other things here which stir me enough to make life worth living. Livy and Clara Spaulding are having a royal time worshiping the old Masters, and I as good a time gritting my ineffectual teeth over them.|$|R

He then tells her that he has realized that bullies will always exist, and while such stages in life seem as if they will last forever to children, one day he will grow into a happy adult, and as she lies dying in a hospital, he will visit her to show her that he is still alive and happy, while she will die the same empty, sad person she's always been.

5000|$|While {{using their}} aquatic morphs {{to chase the}} Yeerks' new Sea Blade, which was after the Pemalite ship, the Animorphs and Ax find {{themselves}} beached inside an underwater cavern. The cavern seems to be littered, however, with several different types of air and sea craft, with {{what appears to be}} human statues inside. Further inspection by Cassie and Ax reveals that these people were real, and were killed and stuffed for preservation. While attempting to escape and locate Visser Three, whose ship was taken by a strange, humanoid aquatic species, Jake, Cassie, Ax, Rachel, and Marco, all in their natural forms, are captured by these life-forms, who reveal themselves as Nartec. (Tobias was on lookout above, and therefore was not captured.) The Nartec queen explains that they once were humans who lived above water, and when their city sunk, they began to adapt to underwater life. Ax realizes that radioactivity is what aided their ability to evolve so quickly. He also surmises that the Nartec have inbred for years, except for possible breeding with their captives prior to killing them, so their genetic code is breaking down. After the Nartec queen makes it clear that she intends to [...] "preserve" [...] the Animorphs, she permits them to <b>do</b> some <b>sightseeing,</b> but warns them not to try and escape.|$|R
40|$|William Thomas Roszell, {{my great}} grandfather, was a {{seventeen}} year old boy when {{the civil war}} began. One year later in August of 1862, he joined the Union cause. As {{a member of the}} Seventh Indiana Volunteer Infantry Regiment, he fought in many important battle of the war including Second Bull Run, Antietam, Gettysburg and Fredericksburg. This paper most closely examines his experiences in the Wilderness Campaign of the Spring of 1864. In the letters he wrote home, he described several aspects of the civil war experience. He wrote of more than just the combat experiences. He also wrote of life in the army camps, food served to the soldiers, the weather during the war and he constantly asked for letters from home. Throughout his nearly three years in the Union army, he saw many sights and met many people. He also was wounded twice. The first time, shortly after joining the army, he received a small nick in the arm. In June of 1864, during the assaults on Petersburg, he was seriously wounded. Hit in the leg by a minnie ball, he was out of combat and in the hospital for several months after receiving the wound. He was furloughed home for two months in the Fall of 1864, but had to return to the army because he had reenlisted. Following his return to the army, {{he spent most of his}} time staying or working in various hospitals. He did return to the front lines for a brief time in the Spring of 1865, but still unable to march, he was soon returned to the hospital. In June of 1865, he was discharged from the army. Though anxious to see his family, he took the opportunity of being away from home and having money to <b>do</b> some <b>sightseeing</b> before going home to his family.

While Uncle Aaron is reading the script, the boys <b>do</b> a little <b>sightseeing.</b> First stop is a call girl service in Beverly Hills where they meet Madame Cassandra (Britt Ekland) and her girls; Jessica (Debra Lamb), Claudia (Jillian Kesner) and Kristina (Michelle Bauer), all of whom are vampires. Kyle, trying to be faithful to his girlfriend Molly (Brigitte Burdine), leaves the brothel. When neither Brock nor Russell return home that night, Kyle revisits the brothel only to find that no one remembers his friends. Kyle goes to the police, but they advise him to wait until his friends show up. Becoming worried, Kyle calls Molly who catches the next flight to Hollywood. While explaining the disappearance to Uncle Aaron, Brock shows up, looking pale and clammy and with two bites on his neck. Sure that they are dealing with vampires, they get advice (and props) from Father Ferraro (Robert Quarry) and, one by one, Kyle destroys the vampires...except for Brock and Molly.|$|R
50|$|In the movie, {{the shuttle}} takes off {{horizontally}} and the Pas-Com (Passenger Compartment) rises {{out of the}} cargo bay so you can <b>do</b> some orbital <b>sightseeing.</b> The shuttle passes Space Shuttle Destiny, which is doing some cleanup work around the atmosphere. Next the shuttle passes an HBO satellite and the Space Station Freedom. The shuttle then makes its way away from Earth and enters LRVM warp and exits {{a short distance from}} the moon. The shuttle then flies over the Sea of Tranquility and over Armstrong City. Shortly before landing in the city an alert is sent to the shuttle crew ordering them to investigate a meteor danger in the area. The shuttle, not even getting a chance to land, takes off again towards an asteroid belt. America is then hit by an asteroid and is now fighting to survive in the asteroid field. America begins blasting asteroids with its 'particle beam' (laser). The shuttle then spots the meteor and is alerted it is heading on a direct course to Earth. Unable to destroy it from a distance, the shuttle flies through a canyon and a cave and destroys it from the inside. The shuttle, now crippled, heads immediately back towards the LRVM and warps back to Earth. The hydraulics for the Pas-Com then malfunction just as the shuttle begins Earth re-entry but they come down just before re-entry. The shuttle lands and the ride ends.|$|R
40|$|Understanding tourist {{behaviour}} {{is one of}} {{the fundamental}} aspects of tourism industry and business operators. For tourism organisations, “such types of knowledge will provide tourism organisations with invaluable market intelligence which can be reflected in the organisation’s marketing strategy” (Cohen et al., 2014, p. 898). Within tourism consumer behaviour research, many segments remain largely under-researched (Cohen et al., 2014). One of these segments is international students. The number of international students in Norway has tripled in the recent years. Many are attracted by Norway as a country of study due to its free education system as well as its image as a modern and safe country with great nature. An increasing number of studies on internationals’ students travel behaviour have certainly provided additional knowledge about such segment. However, there are currently no known studies on international students and their travel behaviour in Norway. This study is the first known study focusing on the travel behaviour of international students in Norway. Specifically, Chinese international students were chosen for this study due to the growing and increasing market of Chinese tourists in Norway. Therefore, understanding their travel behaviour is important in order to provide tourism products and attractions, which can satisfy their needs. Additionally, it can also be argued that studies of Chinese international students are able to provide insights into the needs and preferences of the emerging conventional Chinese tourist market (Hughes, Wang, & Shu, 2015), even though they are considered as two markets. The overall aim of this research is “to explore the travel behaviour of Chinese international students in Norway as means to understand their needs and travel related preferences”. A qualitative methodology approach was employed and semi-structured interviews served as the main the research instrument. The participants of this study were Chinese international students enrolled in higher education institutions in Norway. Data analysis was conducted {{on the basis of a}} thematic analysis of transcribed interviews. The findings indicate that while Norway was not chosen as a study country in the first place, the respondents were all amazed and fascinated by the Norwegian nature and environment. They only travelled to the more popular places due to time and budget contradicts, which is consistent with previous findings. Lack of time is also due to voluntary paid-employment in addition to academic commitment. However, lack of companionship was not considered as a barrier as a majority of respondents preferred to either travel alone or in very small groups. This contradicts with previous literatures. There are further contractions with the previous findings, as they preferred to travel by plane rather than private cars and trains as well as preferring cheap and budget accommodation rather than hotels. Another important task of this study was to identify the willingness of the Chinese international students market to the recommend Norway to family and friends to visit Norway as a holiday destination. While they would recommend Norway as a holiday destination, they were more reluctant to recommend Norway as a study destination. The reason for such is due to the educational system, which is beyond the scope of this thesis. The respondents participated did not experience significant travel barriers in general. Nevertheless, a most important finding and contradiction with previous literature is that it was assumed that Chinese international students mostly prefer sightseeing when travelling in the study country. This study revealed that whilst a majority of respondents <b>did</b> state <b>sightseeing</b> as the most popular activity, the reason is that they do not know how to undertake adventure and nature tourism activities nor were they aware of where to find information about such activities. There were thus no lack of interests in adventure and nature-based tourism activities, but travel barriers consist of lack of information and lack of equipment as well as the perception of risk due to lack of perceived skills prevented them to undertake such activities. For tourism operators that wish to target such segment, the findings provide great knowledge for operators to develop products and services to cater to the needs and preferences of this segment. The knowledge acquired about the travel behaviour of Chinese international students can also be beneficial to understand the conventional Chinese tourist segment in Norway. More detailed and comprehensive studies, which use the longitudinal approaches, may be beneficial to contribute further to the body of knowledge...|$|R
