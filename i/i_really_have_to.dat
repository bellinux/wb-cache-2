500|$|Stewart told Vibe {{how he and}} The-Dream came up {{with the}} song's concept. He said [...] "That was Dream and I just getting in the room and clicking,... We were both on two {{different}} keyboards, two different drum machines and once again just got behind the mic and the rest is history." [...] Lyrics include lines like, [...] "But it's the last time, I'm movin' on / I'm throwing on my Louboutins."

In the chorus Lopez singles [...] "I'm throwing on my Louboutins" [...] eight times and overall the word [...] "Louboutins" [...] is spoken thirty-two times across the song. Prefix magazine said that [...] "Louboutins" [...] is used as a metaphor for female empowerment.|$|E

[...] "It must be dawn", the wife responded. [...] "How do you know?", [...] "The scent of fresh grass and flowers has risen and the birds are singing", she responded. The next night he asked the Arab wife the same question. [...] "It must be dawn as the pearls of my {{necklace}} feel cool on my breasts", she answered.

Of course, started with imported stock, but I've made a California strain that will make the French breeders sit up. See Wardman and take your pick. Get Naismith to look them over with you. Stick half a dozen of them in your train-load, with my compliments, and let your Idaho sheepmen get a line on them." ...|$|E
60|$|I grieve {{over your}} {{somewhat}} sorry account {{of your own}} winter record of work, though I allow in it for your habitual extravagance of blackness. Evidently the real meaning {{of it is that}} you are getting so fort all the while that you kick every rung of your ladder away from under you, by mere uncontrollable force, as you mount and mount. But the rungs, I trust, are all the while being carefully picked up, far below, and treasured; this being Alice's, to say nothing of anybody else's, natural care and duty. Give all my love to her and to the beautiful nursing scrap! I want to say thirty things more to her, but my saying power is too finite a quantity. I gather that this will find you happily, and I trust very conveniently and workably, settled at Chocorua--where may the summer be blest to you, and the thermometer low, and the motor-runs many! Now <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get at Harry! But do send this in any case on to Irving Street, {{for the sake of the}} report of the picture. I want them to have the good news of it without delay.|$|E
6000|$|The Miss Wood whom Victor met as {{he entered}} the dining-room that night was {{precisely}} the young lady he had first seen, a calm, smiling, superior person who looked down upon him with good-humored tolerance of his youth and sex, putting him into the position of the bad little boy who <b>has</b> promised not <b>to</b> do so again. She not merely loftily forgave him, she had apparently minimized the offense, and this hurt worst of all.

We {{struggled}} along and finally went ahead in the first half when an Irish kid named Flanagan, our tailback passed for a touchdown." ...|$|R
5000|$|Following the fight, Tate stated, [...] "I think I'm not {{in reality}} quite yet. I can't believe that I <b>have</b> a belt <b>to</b> take home with me. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> dig deep those last couple rounds.

5000|$|Woodbridge admitted, however, {{that his}} least-favorite subject was sports. This was Jack Davis' specialty; {{but during the}} time Davis wasn't available, that work went to Woodbridge. Of course, he drew them well, but struggled. [...] "That subject seemed to come so {{naturally}} to Jack," [...] Woodbridge said. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sweat those jobs." [...] Ironically, Woodbridge's most famous article for Mad was about sports, albeit a stupid, fictitious one. below.|$|R

5000|$|The {{idea came}} really because I {{wanted to thank}} six key {{people who have been}} very closely {{connected}} to the 'Harry Potter' series, and these were people for whom a piece of jewellery wasn't going to cut it.

And well, if I'm doing six <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do seven, and the seventh book will be for this cause, which is so close to my heart. J. K. Rowling ...|$|E
5000|$|Clapton {{stopped playing}} it in 2004, {{as well as}} the song [...] "My Father's Eyes", stating: [...] "I didn't feel the loss any more, which is {{so much a part of}} {{performing}} those songs. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> connect with the feelings that were there when I wrote them.

5000|$|Damon Albarn {{says that}} he is {{affected}} by this song: [...] "It upsets me, that song. It upset me singing it. Doing that vocal upset me greatly.

I don't want to make a mistake or make a misrepresentation." [...] Regarding the theme, Zapata stressed [...] "I'm sure a lot of people are gonna say a thing or two about the show. All <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say is, this show is a love story.
