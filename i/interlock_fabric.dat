40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{simulate}} the deformations of dry fabrics during the first step of LCM (Liquid Closed Moulding) processes. Among the available numerical approaches, 3 D finite elements simulation at the mesoscopic scale seems to lead to a good compromise between realism and complexity. At this scale, the fibrous reinforcement is modeled by an interlacement of yarns assumed to be homogeneous that have to be accurately represented. The paper therefore presents the creation of a, as realistic as possible, 3 D geometrical model of the yarns of complex unit cells. It is achieved through the implementation of an iterative strategy based on two main properties. On the one hand, consistency, which ensures a good description of the contact between the yarns, that is to say, the model does not contain spurious spaces or interpenetrations at the contact area. On the other hand, the variation of the yarn section shape along its trajectory is accounted so that it enables to stick as much as possible to the evolutive shape of the yarn inside the reinforcement. Using this tool and a woven architecture freely implementable by the user, a representative model of any type of reinforcement (2 D, interlock) can be obtained. The obtained CAD model is fully consistent so that it can be directly used for FE simulations at the meso-scale without any modifications or corrections.

40|$|International {{audience}} 3 D interlock {{woven fabrics}} are promising materials {{to replace the}} 2 D structures {{in the field of}} ballistic protection. The structural complexity of this material caused many difficulties in numerical modeling. This paper presents a new tool that permits to generate a geometry model of any woven fabric, then, mesh this model in shell or solid elements, and apply the mechanical properties of yarns to them. The tool shows many advantages over existing software. It is very handy in use with an organization of the functions in menu and using a graphic interface. It can describe correctly the geometry of all textile woven fabrics. With this tool, the orientation of the local axes of finite elements following the yarn direction facilitates defining the yarn mechanical properties in a numerical model. This tool can be largely applied because it is compatible with popular finite element codes such as Abaqus, Ansys, Radioss etc. Thanks to this tool, a finite element model was carried out to describe a ballistic impact on a 3 D warp interlock Kevlar KM 2 ® fabric. This work focuses on studying the effect of friction onto the ballistic impact behavior of this textile interlock structure. Results showed that the friction among yarns affects considerably on the impact behavior of this fabric. The effect of the friction between projectile and yarn is less important. The friction {{plays an important role in}} keeping the fabric structural stability during the impact event. This phenomenon explained why the projectile is easier to penetrate this 3 D warp <b>interlock</b> <b>fabric</b> in the no-friction case.

By this way, the initial configuration of the <b>interlock</b> woven <b>fabric</b> is characterized as an equilibrium configuration, and defined with only few parameters, without requiring any geometrical preprocessor.

40|$|International audienceThe {{transport}} sector {{is one of}} the fastest growing consumer of energy and producer of greenhouse gases in the world. Consequently, transportation means with a low energy consumption, and thus global warming, are more and more demanding as being a major concern again the protection of the environment and hence respect a durable development. This aim can be achieved by reducing the mass of the transportation means and this by replacing metallic materials by composites ones on structural parts subjected to severe mechanical solicitations and this with equal mechanical performances. Indeed, composite materials are able to propose credible answers to the optimization of the thick structural parts with significant size through their good ratio strength/weight and especially their anisotropy which can be adapted to the mechanical solicitation of the structure. To manufacture the composites pieces, the RTM is the more interesting process because it offers the best compromise in terms of repeatability, production rates and low final cost [une référence]. The first step of the process consists in draping a dry preform before injection of the liquid resin. This stage is a delicate phase and the mechanisms taking place are complex and different than the ones occurring during the stamping of metallic sheets. These mechanisms are far from being fully understood [1] which hampers the mastery of the manufacturing process and development of composite materials. In addition, the increasing use of materials with low environmental effect (biomaterials [...] .) and complex weaving architectures (interlock, 3 D fabrics), makes it more difficult. Many methods have been proposed recently to achieve representative sheet forming simulations of dry fabric, with different approaches [2 - 4]. These studies need several key entries such as the dry fabric mechanical properties and the fabric/tool friction coefficient, which have been widely studied [5 - 8]. When dealing with the multiply forming of composite thick parts, a significant relative sliding of the layers occurs [9]. This sliding generates fabric/fabric friction that has been recently studied [10, 11] and where the effect of woven meso-structure on the behavior has been highlighted. However, this relative sliding coupled with the phenomena that occur during the friction [11] can leads to the defects apparition or their amplification. The aim of this study is then to investigate experimentally the effect of fabric/fabric friction behavior on defects apparition when dealing with multilayered shaping of composite dry fabric. For this purpose, forming tests of <b>interlock</b> <b>fabric</b> (G 1151) with prismatic punch were carried out on a specific device [12]. Tests conditions allowing defects apparition, such as wrinkles, in the useful areas of the shapes are used. Tests were realized with one layer and several layers of dry fabric with the same test conditions. Defects and shear angles were quantified in the useful shape areas (fig. 1) for each test then quantitative and qualitative comparisons were made between the different configurations. These comparisons showed that the shear angles on different areas of interest are almost identical between the multilayered shapes and single-ply ones. For defects, the locations of areas on which they appear are the same (fig. 1). However, the importance of each defect and the extent of the affected areas are more significant in the case of multilayered shapes. Additional defects, such as fiber breakage, were also observed in the same areas for this configuration. These measures and observations carried out in this study highlight the effect of the fabric/fabric friction behavior and relative sliding between layers on the defects and their appearance...|$|E

During this research, several parameters has being studied as the influence of the yarns insertions [1 – 4], the degradation of the yarns during the weaving process [5 – 7], and the influence of the resin rate on the ballistic behaviour. The resin rate inside composite materials is dependant on the final application. In ballistic protection, we need to control the resin rate {{in order to have a}} deformable structure in order to absorb the maximum of energy. However, with the warp interlocks weaving structure, the yarns insertions induce empty spaces between the yarns where the resin takes place without being evacuated. The resin rate inside the warp interlocks structures is in the most of cases less than 50 %, which lead to have brittle and hard material during the impact. Contrary to interlocks structures, the existing protection based on prepreg structure have a high fibres ratio around 88 % of weight.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a 3 D woven fabric-based approach {{for the development}} of pressure switch. A fabric substrate, being elastic and extendable is very useful in addition to its high breaking strength and low cost. The developed resistive-type switch is based on the multilayer <b>interlock</b> 3 D <b>fabrics.</b> In the top and bottom layers, certain number of conductive yarns are woven separated by cotton yarns in both transversal and thickness direction. Application of pressure makes the layers of conductive yarn to come in contact, resulting in a short circuit, which may be recorded using multi-meters. Removing the pressure cause the connection points to separate away and it depends on the weave design. Such switch can be used as an on/off switch for usage in security systems, can be sewn into carpets and wearable garments for a number of purposes...|$|R

An interlock knitted preform {{was produced by}} co-knitting polyester filament yarns as fabric reinforcement with polypropylene yarns as matrix material. The benefits of knitting over other fibre architectures are detailed. Energy absorption capacity for specific engineering applications is discussed. Comparison of tensile properties is made between composites and their individual components. The methods of producing <b>interlock</b> limited knitted <b>fabric</b> preforms are explained. Compression moulding of these produced flat thermoplastic composite panels. The hot-pressing process is examined. The method and equipment used in tensile testing are specified. The tensile curves of pure PP matrix, fabric preform and knitted composites in the walewise, coursewise and diagonal directions are noted. The walewise direction demonstrated better tensile properties. The matrix contribution {{on most of the}} load sustained in the elastic region allied with other factors provided a better combination of properties in the knitted composites than in individual components.
