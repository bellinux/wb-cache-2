5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one <b>got</b> <b>even</b> less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|The root of {{the trouble}} was an {{economic}} crisis—initiated by the Panic of 1837—which was entering its sixth year in 1842. A speculative bubble had burst in 1836–39, causing a collapse of the financial sector and a subsequent depression. The country became deeply divided over the best response to the crisis. Conditions <b>got</b> <b>even</b> worse in early 1842 because a deadline was looming. A decade earlier, when the economy was strong, Congress had promised Southern states {{that there would be}} a reduction in hated federal tariffs. Northern states welcomed tariffs, which protected their infant industries. But the South had no industrial base and depended on open access to British markets for their cotton. In a recommendation to Congress, Tyler lamented that it would be necessary to override the Compromise Tariff of 1833 and raise rates beyond the 20 percent limit. Under the previous deal, this would suspend the distribution program, with all revenues going to the federal government.|$|E
25|$|In April 2010, Shaw {{appeared}} on the UK ITV television programme Loose Women, and revealed that she was returning to recording and would be singing the theme song to the British film, Made in Dagenham.

25|$|One minute {{into the}} fourth quarter, Septien kicked a 22-yard field goal that {{cut the deficit}} to 21-20. Then Walls {{recovered}} a fumble from running back Walt Easley at midfield to set up White's 21-yard touchdown pass to tight end Doug Cosbie, giving Dallas a 27–21 advantage. Things <b>got</b> <b>even</b> better for Dallas when Walls recorded his second interception from Montana on the next drive at the Cowboys 27. Dallas managed {{to pick up a}} few first downs, but was forced to punt, and White's kick gave San Francisco the ball at their own 11 with 4:54 left in the game.|$|E
25|$|It <b>got</b> <b>even</b> {{worse in}} 1991–92. Before the season even began, Tarpley {{violated}} the league's substance abuse {{policy for the}} third time and was banned from the NBA for life. The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete. The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury. Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season—hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks. The team finished with a 22–60 record.|$|E
25|$|Pitching {{continued}} to be problematic for the Cardinals in August. Mark Mulder, attempting {{to come back from}} his shoulder injury, made two starts {{towards the end of the}} month, got hit very hard both times, and return to the disabled list, where he would stay for the rest of the season. He ended the worst year of his career with a 7.14 ERA. Jason Marquis' miserable year <b>got</b> <b>even</b> worse, with a 6.75 ERA for August. New acquisition Jeff Weaver followed up his 6.46 July with a 5.67 August. Closer Jason Isringhausen also struggled, blowing two saves, taking three losses and posting a 5.06 ERA for the month.|$|E

25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He <b>got</b> <b>even,</b> though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. Sometimes I think I can still feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|E
25|$|As Dorsey became successful, he made further {{business}} {{decisions in the}} music industry. He loaned Glenn Miller money to launch Miller's successful band of 1938, but Dorsey saw the loan as an investment, entitling him to a percentage of Miller's income. When Miller balked at this, the angry Dorsey <b>got</b> <b>even</b> by sponsoring a new band led by Bob Chester, and hiring arrangers who deliberately copied Miller's style and sound. Dorsey branched out in the mid-1940s and owned two music publishing companies, Sun and Embassy. After opening at the Los Angeles ballroom, the Hollywood Palladium on the Palladium's first night, Dorsey's relations with the ballroom soured and he opened a competing ballroom, the Casino Gardens circa 1944. Dorsey also owned {{for a short time}} a trade magazine called The Bandstand.|$|E
25|$|In 1809 Bavaria {{was again}} engaged in war with Austria {{on the side}} of France. The Tyroleans rose up against the Bavarian {{authority}} and succeeded three times in defeating Bavarian and French troops trying to retake the country. Austria lost the war of the Fifth Coalition against France, and <b>got</b> <b>even</b> harsher terms in the Treaty of Schönbrunn in 1809. Often glorified as Tirol's national hero, Andreas Hofer, the leader of the uprising, was executed in 1810 in Mantua, having lost a third and final battle against the French and Bavarian forces. By the treaty signed at Paris on 28 February 1810 Bavaria ceded southern Tirol to Italy and some small districts to Württemberg, receiving as compensation parts of Salzburg, the Innviertel and Hausruck and the principalities of Bayreuth and Regensburg. So far the policy of Montgelas had been brilliantly successful; but the star of Napoleon had now reached its zenith and already the astute opportunist had noted the signs of the coming change.|$|E

25|$|During Prima Vera's hiatus {{in early}} 1984, Falsk toured Norway with a solo {{stand-up}} comedy show. Prima Vera's shows {{had always had}} a certain element of toilet humor in their material, but for his solo act, Falsk <b>got</b> <b>even</b> dirtier. Falsk's solo act was described by some critics as vulgar and obscene, {{but in spite of}} this, or maybe because of it, the show was a big hit with the fans. The show was also recorded and released as an album, called Born in Drammen, which {{is believed to be the}} first ever stand-up comedy album released in Norway. The album title is a reference to Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA, which topped the charts in Norway at the time, and the album cover is an almost exact copy of the Born in the USA cover, except that Falsk is not wearing jeans or even underpants on the picture. After the Prima Vera breakup, Falsk did another comedy tour in 1985, and released a second comedy album called Falskboy, which also contained a few songs by Tom Mathisen.|$|E
25|$|The Falcons {{started off}} {{the third quarter}} with an 8-play, 71-yard drive, {{including}} Bartkowski's passes to Floyd Hodge and Alfred Jenkins for gains of 25 and 22 yards. Faced with fourth down on the Vikings 17-yard line, Atlanta managed to fool the Minnesota defense with a fake field goal play. Backup quarterback Mike Moroski, the holder on field goal plays, took the snap and started run right, but then pitched the ball to kicker Mick Luckhurst, who raced 17 {{yards for a touchdown}} (the only rush attempt of his career) to give his team a 14-13 lead. The situation <b>got</b> <b>even</b> better for Atlanta just two minutes later when safety Bob Glazebrook intercepted Kramer's pass and returned it 35 yards for a touchdown. However, the Vikings managed to cut their deficit down to one score {{before the end of the}} third quarter with a 70-yard drive that included Kramer's 18-yard completion to tight end Joe Senser. Danmier finished off the series with a 39-yard field goal, making the score 21-16 going into the final quarter.|$|E
500|$|... "Conquistador" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} at special concerts, dubbed as Church of Mars, in May 2013, {{shortly before the}} release of the album. It later became a signature part of the following Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour. The song, along with [...] "Birth", usually served as a set opener during the entirety of the tour, much like their appearances on Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams as opening tracks. However, it was later moved {{to the middle of the}} setlist. Fans and critics responded favorably to the song in a live setting. Ashley Zimmerman from the New Times Broward-Palm Beach felt that [...] "everyone <b>got</b> <b>even</b> more amped" [...] as the band performed songs like [...] "Conquistador", while Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic deemed it a highlight of the show.|$|E

500|$|The {{twinning}} between {{supporters of}} the clubs Napoli and Genoa football club {{is one of the}} oldest in Italian football. It began on 16 May 1982 following a 2–2 draw in Naples between the two teams on the final day of the 1981–82 Serie A season, a result that allowed Genoa's escape from relegation and condemned Milan to relegation from Serie A to Serie B for the second time in its history. The history and friendship <b>got</b> <b>even</b> stronger for both teams when on the last day of the 2006–07 Serie B season, when both teams drew 0–0 draw at Genoa, ensuring both teams' promotion to Serie A. Genoa ultras could be seen holding up banners saying, [...] "Benvenuto fratello napoletano," [...] meaning, [...] "Welcome, Neapolitan brother." [...] The historic partnership between the two groups of supporters was also honoured and supported by marketing initiatives.|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, the UK PM Gordon Brown used {{provisions}} in part 2 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 to freeze Landsbanki holdings in the United Kingdom. Iceland's prime minister Geir Haarde protested {{against what he}} described as [...] "a terrorist law being applied against us", calling it [...] "a completely unfriendly act". Angered by the British decision, Iceland decided to submit a formal complaint to NATO about their move, and it also provoked more than 80,000 Icelandics (equal to 25% of its entire population) to sign an online petition set up under the heading [...] "Icelanders are not terrorists". The relationship <b>got</b> <b>even</b> tenser when UK replied a month later by cancelling its scheduled patrol of the Icelandic airspace in December 2008. Iceland has no standing army of its own, and relies on a long-term standing agreement with NATO where a group of member states have committed in turns to defend the Icelandic airspace, and the UK Royal Air Force had now cancelled this after mutual agreement with NATO (presumably with another member state having accepted to overtake the liability).|$|E
500|$|The convoy {{encountered}} a strong storm on 4 October that <b>got</b> <b>even</b> stronger {{over the next}} several days; by the morning of 6 October it was assessed as a Force 11 storm on the Beaufort scale with mountainous seas. The storm forced the British destroyers that were to rendezvous with them back into port on 5 October and the last American escort departed at 06:00. The weather prevented accurate navigation and the convoy was forced to proceed by dead reckoning. The ship's officers were uncertain if they were off the northern coast of Ireland or the western coast of Scotland. When dawn broke it revealed a rocky coastline [...] to their east, just ahead of the convoy. Most of the ships correctly thought this was the Scottish coast and turned south, but Otrantos officer of the deck thought that it was the Irish coast and turned north. , another liner turned troopship, was only about a half mile (0.80 km) to Otrantos north and the turns placed them on a collision course. Both ships attempted to avoid the collision, but their efforts cancelled out and Kashmir rammed Otranto on the port side amidships, a few miles off the rocky coast of Islay.|$|E

500|$|In 1985, Westwood One, a major radio {{production}} company and syndicator—that is, a budding network—was looking {{to expand its}} operations. [...] Westwood and Mutual were a good match: The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult; most of the stations that bought Westwood's programming, {{much of it in}} the pop music field, had substantially younger audiences. [...] Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked. [...] And there was Mutual's size; though down from its peak, it still commanded 810 affiliates, a strong second among the Big Four. In September 1985, Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $39 million. [...] "It's a perfect fit," [...] declared Westwood head Norman J. Pattiz. Referring to the united company's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep, he called it [...] "a classic case of two plus two equaling five." [...] In 1987, the number <b>got</b> <b>even</b> bigger: Westwood One snapped up Mutual's long-time competitor, the NBC Radio Network, for $50 million. Mutual was now part of a much larger programming service, and its identity was being slowly phased out. In 1993, when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up, the late-night call-in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon; within a few years, it was a Westwood One–branded show. Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994. In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December, CBS's new parent company, Westinghouse, acquired Infinity for just shy of $5 billion. The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged.|$|E
500|$|Parks and Recreation {{continued}} to receive critical acclaim, {{as it did}} during the second season. The show was featured on the February 11 cover of Entertainment Weekly, where it was called [...] "the smartest comedy on TV" [...] and which included the article [...] "The 101 Reasons We Love Parks and Recreation". James Poniewozik of Time magazine called it [...] "a fabulous season – the best thing on TV in 2011 so far". Maureen Ryan of TV Squad called {{it one of the}} ten best shows of 2011, and said the season saw major growth of both its major characters, especially Leslie Knope, along with the expansion of a strong cast of secondary and tertiary characters as well. New York magazine writer Willa Paskin praised the show for comedy grounded in optimism and characters who genuinely like each other, rather than the cynical humor more prevalent in other comedy shows of the time. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called it a [...] "remarkable season of TV comedy" [...] without a single bad episode. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club said although he considered Parks and Recreation the funniest sitcom on television during its second season, [...] "it somehow <b>got</b> <b>even</b> better" [...] during the third. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic said during the third season, Parks and Recreation was [...] "the funniest, sweetest, most consistent sitcom on television", and that the way the characters were seeking new opportunities outside the parks department {{by the end of the}} season demonstrates the show is willing to change and is [...] "not content to simply spin its wheels". Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said he believed that the third season [...] "will become to be recognized as one of the best seasons of any sitcom ever", and that the characters and setting of Pawnee were so fully developed that he felt a close, personal connection to them. Henry Hanks of CNN called it [...] "a near-flawless season".|$|E
