5|$|Early in {{the race}} John Downie crashed into a pub in Ballasalla, but the car did not sustain {{extensive}} damage {{and he was able}} to continue the race. At Keppel Gate on the Mountain Road, Frederick Bennett, who had been unable to take part in the practice sessions and therefore did not know the course very well, approached a corner with too much speed in his Cadillac and crashed, ripping off two of the wheels. Bennett managed to stay in the vehicle and avoided serious injury. Another driver to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track was J. Hadley in his Wolseley, who also carried too much speed into a corner, leading him to drive off through a hedge and into a field. The Thornycroft driven by Tom Thornycroft had been following closely behind, and the two cars collided during the incident, damaging one of the Thornycroft's rear wheels. Napier in his Arrol-Johnston made the quickest circuit of the first lap in one hour, 32 minutes and 36 seconds.|$|E
5|$|This Amazon {{is famous}} in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; {{some of the}} {{inhabitants}} dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in {{the centre of the}} floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> side of the wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she {{is said to have been}} much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.|$|E
5|$|Gusty winds downed several trees across Alexandria, causing about $2million {{in damage}} (2003USD, $2.3million 2008USD). In Arlington County, {{flooding}} and downed trees destroyed twohouses and damaged 192homes, 46severely. The storm surge flooded {{a parking lot}} at the Reagan National Airport. Damage in the county totaled $2.5million (2003USD, $2.9million 2008USD). Falling trees caused major damage to 15homes in the city of Fairfax, and damage throughout Fairfax County totaled $18million (2003USD, $21million 2008USD). Four homes and 20businesses in King George County were severely damaged, with an additional 150–200 reporting lesser damage from winds and falling trees. Gusty winds forced the closure of the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge. In Prince William County, seven homes were destroyed, with 24homes and three businesses experiencing major damage. Several roads were closed due to downed trees. The Marine Corps Base Quantico reported severe damage amounting to $9.5million (2003USD, $11million 2008USD). Damage included a destroyed marina from flooding, with falling trees damaging buildings and vehicles. Additionally, fallen trees severely damaged 31homes and caused minor damage to 68more in Stafford County. The roof of a shelter in Mathews County was partially blown off. A power outage in Northumberland County caused the NOAA Weather Radio Station in Heathsville to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air {{during the height of the}} storm, leaving the transmitter out of service for several days.|$|E

25|$|As {{he looks}} for the shiny pair, he meets Lisa (Gita)—another orphan mouse—and her parrot Pico (Amadeus); both came from a circus whose ringmaster treated them badly and left them behind. During their journey, the two mice and their pets meet Melvin's hardworking mother and help her chop wood. Worried about her son's bad deeds, Melvin's mother gives Lapitch a silver coin for luck before they <b>go</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> mouse later gives it to the raccoon, after he falls off Dirty Rat's wagon.|$|E
25|$|Chicago's first {{touchdown}} {{resulted on}} a New York punt attempt {{from their own}} 12, forcing Sean Landeta to make the kick three yards into his goal line. As Landeta dropped the ball to kick it, the wind altered the ball's descent and caused it to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> side of his foot. As a result, the ball went right {{into the ground and}} bounced a short distance before reserve safety Shaun Gayle picked it up and returned the -7 yard punt five yards for a touchdown. Gayle's run was the shortest punt return touchdown in NFL history.|$|E
25|$|In {{an abrupt}} reversal, on May 28, 1975, WHFV {{suddenly}} notified the FCC {{it was out}} of money and would <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air the next day. The station, having waited as long as it could for FCC approval of the sale, blamed inaction on Release the World's part. The FCC agreed, stating that Release the World had been notified that it failed to submit complete financial information in its application to transfer control. The FCC placed the application on hold and did not take any action while it awaited completed information. (Potential transferees must prove they have enough cash on hand to acquire the station and run it for one year.) The FCC set an original deadline of May 22 to complete the application, after which it would close and eventually be dismissed. Release the World negotiated an extension to May 29.|$|E

25|$|From there, the {{situation}} deteriorated for Zimbabwe. Chris Mpofu injured {{his leg and}} had to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field, leaving only three bowlers, whom Brendon McCullum and Daniel Vettori attacked with venom. Both reached their centuries in less than 100 balls, Vettori smacking twenty fours and two sixes in his 127 before finally being bowled by Streak. Vettori had enjoyed a slice of luck - having inside edged onto his leg stump, the bail refused to fall down, and Vettori made a further 60. By {{the time he was}} out, the score had exploded to 432 for 9 - helped by Shane Bond's blitzing 41. At stumps on day one, New Zealand were 452 for 9, and comfortably back in the drivers' seat, as Zimbabwe were left to rue all the poor deliveries in the evening session - which had yielded 213 runs.|$|E
25|$|More recently, another {{starting}} position choice has been allowed, {{known as the}} optional offensive {{starting position}} or optional start. After the wrestler with the choice (the offensive wrestler) indicates his intention to the referee, the referee lets the defensive wrestler adjust and begin in the defensive starting position. Next, the offensive wrestler goes {{to either side of}} the defensive wrestler or behind him, with all his weight supported by both his feet or by one or both knees. The offensive wrestler would then place both his hands on the opponent's back between the neck and the waist. When the referee starts the match by blowing the whistle, the defensive wrestler then has the opportunity to get back to his feet in a neutral position. Any of the starting positions may be used to resume action during a period when the wrestlers <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> mat, depending on the referee's judgment as to whether any or which wrestler had the position of advantage.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{this recent}} run of poor scores, Ponting was {{promoted}} to the key No. 3 position in the Australian batting order {{at the expense of}} the dropped Justin Langer, while Damien Martyn took Ponting's former spot at No. 6, for the very next Test series, the 2001 Ashes tour of England. Ponting began the series poorly, scoring 11, 14, 4, 14 and 17—the first four dismissals all to Darren Gough. In the first innings of the fourth Test, Ponting stood his ground while on 0 after edging to slips and refused to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field without a TV replay. Replays revealed that the ball had been grassed and Ponting subsequently went on to score 144 and 72 in the second innings. He scored his 216 runs in only 226 balls. In doing so, he repeated his feat in 1997 of returning to form at Headingley. He ended the series with 338 runs at 42.25. Starting with that 2001 Ashes series he has batted No. 3 in all but four of his Test innings.|$|E

He's successful, as Ryan does as he's instructed, but Ryan is in turn shot and killed by Cordero's bodyguard. Eventually Kaplow makes his big move and bombs the FBI headquarters, during which time he kidnaps Ordonez. Tom makes his way to Ordonez's house, where he sees that Kaplow has tied her up and strapped a bomb to the agent. The two men fight and Kaplow manages to force Tom to handcuff himself. A policeman arrives on the scene but is killed by Kaplow, who is wounded in the process. Kaplow then escapes the house and detonates the bomb, believing that {{this is the end of}} Tom and Ordonez. However Kaplow then receives a call from Tom stating that they are not dead and that Kaplow's bullet proof vest is rigged to bombs. Finally, Tom detonates the bomb and Kaplow explodes inside the police car.|$|E
25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Thursday morning, lasted 45 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Alex Lynn set the fastest time for Theodore Racing by Prema in the opening practice session—held in variable weather conditions—with a lap of two minutes and 14.495 seconds, 0.061 seconds faster than any one else at the track. His closest challenger was Félix da Costa in second in front of third-placed Coletti and Mücke Motorsport's Felix Rosenqvist in fourth position. Alexander Sims was fifth-fastest, ahead of Jaafar. Tom Blomqvist, Marciello, Lucas Auer and Korjus rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Sainz {{was the first of}} the drivers to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track in wet conditions and rebounded off the Fisherman's Corner barriers with his car's rear-end. His teammate King understeered into the same barrier eleven minutes later, while Rosenqvist crashed at San Francisco Bend on dirty tyres due to him running wide at Lisboa turn. Three other drivers—Sekiguchi, Lucas Wolf and Sun Zheng—failed to record a lap time as a consequence of encountering incidents during the session.|$|E
500|$|The attacks evoked severe {{responses}} from {{political parties and}} their leaders, particularly of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Mayawati, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, accused the Congress-ruled Maharashtra government of failing to prevent the attacks. She demanded centre intervention to protect the lives and properties of North Indians in the state. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said [...] "Mumbai ujad jayega (Mumbai will be ruined)". In response to the attacks on taxi drivers and vendors, he added, [...] "What will happen in Mumbai if taxis <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> roads? Mumbai will come to a standstill".|$|E

Nutt and Speer admitted that the series was beginning to deteriorate with this game, likely due to the growing reputation of the more powerful Super Nintendo Entertainment System {{at the time of its}} release. Parrish proclaimed, [...] "Here's where the series starts to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rails a bit -- the Dr. Wily fake out was silly, the music was terrible, the bosses and weapons were uninspired, and the ability to charge up the Mega Buster is often cited as a game-breaking innovation." [...] Thomas identified the chargeable Mega Buster as disrupting the balance of the game and rendering many of the Master Weapons useless, one of the concepts that set the Mega Man games apart from other action-platformers.|$|E
