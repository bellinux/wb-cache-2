5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's {{built-in}} RF modulator can output a video {{picture to}} either a UHF 625-line colour or monochrome television (used in the UK, Australia, and most western European countries). France required a slightly {{modified version of the}} machine to match the positive video modulation of SECAM sets, while the USA and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their 525-line VHF (NTSC) television systems. Both the ZX81 and its predecessor, the ZX80, have a significant drawback <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> handle visual output. Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display. On the ZX80, this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation – such as processing a keystroke – takes place.|$|E

25|$|Consumer {{behaviour}} is {{the study}} of the motivations surrounding a purchase of a product or service. It has been linked to the field of psychology, sociology and economics in attempts to analyse when, why, where and how people purchase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do. However, little literature has considered the link between our consumption behaviour and the basics of our being, our biology. Segmentation by biological driven demographics such as sex and age are already popular and pervasive in marketing. As more knowledge and research is known, targeting based on a consumers biology is of growing interest and use to marketers.|$|E

Stowe from Spin was appreciative of the extended play. He wrote that Ivy was unlike other New York City bands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> catered to [...] "unabashed pop melodies" [...] and later joked that the [...] "concept [...] so far out it's in"; Stowe also described their version of [...] "I Guess I'm Just a Little Too Sensitive" [...] as a [...] "charming" [...] and [...] "special treat".|$|E

500|$|Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 {{were both}} startled and {{challenged}} by the single. Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon's house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, [...] "It seemed {{to go on and}} on forever. It was just beautiful... He showed all of us {{that it was possible to}} go a little further." [...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should have." [...] Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single.

500|$|On July 11, 2015, the EPB issued another statement, {{this time}} warning that [...] "they {{will do what}} is necessary" [...] {{according}} to the moment's circumstances and that [...] "the people should not pay a debt that {{does not belong to}} the people". Thorough its spokesman, the group anticipated that [...] " [...] ineptitude and impotency" [...] the government would exploit the crisis to privatize profits and socialize losses, citing the privatization of the turnpike system, Luis Munoz Marin Airport, the Puerto Rico Telephone Company and the Teodoro Moscoso Bridge as previous examples of this tendency. The EBP expressed dissatisfaction in what they perceived as [...] "an environment of indifference" [...] within sectors of local society that [...] "still expect magic solutions" [...] from those responsible for the crisis, which serves as a hindrance to the militant action that they pursue. Commander Guasábara then offers an alliance that oversees previous differences. In asking the rhetoric question [...] "What would you do for yourself, your children and your country?" [...] the Macheteros urged the public to hold an investigation and [...] "judge those responsible" [...] for what they consider an [...] "irresponsible and unnecessary debt [...] the corrupt administrations that we have tolerated for 50 years". The EPB concluded this press release by urging the public to [...] "take the streets and manifest their anger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> prefer", but not before stating that the time for marches was gone and that it is [...] "time to take action".|$|E

40|$|One way {{in which}} law protects dignity is by {{enforcing}} human rights provisions that explictly or implicitly involve the protection of dignity or the prevention of degradation. But law 2 ̆ 7 s connection with dignity is also much deeper and more pervasive than this. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it operates, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it presents its requirements, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> law expects its requirements to be taken on baord and observed by those to whom the requirements are primarily addressed, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> procedural <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it organizes hearings, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it sponsors argumentation, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it arranages for coercion [...] in all these ways, law treats humans as dignified agents, capable of self-control, {{with a sense of}} themsleves and their interests, and with the ability to respond intelligently and thoughtfully to its demands. These ideas, which originate with some comments by Lon Fuller, in 2 ̆ 2 The Morality of Law, 2 ̆ 2 are developed extensively <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present paper. Of course it is true that law is sometimes brutal and degrading in its application; but the paper argues that it is part of law 2 ̆ 7 s inherently aspirational character to deal with human persons as dignified agents, and that this distinguishes legal forms of control from other modes of governance...|$|R

The distinction, though is that the Vestals wore the stola, which is {{associated}} more with matrons, while brides {{were associated with the}} tunica recta. The stola is a long gown that covers the body, and this covering of the body by way of the gown “signals the prohibitions that governed [...] sexuality.” Stola literally communicates the message of “hands off” and further communicates their virginity.|$|E

2500|$|At {{a meeting}} at Crickhowell on 20 December 2007, British Waterways {{announced}} the preliminary results of the investigations: there were over 90 leaks on the section from Talybont to Gilwern, with less leakage on the stretch from Llanover to Goytre Wharf. A press release in February 2008 announced that {{the total cost of}} restoration was likely to be around £15 million, with major investment required in the 2008/9 financial year, to repair the breach and to deal with other areas identified as being of top priority. The aim of the work would be to ensure that the canal would be safe and fully open from March 2009, but further work would be required during the following three winters to complete the process. Their actions earned British Waterways the praise of Rhodri Glyn Thomas of the Welsh Assembly, who applauded their [...] "courageous decision" [...] to manage the breach <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had.

We could say [...] "Oh, they are not really skilled, they are just lucky. They are just a statistical anomaly." [...] Moving on from this, we could say this about anything and everything. We could say this about professional football players, master chefs and seminal guitar players. None of these people, by EMH logic, should be seen as skilled. Rather, they are just getting lucky over and over again. The professional football players are just getting lucky every time they play well; the master chef is getting lucky every time he cooks a fabulous meal; and the seminal guitar player is just fortunate that his hands move <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do.

2500|$|On {{the day of}} its unveiling, the {{painting}} received considerable press attention from photographers, cameramen, reporters, and art critics and lovers. The portrait divided critics, seen in a negative light by many. Michael Glover of The Independent [...] described it as [...] "catastrophic", and noted that it lacked context. When presented with Glover's comments on the BBC, the artist laughed them off, quipping [...] "can he draw?" [...] He noted that he believes in his work, and understands {{that there would be}} different points of view. Some critics believed that the shading below her eyes and her jawline aged her. Waldemar Januszczak of the Sunday Times described the portrait as [...] "disappointing", saying that it was [...] "pretty ordinary... He made her look older than she is and her eyes don't sparkle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> do and there's something rather dour about the face." [...] Robin Simon of the Daily Mail described it as [...] "rotten" [...] and said it is fortunate that Catherine looks nothing like it in real life. Charlotte Higgins, of The Guardian, compared the depiction of Kate to a character in the Twilight franchise, saying, [...] "The first thing that strikes you about Middleton's visage as it looms from the sepulchral gloom of her first official portrait is the dead eyes: a vampiric, malevolent glare beneath heavy lids. Then there's the mouth: a tightly pursed, mean little lip-clench (she is, presumably, sucking in her fangs). And God knows {{what is going on with}} the washed-out cheeks: she appears to be nurturing a gobbet of gum in her lower right cheek.
