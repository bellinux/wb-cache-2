The [...] "Ping Pong" [...] diamond had cost only $14 and had been bought for her by Burton after he promised her a diamond if she beat him by ten points at a game of ping pong. When people praised her {{diamonds}} at the ball, Taylor would make a show of pretending that they were praising the Ping Pong diamond and not its much larger counterparts. Burton wrote in his diary that [...] "Elizabeth's delight in it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> to behold and a very quaint thing to witness is the obvious pleasure that other people take in her wearing it. Even Hjordis Niven and Princess Grace, who are coldish fish, seemed to enjoy her moment. And of course nobody can wear it better. The miraculous face and shoulders and breasts set it off to perfection".|$|E

Also, I have worked with friends, people that I trust and appreciate, like Edward Aninaru, John Perez and Khaled Mokhtar. I thank them for their professionalism."

500|$|Not all reviews, however, were negative. Nader Elhefnawy at Strange Horizons {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "an interesting experiment". He said that Pohl deserves the credit for [...] "capturing Clarke's voice", and that Clarke also deserves credit for doing something completely different. While he would not recommend the book to readers new to Clarke's work, Elhefnawy said that fans would not regret reading the book. Mark Yon at SFF World said that while this {{is not one of}} Clarke's best works, [...] "it is still very good". He said that even though it is a collaboration, the book is still recognisably Clarke, [...] "with the same humour, the same enthusiasm, the great flashes of inspiration, the big ideas and the same curious positivism that underlines most of Sir Arthur’s work. ... There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> throughout here: a joy of learning, of opening up new opportunities and experiences, and a love of mathematics and science." [...] Michael Berry at the San Francisco Chronicle said that the novel does a [...] "stellar job of conveying some of the intellectual fun that can be had by manipulating math." [...] He said that Sri Lanka, Clarke's home for most of his life, is brought [...] "vividly to life", and that despite some minor flaws, The Last Theorem is a [...] "fitting valedictory for Clarke, one of science fiction's most acclaimed authors, and a reminder of Pohl's great relevance to a genre he has championed for more than 70 years." ...|$|E

500|$|Television {{commentators}} {{praised the}} pilot episode. Heather Havrilesky of Salon declared that [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" [...] raised expectations for future {{competition at the}} time, and added that it emulated {{some of the best}} episodes of The Sopranos. Chicago Tribune journalist Maureen Ryan said that it was an [...] "intelligently made character drama". In his four star review, Adam Buckman of New York Post described it as [...] "stunning" [...] and suggested that Mad Men [...] "just happens to be the finest new TV series of the summer and possibly the entire year". Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle and Brian Lowry of Variety lauded the episode for its historical accuracy; [...] "Just because they're on the cusp of a new decade does not mean they can see what viewers already know is around the corner," [...] stated Goodman. [...] "That impending change gives an extra dimension of perspective to the series." [...] Lowry addressed that despite the subtle approach of Mad Men, it managed to provoke a profound meaning. [...] "In that context, the show illustrates that period's own form of excess without wagging fingers, while reminding us that before sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, there was sexual harassment, free-flowing cocktails and bluesy ballads, invariably sung by white guys." [...] USA Today writer Robert Bianco echoed synonymous sentiment: [...] "Mad Men <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> to watch—the clothes, the clocks, the furniture, it's like a mid-century night's dream. But this is no mere period piece. It's a smart, complex drama that attempts to get through the facades that have always hidden the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|McAdams {{appeared}} in three other 2015 films. She starred with her Wedding Crashers co-star Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone and John Krasinski in Cameron Crowe's romantic comedy-drama Aloha. She played the ex-girlfriend of Cooper's character, {{who is married}} to Krasinski's character with two children. While the film received a negative reaction and controversy from critics and audiences alike, McAdams was praised. Wesley Morris of Grantland remarked: [...] "Someone who can speak Crowe’s language really helps. McAdams might be the best he’s ever had ... puts the perfect amount of air in her lines, giving the words a lightness that conflates optimism, amusement, and resignation. She’s never seemed lovelier, more instinctive, or more present." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times felt she [...] "plays likely the strongest, most rounded female character Crowe has ever written, a woman suddenly {{face to face with the}} life she has and the one she might have had, and the actress brings a grounded, unforced earthiness to the role that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joy</b> to watch." [...] She co-starred with Jake Gyllenhaal in the boxing drama Southpaw (2015), where she played the wife of Gyllenhaal's character. The film received mixed reviews but A.O. Scott of The New York Times conceded: [...] "It features some pretty appealing players. There are worse things to see at the multiplex than Ms. McAdams playing a tough cookie standing by her man." [...] She co-starred with James Franco, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Marie-Josée Croze in Wim Wenders's drama Every Thing Will Be Fine. The film received an U.S. limited release in December 2015. Guy Lodge of Variety remarked: [...] "Poor McAdams, sporting sensible hair and a truly mystifying cod-Continental accent, continues her thankless run of needy, tossed-aside love interests in big-name auteur projects." ...|$|E
500|$|Parenting {{is a large}} task within itself, {{and when}} a parent has a career as well, it can cause a double burden, or work–family conflict. Strain begins to develop when women and men find that the demands of their family are {{conflicting}} with the demands from their job. When one is faced with a double burden like this, it affects how decisions are made within a career and in a family; this burden could potentially effect when a couple decides to have children. 75% of all women who have jobs are in their childbearing prime. When the conflict between one's family and work presents itself, the unpaid work that is being done in the home may be cut down, because of the certain health effects, or {{as a solution to}} deal with the greater demands from the workplace. Social outings and visits, and family dinners are two of the first things that get cut back on due to the work/family conflict. In a study by Ari Väänänen, May V. Kevin, et al. found that if a man put a higher importance on their family, were more likely to stay home from work {{in order to deal with}} extreme family demands. Ways that the double burden can be lessened for is with hired help in the house, day-care facilities, and longer maternity leaves for women. For instance, in Norway women are allowed the options of 10months of maternity leave, where they will get 100% of their pay, or 12months leave, where they will only paid 80% of their earnings. Some companies are realizing the effect the double burden of work and a family is having on their employees and are offering flexible work schedules in order to help their employees cope. Not only do these flexible hours help the employee deal with their stress, but it also benefits the company because workers are happier, less likely to be absent, more productive, and the turnover rate is lower for the company. As Sophia Mwangi says, [...] "Parenthood <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>joy.</b> Let us never be burdened by it but let's celebrate the joy that it brings. Celebrate those first steps or words, the first school play, their graduation day, passing those exams, landing their first job, getting married, making you grandparents. Whatever it is, let's celebrate our children. It's not easy, but the art of juggling can always be mastered!" ...|$|E
