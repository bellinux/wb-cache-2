They established that the movement was one that had political, ideological and economic components and was thus aimed at establishing law and order, {{human rights and the}} <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> working people. They also felt that it would work for the benefit and interest of Armenian-Iranians. The final vote was 25 votes in favour and one absentia.|$|E

25|$|The first {{effective}} labor {{organization that}} was more than regional in membership and influence was the Knights of Labor, organized in 1869. The Knights believed in the unity of the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> producing groups and sought to enlist in their ranks not only all laborers but everyone who could be truly classified as a producer. The acceptance of all producers led to explosive growth after 1880. Under the leadership of Terence V. Powderly they championed a variety of causes, sometimes through political or cooperative ventures.|$|E

Most of the profits left Bougainville Island, but its society was disrupted by thousands of workers from Papua New Guinea, as well as Australians. From the mid-1980s, Ona and others challenged the leadership of the Panguna Landowners Association (PLA), claiming that they were not representing the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the traditional landowners.|$|E

Virtual Representation was the British response to the First Continental Congress in the American colonies. The Second Continental Congress asked for representation in Parliament in the Suffolk Resolves, also known as the first Olive Branch Petition. Parliament claimed that their members had the well being of the colonists in mind. The Colonies rejected this premise.|$|E
25|$|After the 1928 election, Smith {{became the}} {{president}} of Empire State, Inc., the corporation that built and operated the Empire State Building. Construction for the building began symbolically on March 17, 1930, St. Patrick's Day, per Smith's instructions. Smith's grandchildren cut the ribbon when the world's tallest skyscraper opened on May 1, 1931, which was May Day, an international labor celebration. It had been completed in a record 13 months for such a large project. As with the Brooklyn Bridge, which Smith had seen being built from his Lower East Side boyhood home, the Empire State Building was a vision and an achievement constructed by combining the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> rather than being divided by interests of a few.|$|E
25|$|In higher education, the {{analysis}} of students’ individual writing assignments after viewing films/documentaries presents an interesting case of using radical ‘messages’ within the aims of environmental education in order to trigger both student’s engagement and critical thinking. The case study “If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound” {{provides an example of}} how environmental advocacy and the objective of pluralistic education can be combined as mutually supportive means of achieving both democratic learning in which students’ individual opinions are seen as extremely valuable, and simultaneously provide an example of the type of ecopedagogy that supports learning for environmental sustainability. The role of environmental advocacy can be crucially important if the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> planetary citizens—and not just one species—are to be taken seriously.|$|E

25|$|The Terrorists of Iraq: Inside the Strategy and Tactics of the Iraq Insurgency 2003–2014 is a non-fiction {{book about}} the Iraqi insurgency, written by U.S. Navy retired {{cryptology}} analyst Malcolm Nance. It was published by CRC Press in 2014. The book discusses terrorist evolution of the Iraqi insurgency {{which led to the}} formation of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). Nance cites the 2003 Iraq war by the Bush Administration for causing regional instability. He criticizes Coalition Provisional Authority leader Paul Bremer. The book emphasizes lessons the U.S. neglected to learn from the Vietnam War, the Iraqi revolt against the British, and the South Lebanon conflict. Nance writes in favor of the Iran nuclear deal framework by the Obama Administration, saying it is in the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> parties involved.|$|E
