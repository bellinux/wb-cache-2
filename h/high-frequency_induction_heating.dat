30|$|Recently, the {{preparation}} of one-dimensional nanowires has received considerable attention due to their excellent properties and widely potential applications. The nanowires such as silicon (Si), zinc oxide (ZnO), gallium nitride (GaN), silicon carbide (SiC) and others [1] have been synthesized by various methods. Among these nanowires, silicon carbide nanowires (SiC NWs) have been attracting extensive interest due to their excellent electronic, {{physical and chemical properties}} and widely application in semiconductor, microelectronics and optoelectronics industry operating in harsh environment like high temperature, high power and high frequency [2, 3]. So far, SiC NWs have been successfully synthesized by various methods, such as carbon nanotubes-confined reaction [4, 5], laser ablation [6], <b>high-frequency</b> <b>induction</b> <b>heating</b> method [7], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [8, 9] and thermal evaporation method [10]. Most of these methods, however, involved complicated equipments and processes, vacuum conditions and metallic catalyst, which limit their further application. Carbothermic reduction of silica is known to be a simple and economical process for the synthesis of SiC nanostructure. According to the previous reports [11, 12], carbon source is very important and has a substantial influence on the rate of reaction and the morphology or size of synthesized SiC. At present, carbon source such as active carbon, carbon nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes [13 – 15] were utilized to synthesize SiC NWs. These carbon sources, however, have some disadvantages which limited their further application in synthesis of SiC NWs. For example, active carbon and carbon nanoparticles produce SiC nanoparticles stick to the synthesized SiC NWs, and carbon nanotubes are too expensive to synthesize SiC NWs in large scale. Therefore, exploring a suitable carbon source for the synthesis of SiC NWs in large-scale, large-quantity and low-cost production is still necessary.|$|E

Silicon carbide (SiC) {{nanowires}} {{have attracted}} particular research enthusiasm for their favorable applications in nanoscale optoelectronics, sensors, high frequency, high temperature, and high-power electronics. A comprehensive Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) {{analysis of the}} SiC nanowires has been conducted. FTIR gives very important and practical information about the chemical bond states of materials. FTIR studies showed three strong peaks at the spectrum, which can be assigned to SiC transverse optical (TO) mode, SiC longitudinal optical (LO) mode, and Si-O stretching mode. Further, the diﬀerences of phonon states of SiC nanowires compared to the bulk SiC have been discussed. The Si-C TO stretching absorption band ranges from 783 cm− 1 to 793 cm− 1 withthefullwidthathalfmaximum(FWHM) valuesfrom 21 cm− 1 to 36 cm− 1 with Fe-ﬁlm catalyst, while the Si-C TO stretching absorption band ranges from 782 cm− 1 to 784 cm− 1 with the FWHM values from 13 cm− 1 to 31 cm− 1 with Ni-ﬁlm catalyst. The FWHM values of the TO mode absorption of the SiC nanowires are signiﬁcantly {{lower than that of}} bulk SiC (FWHM 59 cm− 1) suggesting higher bond quality and uniformity of the SiC nanowires. Moreover, the SiC TO mode absorption shifted towards the lower wavenumber region compared to the wavenumber of bulk single crystal SiC (800 cm− 1). These results show that FTIR provides quick and valuable information about the chemical bond states, crystal structure, and crystal quality of the nanostructured materials. Additionally, a practical synthesis method for SiC nanowire fabrication has been discussed; and morphology and crystal structure investigation of the SiC nanowires grown with various catalyst materials has been provided.
