50|$|Constructed {{subsurface}} flow wetlands are meant as secondary treatment systems {{which means that}} the effluent needs to first pass a primary treatment which effectively removes solids. Such a primary treatment can consist of sand and grit <b>removal,</b> <b>grease</b> trap, compost filter, septic tank, Imhoff tank, anaerobic baffled reactor or upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. The following treatment is based on different biological and physical processes like filtration, adsorption or nitrification. Most important is the biological filtration through a biofilm of aerobic or facultative bacteria. Coarse sand in the filter bed provides a surfaces for microbial growth and supports the adsorption and filtration processes. For those microorganisms the oxygen supply needs to be sufficient.|$|R

They were evaluated as pretreatments for advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) to polish produced water (PW) for reuse purposes. Settling and E-DAF without air injection showed adequate turbidity and oil and <b>grease</b> (O&G) <b>removals,</b> with eliminations higher than 87 % and 90 % respectively, employing 70 mg L− 1 of FeCl 3 and 83 min of settling time, and 57. 9 mg L− 1 of FeCl 3, 300 mg L− 1 of microspheres and a flocculation rate of 40 rpm in the E-DAF process. A linear correlation was observed between final O&G concentration and turbidity after E-DAF. In order to polish the O&G content of the effluent even further, to remove soluble compounds as phenol and to take advantage of residual iron after these treatments, Fenton and photo-Fenton reactions were essayed. After 6 h of the Fenton reaction at pH 3, the addition of 1660 mg L− 1 of H 2 O 2 and 133 mg L− 1 of iron showed a maximum O&G elimination of 57. 6 % and a phenol removal up to 80 %. Photo-Fenton process showed better results after 3 h, adding 600 mg L− 1 of H 2 O 2 and 300 mg L− 1 of iron, at pH 3, with a higher fraction of elimination of the O&G content (73. 7 %) and phenol (95 %) compared to the conventional Fenton process...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{the solid}} waste {{produced}} is increasing at high rate and known as global environmental issue {{as well as in}} Malaysia and the most common practice to reduce and dispose them is by using landfill method. However, landfill can causes generation of leachate. Leachate is highly contaminated since it contained high level of organic and inorganic matters. Before discharge to water body, leachate needs to be treated. This study was focused on the performance of constructed wetland and limestone filter in treating leachate. Constructed wetland and limestone filter {{emerged as one of the}} potential treatment to remove contaminants from leachate. In this study, limestone size from 2 mm to 14 mm was used for limestone filter and constructed wetland developed by using aggregate size from 5 mm to 20 mm, sand and planted with Typha Latjfolia (Cattails) to treat landfill leachate. Leachate was collected from Jerangau-Jabor Landfill. Different flowrate (3 LPM and 4 LPM) was studied to compare the efficiencies of the treatment system in term of pollutants removal in leachate.

Conventional anaerobic ponding system is normally employed in palm oil mills to treat the effluent. To increase its efficiency, biopretreatment to remove the organic matter and oil & grease by thermotolerant polymer-producing fungi was investigated. The palm oil mill effluent (POME) was treated by the two thermotolerant polymer-producing fungi, Rhizopus sp. ST 4 and Rhizopus sp. ST 29, at 45 ºC under aseptic and septic conditions. Rhizopus sp.

In wastewaters {{of three}} {{restaurants}} from the Costa Rican Institute of Technology, Central Campus, {{high concentrations of}} detergents have been found, exceeding the guideline of 5 mg/L, established by the Reglamento de Vertido y Reuso de Aguas Residuales Nº 3360. A posible alternative to this problem, is a system based on coagulation-flocculation. The chitosan {{was selected as the}} coagulant to be used on the study, because of its biodegrability and easily obtention. Several number of jar tests as coagulation-floculation system, were did to determinate the optimum working conditions of the chitosan with diferent molecular weights and under this conditions, the percentage of detergent <b>removal</b> from the <b>grease</b> trap wastewater from each reastaurant evaluated, was calculated. The chitosan optimal dose for all restaurants evaluated was 30 mg/L at 160 RPM by three minutes. The floculant Hidroxicloruro de Aluminio optimal dose was set by 10 mg/L, four times diluted at 90 RPM by three minutes and then settle for ten minutes. An advantage of using those coagulant and chitosan are the lower doses compared to other coagulants and floculants. (Huang, Li, Li, Yang, & Ran, 2016). The detergents removal efficiency, was increased by up to 40 %, compared to the percentage obtained by the <b>grease</b> trap, achieving <b>removal</b> efficiencies up to 99 %. In addition, the guideline for detergents, was fullfilled by the three wastewater from restaurants analyzed, after the coagulation-flocculation process. Also, the effluent from the three restaurants was characterized to determine the operating conditions of the proposed coagulation system to remove detergents. It had been found that in order to improve the conditions for the removal of COD and grease and oils, a continous cleaning of the fats and sedimented material, must be carried out by the maintenance staff each fiffteen days, so that the water does not enter into conditions of anaerobiosis.

The Wastewater Treatment Plant of Zalau, Salaj county, Romania was {{designed}} to treat approximately 18. 425 m wastewater per day, {{and in order to}} follow the discharge parameters for the chemical oxygen demand indicators (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and suspension solids (SS), the aeration basins have been conceived to function as a unit on nitrification and denitrification. The concentration of the dissolved oxygen is being maintained at the level of 1 mg/l, on the aeration basin, so as to prevent the growth of autotrophic bacteria and nitrification process. Existing Wastewater Treatment Plant has been designed for a population equivalent of 50. 500 people and the aim of the project is to enlarge treatment plant capacity to 90. 900 population equivalent and reach the maximum effluent quality.

40|$|The {{most widely}} used {{treatment}} of wool scouring effluent (WSE) in Australia is lagooning (anaerobic and aerobic). As the pressure to devise a more environmentally acceptable treatment method increases {{there is a need}} to study alternative, efficient biological treatment systems for WSE. In this study, laboratory and pilot-scale anaerobic biological and chemical flocculation treatment processes were investigated for removing the pollutants (mainly wool grease) from WSE. Anaerobic biological treatment utilises the natural microbial flora to destabilise and bioflocculate the WSE resulting in the settling of wool grease from the bulk liquid. Batch trials showed a grease reduction by anaerobic bioflocculation of between 30 % (pilot scale) and 50 % (laboratory scale) over 8 days. However, the destabilisation of the wool grease emulsion after only 2 - 3 days resulted in a total grease reduction of > 80 % after addition of a polymeric flocculant.

40|$|Coagulation and {{flocculation}} {{are essential}} processes {{in a number}} of diverse disciplines, including biochemistry, cheese manufacturing, rubber manufacturing, and in water and waste water treatment. Coagulation flocculation is effective for removing high concentration organic pollutants and heavy metals in water and wastewater. However, limited information exists on the efficiency of this coagulation-flocculation process for biodiesel wastewater treatment. The biodiesel wastewater is basic (alkaline), with a high content of oil and grease, and a low content of nitrogen and phosphorus. As such, biological treatment of the biodiesel wastewater is expected to be very difficult. For this reason supportive physic-chemical methods are often used. Although one of the most frequently employed method is coagulation. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the efficiency of coagulation and flocculation processes for removing suspended solid (SS), color, COD and oil and grease from biodiesel wastewater. Aluminum sulfate, polyaluminum chloride, ferric chloride and ferric sulfate as a coagulant in biodiesel wastewater treatment were studied using a standard jar test apparatus. The result shows that, at the optimum dose of PAC (300 mg/L), the percentage removal of SS, color, COD and oil and grease respectively 97 %, 95 %, 75 % and 97 % compared to only 92 %, 92 %, 53 % and 99 % at the optimal dose alum (500 mg/L), 95 %, 93 %, 63 % and 97 % at the optimum dose of ferric chloride (350 mg/L) and 88 %, 88 %, 54 % and 94 % at the optimum dose of ferric sulfate (450 mg/L).

40|$|The {{control of}} {{perchloroethylene}} (127184) (PERC) exposure in commercial dry cleaning via substitution was reviewed and {{alternatives to the}} use of PERC were discussed. Health hazards associated with PERC included central nervous system depression, liver and kidney damage, memory impairment, dermatitis, respiratory irritation, and other symptoms. Potential alternatives to dry cleaning with PERC included wet cleaning, petroleum based dry cleaning, and liquid carbon-dioxide (CO 2). In terms of fabric deterioration and shrinkage, wet cleaning was suitable for 30 % to 70 % of garments normally dry cleaned with PERC. Most machine wet cleaning techniques incorporated specially formulated wet cleaning detergents and spotting agents, increased water extraction before drying, heat and moisture content monitoring during the drying process, and decreased mechanical action during washing. Advantages of wet cleaning included fewer health, safety, and environmental hazards and regulations, easy removal of some soils, and cost efficiency. Disadvantages of wet cleaning included incomplete PERC replacement, fabric deterioration, shrinkage, difficult removal of some soils, contaminated wastewater, high labor intensity, and ergonomic risks. Although petroleum based solvents were flammable, relatively safe solvents were commercially available. The safety of petroleum based dry cleaning machines was increased through vacuum technology, inert gases, and control of machine operating parameters. Advantages of petroleum based dry cleaning included reduced toxicity and inhalation exposure, effective cleaning of all garments, and reduced costs. Disadvantages of petroleum based dry cleaning included fire hazards, bacteria growth, longer drying process, less effective oil and <b>grease</b> <b>removal,</b> and higher insurance premiums. The recently developed liquid CO 2 method entailed agitating garments immersed in liquid CO 2, then drying the garments via CO 2 vaporization.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of installing biocidal beads into a catch basin filter insert for simultaneous stormwater disinfection and contaminant removal was tested. The catch basin filter insert (DrainPac®) was tested for its sediment, oil and grease, and coliform bacteria removal efficiency {{in conjunction with}} bench-scale testing of biocidal polymer beads. DrainPac® catch basin filters are composed of a metal frame, polypropylene filter fabric, and a high-density polymer support basket, and are installed below storm drains. A 12 x 41 in. DrainPac® filter (United Stormwater, Inc.) insert was set in a flume that simulated a large-scale catchment basin. Pond water was gravity fed to the flume at flow rates up to 200 gpm. The pond water contained fine sediments at concentrations ranging from 30 - 50 mg/L. The biocidal beads were tested in a small laboratory column for potential application to stormwater treatment. The head loss through the clean filter insert varied from 0. 5 cm at 20 gpm to 9. 1 cm at 200 gpm. Head loss of 21. 5 cm occurred after 625 g of solids {{were added to the}} filter at 200 gpm at which point water began bypassing the filter fabric and flowing through the mesh screen. The highest flow rate that could be filtered through the loaded filter was 80 gpm. The DrainPac® filter removed total suspended solids with efficiencies ranging from 83 % to 91 % at flow rates of 20 to 200 gpm, with higher removal efficiencies at lower flow rates. The oil and <b>grease</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency of the DrainPac® filter ranged from 40 % to 82 %. The DrainPac® filter exhibited no removal of coliform bacteria under these test conditions. Biocidal brominated polystyrene beads, developed by Dr. S. D. Worley at Auburn University, were tested in a 1 -cm diameter laboratory column apparatus for leaching of bromine compounds, which is important for determining if the filters will meet water quality regulations of the receiving waters. Removal efficiencies of coliform bacteria were tested in a companion study by Cal Poly graduate student Alex Bowerman. Pond water was passed through a 1 -cm thick bed of beads in an up-flow direction. Leachate was analyzed for bromine, bromide, and bromoform. Leaching from both 0. 3 -mm and 0. 8 -mm biocidal beads was tested in the column apparatus. Samples collected for bromoform analysis were quenched with sodium thiosulfate, and the time before samples were quenched had a drastic effect on bromoform concentrations. Samples quenched after the collection of the total sample were assumed to be the most realistic for stormwater conditions since stormwater entering catch basins isn’t immediately discharged into its receiving waters. Effluent from a 1 -cm bed of 0. 3 -mm beads at 0. 56 mL/sec contained the following average concentrations: 0. 47 mg/L bromine, 2. 45 mg/L bromoform, and 0. 53 mg/L bromide. The same conditions for 0. 8 mm beads resulted in effluent containing the following average concentrations: 0. 27 mg/L bromine, 0. 06 mg/L bromoform, and 0. 50 mg/L bromide. The much lower concentrations of bromine measured in the 0. 8 -mm bead leachate was likely due to the greater surface area of the smaller beads. The greater leaching of bromoform from the 0. 3 mm beads may be partly attributed to the greater surface area of the smaller beads, but also the manufacturer of the beads reported that different production methods were used for the 0. 3 mm beads. Higher bromine compound concentrations were found at lower flow rates, due to the longer contact times with the beads. Deionized (DI) water that was used to initially wet the biocidal beads before passing pond water through the column was also analyzed for bromoform. The DI flush water from the 0. 3 mm beads contained 1. 25 mg/L bromoform at a flow rate of 0. 28 mL/sec. Bromoform concentrations in the DI flush water from the 0. 8 mm beads at the same flow rate were below detection. Bromoform is expected to be formed as bromine is reduced to bromide by the presence of organics. Since there are no organics present in DI water to form such high concentrations of bromoform as those found from the 0. 3 -mm bead DI flush water, it appears that bromoform could have leached {{from the surface of the}} 0. 3 mm beads. The longevity of the bromine treatment of the biocidal beads was tested on one set of 0. 3 -mm beads by simulating five use cycles, and also by testing another set of beads after dry storage. Each use cycle was simulated by pumping pond water through a 1 -cm bed of 0. 3 mm beads at 0. 56 mL/sec for one hour and then connecting the column to an air pump to dry for 23 hours. After five simulated uses, leachate from the beads showed only a slight reduction in concentrations of bromine and bromide (21 % and 4 % less than fresh beads, respectively), while the concentration of bromoform was nearly 100 times less. The drastic decrease in bromoform concentration suggests that after five simulated uses, much of the bromoform was exhausted or conditions for the formation of bromoform were no longer present. For the dry storage test, 0. 3 mm beads were wetted with 1 -L DI water and then stored dry for 162 days. Then pond water was pumped through the column at 0. 56 mL/sec and the leachate was analyzed. After dry storage for 162 days, the leachate showed no reduction in bromine concentrations compared to fresh beads, a 97 % reduction in bromoform, and a 30 % increase in bromide concentrations. This significant reduction in bromoform could be due to the volatilization of bromoform off the surface of the 0. 3 mm beads during dry storage. The 0. 3 mm beads are no longer being manufactured, and leachate from the 0. 8 mm beads contained bromoform at concentrations below the potable drinking water maximum contaminant level of 80 µg/L. Under all tested conditions, bromine, bromide, and bromoform are present in the leachate from the biocidal beads, and thus their applicability for stormwater disinfection depends on the longevity of the bromine compounds in receiving waters, and on the regulations governing these compounds...|$|E
