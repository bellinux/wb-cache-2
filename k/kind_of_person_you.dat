If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize?

40|$|As {{students}} {{progress through}} the educational system their interest in mathematics diminishes. Yet there is an ever increasing need within the workforce for individuals who possess talent in mathematics. The literature suggests that mathematical talent is most often measured by speed and accuracy of a student 2 ̆ 7 s computation with little emphasis on problem solving and pattern finding and no {{opportunities for students to}} work on rich mathematical tasks that require divergent thinking. Such an approach limits the use of creativity in the classroom and reduces mathematics to a set of skills to master and rules to memorize. Doing so causes many children 2 ̆ 7 s natural curiosity and enthusiasm for mathematics to disappear as they get older. Keeping students interested and engaged in mathematics by recognizing and valuing their mathematical creativity may reverse this tendency. ^ The identification of creative potential is challenging. Prior research into the identification of mathematical creativity has focused on the development of measurement instruments. Scoring of these instruments is time consuming and subject to scorer interpretation due to the variety of possible responses. Thus, their use in schools has been very limited, if used at all, since their creation. This study seeks a simpler means to obtain indicators of creative potential in mathematics. Existing instruments, the Creative Ability in Mathematics Test, the Connecticut Mastery Tests, the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitude Scales, What <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>Person</b> are <b>You?</b> from the Khatena-Torrance Creative Perception Index and the Scales for Rating the Behavioral Characteristics of Superior Students were used to conduct a standard multiple regression analysis.

Data were gathered from 89 seventh graders in a suburban Connecticut school. The regression model predicted 35...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 62 - 66) Many {{advocates of}} the study of creativity support the notion that the right cerebral hemisphere style of processing information is dominant in creative thinking. However, recent studies suggest that creative thinking or problem solving requires both left and right styles of processing information. One hundred and twenty-five male and female college students enrolled in introductory psychology classes took the following four tests: Something About Myself (Khatena & Torrance, 1976), a checklist of creative achievements and behaviors; What <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> a <b>Person</b> Are <b>You?</b> (Khatena & Torrance, 1978), a measure of the creative personality style; the Human Information Processing Survey (Taggart & Torrance, 1984), a scale classifying subjects according to learning style into four categories of cerebral dominance - right, left, integrated and mixed; and The Creative Imagination Scale (Wilson & Barber, 1978), an instrument that measures ability to imagine, for example, that an arm is heavy, a finger is numb, and that time is slowing down. It was hypothesized that subjects who report an integrated style of processing information would score higher on the measures of creativity than the other two groups. Further, subjects who report a right style of processing would score higher on the measure of imagination than those with a left style of processing. Multivariate statistical procedures yielded statistically nonsignificant results...|$|R
