5|$|Alan Stern <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{location}} {{should not}} matter {{and that only}} geophysical attributes {{should be taken into}} account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet-sized satellite.|$|E
5|$|Connolly <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{they were}} armed as a pike phalanx. This has been disputed by Head, because Plutarch states they carried spears {{shorter than the}} Roman triarii and by Daly {{because they could not}} have carried an {{unwieldy}} pike {{at the same time as}} a heavy Roman-style shield.|$|E
5|$|Mike Huben <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> were Assassination Politics {{ever to be}} {{accepted}} then governments would merely operate secretly (critiques of libertarianism). Almost all commentary so far {{has focused on the}} first nine parts of the essay and there is little on part 10.|$|E
50|$|Critics <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> governments treated {{this crisis}} {{as one of}} {{investor}} confidence rather than deeply indebted institutions unable to lend, delaying the appropriate remedies. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> this crisis represents a reset of economic activity, rather than a recession or cyclical downturn.|$|R
50|$|The detainees defense <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{testimony}} secured in Guantanamo {{could not}} be used in Kuwaiti courts, because the detainees and interrogators had not signed them. Furthermore, they <b>had</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the allegations the USA had directed at them were not violations of Kuwaiti law.|$|R
50|$|Unfair {{dismissal}} is now {{governed by}} the Labour Relations Act. Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Labour Relations Act undermines the flexibility required for the free market to exist. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a restrictive labour law promotes job security, loyalty and incorporation into companies.|$|R
5|$|Post-Skilling, some {{courts have}} held that gratuities may be reached as kickbacks, while others {{have held that}} they may not. Prof. Coffee <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> honest {{services}} fraud doctrine should explicitly distinguish {{between public and private}} corruption.|$|E
5|$|Rapoport <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Sorabji's {{reluctance}} to make commercial recordings {{of his music}} stemmed from a fear of losing control over the making of future recordings of it, because of UK copyright laws of the time.|$|E
5|$|Although Sunday schools such as {{the ones}} {{established}} by Trimmer have often been characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle class to impose their morality on the lower classes, Thomas Laqueur <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the poor embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.|$|E
50|$|Many {{observers}} <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> India's labour laws {{should be}} reformed.|$|R
25|$|The proper arsenic MCL {{continues}} to be debated. Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the 10 ppb federal standard is still too high, while others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> 10 ppb is needlessly strict. Individual states are able to establish lower arsenic limits; New Jersey has done so, setting a maximum of 0.005mg/L for arsenic in drinking water.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> finding {{should not}} be a {{province}} for the criminal law system but that any dispute as to ownership be left to resolution via a civil suit. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the jurisprudence gives rise to legal fictions and strained reasoning which has attracted divergent statutory law reform in different jurisdictions.|$|R
5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the lack of}} global consensus on key issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> quite possibly {{the most important issue}} is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 472 BC, Pericles {{presented}} The Persians of Aeschylus at the Greater Dionysia as a liturgy, demonstrating {{that he was one}} of the wealthier men of Athens. Simon Hornblower <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Pericles' selection of this play, which presents a nostalgic picture of Themistocles' famous victory at Salamis, shows that the young politician was supporting Themistocles against his political opponent Cimon, whose faction succeeded in having Themistocles ostracized shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|James Richard Ellis <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the incest taboo is {{fundamental}} to a civilized society. Building on Sigmund Freud's theories and psychoanalysis this is shown in Ovid's version of the myth of Myrrha. When the girl has been gripped by desire, she laments her humanity, for if {{she and her father}} were animals, there would be no bar to their union.|$|E
50|$|Many {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Fletcher's sympathies seem to lie {{more with}} the Romans than the Britons, though it <b>has</b> also been <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the play constantly parallels the two sides.|$|R
50|$|It <b>has</b> been <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the lack}} of uniform {{protection}} against SLAPPs has encouraged forum shopping; proponents of federal legislation <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the uncertainty about one's level of protection has likely magnified the chilling effect of SLAPPs.|$|R
50|$|The proper arsenic MCL {{continues}} to be debated. Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the 10 ppb federal standard is still too high, while others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> 10 ppb is needlessly strict. Individual states are able to establish lower arsenic limits; New Jersey has done so, setting a maximum of 0.005 mg/L for arsenic in drinking water.|$|R
5|$|Molly Haskell <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> nevertheless, {{women are}} mostly {{uncritical}} of the scene, {{and that by}} and large it is consistent with what women have in mind if they fantasize about being raped. Their fantasies revolve around love and romance rather than forced sex; they will assume that Scarlett was not an unwilling sexual partner and wanted Rhett {{to take the initiative}} and insist on having sexual intercourse.|$|E
5|$|More recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the Life is a forgery by Byrhtferth, basing {{his case}} {{primarily}} on {{an analysis of}} Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth's motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred's prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century. However, the argument has not been found persuasive, and few historians harbour doubts about {{the authenticity of the}} work.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, NMP Paulin Tay Straughan <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> NMPs, being non-partisan, do not replace either PAP or {{opposition}} MPs. During general elections, Singaporeans still continue to elect MPs who best represent their interests, and NMPs do not {{feature in the}} equation. In other words, the NMP scheme has never compromised the democratic process of free elections.|$|E
5000|$|Given the {{similarities}} {{in the pattern of}} neurofibrillary tangles in PART, some scientists <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> they represent the same phenomenon. [...] However, others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> sufficient evidence exists to conclude that PART represents a pathological process. [...] Should this be the case, it would have important implications with respect to developing diagnostics and therapeutics.|$|R
5000|$|It <b>has</b> been <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> modern neuroimaging {{techniques}} {{will allow}} researchers to create accurate simulations {{of the human}} mind within the 21st century ( [...] ; , [...] ), thereby overcoming the wager. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> such claims are unjustified [...]|$|R
50|$|The general concept or {{principle}} of moral universalizability is that moral norms, facts, predicates, etc. apply universally; that is, if {{they apply to}} one person, they apply to everyone. Some philosophers, like Immanuel Kant, Richard Hare, and Alan Gewirth, <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> moral universalizability {{is the foundation of}} all moral facts. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> while moral facts are constrained by moral universalizability, this constraint is too weak for grounding substantial moral facts. A few <b>have</b> also <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> morality is not constrained by universalizability at all.|$|R
5|$|Opponents of {{the plan}} criticize this tax rebate due to its costs. Economists at the Beacon Hill Institute {{estimated}} the overall rebate cost to be $489 billion (assuming 100% participation). In addition, economist Bruce Bartlett <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the rebate would create a large opportunity for fraud, treats children disparately, and would constitute a welfare payment regardless of need.|$|E
5|$|Prof. Freedman <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Bollman erred in {{applying}} § 14's proviso to both courts and individual judges (as opposed to only individual judges) and thus that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did confer federal courts {{the power to}} grant writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners. The Reconstruction-era Congress granted federal courts this power in 1867.|$|E
5|$|Romanian American {{economist}} Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor {{in economics}} and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the carrying capacity of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — {{is bound to}} decrease {{sometime in the future}} as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use. Leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly, a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has propounded the same argument.|$|E

50|$|Economists <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> a {{liquidity}} trap might {{have contributed to}} bank failures.|$|R
50|$|Kano et al. (2009) <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Turcica {{belongs in}} the family Calliotropidae.|$|R
5|$|Some large {{satellites}} are {{of similar}} size or {{larger than the}} planet Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan. Alan Stern <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes {{should be taken into}} account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to Stern.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagonal}} {{positioning of}} the metalloids represents {{an exception to the}} observation that elements with similar properties tend to occur in vertical groups. A related effect can be seen in other diagonal similarities between some elements and their lower right neighbours, specifically lithium-magnesium, beryllium-aluminium, and boron-silicon. Rayner-Canham <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> these similarities extend to carbon-phosphorus, nitrogen-sulfur, and into three d-block series.|$|E
5|$|A high {{percentage}} of ADF personnel are drawn from the Anglo-Celtic portion of Australia's population. In 2011 the proportion of ADF personnel born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher than this population group's share of both the Australian workforce and overall population. As a result, analyst Mark Thomson <b>has</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the ADF is unrepresentative of Australia's society in this regard and that recruiting more personnel from other ethnic backgrounds would improve the ADF's language skills and cultural empathy.|$|E
