25|$|This can be {{illustrated}} with a diagram. Initially the consumer has {{the choice between}} spending their income on either commodity Y or commodity X as defined by line segment MN (where M = total available income divided by the price of commodity Y, and N = total available income divided by the price of commodity X). The line MN {{is known as the}} consumer's budget constraint. Given the consumer's preferences, as expressed in the <b>indifference</b> <b>curve</b> I0, the optimum mix of purchases for this individual is point A.|$|E
500|$|In economics, a consumer's {{preferences}} are defined over all [...] "baskets" [...] of goods. Each basket is {{represented as a}} non-negative vector, whose coordinates represent the quantities of the goods. On this set of baskets, an <b>indifference</b> <b>curve</b> is defined for each consumer; a consumer's <b>indifference</b> <b>curve</b> contains all the baskets of commodities that the consumer regards as equivalent: That is, for every pair of baskets on the same <b>indifference</b> <b>curve,</b> the consumer does not prefer one basket over another. Through each basket of commodities passes one <b>indifference</b> <b>curve.</b> A consumer's preference set (relative to an <b>indifference</b> <b>curve)</b> is the union of the <b>indifference</b> <b>curve</b> and all the commodity baskets that the consumer prefers over the <b>indifference</b> <b>curve.</b> A consumer's {{preferences are}} convex if all such preference sets are convex.|$|E
500|$|An optimal {{basket of}} goods occurs where the budget-line {{supports}} a consumer's preference set, {{as shown in}} the diagram. This means that an optimal basket is on the highest possible <b>indifference</b> <b>curve</b> given the budget-line, which is defined in terms of a price vector and the consumer's income (endowment vector). Thus, the set of optimal baskets {{is a function of the}} [...] prices, and this function is called the consumer's demand. If the preference set is convex, then at every price the consumer's demand is a convex set, for example, a unique optimal basket or a line-segment of baskets.|$|E

2500|$|A price drop for {{commodity}} X causes two effects. The {{reduced price}} alters relative prices {{in favour of}} commodity X, known as the substitution effect. This is illustrated by a movement down the <b>indifference</b> <b>curve</b> from point A to point B (a pivot of the budget constraint about the original <b>indifference</b> <b>curve).</b> At the same time, the price reduction increases consumer purchasing power, known as the income effect (an outward shift of the budget constraint). This {{is illustrated by the}} shifting out of the dotted line to MP (where P = income divided by the new price of commodity X). The substitution effect (point A to point B) raises the quantity demanded of commodity X from Xa to Xb while the income effect lowers the quantity demanded from Xb to Xc. The net effect is a reduction in quantity demanded from Xa to Xc making commodity X a Giffen good by definition. Any good where the income effect more than compensates for the substitution effect is a [...] Giffen good.|$|E
2500|$|The {{substitution}} effect {{is the change}} in demands resulting from a price change that alters {{the slope of the}} budget constraint but leaves the consumer on the same <b>indifference</b> <b>curve.</b> In other words, it illustrates the consumer's new consumption basket after the price change while being compensated as to allow the consumer to be as happy as he or she was previously. By this effect, the consumer is posited to substitute toward the good that becomes comparatively less expensive. In the illustration below this corresponds to an imaginary budget constraint denoted SC being tangent to the <b>indifference</b> <b>curve</b> I1. Then the income effect from the rise in purchasing power from a price fall reinforces the {{substitution effect}}. [...] If the good is an inferior good, then the income effect will offset in some degree the substitution effect. [...] If the income effect for an inferior good is sufficiently strong, the consumer will buy less of the good when it becomes less expensive, a Giffen good (commonly believed to be a rarity).|$|E
2500|$|To {{maximize}} the utility with the reduced budget constraint, BC1, the consumer will re-allocate consumption {{to reach the}} highest available <b>indifference</b> <b>curve</b> which [...] BC1 is tangent to. As shown on the diagram below, that curve is I1, and therefore the amount of good Y bought will shift from Y2 to Y1, {{and the amount of}} good X bought to shift from X2 to X1. The opposite effect will occur if the price of Y decreases causing the shift from BC2 to BC3, and I2 to I3.|$|E
