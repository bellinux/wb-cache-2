500|$|Catherine de' Medici {{has been}} {{labelled}} a [...] "sinister Queen… noted for {{her interest in}} the occult arts". To some, Catherine and Henry's inability to produce an heir for the first ten years of their marriage gave rise to suspicion of witchcraft. Labouvie suggested that women's power {{was believed to be}} the ability to create and sustain life, whilst witches were believed to have the opposite power; that of attacking health, life and fertility. An infertile woman, and in particular an infertile queen, was therefore regarded as 'unnatural' and a small step from supernatural. Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> with similar suspicion—she too entertained questionable characters (such as her advisor, John Dee), and produced no official heir. Essentially, however, there exists no concrete proof that either woman took part in the occult, and it is now believed that Catherine's trouble in providing an heir was in fact due to Henry II's penile deformity.|$|E
500|$|On 3 September 1939, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain {{announced}} {{the commencement of}} war with Nazi Germany. The following day, the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, without consulting Indian political leaders, announced that India had entered the war along with Britain. There were widespread protests in India. After meeting with Jinnah and with Gandhi, Linlithgow announced that negotiations on self-government were suspended {{for the duration of}} the war. The Congress on 14 September demanded immediate independence with a constituent assembly to decide a constitution; when this was refused, its eight provincial governments resigned on 10 November and governors in those provinces thereafter ruled by decree for the remainder of the war. [...] Jinnah, on the other hand, was more willing to accommodate the British, and they in turn increasingly recognised him and the League as the representatives of India's Muslims. Jinnah later stated, [...] "after the war began, ... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> on the same basis as Mr. Gandhi. I was wonderstruck why I was promoted and given a place side by side with Mr. Gandhi." [...] Although the League did not actively support the British war effort, neither did they try to obstruct it.|$|E

500|$|Johnson had {{the matter}} investigated, and after having Cobb's September 24 doubleheader {{statistics}} re-checked, discovered {{only the first}} game of Cobb's statistics had been scored, but not the second game, in which he went 2-for-3. This put Cobb's suggested actual batting average at [...]385, again ahead of Lajoie's. In the end, Johnson ruled that Lajoie's sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit (which would have allowed him to go 9-for-9) but that Cobb's batting average was greater, recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to Lajoie's 227 hits in 591 at bats. Johnson asked Chalmers if his company would award an automobile to each player, to which he agreed. Initially Lajoie refused the car but eventually relented and accepted it. Cobb said, [...] "I am glad that I won an automobile and am especially pleased that Lajoie also gets one. I have no one to criticize. I know the games were on the square and I am greatly pleased to know that the affair has ended so nicely." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "I am quite satisfied that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> fairly in every way by President Johnson, but I think the scorer at St. Louis made an error in not crediting me with nine hits. However, I am glad that the controversy is over. I have the greatest respect for Cobb as a batter and am glad of his success." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2004, Wood was {{the first}} Assembly Member to be ordered out of the chamber, after {{referring}} to the Queen as [...] "Mrs Windsor" [...] during a debate. Lord Elis-Thomas, a fellow Plaid Cymru AM and the Presiding Officer, asked Wood to withdraw the remark {{on the grounds of}} discourtesy. When Wood refused, she was ordered to leave. She later said: [...] "I don't recognise the Queen ... I don't think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> fairly, I don't think it was necessary. I called her that because that's her name." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Roller {{directives}} are infamous for {{emphasizing the}} supposed {{grandeur of the}} Soviet Union under Stalin, but also for praising Tsarist Russia and the Slavic peoples. The other ideas emphasized included the condemnation of other foreigners, particularly Westerners, starting with Ancient Rome—the French, Italian and American libraries were shut down, their patrons arrested; condemnation of the formerly dominant boyars ("traitors" [...] to the Ottomans) and bourgeoisie ("cosmopolitan" [...] and [...] "serving imperialist capitalists"); and minimization of {{the role played by}} historic Romanian figures. Described by traditionalist historians as Romania's war of national unity, World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> by Roller and other Marxist-Leninists as an [...] "imperialist war". Romania's participation was therefore an [...] "imperialist action", as were the occupation of Bessarabia and the intervention in Hungary.|$|E
