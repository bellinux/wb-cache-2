30|$|Generally, {{the rate}} of {{survival}} of fish larvae is poor during the early life stages (Bisbal and Bengtson 1995; Yang 2007). The availability of food {{at the right time}} is crucial because starvation can lead to high larval mortality (Bisbal and Bengtson 1995; Gisbert et al. 2004; Kohno et al. 1997; Peña and Dumas 2005). Some other factors such as larval size, yolk and oil quantity and absorption rate, feeding behaviour, and the time of <b>initial</b> <b>feeding</b> may also affect mortality (Blaxter 1974; Dou et al. 2000). In chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, and rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri, <b>initial</b> <b>feeding</b> starts after the swim-up stage (Heming et al. 1982; Twongo and MacCrimmon 1976), while in burbot, Lota lota, exogenous food needs to be given at 9 – 10  dph (Palińska-Żarska et al. 2014).

The effects of BW distribution, BW class, and sex were studied with regard to average performance traits, latency time (interval between weaning and first feed intake), <b>initial</b> <b>feed</b> intake (intake during the first 24 h following first feed intake), and daily increase in feed intake during the interval between first feed intake and the day on which energy intake met or exceeded 1. 5 times the maintenance requirement.

The effects of delayed first feeding on larval growth and survival in the larvae of Yesso Scallop Patinopecten yessoensis were investigated in this study. Groups of larvae were fed at early stage of D-shaped larvae or delayed for 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 h. When first feeding was delayed for less than 72 h, the P. yessoensis larvae grew as rapidly as those non-starved larvae. When delayed first feeding for more than 72 h, the growth rates of larvae were significantly reduced (less than 2 µm day- 1), half or less than those of the non-starved group. The survival rates decreased sharply with the prolonged starvation period and the extremely low survival rates were observed in the groups that were delayed first feeding for more than 72 h. The results indicate that the prolonged starvation had a deleterious impact on the larval growth and survival when delayed first feeding for 96 h or more.

40|$|To {{study the}} role of the {{phytohormone}} auxin in nematode feeding cell induction and early development, the transcriptional regulation of the artificial auxin-responsive promoter element DR 5 was monitored in Arabidopsis thaliana roots infected with the cyst nematode Heterodera, schachtii or the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. For both nematode species, a specific and strong activation of DR 5 ::gusA was observed inside the <b>initial</b> <b>feeding</b> cells at 18 h post inoculation, pointing to an increase in the perceived auxin concentration. This high expression was maintained until 3 - 5 days post inoculation and subsequently the GUS staining was reduced. Cyst and root-knot nematodes are distantly related and the feeding sites they induce are highly dissimilar. In this respect, the similarities between the two nematode-induced DR 5 activation patterns in A. thaliana roots are remarkable. A transient and local increase in auxin perception could be due to an accumulation or to an increased sensitivity. Based on previously published data, a local auxin accumulation seems to be the more probable explanation.

30|$|At higher salt {{concentration}} values, it can {{be observed}} that the DR has a considerable dependence on the feed solution {{in the range of}} 5.5 – 10  g L− 1.

The effect of timing of start feeding on morphometric and gravimetric characteristics, size distribution, survival and rate of cannibalism in eleuterembryoes/larvae was examined. A temperature of 24 °C was determined the hatching time of eleuterembryoes after 36, resp. 33 hours (1 st, respectively 2 nd experiment) from fertilization. The start of intake of exogenous food (S 95) was determined at age 123 hPF, yolk sac absorption at age 150 hPF during the 1 st experiment. At the 2 nd experiment the start of intake exogenous food was determined at age 115 hPF and yolk sac absorption at age 161 hPF. During the interval from H 95 to S 95 records showed an increased rate of growth, especially the caudal part of the body. At the age from S 95 to Re 95, growth of unfed larvae was stopped (first effect of starvation). Almost all monitored parametres were significantly affected (P < 0, 01) by timing of start feeding except for rate of cannibalism. While the percentage representation of large sized and medium sized individuals (the potential cannibals) was decreased with increasing the time of start feeding, the rate of cannibalism wasn´t changed. However the number of small sized individuals was increased with increasing the time of start feeding. The study of the African catfish confirmed the negative impact on survival, which is caused by a delay in <b>initial</b> <b>feeding.</b> Unlike survival, with morphometric parametres there wasn´t observed a significant decrease in values, provide the larvae was first fed before reaching the age of 216 hPF. It was also found that almost 100 % of the individuals in the control (unfed) group died at age 377 hPF. However the first indications of increasing mortality was observed in age 283 hPF. Based on the above information, the PNR (point of no return) was reached approximately at the age of 270 hPF in African catfis...|$|R
