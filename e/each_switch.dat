25|$|Also, {{because the}} concept of Internet of things entails adding {{electronics}} to mundane devices (for example, simple light switches), and because the major driver for replacement of electronic components is often technological obsolescence rather than actual failure to function, {{it is reasonable to}} expect that items that previously were kept in service for many decades would see an accelerated replacement cycle if {{they were part of the}} IoT. For example, a traditional house built with 30 light switches and 30 electrical outlets might stand for 50 years, with all those components still original at the end of that period. But a modern house built with the same number of switches and outlets set up for IoT might see <b>each</b> <b>switch</b> and outlet replaced at five-year intervals, in order to keep up to date with technological changes. This translates into a ten-fold increase in waste requiring disposal.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of The new Panorama Elite {{was to the}} usual high standard that everyone had come to expect from a leading coachbuilder like Plaxton. It made more use of laminate than before but this was tastefully specified & well balanced. The interior skirt panels, racks and front cabinet made extensive use of this easily worked & easy to maintain material. The analogue clock in the front dome was flanked either side by small square controllable air vents. The dashboard was improved and made use of a panel of rocker switches {{in front of the}} driver with <b>each</b> <b>switch</b> designation lighting for night time operation. Previous dashboards hid the switches in places inaccessible whilst moving. Ventilation was again improved though using the same design of moulded air output & light assembly as {{the final version of the}} Panorama I. The racks were trimmed with laminate instead of using vinyl like material from the previous design.|$|E
50|$|Clos {{networks}} {{are defined by}} three integers n, m, and r. n represents the number of sources which feed into each of r ingress stage crossbar <b>switches.</b> <b>Each</b> ingress stage crossbar switch has m outlets, and there are m middle stage crossbar switches.

25|$|In fiber-optic communication, {{the path}} {{coloring}} {{problem is the}} problem of assigning colors (frequencies of light) to pairs of nodes that wish to communicate with each other, and paths through a fiber-optic communications network for each pair, subject to the restriction that no two paths that share a segment of fiber use the same frequency as each other. Paths that pass through the same communication switch but not through any segment of fiber are allowed to use the same frequency. When the communications network is arranged as a star network, with a single central switch connected by separate fibers to each of the nodes, the path coloring problem may be modeled exactly as a problem of edge coloring a graph or multigraph, in which the communicating nodes form the graph vertices, pairs of nodes that wish to communicate form the graph edges, and the frequencies that may be used for each pair form the colors of the edge coloring problem. For communications networks with a more general tree topology, local path coloring solutions for the star networks defined by <b>each</b> <b>switch</b> in the network may be patched together to form a single global solution.|$|E
2500|$|Titled as an exhortation by Davis to McLaughlin, [...] "Go Ahead John" [...] {{features}} a basic, blues motif, centered around E and B♭, {{as well as}} modulations introduced by Davis into the D♭ scale. The recording begins with McLaughlin's funky wah-wah lines, backing Grossman's sharp, restrained playing, with Davis's first trumpet solo entering at four minutes with scattered ideas. In his book Milestones: The Music and Times of Miles Davis, Jack Chambers writes that the recording's first 11 minutes and its closing four-and-a-half minutes [...] "resemble Willie Nelson [...] as a head arrangement built on a riff, with the riff sustained this time by McLaughlin's steady wah-wah in the background. Approximately six minutes into it, McLaughlin's guitar solo succeeds Davis's first solo, as the band vamps. Music journalist Todd S. Jenkins writes of this passage in the recording, [...] "Thanks to the then-new wonders of noise gate technology, Jack DeJohnette’s drums and cymbals flit back and forth rapidly {{from left to right}} in the mix. With <b>each</b> <b>switch,</b> the guitar’s volume blasts in and out, over and over again, during McLaughlin’s relentlessly acidic solo". Following the passage, an unrelated theme opens with two minutes of a slow blues segment by Davis that is spliced into the recording, accompanied solely by occasional notes from Holland; According to Jack Chambers, Davis's blues solo [...] "becomes a duet with himself by overdubbing, and then builds into a quintet performance lasting ten more minutes". Phil Freeman wrote of this [...] "doubling effect", stating [...] "Miles's two solos fit together perfectly, creating a feel similar to that of New Orleans jazz, with two trumpets weaving intricate, complementary lines around each other".|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{multiple}} bit-rate (MBR) {{representation of}} video sequences offers an effective solution to video streaming services over the Internet. To facilitate such MBR-based streaming services, a mechanism {{is required to}} support seamless switching among multiple bit-streams when a bandwidth change is detected. The SP-frames developed in H. 264 provide such a mechanism at <b>each</b> pre-selected <b>switching</b> point. In this paper, we propose a new switching scheme {{that is based on}} a waveletdomain processing of the reconstructed frame at <b>each</b> <b>switching</b> point. We will compare our scheme with the SP-frame scheme in aspects such as the quality drop at <b>each</b> <b>switching</b> point and all subsequent frames, the count of overhead bits to support an arbitrary switching, and the computational complexity. The results indicate that our scheme can achieve the seamless switching with a better rate-distortion performance at cost of slightly increasing the computations at the decoder side. 1...|$|R

The key loader was pushed into a matrix of holes, one hole for <b>each</b> <b>switch.</b> The loader also had two larger index pins that also cocked a spring that would return <b>each</b> <b>switch</b> to their initial position when the door covering the hole matrix was reopened, zeroizing the equipment.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a state {{observer}} {{is proposed}} for {{the reconstruction of the}} concentration proﬁles in a simulated moving bed.

50|$|When {{customers}} {{of a public}} switched telephone network make telephone calls, they utilize a telecommunications network called a switched-circuit network.
