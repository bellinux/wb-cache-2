40|$|ABSTRACT Relating the {{collected}} customs {{duty to the}} value of imports enables the estimation of a rate of applied duty that takes into account all pricing components and their use. Indeed, this ad valorem equivalent integrates the complex dimensions of customs duties, the measures of exemption and suspension, and those concerning preferential regimes. Processing collected duties for all the products reveals that the 1. 5 per cent rate of <b>duty</b> <b>actually</b> <b>applied</b> in 2003 is the same for the EU and the US. Nevertheless, it appears that the US taxes more the least developed countries (LDCs) and developing countries than does the EU. Thus, setting aside those products which enter free of duty, the rate of taxation applied by the US is 15 per cent and 6. 2 per cent respectively with regards to LDCs and developing countries, whereas in the EU it is only 3. 7 per cent and 4. 1 per cent. In the US market the sectors that are the most highly taxed upon importation are textiles, apparel and clothing, cotton and articles of leather, whereas in the EU it is more agricultural and food products (fruits and preserves, meats, sugars and cereals).

40|$|The European Commission {{issued a}} press release on July 24 th 2003 {{concerning}} an independent study by the French research institute INRA (Institute National pour la Recherche Agricole) on developing-country exports to the EU. The Commission press release highlighted that the study pointed to the EU {{as one of the}} world's most open markets to imports of farm products from developing countries. According to the Commission's summary, when taking into account the trade preferences granted developing countries 'the average customs <b>duty</b> <b>actually</b> <b>applied</b> by the EU to farm imports is 10. 5 %, a figure three times lower than frequently mentioned' (for example by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)). The EC maintains that, as a consequence of this low level of protection, the EU is 'by far the world's number one importer of agricultural products, and the main importer of farm products from developing countries as well as from least developed countries. ' EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said that 'these results show clearly why the EU is the most open market in the world for agricultural products from the developing countries' and that {{the results of the study}} made 'a mockery of the criticisms regularly advanced by other developed countries, none of whom import anything like the volume or value of our imports from developing countries, that the EU is protectionist in its farm policy'. Comment: It should be borne in mind that with the progress of CAP reform, involving the disbursement of direct aid payments in compensation for price declines, EU prices are being brought into line with world market prices, thereby removing the need for high levels of tariff protection. 'Protectionism' is now taking a different form involving as it does 'protecting' EU farmers from the consequences of much lower market prices. This 'protection' serves to stabilise EU production at around those levels prevailing at the time reform began, levels which were themselves distorted by the high-price policy of the EU which necessitated high tariff protection in the first place. While the EU press release on the INRA study describes the EBA measure as ' a measure of far-reaching impact', a number of studies suggest that to date, two years after the implementation of the EBA initiative it has had little impact on least developed country exports to the EU. Indeed, the press release identifies only € 6 million in trade creation arising from the implementation of the EBA initiative (including € 3 million in molasses exports from Sudan and € 1. 2 million in imports of molasses and tomatoes from Senegal.
