5|$|The next {{trip was}} up to Anchorage, for the Northern Lights Invitational, a three-day, eight-team tournament. The first game was an easy win against Akron, in which Summitt played her bench frequently. The semi-final game, against Texas A, was not much more difficult. The Ladies won handily, 105–81, leading {{by as much as}} 25. Texas A's 81 points would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> most a team would score on Tennessee that season. The {{championship}} game was against Wisconsin, a team ranked in the top 10, but this ranking did not mean much, as the team ended 1997 with an 87–66 victory. The Meeks were named to the All-Tournament team.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, local {{production}} of the F-20 was discussed with India. A move was also made in the 1980s to market the aircraft to the Pakistan Air Force with a license production manufacture of the aircraft. It was evaluated by a Pakistani contingent in the United States, with the F-20 being flown by Abbas Mirza, a senior Pakistani air force fighter pilot. Of {{the components of the}} F-20, the radar would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> most successful; Taiwan selected it for the Ching-kuo, South Korea also adopted it for the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle trainer aircraft, and the radar was used in the multinational FMA IA 63 Pampa. As sales prospects were not apparent early on, GE sold their radar division, which was eventually acquired by Lockheed-Martin.|$|E

25|$|Although he didn't throw any {{touchdown}} passes, Young was near-perfect in the game, completing 17 of 22 {{passes for}} 226 yards, and rushing for 17 {{yards on the}} ground. The game was also notable in that it would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> final game in the storied career of New York linebacker Lawrence Taylor, and as it turned out, {{it would be the}} final game for Simms as well.|$|E
25|$|The Royals started another {{threat in}} the top of the sixth inning. Escobar singled with one out. Gordon then doubled to center field to score Escobar and {{increase}} the Royals' lead. Cain grounded to third for the second out, and Bruce Bochy brought in southpaw Javier Lopez to face the left-handed hitting Eric Hosmer. Hosmer battled an eleven pitch at-bat with Lopez until finally singling to center to score Gordon for what would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> game-winning RBI. Lopez retired Moustakas to end the inning.|$|E

Krieger recorded an assist on one of Crystal Dunn’s goals in the NWSL Championship. She was voted Spirit Fan Favorite and Spirit Defender of the Year and named to NWSL Second Best XI.|$|E
25|$|Stanford {{earned an}} {{automatic}} {{berth in the}} NCAA Tournament by the virtue of winning the Pac-12 regular season, which doubled as the championship. Their Rating Percentage Index {{and the quality of}} their wins allowed the Cardinal to earn the fifth overall seed in the tournament, and thus earn a bye to {{the second round of the}} competition. In the second round, Stanford hosted nearby University of the Pacific. Goals from Foster Langsdorf and Tomas Hilliard-Arce secured a 2–0 victory for the Cardinal. Langsdorf would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> winning goalscorer in the Cardinal's third round matchup against the 12th-seeded, Virginia. A golden goal broke the scoreless stalemate, and gave Stanford 1–0 victory over the Cavaliers.|$|E
25|$|The {{second half}} saw the Wildcats surge — scoring a {{touchdown}} and a two-point conversion on their opening possession {{to cut the}} Sooner lead to 28–17. Following an Oklahoma four-and-out, Kansas State again scored but again had the extra point blocked. Oklahoma now led by only five points, 28–23. After not scoring during the third quarter, Oklahoma managed to score on the opening possession of the fourth quarter. On the ensuing kick off, Kansas State's Brandon Banks caught the ball at the 2-yard line and returned it for a touchdown to again cut the Sooner lead back to five. Oklahoma was able to score what would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> game sealing touchdown on the next possession {{to give them a}} 42–30 lead, which they held {{for the rest of the}} game.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, morale was low at the {{beginning}} of the SuperSonics season as talks with the City of Seattle for a new arena had broken down. The Sonics had gotten a franchise player with second overall pick in the NBA draft with Durant. However, with the Allen trade the Sonics did not have much talent to surround their rookie forward, as they lost their first eight games under coach P. J. Carlesimo on the way to a 3-14 record in the first month of the season. Durant would live up to expectations, as he led all rookies in scoring at 20.3 ppg and won the Rookie of the Year. However, the Seattle SuperSonics posted a franchise worst record of 20-62. It would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> final season in Seattle as Bennett ended up getting the rights to move the team after settling all the legal issues with the city.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} their Spring training schedule {{two days}} prior, the Atlanta Braves began their season on Opening Day as the guests for the New York Mets home opener at Citi Field on April 5. Tommy Hanson, making the first Opening Day {{start of his}} career, faced Mets ace Johan Santana, who was making his first Major League appearance since September 2010. The first game proved {{to be dominated by}} defense and pitching. In the bottom of the sixth, Mets third baseman David Wright singled home center fielder Andrés Torres to give the Mets a 1–0 advantage, which would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> final score of the game. Hanson took the loss, giving up just the one earned run in five plus innings of work. Kris Medlen and Jonny Venters followed with three scoreless innings in relief, but the offense could never find the scoreboard. The Opening Day loss was only the second in the last seven seasons and the first since 2008.|$|E

Because Mulder believes so strong it's the other guy, it helped hide the true identity of the bad guy from the audience." ...|$|E

500|$|Musician and filmmaker Rob Zombie observes, [...] "Most of {{the kids}} who come to my shows seem like really imaginative kids with a lot of {{creative}} energy they don't know what to do with" [...] and that metal is [...] "outsider music for outsiders. Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> weird kid. It's kind of like that, but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place".

500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Fatbeard" [...] was watched by 2.59 million overall households, {{according to the}} Nielsen ratings, making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week. The episode received generally positive reviews. Carlos Delgado of If magazine, who gave the episode an A- grade, particularly praised the Cartman and Ike characters and called the ending [...] "perfect". Delgado said of the show's creators, [...] "These guys see episode potential in nearly everything that passes through the news desk. And because South Park {{can be made in}} like a week—and I’m talking start to finish, from concept to finished product—they <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> most socially conscious and timely show on television today." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode and the Somalian pirate song, and complimented the show for presenting the pirates as sympathetic human beings. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club said the portrayal of Somalian pirates was a predictable storyline, but said he enjoyed the episode because of the pacing: [...] "Rather than a cobbled-together collection of gags, everything progressed very organically." [...] IGN writer Travis Fickett said the episode was amusing but not exceptional. Fickett enjoyed the takeover of the French vessel {{and the extent to which}} Cartman's delusion about pirates takes him, but he said the pirate plot [...] "isn't entirely in good taste (and) it never really gathers a full head of steam".|$|E
500|$|Liu {{was once}} an eminent scholar, but was {{reportedly}} little-known inside the People's Republic of China (PRC) {{at the time of}} the award due to official censorship. Those who had heard about Liu had mixed views about him. Some clearly supported the government position, whereas one university student was quoted as saying [...] "George Orwell probably had no idea that what he wrote would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> reality of China now." [...] "Liu Xiaobo" [...] and [...] "Nobel Peace Prize" [...] became the most searched terms among internet users in China. However, some time after the release of the official response from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, government censors screened the news item, and there were reports of searches in China using Chinese search engines returning error pages. Web searches using Chinese search engines for [...] "Liu Xiaobo" [...] in Chinese without attaching the words [...] "Peace Prize," [...] gave information about Liu. Yet most sites found [...] "Liu" [...] plus [...] "Peace Prize" [...] yield only the official foreign ministry response. CNN reported that any mention of [...] "Nobel Prize" [...] on microblogging sites was censored. One person claimed that his SIM card was deactivated after he sent a text message to a relative about the Nobel Peace Prize. Accustomed to circumventing Chinese internet censorship, bloggers and forum-users used variants of Liu's name and posted subtle or cryptic messages to express their elation about the award or sarcasm towards the state. The statement on 8 October by renowned blogger Han Han consisted of only a pair of double quote marks.|$|E
