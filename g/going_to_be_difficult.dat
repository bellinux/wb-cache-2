5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was also <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E
5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} proposal is biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E
25|$|With Luton's spell {{in the top}} flight finally over, it {{was always}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to keep hold of prize assets. So it proved when Mick Harford signed for Chelsea for £300,000. The first season in the new, three-division Football League almost saw Luton drop into the third tier of English football. The team was not helped by the {{involvement}} of Scottish duo Paul Telfer and Darren Salton in a motor accident {{early on in the}} season – under-21 international defender Salton was nearly killed, and never played again. Luton were bottom of the table shortly into the New Year, and Pleat reacted by procuring a loan deal to bring Luton-born England international Kerry Dixon to the club on loan from Southampton. Dixon gelled well alongside Phil Gray up front, and Luton stayed up.|$|E

500|$|On 9 August 1942, {{his orders}} were {{abruptly}} changed. MacArthur, now Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Area, had requested that a corps headquarters {{be sent to}} his command. Major General Robert C. Richardson, Jr., had originally been detailed for the assignment, but as Marshall informed MacArthur, [...] "Richardson's intense feelings regarding service under Australian command made his assignment appear unwise." [...] Eichelberger's I Corps headquarters was ready for overseas service and had training in amphibious warfare, and Eichelberger had experience working with MacArthur, so Marshall selected him for the job instead. Eichelberger was {{not happy with the}} assignment, especially when he found out about Richardson, and [...] "knew General MacArthur well enough to know that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to get along with".|$|E

[...] Edmondson himself has added that he gets along well with the cast, although finds that the distance of Elstree Studios from most of their London homes makes them [...] "weirdly unsociable".|$|E
500|$|Considered {{to be one}} of {{the most}} {{maligned}} players in the Melbourne Football Club's history, Watts' career has been filled with criticism from the media, fans and members of the football industry. The seeds for the ongoing criticism were planted when he was announced as the number one draft pick in the 2008 AFL draft; the hype surrounding him meant that the expectations placed on him before he had even played a match were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to live up to. Some of these lofty expectations included being seen as the replacement for club champion, David Neitz, who is the club's games and goals record holder, being labelled as a potential future captain, being one of the team's most valuable players, before he had even played an AFL match, with the club unable to afford him being injured, and claims he was the [...] "great white hope" [...] who would lift the club off the bottom of the ladder.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} debate began the Prime Minister rose to speak, {{and said that}} he [...] "sought to correct the {{impression}} [...] gave" [...] that he knew nothing about the prosecution. This was followed by a motion of censure pushed forward by Robert Horne, and after Horne had presented the motion Hastings rose to speak, and explained the facts of the case. His speech took over an hour, and was frequently interrupted by Conservative MPs. In his speech, Hastings took full responsibility for both the decision to prosecute and the subsequent decision to withdraw the prosecution, asking whether a censure was merited for correcting a mistake. His speech quieted the Conservatives and made it clear that a censure for the entire Parliament was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> for the Whips to enforce. The Liberal spokesman John Simon stood to speak, however, and called for the appointment of a Select Committee to investigate the case. This was rejected by MacDonald, and MPs continued to speak for several more hours.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{generally}} responded warmly to the episode, {{but some}} felt it compared poorly {{to others in}} the series. David Chater, writing for The Times, felt that [...] "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] was dissimilar from any previous episode of Inside No. 9, but that it was [...] "equally accomplished", while in sister publication The Sunday Times, critics suggested that the change in style showed the writers' versatility. Neela Debnath, writing for The Independent, called [...] "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] a [...] "hilariously dark little half-hour of quintessentially British comedy". Rupert Hawksley, writing for The Daily Telegraph, was more critical. He awarded [...] "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] three out of five stars, saying that [...] "despite a starry cast and a delightful twist and counter-twist, [...] was nothing like as effective" [...] as [...] "La Couchette" [...] and [...] "The 12 Days of Christine", the previous two episodes of the series. The episode, he claimed, was indicative of a [...] "mid-series lull". The freelance journalist Dan Owen felt the episode was [...] "entertaining fare, but too predictable and clichéd to prove genuinely memorable", awarding it two out of four stars. He, too, said the episode felt like [...] "a mid-series misstep". Shearsmith was unhappy with those who thought the episode a [...] "dud" [...] or a [...] "misfire", confessing that it was his favourite episode of the second series. Pemberton felt it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to follow [...] "The 12 Days of Christine", but Shearsmith was of the view that the episodes should not be in competition with each other.|$|E

2500|$|Bankhead was {{director}} Irving Rapper's first {{choice for the}} role of Amanda in the film version of Tennessee William's The Glass Menagerie. Laurette Taylor, who originated the role of Amanda, was an idol of Bankhead's and also an alcoholic, whose brilliant performance in the original Broadway production reversed years of career decline. Rapper called Bankhead's screen test the greatest performance he had ever seen: [...] "I thought she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult,</b> but she was like a child, so sweet and lovely. I was absolutely floored by her performance. It's the greatest test I've ever made or seen in my life. I couldn't believe I was seeing such reality. Bankhead was absolutely natural, so moving, so touching without even trying. The crew was stunned, too." [...] But studio head Jack Warner rejected the idea because of his fear of Tallulah's drinking; though she promised not to drink during shooting, he refused to give her the part. The role was given to Gertrude Lawrence instead, whose acting was panned by most critics.|$|E
2500|$|The wingsuit flying {{sequence}} {{which is}} notably {{the most dangerous}} stunt in the film was filmed in Walenstadt, Switzerland and required five stuntmen (including the cameraman) flying in formation, while all weaved through narrow mountain passes, {{one of which is}} called [...] "The Crack", all at a speed of over 145 miles per hour. The production canceled planned flights on a number of days because of poor weather conditions, eventually completing it only after two weeks in August 2014. Core brought in Jeb Corliss, a professional sky diver, to help coordinate the scene and handpick wingsuit athletes to perform the stunt. Corliss and his team picked the best wingsuit pilots in the world, who have all made over 17,000 sky dives and have had 20 years of experience, including one thousand BASE jumps and thousands of wingsuit jumps each, to perform the jump. Corliss himself was {{going to be one of}} the fliers, but was not able to be, because he was recovering from a knee surgery after he tore his anterior cruciate ligament prior to the filming, while testing a suit. The five fliers includes two times World Wingsuit League champion and four times Guinness World Records holder Jhonathan Florez (cameraman, who died in July 2015), Red Bull Air Force former manager Jon DeVore (portrayed Utah), who previously worked on the wingsuit sequence for , and served as the aerial coordinator, Mike Swanson (Bodhi), Julian Boulle (Grommet), Noah Bahnson (Roach), and James Boole. DeVore knew that the sequence was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> to enact, especially in supertight, choreographed formations. Corliss himself was familiar with the place since he made a jump in 2011 from a peak just outside the Swiss town. A video of the jump titled [...] "Grinding the Crack" [...] uploaded to YouTube has been watched over 30 million times.|$|E
