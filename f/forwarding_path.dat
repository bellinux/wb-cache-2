[...] PBB-TE adapts Ethernet technology to carrier class transport networks.

Compared to PBB and its predecessors, PBB-TE behaves more predictably and its behavior can be more easily controlled by the network operator, at the expense of requiring up-front connection configuration at each bridge along a <b>forwarding</b> <b>path.</b> PBB-TE Operations, Administration, and Management (OAM) is usually based on IEEE 802.1ag.

50|$|This {{technique}} {{relies on}} traceroute-like probing on the IP address space. These probes report back IP forwarding paths to the destination address. By combining these paths one can infer router level topology {{for a given}} POP. Active probing is advantageous in that the paths returned by probes constitute the actual <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> that data takes through networks. It is {{also more likely to}} find peering links between ISP's. However, active probing requires massive amounts of probes to map the entire Internet. It is more likely to infer false topologies due to load balancing routers and routers with multiple IP address aliases. Decreased global support for enhanced probing mechanisms such as source-route probing, ICMP Echo Broadcasting, and IP Address Resolution techniques leaves this type of probing in the realm of network diagnosis.|$|E

50|$|For further cost reduction, a {{large-scale}} high-capacity mesh is desirable. For instance, Kyushu University's Mimo-Mesh Project, based in Fukuoka City, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, has developed {{and put into}} use new technology for building high capacity mesh infrastructure. A key component is called IPT, intermittent periodic transmit, a proprietary packet-forwarding scheme {{that is designed to}} reduce radio interference in the <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> of mesh networks. In 2010, hundreds of wireless LAN access points incorporating the technology were installed in the commercial shopping and entertainment complex, Canal City Hakata, resulting in the successful operation of one of the world's largest indoor wireless multi-hop backhauls. That network uses a wireless multi-hop relay of up to 11 access points while delivering high bandwidth to end users. Actual throughput is double that of standard mesh network systems using conventional packet forwarding. Latency, as in all multi-hop relays, suffers, but not to the degree that it compromises voice over IP communications.|$|E
50|$|Link-state routing {{protocols}} such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and IS-IS elect a designated router on every link to perform flooding of topology information. In wireless ad hoc networks, there is different {{notion of a}} link, packets can and do go out the same interface; hence, a different approach is {{needed in order to}} optimize the flooding process. Using Hello messages the OLSR protocol at each node discovers 2-hop neighbor information and performs a distributed election of a set of multipoint relays (MPRs). Nodes select MPRs such that there exists a path to each of its 2-hop neighbors via a node selected as an MPR. These MPR nodes then source and forward TC messages that contain the MPR selectors. This functioning of MPRs makes OLSR unique from other link state {{routing protocols}} in a few different ways: The <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> for TC messages is not shared among all nodes but varies depending on the source, only a subset of nodes source link state information, not all links of a node are advertised but only those that represent MPR selections.|$|E
5000|$|The ERS 2500 Series of Switches can be {{stacked with}} Flexible Advanced Stacking Technology (FAST) to allows eight {{switches}} {{to operate as}} single logical system with a 32 Gbit/s virtual backplane. The stack operates on a bi-directional and shortest path forwarding star topology that allows traffic to flow either 'upstream' or downstream' simultaneously from every switch allowing packets to take the optimal <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> (shortest path). The bi-directional paths allow the traffic to automatically redirect around any switch in the stack that is not operating properly. [...] This stacking technology allows stackable switches to operate with the same performance and resiliency as chassis solution. The entire stack can be managed from the base switch by several methods: Console into the base switch and use command line or a menu; telnet/SSH into the IP address of the base switch IP address and use command line; SNMP into the IP Address of the base switch to use the GUI configuration tools to management all switches on the stack at once.|$|E

50|$|This {{technique}} {{relies on}} various BGP collectors who collect routing updates and tables and provide this information publicly. Each BGP entry contains a Path Vector attribute called the AS Path. This path represents an autonomous system <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> from a given origin {{for a given}} set of prefixes. These paths {{can be used to}} infer AS-level connectivity and in turn be used to build AS topology graphs. However, these paths do not necessarily reflect how data is actually forwarded and adjacencies between AS nodes only represent a policy relationship between them. A single AS link can in reality be several router links. It is also much harder to infer peerings between two AS nodes as these peering relationships are only propagated to an ISP's customer networks. Nevertheless, support for this type of mapping is increasing as more and more ISP's offer to peer with public route collectors such as Route-Views and RIPE. New toolsets are emerging such as Cyclops and NetViews that take advantage of a new experimental BGP collector BGPMon. NetViews can not only build topology maps in seconds but visualize topology changes moments after occurring at the actual router. Hence, routing dynamics can be visualized in real time. In comparison to what the tools using BGPMon does there is another tool netTransformer able to discover and generate BGP peering maps either through SNMP polling or by converting MRT dumps to a graphml file format. netTransformer allows us also to perform network diffs between any two dumps and thus to reason how does the BGP peering has evolved through the years.

30|$|We {{propose a}} novel routing protocol, called vector-based {{forwarding}} (VBF), {{to address the}} routing problem in UWSNs. VBF is an essentially geographic routing protocol, which is robust, scalable, and energy efficient. In VBF, the <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> is the vector from the source to the destination. No state information is required on the sensor nodes and {{only a small fraction}} of the nodes in the networks are involved in routing. Moreover, packets are forwarded along redundant and interleaved paths from the source to the destination; it is robust against packet loss and node failure. To enhance the performance of VBF in sparse networks, we propose a variant of VBF, called hop-by-hop VBF (HH-VBF). In HH-VBF, the <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> is the vector from forwarding nodes to the target instead of the one from the source to the target. HH-VBF is capable of finding a <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> even in a very sparse network. Further, we develop localized and distributed self-adaptation algorithms to improve the performance of VBF and HH-VBF. The self-adaptation algorithms allow the nodes to weigh the benefit to forward packets and reduce energy consumption by discarding low benefit packets. We evaluate the performance of VBF and HH-VBF through extensive simulations.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAnalysis of real {{datasets}} {{to characterize}} the local stability properties of the Internet routing paths suggests that extending the route selection criteria to account for such property would not increase the routing path length. Nevertheless, even if selecting a more stable routing path could be considered as valuable from a routing perspective, {{it does not necessarily}} imply that the associated <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> would be more stable. Hence, if the dynamics of the Internet routing and forwarding system show different properties, then one can not straightforwardly derive the one from the other. If this assumption is verified, then the relationship between the stability of the <b>forwarding</b> <b>path</b> (followed by the traffic) and the corresponding routing path as selected by the path-vector routing algorithm requires further characterization. For this purpose, we locally relate, i. e., at the router level, the stability properties of routing path with the corresponding <b>forwarding</b> <b>path.</b> The proposed stability model and measurement results verify this assumption and show that, although the main cause of instability results from the forwarding plane, a second order effect relates forwarding and routing path instability events.
