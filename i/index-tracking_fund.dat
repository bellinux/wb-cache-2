50|$|However, in a Jun 2010 {{article in}} The Economist, the {{argument}} is made that <b>Index-tracking</b> <b>funds</b> (of which Goldman Sachs Commodity Index was one) did not cause the bubble. It describes {{a report by the}} Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that used data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to make the case. For example, the report points out that even commodities without futures markets also saw price rises during the period. However, counter-arguments have been made that the commodities without futures markets saw their prices rise {{as a consequence of the}} rising prices of commodities with futures markets: the World Development Movement, a social justice lobbying organization, states there is strong evidence that the rising price of wheat caused the price of rice to subsequently rise.|$|R

40|$|Fund {{managers}} earn {{a portion}} of their fees by out-performing a benchmark, typically an index. To out-perform, they may leverage the fund or engage in scrip lending, but usually they “stock-pick”, taking positions in the market which differ from those of the benchmark, namely: “active share”. Several factors in the fund’s mandate may constrain the level of active share in a fund, inter-alia: limits on specific equities or sectors, tracking error constraints around the benchmark or limits on short-selling. We find that the percentage of active share on the JSE has declined from around 50 % to 15 % over the last 20 years, which is consistent with research elsewhere. This indicates that fund managers are unable or unwilling to take active positions. In contrast to other studies, we find no relationship between the level of active share and a fund’s return, raising doubts abou t the stock picking ability of fund managers. Finally, we observe that some <b>index-tracking</b> <b>funds</b> (with low active share) consistently out-perform around 80 % of domestic general equity funds on the JSE over five-year holding periods. These findings challenge the high fees charged by many fund managers...|$|R
40|$|As a discipline, {{political}} economy {{has often been}} reluctant to engage with the details of market devices and practices. This weakens the microfoundations of its analysis of capitalist macro-dynamics and cedes unnecessarily large stretches of intellectual territory to economics. The performativity approach developed by Michel Callon offers a theoretical {{way out of this}} dual dilemma. It allows political economists to study ‘the economy’ directly by investigating the links between the diversity of market devices and the diversity of capitalism. The argument is illustrated by an analysis of the gradual, performative evolution of the investment intermediation market, where the traditional high-cost model of active asset management has been challenged by the emergence of a low-cost alternative in the form of <b>index-tracking</b> investment <b>funds.</b> Highlighting the distributive implications of this development, the current article shows that the financial innovation of exchange-traded funds played a crucial part in the completion of the socio-technical agencement of the ‘passive investor’. In contrast to the recently resurgent notion that the two approaches are incompatible, this article insists that the micro-sociological study of market devices fosters the analytical capacity of {{political economy}} by opening up new perspectives on the macro-dynamics of contemporary capitalism. In the case at hand, it brings into sharp relief the contours of the emerging constellation of ‘asset manager capitalism’...|$|R
