50|$|A {{tachymeter}} or tacheometer {{is a type}} of theodolite {{used for}} rapid measurements and determines, electronically or electro-optically, the <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target.</b> The principles of action {{are similar to those of}} rangefinders.|$|E

50|$|In 1960, {{when the}} {{biathlon}} was included into the Winter Olympics, this sport was, so to say, paramilitary. Sportsmen used rifles based on army magazine carbines, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>targets</b> was 150-200 m, and <b>to</b> hit the <b>targets</b> heavy 7.62 and 6.5 cartridges were used.The 6,5x54R was the wildcat of the 7,62x54R, and {{may soon be}} back in production.|$|R
50|$|The {{theodolite}} is used {{to measure}} horizontal and vertical angles to target points. These angles are referred to the local vertical. The tacheometer additionally determines, electronically or electro-optically, the <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target,</b> and is highly automated to even robotic in its operations. The method of free station position is widely used.|$|E
50|$|Modern combat {{aircraft}} are equipped {{to calculate the}} PIP for onboard weapons at any given time. Using the PIP marker, pilots can achieve good accuracy at ranges of up to several kilometers, whether the target is ground-based or airborne. Variables included in the calculation are aircraft velocity, target velocity, target elevation, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target,</b> forces on the projectile (drag, gravity), and others.|$|E

50|$|The skinny {{triangle}} {{is useful}} in gunnery in that it allows a relationship to be calculated between the range {{and size of the}} target without the shooter needing to compute or look up any trigonometric functions. Military and hunting telescopic sights often have a reticle calibrated in milliradians, in this context usually called just mils or mil-dots. A target 1 metre in height and measuring 1 mil in the sight corresponds to a range of 1000 metres. There is an inverse relationship between the angle measured in a sniper's sight and the <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target.</b> For instance, if this same target measures 2 mils in the sight then the range is 500 metres.|$|E
50|$|Once {{calculated}} the radial velocity of currents, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target,</b> and the angular direction to target {{it is possible}} to determine the current vector and to construct current vector maps. In fact, for the area in which vector data from two CODAR sites overlap, {{it is possible to}} calculate the velocity and direction of the current and comparisons with surface drifters and error analysis made in 1979 indicate that CODAR measures surface currents with at least 10 cm/s accuracy.In 2010, retailers of modern CODAR equipments guarantee an accuracy typically < 7 cm/s of the total current velocity and 1-2 cm of the tidal component, in normal environment condition.However, the accuracy of the system depends on several factors, such as signal-to-noise ratios, geometry and pointing errors.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{units are}} based on {{customary}} units, but use power-of-ten factors and metric prefixes. For example, <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target</b> for a U.S. submarine is expressed in kiloyards rather than some combination of miles, yards, and feet. Telephone transmission line length and loop distances are measured in kilofeet. [...] In some fields of civil engineering (especially structural engineering), and architecture, large loads and forces (such as {{the weight of a}} building or the amount of load applied to a column) are measured in kips (kilopounds or 1000 pounds-force) instead of short tons-force (2000 pounds-force), which are used in virtually all other non-metric industries in the United States, as well as in common usage among the public, when dealing with large values of force.|$|E
5000|$|In the k-calculus methodology, {{distances}} {{are measured}} using radar. An observer sends a radar pulse towards a target and receives an echo from it.

30|$|For {{producing}} a design {{solution of the}} approach function for both attentive Target and inattentive Target, we surveyed the required abilities to the approach function suitable for both attentive and inattentive Target, and then, we assumed that Robot had to have abilities to distinguish the poses of inattentive Target from attentive <b>Target,</b> <b>to</b> measure <b>distances</b> <b>to</b> <b>Target,</b> and <b>to</b> warn <b>Target.</b> And for simplifying an environment of approach function, we supposed that Robot would approach Target in a wide indoor hallway.|$|R

50|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of weapons in Vendetta Online, some {{requiring}} energy to fire, others relying on ammunition, proximity fuzes, target tracking, or some combination thereof. As most weapons have a cone of fire assisted by autoaim, effectively deploying weaponry relies less on careful aiming than it does on managing the ship's momentum, energy, attitude and <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target.</b> Knowledge of combat proves an effective tool, as a veteran pilot flying mediocre equipment will often defeat a less experienced pilot using superior equipment, by virtue of tactics alone. However, certain weapons do require careful aiming, such as railguns. Weapons may cause the target ship to be displaced, or to spin through concussive force. Weapons may also hit a target that has not been selected, or hit an unintended target or friendly ship.|$|E
5000|$|The gun's {{performance}} was {{highly dependent on}} <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target</b> and type of ammunition loaded. For kinetic penetration, {{the speed of the}} projectile upon impact is crucial, and cumulative effect of air resistance decreases the velocity of the shell as the distance to the target increases. The accuracy achieved during controlled test firing to determine the pattern of dispersion gives a greater accuracy than the variation expected during practice firing on a range due to differences between guns, ammunition and gunners; both at precisely known distances.Due to errors in estimating the range and many other factors, the probability of a first shot hit under battlefield conditions was much lower than at the firing range. Observing the tracer from the first round in battle, the average, calm gunner might achieve the firing range accuracy shown in the second column with the second round fired at the same target.|$|E
5000|$|The Type 89 {{discharger}} {{could also}} be used with a more powerful impact-detonated shell approaching the power of a light mortar. Weighing approximately two pounds (approx. 900 g), it was known as the Type 89 50mm shell, and was made in high explosive (HE), incendiary and smoke variants. To fire the shell (which had a nose-mounted impact fuse that detonated on contact), it was dropped base-down inside the tube of the discharger. By setting the Type 89 discharger at a fixed angle of 45 degrees, and varying <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target</b> by adjusting the size of a variable chamber space inside the discharger mechanism (See also the Granatnik wz. 36), soldiers could adjust fire onto multiple targets at varying ranges while firing the contact-detonated 50 mm shell through a single small clearing in the jungle canopy. [...] The method worked equally well when firing from deep trenches or pits, or between various building obstructions when fighting inside a built-up town or city.|$|E

50|$|For example, with {{a typical}} Leupold brand duplex 16 Minute of Angle (MOA) reticle (of a type {{as shown in}} image B) on a fixed power scope, the {{distance}} from post to post (that is, between the heavy lines of the reticle spanning {{the center of the}} scope picture) is approximately 32 in at 200 yd, or, equivalently, approximately 16 in from the center to any post at 200 yards. If a target of a known diameter of 16 inches fills just half of the total post-to-post distance (i.e. filling from scope center to post), then the <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target</b> is approximately 200 yd. With a target of a diameter of 16 inches that fills the entire sight picture from post to post, the range is approximately 100 yards. Other ranges can be similarly estimated accurately in an analog fashion for known target sizes through proportionality calculations. Holdover, for estimating vertical point of aim offset required for bullet drop compensation on level terrain, and horizontal windage offset (for estimating side to side point of aim offsets required for wind effect corrections) can similarly be compensated for through using approximations based on the wind speed (from observing flags or other objects) by a trained user through using the reticle marks. The less-commonly used holdunder, used for shooting on sloping terrain, can even be estimated by an appropriately-skilled user with a reticle-equipped scope, once both the slope of the terrain and the slant range to target are known.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experiment comparing two spatial audio display segmentation techniques by investigating the relative salience of target width versus <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target</b> in a gesture based spatial audio selection task. The first technique, MINIMAL, occupies as little of the display area as possible with sounds placed as close to each other as possible. The second technique, MAXIMAL, occupies all the available display area and sounds are placed as far apart as possible and the associated display area assigned to each sound is allowed to grow. Ratios of <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target</b> to target width were kept constant in both displays to investigate the relative salience of <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target</b> versus target width in the sound selection task. Participants performed an orientation based pointing task to select an audio display element in the presence of distracting sounds. Results show that the maximal strategy results in faster and more accurate interaction. Target width was found to have significantly more impact on time ratings than <b>distance</b> <b>to</b> <b>target.</b> Time and accuracy ratings indicate that deictic gesture interaction with a spatial audio display is a robust and efficient interaction technique. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} and precision of two key field measurements used to produce estimates of marine mammal abundance from shipboard surveys – the horizontal angles from the ship's trackline and the radial <b>distances</b> <b>to</b> the animals in the water – were assessed. Measurements were made from two ships, the McArthur and the David Starr Jordan, under field conditions. Horizontal angles were measured using angle rings and radial distances were measured with reticles in 25 X binoculars. <b>Distances</b> <b>to</b> <b>targets</b> were measured simultaneously using radar and reticles. Rounding of horizontal angles in field survey data to 5 degree increments, and of reticle values to both 0. 2 and 0. 5 reticle increments, was indicated by autocorrelation tests. The rounding was eliminated by "smearing " the original horizontal angles over ± 2 degrees and the original reticles over ± 0. 05 reticles. Replicated measurements of angles in the radar database indicated 95 % of angle measurements <b>to</b> a single <b>target</b> were expected <b>to</b> be within ± 3 degrees of one another. The precision of radial distances measured using reticles was inversely proportional <b>to</b> <b>target</b> <b>distance.</b> The radial distances calculated using the formula proposed by Lerczak and Hobbs (1998) were a closer fit <b>to</b> <b>distances</b> from radar than alternative formulas, but exhibited a slight tendency <b>to</b> underestimate <b>distances</b> <b>to</b> <b>targets</b> close <b>to</b> the horizon under field conditions. Adjusting reticle measurements for light refraction improved the fit <b>to</b> <b>target</b> <b>distances</b> by reducing this downward bias.
