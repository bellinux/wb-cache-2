5|$|Capital {{within the}} EU may be {{transferred}} in any amount <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>country</b> to another.

This includes all member states of the EU, even those outside the eurozone providing the transactions are carried out in euro. Credit/debit card charging and ATM withdrawals within the eurozone are also treated as domestic transactions; however paper-based payment orders, like cheques, have not been standardised so these are still domestic-based. The ECB has also set up a clearing system, TARGET, for large euro transactions.|$|E

5|$|Within {{a day of}} Cyclone Waka's {{passage in}} Tonga, the Government of New Zealand {{deployed}} an aircraft to survey the scale of damage and reestablish contact with the Tongan Islands. This aircraft was sent {{in accordance with the}} FRANZ Agreement, enacted in 1992, which states that assests <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>country</b> would be used in relief operations. On January2, the head of Tonga's Disaster Office announced that they would likely need international assistance to recover from the storm. Due to the substantial damage to agriculture, food shortages were expected to impact the region over the following months. By January7, the Red Cross began sending supplies to Tonga. Hundreds of tents and tarpaulins were brought in by an Australian AC-130 to help with the recovery process. On January12, a New Zealand Lockheed C-130 Hercules carrying US$700,000 worth of supplies flew to the area to deliver aid. An additional US$700,000 was given in relief funds to repair damage wrought by the storm. Of this, US$500,000 would be used to repair schools that were damaged or destroyed and the remaining US$200,000 would be used for emergency lighting, cooking and food supply recovery.|$|E
