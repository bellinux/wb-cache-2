5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the District and Metropolitan {{railways}} faced increased competition in central London from new, electric, deep-level tube lines. The City & South London Railway had been a great success when it opened in 1890. After the opening of the Central London Railway in 1900 from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fare</b> of 2d, the District and Metropolitan together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The use of steam propulsion led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward. However, electric traction was still in its infancy and agreement would be needed with the Metropolitan because of the shared ownership of the inner circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches successfully ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. Tenders were then requested and in 1901 a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. Initially this was accepted by both parties.|$|E

This means passengers would have a single card and be charged for the actual fare used (<b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fare).</b> This is unlike Metcard where passengers who travel into different zones at different days and times may need to buy several types of Metcards beforehand.|$|E

2500|$|Urban {{public transit}} differs {{distinctly}} among Asia, North America, and Europe. In Asia, profit-driven, privately-owned and publicly traded mass transit {{and real estate}} conglomerates predominantly operate public transit systems [...] In North America, municipal transit authorities most commonly run mass transit operations. In Europe, both state-owned and private companies predominantly operate mass transit systems, Public transport services can be profit-driven by use of pay-by-the-distance fares or funded by government subsidies in which <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fares</b> are charged to each passenger. Services can be fully profitable through high usership numbers and high farebox recovery ratios, or can be regulated and possibly subsidised from local or national tax revenue. Fully subsidised, free of charge services operate in some towns and cities.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two schools}} of thought in fare collections: a simple, <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fare</b> {{structure}} (pay a fixed fare regardless of time of day and/or travel distance) or a complex, variable rate fare structure (pay a variable fare depending on time of day and/or travel distance).|$|E
50|$|In North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania, the {{majority}} of the cities use simple, <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fare</b> structures due to budgetary constraints. With {{the majority}} of North America, most of South America, almost all of Africa, and most of Oceania being heavily reliant on the automobile for both short and long distance travel, majority of the transit budgets are allocated toward construction and maintenance of freeways and roads, with very little funding making way to investments in new mass transit technologies. Inadvertently however, the reliance on simpler fare structures due to their cheaper costs ends up increasing the tax burden on the agencies as <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> <b>fare</b> structures have lower farebox recovery ratios, placing more pressure to the transit agencies to increase taxes, pursue higher fare hikes, or to cut services to maintain the transit system.|$|E

The other large service provider is the Unilink bus service (running from {{early in the morning}} to midnight), which was commissioned by the University of Southampton to provide transport from the university to the town. Previously run by Enterprise, it is now run by Bluestar. Free buses were provided by City-link', but the subsidy provided by Southampton City Council was pulled in 2014 and the service now charges passengers £1 <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> single <b>fare,</b> with Red Funnel ticket holders continuing to travel free. The service was rebranded as QuayConnect in May 2016, with a red and white livery on the bus instead of blue. It runs from the Red Funnel ferry terminals at Town Quay to Central station via Westquay and is operated by Bluestar. There is also a door-to-door minibus service called Southampton Dial a Ride, for residents who cannot access public transport. This is funded by the council and operated by SCA Support Services.|$|R

As of January 2016, a single adult fare is $3.15, or $2.10 for youth. Books of 10 tickets are available at par to 10 fares. Monthly passes are also available, with youth passes for $60.00, and adult passes for $99.00. Seniors (65 and over) pay $95.00 for a yearly pass which is valid from July 1 to June 30 of the following year and which entitles them to travel at any time. Service on Christmas Day is free of charge. Starting New Year's Eve 2014, extended service until 3:00 a.m. on the CTrain and select bus routes requires regular fare. In order to transfer from one transit vehicle to another, proof of fare from the CTrain, or a transfer from a bus is required.

3000|$|We {{find that}} cost cap tariffs {{should never be}} chosen over {{pay-per-use}} or <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> plans if consumers are certain about their preferences and consequently in their demand. In this case, the cost cap tariff is always dominated by either the pay-per-use plan or the <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> However, if consumers have uncertainty in their preferences, the cost cap tariff may generate a higher (expected) consumer surplus than a pay-per-use plan or a <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> This holds true even though consumers are charged more at the margin than in a pay-per-use tariff and the maximum possible bill amount is higher under a cost cap compared to a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> tariff. This is because the cost cap tariff does not only provide cost insurance in case of high demand (like a <b>flat</b> <b>rate),</b> but also cost flexibility in case of low demand (like a pay-per-use tariff). The main research questions that are addressed are (1) under which conditions are cost cap tariffs potentially chosen (over pay-per-use plans and <b>flat</b> <b>rates)?</b> and (2) what {{is the impact of}} demand uncertainty on tariff choice?

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to give insights into the production, income and environmental effects of the introduction of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> for Dutch agriculture that is lower than the present average direct income payment. For this purpose, a detailed agri-environmental programming model for Dutch agriculture is used. Results of a <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> scenario are compared to a reference scenario comparing agricultural production in the Netherlands in 2020 in a situation without a <b>flat</b> <b>rate.</b> Results show that total gross margin in Dutch agriculture decreases because of the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> with 7 %. The supply of starch potatoes and cow milk decreases most. Production of seed and consumption potatoes, vegetables and intensive livestock products increases slightly. This is largely due to a shift of farm payments from milk and starch potatoes production to arable crops and vegetable production. It was found that including risk aversion of income volatility amplifies these effects. In the <b>flat</b> <b>rate</b> scenario total emissions of nutrients from agricultural production to the environment decreases...|$|R
