50|$|In energy-dispersive X-ray {{spectroscopy}} (EDX) or (EDXS), {{which is}} also referred to in literature as X-ray <b>energy</b> <b>dispersive</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (EDS) or (XEDS), an X-ray spectrometer is used to detect the characteristic X-rays that are emitted by atoms in the sample as they are ionized by electron in the beam. In STEM, EDX is typically used for compositional analysis and elemental mapping of samples. Typical X-ray detectors for electron microscopes cover only a small solid angle, which makes X-ray detection relatively inefficient since X-rays are emitted from the sample in every direction. However, detectors covering large solid angles have been recently developed, and atomic resolution X-ray mapping has even been achieved.|$|E
