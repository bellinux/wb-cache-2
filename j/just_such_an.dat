But they were cornered by a Roman cavalry squadron in a wood {{on the bank of}} the Rhine and surrendered. Brought before Julian, whom he begged for mercy, Chnodomar was sent on to the court of Constantius at Milan. Not long afterwards, he died of disease in a camp for barbarian prisoners in Rome.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October, The Austro-German 14th Army under General der Infanterie Otto von Below inflicted a great defeat on the Italian Army at the Battle of Caporetto. In {{fear that}} Italy might {{be put out}} of the war, the French and British Governments each promised to send six {{divisions}} to the Italian Front. All troops were rapidly and efficiently transferred between 10 November and 12 December, due to good administrative preparations made by the French Chief of Staff Ferdinand Foch, who {{had been sent to}} Italy in April 1917 to plan for <b>just</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> emergency. The Third Battle of Ypres came to an unsatisfactory close {{as a result of the}} diversion of British forces, with Haig being forced to end his advance just short of Westroosebeke. On 14 November, a gradual relief of the Canadian divisions by the VIII Corps began and on 20 November, Currie resumed command along the Lens–Vimy front.|$|E
5|$|South Vietnamese {{forces had}} been rehearsing for <b>just</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> {{operation}} since late March. On 27 April, an ARVN Ranger Battalion had advanced into Kandal Province {{to destroy a}} communist base. Four days later other South Vietnamese troops drove 16 kilometers into Cambodian territory. Lon Nol, who had initially attempted to follow a neutralist policy of his own, requested military aid and assistance from the U.S. government on 14 April. On that day, South Vietnamese forces then conducted {{the first of three}} brief cross-border operations under the aegis of Operation Toan Thang (Complete Victory) 41, sending armored cavalry units into regions of Cambodia's Svay Rieng Province nicknamed the Angel's Wing and the Crow's Nest. On 20 April, 2,000 South Vietnamese troops advanced into the Parrot's Beak, killing 144 PAVN troops. On 22 April, Nixon authorized American air support for the South Vietnamese operations. All of these incursions into Cambodian territory were simply reconnaissance missions in preparation for a larger-scale effort being planned by MACV and its ARVN counterparts, subject to authorization by Nixon.|$|E

In February 1975, he changed the name of Ablesdeal Ltd (a shelf company he had bought in September 1973 for <b>just</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> eventuality) to Westminster Mail Order Ltd.

25|$|On 21 March, Patton {{ordered his}} XII Corps {{to prepare for}} an assault over the Rhine on the {{following}} night, one day before Montgomery's scheduled crossing. While this was certainly short notice, it did not catch the XII Corps completely unaware. As soon as Patton had received the orders on the 19th to make a crossing, he had begun sending assault boats, bridging equipment, and other supplies forward from depots in Lorraine {{where they had been}} stockpiled since autumn in the expectation of <b>just</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> opportunity. Seeing this equipment moving up, his frontline soldiers did not need any orders from higher headquarters to tell them what it meant.|$|E
25|$|In April 1967 MACSOG {{was ordered}} to {{commence}} Operation DANIEL BOONE, a cross-border recon effort in Cambodia. Both SOG and the 5th Special Forces Group had been preparing for <b>just</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> eventuality. The 5th had {{gone so far as}} to create Projects B-56 Sigma and B-50 Omega, units based on SOG's SHINING BRASS organization, which had been conducting in-country recon efforts on behalf of the Field Forces, awaiting authorization to begin the Cambodian operations. A turf war now raged between the 5th and SOG over missions and manpower. The Joint Chiefs decided in favor of MACSOG, since it already successfully conducted covert cross-border operations. Operational control of Sigma and Omega was eventually handed over to SOG.|$|E

25|$|As {{a long-standing}} ally of Pakistan, the People's Republic of China reacted with alarm to the {{evolving}} situation in East Pakistan {{and the prospect}} of India invading West Pakistan and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. Believing that <b>just</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> Indian attack was imminent, Nixon encouraged China to mobilise its armed forces along its border with India to discourage it. The Chinese did not, however, respond to this encouragement, because unlike the 1962 Sino-Indian War when India was caught entirely unaware, this time the Indian Army was prepared and had deployed eight mountain divisions to the Sino-Indian border to guard against such an eventuality. China instead threw its weight behind demands for an immediate ceasefire.|$|E
25|$|In 1354, {{though in}} exile and without {{control of his}} ancestral lands, John, the MacDougall heir, quitclaimed any rights he had over Mull and Iona to the Lord of the Isles (though this had no {{meaningful}} effect at the time). When Robert's son, David II, King of Scotland, became king, he {{spent some time in}} English captivity; following his release, in 1357, he restored MacDougall authority over Lorn. The 1354 quitclaim, which seems to have been an attempt to ensure peace in <b>just</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> eventuality, took automatic effect, splitting Mull and Iona from Lorn, and making it subject to the Lordship of the Isles. Iona remained part of the Lordship of the Isles for the next century and a half.|$|E
25|$|Page 13 - Finally, a word {{should be}} said for the inestimable value of the Type JR-1 relay {{operated}} battle lanterns, which were the only source of illumination after the ship's lighting system failed. The confidence that these beams of light along the exit routes maintained in the men contributed largely to the lack of panic and contributed to the saving of many lives. There were 110 of these lanterns installed throughout the ship in locations best suited for <b>just</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> emergency. This is twice the number shown in the ship's machinery allowance book. The excess was obtained through an error, but in view of this experience it is believed that the quantity of 110 is the acceptable minimum for cruisers. It is recommended that the allowance of this item for cruisers be increased accordingly and that it be increased proportionately for other types of ships.|$|E

Launched with naval and close air support, the landing outflanked the North Koreans, recaptured Seoul and forced them to retreat northward in disarray.
