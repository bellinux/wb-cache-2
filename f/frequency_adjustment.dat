50|$|Changing {{the square}} wave as {{described}} above {{is an example of}} pulse-width modulation (PWM). Modulating, or regulating the width of a square-wave pulse is often used as a method of regulating or adjusting an inverter's output voltage. When voltage control is not required, a fixed pulse width can be selected to reduce or eliminate selected harmonics. Harmonic elimination techniques are generally applied to the lowest harmonics because filtering is much more practical at high frequencies, where the filter components can be much smaller and less expensive. Multiple pulse-width or carrier based PWM control schemes produce waveforms that are composed of many narrow pulses. The frequency represented by the number of narrow pulses per second is called the switching frequency or carrier frequency. These control schemes are often used in variable-frequency motor control inverters because they allow a wide range of output voltage and <b>frequency</b> <b>adjustment</b> while also improving the quality of the waveform.|$|E
5000|$|Neuhof Substation is a 110 kV {{substation}} in Neuhof, {{an urban}} part of Bad Sachsa, Lower Saxony. The Neuhof substation went in service in 1985 and was {{connected with a}} 110 kV-powerline for three phase alternating current with the Wolkramshausen substation in former East Germany. It was therefore {{one of the few}} substations in former West Germany, into which electricity from GDR was fed. Through the Neuhof substation up to 40 MVA could be imported. Up to 25 MVA of the imported power could be fed via 5 rotary motor-generators, which were manufactured by Siemens and used for the compensation of frequency fluctuations of the East German power grid, into the power grid of West Germany. Additionally power was fed directly from the East German power grid into the grids of Bad Sachsa, Walkenried, Zorge and Wieda. The converters consisted of a three-phase asynchronous motor with a short circuited rotor on the driving side and an asynchronous generator with a slip-ring fed rotor, whereby the <b>frequency</b> <b>adjustment</b> was made by a static frequency inverter, which feeds the rotor. Startup of a converter took place using the slip-ring rotor with a conventional starter circuit. After the converter had reached its nominal speed, the short circuited rotor was connected, which then took over the drive. In April 1990 the plant was shut down and between 2003 and 2005 the machines were dismantled. The machine halls stand still today and are used by Harzenergie for internal purposes.|$|E

50|$|GPSDOs {{typically}} phase-align {{the internal}} flywheel oscillator to the GPS signal by using dividers {{to generate a}} 1PPS signal from the reference oscillator, then phase comparing this 1PPS signal to the GPS-generated 1PPS signal and using the phase differences to control the local oscillator <b>frequency</b> in small <b>adjustments</b> via the tracking loop. This differentiates GPSDOs from their cousins NCOs (numerically controlled oscillator). Rather than disciplining an oscillator via <b>frequency</b> <b>adjustments,</b> NCOs typically use a free-running, low-cost crystal oscillator and adjust the output phase by digitally lengthening or shortening the output phase many times per second in large phase steps assuring that on average the number of phase transitions per second is aligned to the GPS receiver reference source. This guarantees frequency accuracy {{at the expense of}} high phase noise and jitter, a degradation that true GPSDOs do not suffer.|$|R

40|$|This study proposes an {{optimized}} <b>frequency</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{method that}} uses a micro-cantilever beam-based piezoelectric vibration generator based {{on a combination of}} added mass and capacitance. The most important concept of the proposed method is that the <b>frequency</b> <b>adjustment</b> process is divided into two steps: the first is a rough adjustment step that changes the size of the mass added at the end of cantilever to adjust the frequency in a large-scale and discontinuous manner; the second step is a continuous but short-range <b>frequency</b> <b>adjustment</b> via the adjustable added capacitance. Experimental results show that when the initial natural frequency of a micro piezoelectric vibration generator is 69. 8 Hz, then this natural frequency can be adjusted to any value in the range from 54. 2 Hz to 42. 1 Hz using the combination of the added mass and the capacitance. This method simply and effectively matches a piezoelectric vibration generator’s natural frequency to the vibration source frequency...|$|E

30|$|Many {{research}} {{works in}} recent years have sought to overcome transmission latency. These works proposed broadcast transmission <b>frequency</b> <b>adjustment</b> methods to overcome this issue [13, 18, 19]. Moreover, many other research works have proposed broadcast transmission power adjustment methods to overcome the problem [12, 20, 21]. However, not only transmission <b>frequency</b> <b>adjustment</b> methods but also transmission power adjustment methods are needed to obtain more information, to decide the optimal rate or frequency control, such as feedback information from neighbouring cars, or to monitor the broadcast condition immediately. This paper proposes a system that reduces the repeated and derivable information between the broadcast messages, thus solving the time-critical issue. The proposed system will not change the transmission power and frequency but is compatible with the above research works.|$|E
