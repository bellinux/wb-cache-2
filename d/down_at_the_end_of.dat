5|$|At times, when a {{new king}} came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and {{replaced}} with new ones, or they might be broken. When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors. One {{of the most striking}} archaeological markers of such an invasion is the destruction of the defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast <b>down.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador, where most of the stelae were found smashed.|$|E

50|$|The Chaconne, an {{extremely}} dynamic work, was Nielsen's first piano composition in 16 years. Following a simple opening theme, always in constant motion the piece develops through a crescendo, finally winding <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> <b>The</b> 20 variations forming the composition's core have an extensive range, sometimes reflecting Bach's influence, {{but more often}} presenting highly complex contrasts.

Upon reaching {{the city in}} September 1895, the column bombarded the royal palace with heavy artillery, causing heavy casualties and leading Queen Ranavalona III to surrender. France annexed Madagascar in 1896 and declared the island a colony the following year, dissolving the Merina monarchy and sending the royal family into exile on Réunion Island and to Algeria.

5|$|Construction of the {{original}} spacecraft was completed in August 2004. Following testing, the spacecraft was shipped to the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia during August 2005 and arrived on 1 September. The launch occurred from Site 133/3 on 8 October, however due to a missing command in the rocket's flight control system, the second stage engine did not shut <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> its planned burn, and instead the stage burned to depletion. This prevented the second stage and Briz-KM from separating, {{and as a result}} the rocket failed to achieve orbit. The spacecraft was lost when it reentered over the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland.|$|E

During an afternoon patrol commanding twenty-two F-86's, Davis spotted fifty MiGs in the Sunchun, South Korea area heading further south towards the Taechon area. He surprised and destroyed one MiG, and then turned on another in an aggressive attack which forced the MiG pilot to bail out. After 30 combat missions in Korea, Davis had 12 victories.|$|E

5|$|The company sold $750 {{million in}} assets, {{including}} Fluor's headquarters in Irvine, {{in order to}} pay $1 billion in debt. Staff were reduced from 32,000 to 14,000. In 1986 Fluor sold all of its oil assets and some of its gold mining operations. Fluor Engineers, Inc. and Daniel International were merged, forming Fluor Daniel. By 1987, Fluor had returned to profitability with $26.6 million in profits and $108.5 million by 1989. By the end of the restructuring, Fluor had three major divisions: Fluor Daniel, Fluor Construction International and St. Joe Minerals Corp. Each division had its own smaller subsidiaries. Fluor started being named by Engineering News as the largest construction and engineering company in the United States. Fluor's international revenues rebounded. Having postponed his retirement to help Fluor, Tappan stepped <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 1989 and was replaced by Leslie McCraw.|$|E
5|$|Arkansas State got {{the ball}} to start the second half, and {{promptly}} drove down the field relying predominantly on Knighten, who threw six passes and attempted three rushes; ultimately, their drive stalled at the 2-yard line, and Davis kicked an 18-yard field goal to put the Red Wolves atop 13–10. Ball State subsequently faced a fourth down and one (4th and 1) situation, on which they attempted a fake punt – Schmidt was tackled by Brock Barnhill on the play and lost three yards on the rush, and the Cardinals had to relinquish the ball in their own territory. Arkansas State {{took advantage of the}} field position, converting another field goal attempt, this one from 29 yards, to give them a 6-point lead. Once again, Ball State turned the ball over on downs on their ensuing possession, this time doing so at the Arkansas State 32-yard line. This time, Arkansas State failed to take advantage, punting after achieving only one first <b>down.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the quarter, Ball State {{was in the midst of}} a possession around their 25-yard line.|$|E

After two short-gain plays, Rodgers completed a 16-yard pass and a 24-yard toss to drive the Bears inside the Virginia Tech 20-yard line. Echemandu rushed the ball twice for seven total yards, then Rodgers ran it himself the remaining nine yards for another California touchdown. The touchdown and extra point gave California a 42–28 lead, its largest in the game. Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball with 41seconds remaining in the quarter, and ran four quick plays. After Bryan Randall threw two incompletions, he connected with Ernest Wilford on a long 23-yard pass, and Kevin Jones rushed up {{the middle of the}} field for another 12yards. As time expired in the quarter, Tech was inside California territory for the first time since the beginning of the quarter and had a first <b>down.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the third quarter, California held a 42–28 lead.|$|E
50|$|The {{tendency}} of the variable force on the upper slide is to lift the machine off its lead springs at half-stroke and ease it <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of stroke.

5|$|Ferreira stepped <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the 2009–10 {{season and}} was {{replaced}} by André Villas-Boas, a former assistant of Mourinho at Porto, Chelsea, and Internazionale. In a single season, Villas-Boas guided the team to a record-matching four titles, including victory in the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. Their triumphant campaign started in the play-off round, where they overcame Belgian side Genk to reach the group stage. Porto topped their group undefeated, only dropping points against Beşiktaş. In the round of 32, despite a second-leg home loss, they eliminated the 2005–06 and 2006–07 UEFA Cup winners Sevilla, setting up a tie with CSKA Moscow. Porto defeated the Russians in both legs and advanced to the quarter-finals, where they were paired against another Muscovite club, this time Spartak Moscow. Two prolific displays, which included a hat-trick by Radamel Falcao, sealed a 10–3 aggregate win for Porto. In the semi-finals, Falcao went one better and scored four goals in a first-leg 5–1 win against Villarreal, which all but confirmed the club's fourth major European final. The Dublin final was an all-Portuguese affair between Porto and Primeira Liga rivals Braga. Contrasting with previous matches in the tournament, Porto's performance was more contained and victory was secured with a single goal by Falcao, who became the competition's top scorer.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{they won}} the Northern League Cup, beating Ashington 2–1 in the final at Crook. In the summer of 1978, Chris Waddle started playing for the club. In the summer of 1980, while Waddle was working in a sausage factory, he was sold to Newcastle United for the fee of £1,000. Tow Law Town were runners-up in the 1988–89 season, before finally winning the league again in 1994–95, sitting 14 points clear {{at the end of}} the season.

Kevin McCormick took over as treasurer.|$|E
5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while he had thought that he was traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion.|$|E
