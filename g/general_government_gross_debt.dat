We talk about the Economic Forecast Spring 2009 of the European Commission, Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs. The analysis is focused on some specific economic indicators (GDP at previous year prices, private consumption, public consumption, gross fixed capital formation, exports, imports, employment, unemployment rate, unit labour costs whole economy, savings rate of households, harmonised index of consumer prices, trade balance, <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> as % of GDP) and covers 2008 - 2010 period.

The data processing leads to an unexpected result: the Members States can be easily divided into three categories, each of them with specific evolutions. Moreover, the economic evolution of those Member States' economies leads to greater disparities in 2010, comparing to 2008. These disparities are presented using pertinent diagrams and critical remarks. The question we have to answer is if the present European cohesion policy is able to solve these disparities. Unfortunately, the answer is negative, at least in 2010. As a result, these new socio-economic evolution of the EU under the global crisis represents the real greatest challenge for the EU...|$|E
40|$|The thesis Italy: {{economy and}} {{regional}} differentiation deals {{in the first}} place with the current problem of the state of Italian economy influenced by the global economic crisis and secondly it looks at the underdevelopment of South Italian regions. In connection with the economic crisis the thesis describes measures adopted by the Italian government in order to reduce negative effects of the crisis on the economy and employment. These measures, especially the fiscal stimulus, belonged to the lowest in Europe also by reason of the huge <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>gross</b> <b>debt.</b> The second part of the thesis looks at the problem of the regional differentiation among the regions of the North and the South of Italy. South Italian regions suffer from underdevelopment, high rate of unemployment and low rate of employment and these problems haven't been successfully solved even after many years of their existence. The unfavourable situation in South Italian regions has moreover been worsened by the unstable political situation, corruption and activities of the organised crime. These obstacles are widely spread in Italy also according to the research of the World Economic Forum. It was supposed that the underdevelopment of South Italian regions would reduce {{as a result of the}} implementation of European Structural funds. The main part of the financial resources assigned to Italy goes to the South and so it was expected that the influence in southern regions would prove to be remarkable. Unfortunately, even after expiration of three programming periods just a little positive impact on the alleviation of regional disparities in Italy was proved. The quality of implementation especially in the South is affected by irregularities and frauds and the executed projects are often ineffective.

50|$|Anatole Kaletsky was {{an early}} {{supporter}} of Abenomics, but since the Japanese government decided to raise the country's consumption tax rate to 10 percent, he expressed his concern that the tax hike could deal a more devastating blow to Japanese economy than expected. In 1997, the Japanese government raised the rate to 5 percent from 3 percent to tackle its debt of 50 percent of its GDP at that time, promising that the tax hike would be offset by income-tax reforms. But the tax hike ended up making the domestic consumption stumble, pushing the economy into recession. The country fell into a deflationary trap. Due to the country's long-running malaise, the <b>government</b> <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> reached 200 percent of its GDP despite the increase of the sales tax. The IMF forecast that the tax hike in 2014 would cut Japan's economic growth from 2.5 percent in 2013 to 1.4 percent in 2014, but Kaletsky argues that this economic downturn is underestimated.|$|R
40|$|The U. K. Whole of Government Account (WGA) {{has been}} {{conceived}} by the Treasury {{as having a}} macro-fiscal role. This WGA is about fiscal transparency at the aggregate level, rather than at a more disaggregated level with regard to public sector decision makers at tiers of government, each with their own chain of accountability. This paper analyses the U. K. conception of the WGA, examining its theoretical background and evolution since the 1995 decision to convert central government accounting from cash to accruals. The definition of the area of consolidation is governed by statute, the declared intention being to align {{as far as possible}} with the national accounts definitions that provide the basis for fiscal aggregates, thereby overriding IAS 27. Net liabilities per WGA is mapped in this paper to macro-fiscal aggregates, including public sector net debt (the U. K. preferred measure), <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> (the EU preferred measure) and public sector net worth (national accounts). Conceptually, the WGA measure is situated between net debt (against which only liquid assets are netted) and the long-term cash projections developed by the Treasury. Insights are provided into the damage inflicted on U. K. public finances by a period of over-optimism about fiscal performance and the economy's heavy exposure to the global financial crisis. Fiscal retrenchment in all countries can have a substantial illusory component, as proposals may reduce some measures of deficit and debt {{at the expense of the}} public sector balance sheet, to which the WGA draws attention. These measures may include: privatizing state assets; neglecting existing public sector assets; cutting public sector capital expenditure; substituting public–private partnerships for conventional procurement; and posting bills to the future. The U. K. WGA may also institutionalize some protection against accounting arbitrage that distorts policy choices and fiscal reporting. Well-documented reconciliations between figures derived from national accounts and from IFRS-based financial reporting are therefore imperative for fiscal transparency...|$|E

40|$|The <b>gross</b> <b>general</b> <b>government</b> debt-to-GDP ratios in many {{advanced}} economies {{have reached}} the highest levels in peacetime history and continue to grow, putting into question sovereign solvency in these economies. In case of new adverse shocks, whether economic or political, global or country-specific, which result in the deterioration of growth prospects or higher real interest rates, or both, the situation could easily get out control. Apart from the risk of sovereign default, excessive public debt might also {{have a negative impact}} on the stability of financial sector and on economic growth in the medium and long term. Debt sustainability simulations for the group of highly-indebted advanced economies - those in which the <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>gross</b> public debt-to-GDP ratio exceeded 80 percent in 2015 - suggest that benefits of the current record-low interest rates and post-crisis growth recovery should be used for fiscal consolidation.

Such corrective measures are needed in six out of seven G 7 members (Germany being the exception) and in 10 out of 19 euro-area members. The fiscal situation of Japan, where <b>gross</b> <b>debt</b> has reached 250 percent of GDP, is particularly precarious.

Of course, no matter who holds the public debt, U. S. taxpayers eventually have to fund it. The cause of the U.
