This method allows an <b>equivalent</b> <b>flow</b> curve to be extracted from squeeze data. From this <b>equivalent</b> <b>flow</b> curve, rheological properties of viscoplastic fluids {{can be directly}} identified. For this, we have calculated an instantaneous average strain rate. This average strain rate is defined {{by means of a}} dimensional analysis coupled with energy balance. Furthermore, we consider a Bingham model to describe the squeeze flow of viscoplastic fluids and specify an equivalent stress-strain state at any time. For this purpose, it is assumed that the fluids stick on both plates and the flow field is essentially extensional around the plane of symmetry. The constitutive parameters of the Bingham model are evaluated by confronting squeeze data and analytical solution of the Bingham squeeze force. In particular, we focus on the development of an algorithm which enables the construction of an <b>equivalent</b> <b>flow</b> curve with step-by-step computation. The algorithm, preliminary tested and validated on simulated data of complex fluids in sticking squeeze flow, is applied on experimental squeeze data.
