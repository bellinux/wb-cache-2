Increased wheel travel (3mm) and redesigned jounce bumpers for softer feel at full travel. Dual <b>durometer</b> cradle mounts for improved isolation. Premium valving and damping {{in the front and}} rear struts for a higher refinement in calibration. There were more accurate wheel sensors for improved ABS actuation.

30|$|Although in {{many cases}} the {{footwear}} reduced the pressure and shear force, as indicated in Table  3 and Figure  8, this was not always the case. Regarding the characteristics of the shoes, for example, as shown in Figure  8, {{there was no significant difference}} between the peak pressures for boots and barefoot. Because the weight of each of the boots was 800  g and the hardness of the heels was 80 <b>durometers,</b> the reduction in the pressure may be small. The corresponding properties for leather shoes and therapeutic shoes were 300  g and 45 <b>durometers,</b> and 500  g and 20 <b>durometers,</b> respectively. However, boots produced a significantly higher peak pressure and lower shear force than leather shoes. One possible reason for this was that the boots had shoelace whereas the leather shoes did not. Because the therapeutic shoes also had shoelace, it is considered that fixing the instep with a shoelace would be effective for reducing the shear force.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the physiological response of an in-line submaximal skate on two surfaces using two wheel types and two bearing types. The variables measured were V 0 $ sb 2 $ and HR. Ten male varsity hockey players volunteered as subjects. The subjects, after being assigned one of two wheel types with varying <b>durometers,</b> skated the submaximal test twice for each surface (concrete and asphalt) using a different type of bearing (precision and semi-precision) each time. These results were compared to a similar on-ice submaximal skating test session. Results revealed no significant difference between in-line skating with wheels of 78 and 82 Shore A <b>durometers</b> (p $<$. 05) with both V 0 $ sb 2 $ and HR as markers. A significant difference was found between in-line skating with precision and semi-precision bearings with V 0 $ sb 2 $ as a marker (p $<$. 05), however, not with HR as a marker (p = 0. 31). On-ice skating was significantly different from in-line skating on concrete and asphalt surfaces for both physiological markers. In-line skating on asphalt and concrete surfaces resulted in similar physiological responses. It was concluded that hockey players training with in-line skates obtain the same training benefits using either wheel <b>durometers,</b> but will have greater oxygen costs when training with semi-precision bearings than training with precision bearings...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, they began experimenting with the {{hardness}} {{of the plastic}} balls. The {{reason for this is}} to allow the ball to [...] "grab" [...] the lane better. Plastic balls were difficult to hook on tough oil conditions. Until the 1970s, there were no rules regarding the hardness of the bowling ball's surface. PBA member Don McCune took advantage of the non-existence of such a rule. He at the time worked for Chuck Hamilton, who invented the [...] "soaker"—a plastic (usually polyester) ball he softened [...] "in the garage" [...] with chemical solvents such as MEK, which would excrete a sticky substance, allowing the ball to hook more on oily conditions. At times, the balls were soaked {{to the point that the}} balls might even end up lopsided. Columbia—a more established manufacturer of bowling balls—came out with a series of [...] "yellow dot" [...] balls that were similar in function to the [...] "soaker". The hardness of the ball's surface came under ABC scrutiny because of the increased scoring, particularly by McCune, who with his [...] "soaker" [...] won six PBA tournaments in 1973 and PBA Player of the Year honors. The ABC established a <b>durometer</b> hardness rule of 72, which barred even some of the out-of-the-factory softer balls. The PBA took the issue even further by applying a more strict 75 hardness rule. To effectively test the hardness, the PBA required each ball to bear a 0.25-inch deep hole, just above the finger holes. The <b>durometer</b> would be inserted into the hole, allowing the meter to perform the test beneath the ball's surface.|$|E
50|$|The ASTM D2240 {{standard}} recognizes twelve different <b>durometer</b> scales using {{combinations of}} specific spring forces and indentor configurations. These scales are properly {{referred to as}} <b>durometer</b> types; i.e., a <b>durometer</b> type is specifically designed to determine a specific scale, and the scale does not exist separately from the <b>durometer.</b> The table below provides details {{for each of these}} types, with the exception of Type R.|$|E
50|$|The {{final value}} of the {{hardness}} depends on {{the depth of the}} indenter after it has been applied for 15 seconds on the material.

Tests were conducted on two commercial elastomeric seals: a "T" seal (76 mm O. D. and 3. 8 mm between backing rings) and an "O" ring (76 mm O. D. and 5. 3 mm diameter). Testing conditions included seal <b>durometers</b> of 70 and 90, sliding velocities of 0. 8, 2. 0, and 3. 6 m/s, and no pressure gradient across the seal.

Friction and oil leakage measurements were also made at these sliding speeds. The fluid used was a typical synthetic base automotive lubricant.

40|$|There is a {{continuing}} need for better fracture and impact-resistant materials in civil and military applications. This work characterizes the impact resistance and fracture toughness of several fiber-reinforced polyurethane composites.

The elastomers covered a range of <b>durometers</b> (hardness). Impact strength and specific impact strength of the composites were also compared to results from aluminum and steel specimens. For the same fiber type, all elastomer composites had greater impact strength than the epoxy composite. When specific impact energies are considered, the intermediate and rigid elastomer composite specimens have greater impact resistance than the baseline metal specimens and compared favorably with hot rolled 4140 steel. The fiberglass and intermediate hardness elastomer specimens resisted multiple Charpy impact tests with gradual loss of strength. Compact tension specimens of fiberglass using the same intermediate and rigid elastomer matrices and epoxy resin were fabricated and tested to acquire preliminary trends in fracture toughness.

5000|$|The {{top part}} of the truck is screwed to the deck and is called the {{baseplate}}, and beneath it is the hanger. The axle runs through the hanger. Between the baseplate and the hanger are bushings, also rubbers or grommets, that provide the cushion mechanism for turning the skateboard. The bushings cushion the truck when it turns. The stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the skateboard is to turning. The softer the bushings, {{the easier it is}} to turn. Bushings come in varying shapes and urethane formulas as well as <b>durometers,</b> which may affect turning, rebound and durability. A bolt called a kingpin holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be adjusted loosely for better turning and tighter for more stability (useful when landing tricks). Standard kingpin nut size is 3/8" [...] - 24tpi. The position of the hanger respect to the baseplate is also determined by the pivot, a rod that slots into the corresponding seat in the baseplate. The pivot stops the hanger from rotating around the kingpin. The pivot must allow some movement around the bushings and therefore is not a perfect fit. The space between the pivot and its seat in the baseplate is filled by a pivot cup, a plastic part that will take most of the wear and tear of the pivot and assist in centering the hanger.|$|R
40|$|Seals {{that provide}} the {{containment}} system interface between the packaging body and closure must function in high and low temperature environments, under dynamic and static loading conditions, and with different types of contained media. It {{is one of the}} most critical elements in the container since the container fails to meet regulations if the seal does not function properly. A research and testing program for seal materials was initiated at Sandia in 1988 with the goal of characterizing the behavior of seal materials commonly used in packages conditions as specified in the regulations (NRC IOCFR Part 71) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 14. 5. The performance of elastomeric seals in undeformed closures at both high and low temperatures has been investigated (Bronowski 1995). Work has begun with this program to determine the response of elastomeric seals to fast acting dynamic deformations`` in the closure. The response of elastomeric o-ring seals during closure movements due to long-term deformations has already been characterized. What has not been well characterized are short-term closure movements with durations of only a few milliseconds that result in the so called ``burp`` release. Methods for generating this type of response in a repeatable manner had not been developed and standard leak detection equipment does not have a fast enough response time to measure these transient events. One factor which affects the length of the burp is the ability of the o-ring to quickly close the gap to prevent a significant leak. The dynamic characteristics of the elastomeric o-ring material including the dynamic spring modulus and internal damping are directly related to its ability to quickly close the gap. A set of tests designed to determine the dynamic properties for various material types and <b>durometers</b> (hardness) of elastomers that were both lubricated and dry at ambient temperature were conducted...|$|R
5000|$|Harder wheels {{minimize}} elastic hysteresis energy absorption, due to skater's weight deforming {{the solid}} polyurethane [...] "tyre".

5000|$|Wheels are {{nowadays}} {{almost universally}} made of polyurethane (a kind of durable plastic). Most other plastics and rubber either wear down too quickly or {{have too much}} rolling resistance.In general, the bigger the wheel, the faster the skate. However, large wheels take more energy to start rolling. Smaller wheels allow faster acceleration, maneuverability, and a lower center of gravity. Wheel hardness is measured on the A scale (see <b>Durometer)</b> and usually ranges between 72A-93A (higher numbers are harder). Harder wheels are not necessarily faster but {{tend to be more}} durable; soft wheels may have better grip and are generally less affected by road bumps. In the 1990s, wheel rolling resistance (CRR - coefficient of rolling resistance) tended to be minimized with wheel hardness in the 78A <b>durometer</b> range, with rolling resistance dramatically increasing below 75A <b>durometer</b> and above 85A <b>durometer.</b> In the early 2000s, urethane compounds improved significantly, allowing skaters to use harder compounds to get better wheel life, and get the lowest rolling resistance in the 82A-84A <b>durometer</b> range. Wheel profiles and thicknesses again vary by application. Elliptic profiles were thought to minimize friction for a faster ride; however, they were intended to mimic the knife-like properties of an ice blade. More rounded profiles provided lower rolling resistance due to the greater [...] "belly" [...] or tire that increased resilience (or [...] "rebound"); and these wheels were perceived as having better grip and being more stable (less like an ice blade), but were heavier than elliptical-profiled wheels and were often used in downhill racing (such as the Hyper Downhill racing wheels) and in recreational skates. Another advantage of rounded profile wheels is longer wear life due to the increased amount rubber on the tire. To increase stability at high speed, skates intended for downhill skating usually have five or six wheels, in contrast with recreational skates, which typically have four wheels. [...] This advantage of more wheels having less rolling resistance has been largely negated by the 100-110mm diameter wheels with 4-wheel trucks.|$|E
