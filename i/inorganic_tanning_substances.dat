40|$|To {{improve the}} East Indian leather {{industry}} a search {{was made for}} tan barks and other tanning products, and their suitability and productivity per ha were assessed. At first (1917 - 1924) the study concentrated on tanning products already locally used, including those from mangrove forest, but considered also some promising local and exotic (some well known) products. For all species considered botanical data, geographic distribution and, where possible, information on bark production and quality, and on culture of the trees were discussed. Other topics were trade in leather and <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> in the Netherlands East Indies, trade in mangrove bark and catch and tanned hides in the Malayan Straits Settlements, leather dressing and working in the Netherlands East Indies, research on <b>tanning</b> <b>substances,</b> experiments on practical tanning and on methods of collecting bark. Finally followed the main conclusions for supply of <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> for the home industry. An appendix included {{a key to the}} tree species of mangrove forest...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is the at least {{partially}} substitution of chrom tanning agents by production of leather. This will be achieved by extracting of natural tanning agents from the roots of local species of the Polygonaceae plant familiy. The research project has been conducted in cooperation with NIG GmbH Magdeburg (processing of raw material) and FILK gGmbH (testing the tanning agents on leather). The FH Anhalt cultivates the species Rheum, Reynoutria and Rumex and examines and describes the <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> in these plants using chemical-analytical methods. Results: a growth period {{of at least two}} years is necessary for plants to develop enough biomass and tanning agents. In Reynoutria the <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> are located in leaves which are easier to harvest. The leaves can be harvested several times in the year over a period of up to ten years. The <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> were studied using HPLC and DC. The concentration of the <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> in raw material determined by calibration with <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> from Quebracho was insufficient. The combination of HPLC with other separation techniques such as HPTLC will be more efficient in developing analytical method for the on-line observation of the raw material. Further investigations involving larger quantities of extracts are necessary in order to consolidate the results obtained so far. These investigations should be extended to include the species Reynoutria and Polygonum. Further investigations should concentrate on the production and utilisation of the different pigments found in the roots of Rheum and Rumex for use in heavy metal-free dyeing of leather and textiles.

40|$|Two pupariation factors, {{anterior}} retraction factor (ARF) and puparium tanning factor (PTF), {{are absent}} from the hemolymph of larvae {{at the time of}} tanning accelerated by ARF/PTF, cyclic AMP, or dopamine. ARF and PTF are not involved in derepression of dopa decarboxylase (aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase, aromatic L-amino-acid carboxy-lyase, EC 4. 1. 1. 28) synthesis initiated by ecdysone. Tanning is entirely inhibited by injection of two transcriptional inhibitors, actinomycin and BrdUrd, and two translational inhibitors, puromycin and cycloheximide. Retraction activity is more severely inhibited by the transcriptional than by the translational inhibitors. A tanning response is initiated by cyclic AMP {{in the presence of the}} transcriptional but not the translational inhibitors. Dihydric <b>tanning</b> <b>substances</b> (dopa, dopamine) initiate tanning in the presence of both types of inhibitors. Release of ARF and PTF from the central nervous system is inhibited by the four inhibitors. ARF totally reverses the inhibitory effects on retraction, whereas PTF does not reverse inhibition of tanning. These data are interpreted to mean that PTF is concerned with the regulation of two components of the tanning response: (i) acceleration of synthesis of a particular protein (associated with the tyrosine hydroxylation complex), and (ii) activation via cyclic AMP of a component of the tyrosine hydroxylating system...|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, {{leaves of}} redoul were intensively {{collected}} for their tannin content, for tanning and dyeing purposes.During the medieval period, ecclesiastical {{institutions and the}} aristocracy clearly sought to establish some royalties on this resource, the samples are being especially on the distribution and sale of material first. These uses are due to the wealth of Coriaria spp tannin, particularly concentrated in the root and the bark of the stem, but also present in leaves, where they coexist with yellow dyes from the chemical group of flavonoids. These tannins {{are part of the}} group of hydrolyzable tannins, such as gall tannins. The chemical composition of redoul thus makes a <b>tanning</b> <b>substance,</b> capable of transforming recently flayed animal skins into leather, which is rot resistant, flexible and relatively impermeable, known as Basil leather. [...] These properties allow for its widespread use in many industries. Moreover, the well-known chemical reaction of tannins with iron salts, producing black precipitates, is the basis for the manufacture of some inks used since the Middle Ages, and is also used to dye a variety of textiles black or gray. Until the mid-fourteenth century, the material was the subject of extensive trade between the north of Catalonia and Languedoc.|$|R

5000|$|There was a Tannery about 100 years ago, {{and hides}} and skins were <b>tanned</b> from a <b>substance</b> {{obtained}} from the bark of oak trees. The oak bark was steeped in pits, built of stone and lime, and are still traceable in a yard in the village. The leather made here was used for making harness for horses as well as boots and shoes, which were made locally. There was a company of Imperial yeomanry stationed here about 150 years ago, whose principle duty seemed to be of searching for illicit spirits or poteen.

There are also emissions from electricity generation and transportation, and the end of lifecycle disposal of shoes often into landfill. The footwear industry can also be measured on its related social and health impacts. The overwhelming majority of multinationals have relied on sweatshops and exploitation to produce low-cost footwear to be competitive in the free market. In addition, the same chemicals used during manufacture that damage the environment, are causing illness to sweatshop workers. Substances known to be harmful to humans such as Benzine, Lead and Mercury, are commonplace in the footwear manufacturing factories of developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Controlled {{struvite}} formation {{has been}} attracting increasing attention as a near mature technology to recover nutrients from wastewater. However, struvite feasibility is generally {{limited by the}} high cost of chemical reagents. With the aim to understand and control reagent use efficiency, experiments and equilibrium model simulations examined <b>inorganic</b> nitrogen (<b>TAN)</b> removal from pig manure via struvite with added magnesium and phosphate reagents. Four industrial magnesium oxide (MgO), a commercial product and three by-products from magnesite calcination, were tested with phosphate added as a highly soluble potassium salt. TAN removal extents with the MgOs ranged from 47 to 72 %, with the highest grade MgO providing the greatest extent of TAN removal. However, model analysis showed that all the MgO reagents were poorly soluble (only about 40 % of added magnesium actually dissolved). The model results suggested that this poor dissolution was due to kinetic limitations, not solubility constraints. A further set of additional reagents (termed stabilization agents) were prepared by pre-treating the MgO reagents with phosphoric acid, and were tested separately as a source of both magnesium and phosphate. Results showed that acid pre-treatment of moderate to highly reactive MgOs (soft to medium-burnt) primarily formed bobierrite as the stabilizing agent, whereas the pre-treatment of very low reactivity MgOs (dead-burnt) mostly formed newberyite. The newberyite stabilizing agents achieved very high TAN removal extents of about 80 %, which is significant, considering that these were formed from dead-burnt/low-grade MgOs. However, the bobierrite stabilizing agents achieved a substantially lower TAN removal extent than their medium-to-high reactivity precursor MgOs. Again, model analysis showed that the bobierrite stabilizing agents were poorly soluble, due to kinetic limitations, not solubility constraints. In contrast, the model suggested that the newberyite stabilizing agents almost completely dissolved to very effectively form struvite. A mechanism was proposed by which conditions near a dissolving reagent particle surface causes unwanted struvite nucleation onto and overgrowth of the reagent particle, inhibiting further dissolution and markedly reducing reagent efficiency. The findings of the study could have implications for reagent efficiency with struvite in general, even when using other solid reagents such as magnesium hydroxide or other MgOs...|$|R
