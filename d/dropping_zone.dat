5000|$|Air Ministry, 13 November 1945.The KING {{has been}} graciously pleased to confer the VICTORIA CROSS on the undermentioned officer in {{recognition}} of most conspicuous bravery:—Flight Lieutenant David Samuel Anthony LORD, D.F.C. (49149), R.A.F., 271 Sqn. (deceased).Flight Lieutenant Lord was pilot and captain of a Dakota aircraft detailed to drop supplies at Arnhem {{on the afternoon of}} the 19th September, 1944. Our airborne troops had been surrounded and were being pressed into a small area defended by a large number of anti-aircraft guns. Air crews were warned that intense opposition would be met over the <b>dropping</b> <b>zone.</b> To ensure accuracy they were ordered to fly at 900 feet when dropping their containers.While flying at 1,500 feet near Arnhem the starboard wing of Flight Lieutenant Lord's aircraft was twice hit by anti-aircraft fire. The starboard engine was set on fire. He would have been justified in leaving the main stream of supply aircraft and continuing at the same height or even abandoning his aircraft. But on learning that his crew were uninjured and that the <b>dropping</b> <b>zone</b> would be reached in three minutes he said he would complete his mission, as the troops were in dire need of supplies.By now the starboard engine was burning furiously. Flight Lieutenant Lord came down to 900 feet, where he was singled out for the concentrated fire of all the anti-aircraft guns. On reaching the <b>dropping</b> <b>zone</b> he kept the aircraft on a straight, and level course while supplies were dropped. At the end of the run, he was told that two containers remained.Although he must have known that the collapse of the starboard wing could not be long delayed, Flight Lieutenant Lord circled, rejoined the stream of aircraft and made a second run to drop the remaining supplies. These manoeuvres took eight minutes in all, the aircraft being continuously under heavy anti-aircraft fire.His task completed, Flight Lieutenant Lord ordered his crew to abandon the Dakota, making no attempt himself to leave the aircraft, which was down to 500 feet. A few seconds later, the starboard wing collapsed and the aircraft fell in flames. There was only one survivor, who was flung out while assisting other members of the crew to put on their parachutes.By continuing his mission in a damaged and burning aircraft, descending to drop the supplies accurately, returning to the <b>dropping</b> <b>zone</b> a second time and, finally, remaining at the controls to give his crew a chance of escape, Flight Lieutenant Lord displayed supreme valour and self-sacrifice.|$|E

50|$|In 1942, during World War II, a three runway airfield, RAF Beaulieu, {{was built}} on the {{opposite}} side of the road. It was used by both the Royal Air Force and then later by the United States Army Air Forces. After the war, the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment (AFEE) came to RAF Beaulieu, and used the former airfield as a parachute <b>dropping</b> <b>zone</b> until September 1950. The site was then neglected and the Air Ministry relinquished control of the land in 1959. Today model aircraft are flown on the site on a regular basis.|$|E

50|$|On 4 January 1945, {{the whole}} of the AFEE was {{relocated}} to RAF Beaulieu, that had been vacated by USAAF bomber units. It joined an existing detachment there of its A Flight, and AFEE came under control of RAF No. 43 Group. The adjacent former airfield at East Boldre was used as a <b>dropping</b> <b>zone.</b> Activities included specialist training of pilots for helicopters and gliders. Types tested included gliders AW.52, GAL.55, GAL.56, GAL.61, Waco CG-13, plus helicopters Bristol 171, Cierva W.14 Skeeter, Cierva Air Horse, Sikorsky Hoverfly. Additional support aircraft included Boston, Cierva C.40, Curtiss Commando, Dragonfly, Harvard, Hastings, Lancaster, Valetta.|$|E
50|$|Training using live {{ammunition}} {{was carried out}} on drogue targets (similar to a windsock), towed behind a target tug, most commonly Miles Masters or Westland Lysanders. Hawker Henleys were also used briefly at the School - see link for photograph of a drogue. The CGS operated its own Target Towing Flight. The ammunition of various Spitfires was painted in different colours, for example, blue green and red. Three Spitfires made attacks on one drogue, after which the target-towing aircraft dropped the drogue at a <b>dropping</b> <b>zone</b> near the airfield; it would then stream another drogue in readiness for another three pilots to make their attacks. By subsequent examination of the colour of the paint around {{the holes in the}} drogue, percentage hit rates of individual pilots could be assessed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next stage}} of the course {{consists}} of a parachute descent from a balloon at the <b>dropping</b> <b>zone</b> at Weston-on-the-Green. This is carried out from a height of 800ft (244m) in {{what is known as}} [...] "clean fatigue" [...] - without equipment. Subsequently trainees carry out their first descent from a C-130 Hercules in single 'sticks' of six without equipment from one door of the aircraft. Their second descent is again in 'clean fatigue', in single 'sticks' of eight or ten. Trainees then make their third descent, jumping in simultaneous 'sticks' of six from both sides of a Hercules. This is followed by a night descent without equipment. Thereafter, descents are made with equipment, initially in a single 'stick' of six, subsequently in simultaneous 'sticks' of eight or ten and finally in the maximum size of 'stick' possible, depending upon the number of personnel on the course.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} cold model study, replicating an ironmaking {{blast furnace}} <b>dropping</b> <b>zone,</b> {{was carried out}} to estimate quantitatively the local dynamic, static, and total liquid holdups {{in the presence of}} lateral gas flow. Plastic beads were used as nonwetting packing material, and aqueous barium chloride solution was used to model the liquid flow. The X-ray visualization technique was used to image the entire packed bed followed by preliminary image processing operations in order to obtain the various types of liquid holdup values quantitatively at various locations in the bed. Liquid holdups were estimated at various liquid flow rates. Liquid holdup results have been obtained at local and total bed level and are discussed both in qualitative and quantitative ways. Substantial liquid holdup was found above the raceway zone. Liquid holdup in a few regions in the bed was an order of magnitude higher than average at a particular flow rate. This may have important implications with respect to blast furnace modeling/chemistry...|$|E
