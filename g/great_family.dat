5|$|Following {{the death}} of Phokas, the {{rebellion}} collapsed, and Xiphias was arrested and forced to become a monk. Released from the threat to his rear, Basil II swiftly and decisively defeated George I, and imposed his terms on him. The other supporters of the uprising were imprisoned and released in 1025, after {{the death of}} Basil II and the succession of his younger brother, Constantine VIII. In 1026, however, Constantine VIII accused the last surviving member of the once <b>great</b> <b>family,</b> Bardas Phokas (possibly a son or nephew of Nikephoros Barytrachelos), of plotting against the throne, and had him blinded.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{there were}} then some 50-60 {{influential}} and very wealthy families and with <b>great</b> <b>family</b> history, sometimes with Prince titles. However, those families {{did not have}} same impact {{on the politics of}} the Commonwealth, still being considered as Magnats of the Commonwealth. Among them there are most magnificent families like Lanckoronski, Tarnowski, Tęczyński, Prince Holszanski, Rzewuski, Gonzaga-Myszkowski or Prince Czertwertynski.|$|E

25|$|The {{reduction}} of {{power of the}} great families helped to improve the empire. This was because previously, each <b>great</b> <b>family</b> ruled {{a large chunk of}} land and each had their own king. The name Shahanshah, meaning King of Kings, derived from {{the fact that there were}} many feudal kings in Sasanian Persia with the Shahanshah as the ruler of them all. Their fall from power meant their control was redirected to the central government and all taxes now came to the central government rather than to the local nobility.|$|E
25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors {{to take care of}} their comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to us, who have known them, to all of us here who are their <b>great</b> <b>family,</b> to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be above our dead, when we have left, as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E

She says: [...] "I am blessed with a <b>great</b> <b>family</b> and great people around me that would be able to kick me in the shins if I ever for one minute got lost up in the clouds. I've been really lucky in that sense." [...] During the production of The Amazing Spider-Man in 2010, Stone dated co-star Andrew Garfield. The nature of their relationship was well-documented by the media, with frequent speculation about an impending engagement or a break-up. The couple refused to talk about it publicly, though they made several appearances together. In 2015, they were reported to have broken up.|$|E
500|$|During the {{broadcast}} run of The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., TV Guide featured a positive {{review of the}} show in its Couch Critic column and wrote, [...] "It's as funny as it is exciting, which {{is not an easy}} combo to pull off... it's fresh and funny and different, and that's why we like it." [...] The magazine twice listed Brisco as a family-friendly TV program: [...] "Back when some of us grew up, Westerns were synonymous with <b>great</b> <b>family</b> entertainment, but– let's be honest– some of them were dull as dust. Not this one. Brisco is a Western with a sense of humor, filled with impish action for kids and adults." ...|$|E

Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode 7.5/10 and said: [...] "While it featured more than [...] {{a couple of}} genuinely unfunny ideas, this episode succeeds for the most part. [...] While this episode definitely won't make anyone's top ten list of <b>great</b> <b>Family</b> Guy, there was a much better balance between random humor and storytelling in this outing". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, and said that Family Guy [...] "started things out {{on the wrong foot}} with an oh-so-relevant Jackass storyline. [...] Most of the Jackass stuff was way too stale–Peter jackknifing Quagmire into the crate of bees notwithstanding–but thankfully it was just setup for a far superior storyline, the introduction of a younger 'New Brian'".|$|E

500|$|During {{her teenage}} years, Sevigny became rebellious: [...] "I was very well-mannered, {{and my mother}} was very strict. But I did hang out at the Mobil station and smoke cigarettes." [...] Between her junior and senior year of high school, she shaved her head and sold her hair to a Broadway wigmaker. She openly {{admitted}} to using drugs as a teenager, especially hallucinogens. She has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had [...] "to stop if she had bad trips". Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a <b>great</b> <b>family</b> life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager". Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: [...] "Mostly I sewed. I had nothing better to do, so I made my own clothes." ...|$|E
500|$|For Japan, the {{war began}} with the {{undeclared}} war and invasion of China in 1937, which the Japanese authorities called [...] "The China Incident". The government dispatched a [...] "pen brigade" [...] to write and film the action in China with [...] "humanist values". Tomotaka Tasaka's Mud and Soldiers (1939) for instance, shot on location in China, Kōzaburō Yoshimura's Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi, and Sato Takeshi's Chocolate and Soldiers (1938) show the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, and even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes fighting bravely. Once war with the United States was declared, the Japanese conflict {{became known as the}} Pacific War. Japanese film critics worried that even with Western film techniques, their film output failed to represent native Japanese values. The historian John Dower found that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as [...] "losers do not get reruns", yet they were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought Chocolate and Soldiers unbeatable. Heroes were typically low-ranking officers, not samurai, calmly devoted to his men and his country. These films did not personalise the enemy and therefore lacked hatred, though Great Britain could figure as the [...] "cultural enemy". For Japanese film-makers, war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and [...] "what mattered was not whom one fought but how well". Asian enemies, especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but present the Japanese state as one <b>great</b> <b>family</b> and the Japanese people as an [...] "innocent, suffering, self-sacrificing people". Dower comments that the perversity of this image [...] "is obvious: it is devoid of any recognition that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others." ...|$|E
500|$|Mic {{organized}} {{a list of}} [...] "5 Reasons Claire Huxatable (sic) is the Ultimate Feminist Mom", and The Huffington Post crowned The Cosby Show [...] "One of the Most Feminist Shows of All Time" [...] due to individual contributions from both Clair and Cliff. Dubbed the [...] "feminist rant" [...] by media publications, Clair's speech to future son-in-law Elvin about gender roles in marriage in the episode [...] "Cliff in Love" [...] is often lauded {{as one of the}} character's greatest moments, to which the studio audience responded with enthusiastic applause. CNN ranked the rant their seventh favorite The Cosby Show moment. Slates Jason Bailey hailed the scene as [...] "Rashad’s finest moment on the show." [...] The rant has proven so popular that it continues to be frequently quoted and referenced on the Internet and social media. Pastes Shannon M. Houston believes that [...] "If you’re a woman, and you work, and you identify as a feminist, there’s a 90 percent chance you or someone you know has posted that clip". Additionally, Houston believes that the scene remains so popular because the discussion about women in the workplace has hardly changed since the episode first aired 30 years ago. According to Nico Lang of The Daily Dot, Clair taught an entire generation [...] "what a strong, successful woman looked like". Former United States First Lady Michelle Obama has constantly been compared to Clair, by which Obama admitted she is flattered because she considers the character to be an [...] "American icon". Patrice Evans of Jezebel wrote that although [...] "Michelle Obama might be taking the baton as the quintessential symbol of the professional black woman/doting mother ... she'll still need Barack to win a second term before she can approach the status of Clair Huxtable." [...] However, Rashad herself has discredited the Clair-Obama comparisons. LGBT rights activist Janet Mock cites Clair as one of her biggest influences: [...] "I wanted to be her; I wanted to be beautiful, be successful, and maybe have a <b>great</b> <b>family</b> and a brownstone in Brooklyn." ...|$|E
