5|$|The {{police had}} only two clues: some {{footprints}} in the garden, and a <b>hat</b> <b>that</b> they found in a nearby gutter. The police took moulds of the footprints and endeavored to trace the hat, but with no success. However, during routine questioning of local residents, police learned that earlier in {{the afternoon of the}} murder, a man had been seen sitting with a heavily-pregnant young woman on a bench at one end of South Cliff Avenue; the man had also been seen wandering the street while the young woman sat on the bench alone, leading police to suspect that the man was assessing the lay of the land.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive <b>hat</b> <b>that</b> might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E

25|$|The creators {{claimed they}} based Raiden's {{character}} design on The Three Storms, Lo Pan's three servants {{from the film}} Big Trouble in Little China. The third storm, Lightning, exhibited the ability to ride and control lightning, and wore a <b>hat</b> <b>that</b> closely resembles Raiden's conical hat. In an interview featured in Deception, Ed Boon said that the <b>hat</b> <b>that</b> actor Carlos Pesina wore to portray the character in the earlier Mortal Kombat games was ruined {{as a result of}} Pesina repeatedly performing falls during production. In Mortal Kombat and , it states that Raiden is seven feet tall but his sprite was the same height as the other fighters. His coolie hat is his most recognizable feature, and he occasionally wields a quarterstaff that holds the power of thunder and lightning. The Chinese character for thunder, 雷, is visible on most of his costumes. A saya (katana scabbard) appears on Raiden's secondary costumes in Deadly Alliance, Deception, and Armageddon, but he is never seen actually using the sword. Raiden has electricity pulsating across his body in Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat 4, and Deadly Alliance. He has glowing white (occasionally blue) eyes, which glow red in Deception and Armageddon.|$|E

25|$|Military {{historian}} Richard Holmes {{remarked that}} Wellesley's experiences in India {{had an important}} influence on his personality and military tactics, teaching him much about military matters that would prove vital to his success in the Peninsular War. These included {{a strong sense of}} discipline through drill and order, the use of diplomacy to gain allies, and the vital necessity for a secure supply line. He also established a high regard for the acquisition of intelligence through scouts and spies. His personal tastes also developed, including dressing himself in white trousers, a dark tunic, with Hessian boots and black cocked <b>hat</b> (<b>that</b> later became synonymous as his style).|$|E

Lower-level riders may use a derby, hunting cap, or ASTM/SEI-approved Equestrian helmet. In the United States, junior riders and riders through Fourth Level at recognized competitions are required to wear an ASTM/SEI approved helmet to protect against head trauma {{in the event of}} a fall.

During the funeral, {{she kept her}} composure, {{but at the end}} of the service, she ran from the church clutching her son's top <b>hat</b> <b>that</b> been atop the coffin and collapsed in her carriage sobbing. Two years later, according to her daughter, Grand Duchess Olga, she arranged Olga's disastrous marriage to Peter, Duke of Oldenburg. For years Nicholas refused to grant his unhappy sister a divorce, only relenting in 1916 in the midst of the War. When Olga attempted to contract a morganatic marriage with Nikolai Kulikovsky, Maria Feodorovna and the tsar tried to dissuade her, yet, they did not protest too vehemently. Indeed, Maria Feodorovna was one of the few people who attended the wedding in November 1916. In 1912, Maria faced trouble with her youngest son, when he secretly married his mistress, much to the outrage and scandal of both Maria Feodorovna and Nicholas.|$|E
25|$|During this time, however, {{change was}} {{happening}} to the Scots Greys. Through a series of changes in uniform and equipment, the regiment began to be identified more as cavalry, rather than as mounted infantry. Drummers, an instrument of the infantry, were replaced with trumpeters, as was standard for cavalry regiments, in 1766. Two years later, the Scot Greys traded in their mitre-style grenadier cap for the tall bearskin <b>hat</b> <b>that</b> would remain {{a part of the}} regiment's uniform until its amalgamation in 1971. During this period, the Scots Greys also underwent an organizational change. Although deemed to be a heavy dragoon unit, each troop of the regiment was reorganised to include a detachment of light dragoons. These light dragoons were mounted on lighter, faster horses {{than the rest of the}} regiment. However, this increase in strength was soon lost, as the light troops of Scots Greys and other heavy dragoon regiments of the British Army were combined to form a new regiment, the 21st (Douglas's) Light Dragoons, in 1779.|$|E

500|$|In April 2010, Harrison Ford {{was cast}} {{alongside}} Craig. Favreau had cast Craig and Ford {{in the film}} because they were actors who suited the action-adventure roles so the characters would be less seen as comedic.

Before Cowboys & Aliens, Ford had previously acted in the Western films A Time for Killing in 1967, Journey to Shiloh in 1969 and The Frisco Kid in 1979. While Ford {{is well known for}} playing Indiana Jones, the filmmakers wanted to avoid giving him a cowboy <b>hat</b> <b>that</b> would remind audiences too much of Jones.

[...] The king replied, he remembered he had such a nobleman, and believed the privilege he asserted to be his right, and giving him his hand to kiss, his lordship paid his obeisance, and remained covered.|$|E
