5000|$|Canvas {{has become}} the most common support medium for oil painting, {{replacing}} wooden panels. It was used from the 14th century in Italy, but only rarely. One of the earliest surviving oils on canvas is a French Madonna with angels from around 1410 in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. Its use in Saint George and the Dragon by Paolo Uccello in about 1470, and Sandro Botticelli's Birth of Venus in the 1480s was still unusual for the period. Large paintings for country houses were apparently more likely to be on canvas, and are perhaps less likely to have survived. It was a good deal cheaper than a panel painting, and may sometime indicate a painting regarded as less important. In the Uccello, the armour does not use silver leaf, as other of his paintings do (and the colour therefore remains undegraded). [...] Another common category of paintings on lighter cloth such as linen was in distemper or glue, often used for banners to be carried in processsion. This is a less durable medium, and surviving examples such as Dirk Bouts' Entombment, in distemper on linen (1450s, National Gallery) are rare, and often rather <b>faded</b> <b>in</b> <b>appearance.</b>|$|R

50|$|The term {{is found}} in {{reference}} to plumage colouring in the bird species names isabelline bush-hen, isabelline wheatear, and isabelline shrike, {{as well as in}} descriptions of birds. The genetic pigmentation disorder isabellinism seen in birds is derived from the colour word and is a form of leucism caused by a uniform reduction in the production and expression of melanin resulting in areas of plumage {{on the back of the}} bird, normally black, being strongly <b>faded,</b> or isabelline, <b>in</b> <b>appearance.</b> Isabellinism has been reported in several species of penguin.|$|R
50|$|Iris flavescens, {{also known}} as the lemonyellow iris, is a species of Iris that has {{distichous}} leaves and pale yellow flowers.

40|$|A general {{mathematical}} model to study capacity <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> lithium ion batteries is developed. The model {{assumes that the}} formation of the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer is the primary reason behind the capacity <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> lithium ion batteries. Previous models have assumed that either the solvent or the lithium {{plays a key role in}} the film formation reaction which drives the capacity <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> lithium ion batteries. The current model postulates that the solvent species and lithium ions could play a limiting role <b>in</b> the capacity <b>fade</b> <b>in</b> a lithium ion battery. The model studies the concentration profiles of the solvent species and lithium ions at the electrode/film interphase as a function of diffusion and migration parameters. Model predictions are found to fit experimental data very well...|$|R

30|$|Concerning {{multipath}} <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> dynamic scenarios, {{one should}} use Nakagami distribution {{as it can}} represent all cases; a nearly Rice <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> the CP channel and Rayleigh <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> the XP channel is observed. For the CP channel, values of the shape parameter between 1.2 and 1.3 are suitable for the QLoS and NLoS cases, whereas the value for the LoS case can significantly differ between quasi- and true-dynamic scenarios, i.e. between 4.3 for the former and 19 for the latter. For the XP channel, values between 0.9 and 1.2 could be suitable for the shape parameter in either propagation conditions or user dynamics. Similarly, the subtle differences observed between corresponding values of the scale parameter suggest that values 1.6 and 1.9 will in general provide a satisfactory representation of the multipath <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> this channel.|$|R
