25|$|There are {{two other}} common misconceptions {{concerning}} the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule.</b> The first is that hearsay applies only to oral statements. The <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule</b> applies to all out-of-court statements whether oral, written or otherwise. The Federal Rules of Evidence defines a statement as an oral or written assertion or nonverbal conduct of a person, if the conduct is intended by the person as an assertion. Even written documents made under oath, such as affidavits or notarized statements, {{are subject to the}} 'hearsay rule'.|$|E
25|$|Previously, the Criminal Justice Act 1988 {{carved out}} {{exceptions}} to the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule</b> for unavailable witnesses and business documents. These were consolidated into the 2003 Act.|$|E
25|$|One major {{misconception}} {{about the}} <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule</b> is that hearsay is never admissible in court. While {{the general rule}} is that such evidence is inadmissible, there are many exceptions.|$|E
25|$|There {{was some}} {{statutory}} {{reform in the}} nineteenth century (see Bankers' Books Evidence Act 1879), and later the Evidence Act 1938 made some further if cautious reforms. The state of the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rules</b> were regarded as 'absurd' by Lord Reid and Lord Diplock.|$|R
40|$|Many systems {{publications}} and courses refer to <b>hearsay</b> <b>rules</b> of thumb which supposedly simplify the complex procedure of designing data processing files; consequently, these rules {{are widely used}} in practice.

"When section 114 {{and section}} 118 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 are read {{together}} they, in our judgment, abolish {{the common law}} <b>hearsay</b> <b>rules</b> (save those which are expressly preserved) and create instead a new <b>rule</b> against <b>hearsay</b> which does not extend to implied assertions. What was said by the callers in Kearley [...] would now be admissible as direct evidence {{of the fact that}} there was a ready market for the supply of drugs from the premises, from which could be inferred an intention by an occupier to supply drugs. The view of the majority in Kearley, in relation to hearsay, has been set aside by the Act." ...|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, even in common-law systems, the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule</b> only {{applies to}} actual trials. Hearsay is {{admissible}} as evidence in many other judicial proceedings, such as grand jury deliberations, probation hearings, parole revocation hearings, and proceedings before administrative bodies.|$|E
25|$|Some {{statements}} {{are defined as}} hearsay, but may nevertheless be admissible as evidence in court. These statements relate to exceptions to the general rule on hearsay. Some (but not all) exceptions to the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule</b> apply only when the declarant is unavailable for testimony at the trial or hearing.|$|E
25|$|This, of course, is {{not always}} true. Patients do {{sometimes}} lie to their doctors (to get painkillers {{to which they are}} not entitled, for example). Hearsay exceptions do not mandate that a trier of fact (the jury or, in non-jury trials, the judge) accept the hearsay statement as being true. Hearsay exceptions mean only that the trier of fact will be informed of the hearsay statement and will be allowed to consider it when deciding on a verdict in the case. The jury is free to disregard a hearsay statement if the jury does not believe it. The <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule</b> controls only what out-of-court statements a trier of fact gets to consider in deciding a case, not how they consider the out-of-court statements.|$|E

40|$|How well do <b>hearsay</b> <b>rules</b> {{function}} {{under the}} current Federal Rules of Evidence? One issue, dormant yet pulsating beneath the surface for decades, involves the admissibility of prior inconsistent statements by witnesses. The long-standing “orthodox” rule admitted the prior statement only to impeach the witness’s trial testimony; {{it could not be}} used as substantive evidence of the facts asserted. In 1972, the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence (“the Advisory Committee” or “the Committee”) proposed an innovative rule permitting all prior inconsistent statements to be used both for impeachment and as substantive evidence—a sea change in practice. Congress, however, torpedoed the proposal for reasons that rang hollow in the mid- 1970 s and which remain so today. Experience has proven the Committee’s wisdom...|$|R
5000|$|Pro se litigants who {{represent}} themselves, unlike lawyers, must ask a court clerk to officially issue them subpoena forms {{when they need}} to call witnesses by phone or in person, or {{when they need to}} officially request documents to be sent to them and/or directly to court. Any documents that have not been subpoenaed to court or verified by a witness may be dismissed by the opposite party as hearsay, unless excepted by <b>hearsay</b> <b>rules</b> or permitted by the judge. If the witness is called via long-distance phone call, then the requesting party is responsible for initiating the call and providing a payment with a prepaid phone card. Most states (including California) have further restrictions on subpoena use in criminal cases.|$|R

2500|$|The Criminal Justice Act 2003 ("2003 Act"), {{which went}} into force on 4 April 2005, {{introduced}} significant reforms to the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule,</b> implementing (with modifications) the {{report by the}} Law Commission in [...] (LC245), published on 19 June 1997.|$|E
2500|$|The theory {{underlying}} this [...] "exemption" [...] {{is derived}} from the nature of the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule</b> itself. The <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule</b> operates to exclude extrajudicial assertions as untrustworthy because they cannot be tested by cross-examination. When an assertion is offered into evidence against the defendant and the defendant objects, [...] "hearsay", the defendant is in essence saying [...] "I object to this statement as untrustworthy because I am not afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the person who made it. How can we trust what he said?" [...] But what if the defendant is the person who made the statement that is now being offered against him? To object, [...] "hearsay" [...] in this circumstance would be as absurd as to argue, [...] "This statement is unreliable because I cannot cross-examine myself; therefore, how can I trust what I said?" [...] In this situation the objection of the <b>Hearsay</b> <b>rule</b> falls away, because the very basis of the rule is lacking, viz. the need and prudence of affording an opportunity of cross-examination. Another {{way of looking at it}} is that a defendant who faces his own statement being used against him has an opportunity to cross-examine himself – he can take the witness stand and explain his prior assertion, so the rule is satisfied.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 Gibbs was {{appointed}} to the Federal Court of Bankruptcy and the ACT Supreme Court. He {{was appointed}} as a judge at a relatively early age of 44 due to his reputation at the bar. During his service, he was appointed as a Royal Commissioner in the National Hotel Royal Commission following allegations that the Hotel was the centre of a network of vice including a call girl ring with support of senior members of the Queensland Police Force. Gibbs found that the allegations were not correct. Critics such as Evan Whitton and Richard Ackland claim that Gibbs inappropriately followed the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rules,</b> excluding a great deal of evidence despite the fact that Royal Commissioners are not bound to follow such rules. He also chaired a committee of inquiry into the expansion of the Australian sugar industry.|$|R
40|$|The {{intricate}} {{legal framework}} governing {{the admission of}} out-of-court statements in American trials is premised on increasingly outdated communication norms. Nowhere is this more apparent than with the hearsay exception for “present sense impressions. ” Changing communication practices typified by interactions on social media websites like Facebook and Twitter herald {{the arrival of a}} previously uncontemplated—and uniquely unreliable—breed of present sense impressions. This Article contends that the indiscriminate admission of these electronic present sense impressions (e-PSIs) is both normatively undesirable and inconsistent with the traditional rationale for the present sense impression exception. It proposes a reform to the exception that would exclude unreliable e-PSIs while simultaneously realigning the modern rule with its historical rationale. In so doing, this Article sounds an early warning to courts and legislators regarding similar challenges on the horizon, as modern communication norms continue to evolve beyond the contemplation of the drafters of the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rules...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} post-Crawford Minnesota cases (presented below) {{suggests}} that Minnesota Supreme Court {{does not share}} Justice Scalia’s zeal for the confrontation right. Its response to the Crawford revolution has been unenthusiastic, even intransigent. The same moral and political forces that led Minnesota courts to bend the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rules</b> {{in the first place}} now lead them to bend the Crawford rule. Minnesota’s resistance has already produced substantial conflict between state and federal courts. In the few years since Crawford, the United States Supreme Court has already overruled two key Minnesota post-Crawford rulings. The Minnesota Supreme Court responded by finding other grounds to reach the same result or distinguishing away the holdings of the United States Supreme Court. Finally, the simmering conflict reached a boiling point when one defendant named Orlando Bobadilla, after being rebuffed by Minnesota state courts, sought federal habeas relief. Federal district Judge Patrick Schiltz ruled that Minnesota’s application of Crawford was not simply wrong, but objectively unreasonable...|$|R
2500|$|In some jurisdictions, such as Canada, {{the limited}} {{exceptions}} format {{to the rule}} {{have been replaced by}} a more general theory of exceptions to the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule</b> that allows courts to decide when documents, testimony or other evidentiary proof can be used that might not otherwise be considered.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{rejected}} Massachusetts' {{claim that}} the forensic affidavits met the business records exception to the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule.</b> [...] A business document will be inadmissible under the exception when [...] "calculated for use essentially in the court, not in the business." [...] The Court analyzed the narrow exception of a clerk certificate authenticating official records. [...] This certificate was limited in that it could only claim {{the authenticity of the}} record as official, but speak nothing of its contents. [...] The Court drew a distinction between this exception and the case before it. [...] The forensic analyst was creating a record whereas the clerk was authenticating a record already in existence. [...] Finally, it explained the relationship between the Confrontation Clause and the Business Records Exception. [...] Citing Crawford, the court stated that most business records will escape Sixth Amendment scrutiny not because they meet the exception to the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule,</b> but because they are non-testimonial in nature. [...] A record prepared in the ordinary course of business will necessarily not have been created for the purpose of proving a fact at trial.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are some}} older cases which threw the rigidities of the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule</b> into sharp relief. In Sparks v R [...] an American airman {{was accused of}} indecently assaulting a girl just {{under the age of}} four. Evidence that the four-year-old victim (who did not give {{evidence}} herself) had told her mother [...] "it was a coloured boy" [...] was held not to be admissible (not being res gestae either) against the defendant, who was white.|$|E
40|$|To be {{admissible}} {{under the}} <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule's</b> business records exception {{set out in}} Federal Rule of Evidence 803 (6), the record in question must have been “kept in the ordinary course of a regularly conducted business activity. ” Many electronic records, however, remain in a company's files only because the company had a duty to preserve them once it reasonably anticipated litigation or a government subpoena. The company otherwise typically would have deleted those electronically stored data in the regular operation of its business to make room on its burdened servers. This Article argues that such presumptive deletion undermines the trustworthiness and reliability of a business record, and thus the rationale of Rule 803 (6). Courts should therefore focus on the unique elements of the creation and preservation of electronic evidence, and consider whether a company truly kept the record at issue {{in the course of}} business, or simply because a duty to preserve required it...|$|R
40|$|This Article exposes {{internal}} {{contradictions in}} case law concerning {{the use and}} admissibility of film as evidence. Based on a review of more than ninety state and federal cases dating from 1923 to the present, the Article explains how the source of these contradictions is the frequent miscategorization of film as 2 ̆ 2 demonstrative evidence 2 ̆ 2 that purports to illustrate other evidence, rather than to be directly probative of some fact at issue. The Article further demonstrates how these contradictions are based on two venerable jurisprudential anxieties. One is the concern about the growing trend toward replacing the traditional testimony of live witnesses in court with communications via video and film technology. Another anxiety is the public perception of the trial itself as undisciplined and capricious rather than as controlled and truth-establishing. The Article concludes by showing that these anxieties are not well-founded because, when filmic proffers are properly considered, they are admitted as substantive and testimonial evidence. As a result, they are (or should be) subject to <b>hearsay</b> <b>rules</b> and cross-examination and to other rules intended to safeguard {{the integrity of the}} trial...|$|R

2500|$|The {{reasoning}} {{behind the}} <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule</b> {{can be seen}} by comparing the acceptance of direct evidence and hearsay. Direct evidence is given under oath (with potential criminal liability for perjury if the testimony is subsequently proven false), {{in the presence of the}} court and jury, and may be cross-examined. [...] In adducing direct evidence (that is, recollection of a witness in court) the court considers how the witness would have perceived the event at the time, potential ambiguities, and the witness's sincerity. These can be tested in cross-examination.|$|E
2500|$|This {{decision}} had an immediate, profound effect upon {{the ability of}} prosecutors to prove their cases {{through the use of}} evidence that had previously been admissible via various exceptions to the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule.</b> Justice Scalia's opinion explicitly states that any out-of-court statement that is [...] "testimonial" [...] in nature is not admissible, unless the declarant is unavailable to testify in court, and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him or her. However, the opinion does not define [...] "testimonial", which has allowed courts across the country to determine that issue for themselves.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>rules</b> of <b>hearsay</b> {{began to}} form {{properly}} {{in the late}} seventeenth century and had become fully established by the early nineteenth century. The issues were analysed in substantial detail in Wright v Doe d Tatham. The technical nature of the discussion in Doe d Tatham inhibited much reasoned progress of the law, whose progress (in the form of judicial capacity to reform it) ended not long afterwards. Later attempts to reform through the common law it got little further, with Lord Reid in Myers v DPP saying If we are to extend the law it must be by the development and application of fundamental principles. We cannot introduce arbitrary conditions or limitations; that must be left to legislation: {{and if we do}} in effect change the law, we ought in my opinion only to do that in cases where our decision will produce some finality or certainty. If we disregard technicalities in this case and seek to apply principle and common sense, {{there are a number of}} parts of the existing law of hearsay susceptible of similar treatment, ... The only satisfactory solution is by legislation following on a wide survey of the whole field ... A policy of make do and mend is not appropriate. There was some statutory reform in the nineteenth century (see Bankers' Books Evidence Act 1879), and later the Evidence Act 1938 made some further if cautious reforms.

50|$|Special Prosecutor Robert Jambois {{contended that}} Mark Jensen {{poisoned}} his wife Julie, then 40, with ethylene glycol (antifreeze) and then suffocated her inside the garage {{of their home}} in Pleasant Prairie on December 3, 1998. The trial was moved from Kenosha County to Walworth County in response to pre-trial publicity. defense counsel Craig Albee argued that Julie Jensen was a depressed woman who killed herself and framed her husband. Moreover, the deceased had seen a therapist {{at least three times}} for depression and was aware of her husband's extramarital affair with a co-worker, Kelly LaBonte Grieman whom Mark Jensen later married, and who assumed custody of the Jensens' two sons after Mark's eventual imprisonment. Evidence was introduced showing that Mark Jensen had discussed poisoning his wife with co-workers and a jailhouse associate, as well as searching on the internet for information relating to spousal murder and poisoning techniques. The prosecution contended further that Jensen remained angry over his wife's brief affair in 1991 with co-worker Perry Tarica. The letter's use by the prosecutors was controversial, because such evidence has been blocked from court for years by strict <b>hearsay</b> <b>rules</b> based on criminal defendants' right, under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to confront their accusers. But the Wisconsin Supreme Court, guided by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling (Crawford v Washington 541 U.S. 36 (2004)), created a hearsay exception that permitted the use of Julie Jensen's letter and statements as a dying declaration — that is, evidence of her state of mind {{at the time of her}} death. The letter was the critical factor in the trial that ended on February 22, 2008. The jury found Jensen, 48, guilty of his wife's murder after more than 30 hours of deliberations. He was sentenced by Kenosha County Circuit Court Judge Bruce Schroeder on February 27, 2008 to life in prison with no chance of parole.|$|R
2500|$|Legal scholars' main {{criticism}} of the decision was its failure to define [...] "testimonial".

This was the factual situation in Davis v. Washington, in which the Court laid out a definition of [...] "testimonial."

The officer is being asked to testify to what Monica said to prove that John attempted to murder Monica. Unless the attorney can show that this statement falls within an exception to the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule,</b> the factfinder (the judge or jury) may not consider Monica's statement (this particular statement, however, would likely be admissible because of [...] "Excited Utterance" [...] and [...] "Present sense impression" [...] exceptions).|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{noted that}} the Confrontation Clause creates two kinds of witnesses: those whom the {{prosecution}} is obligated to call, and those whom the defense has the discretion to call. [...] The Court rejected {{the argument that the}} analyst was not a conventional witness because he or she recorded the immediate results of a chemical test rather than recalled a historical event. [...] Even though evidence may be so contemporaneous that it meets the present sense impression exception to the <b>hearsay</b> <b>rule,</b> it may nevertheless be a violation of the Confrontation Clause. [...] The Court referred to the companion case to Davis v.

40|$|One of {{the central}} protections of our system of {{criminal}} justice is {{the right of the}} accused in all criminal prosecutions 2 ̆ 2 to be confronted with the witnesses against him. 2 ̆ 2 It provides assurance that prosecution witnesses will give their testimony in the way demanded for centuries by Anglo-American courts-in the presence of the accused, subject to cross-examination- rather than in any other way. Witnesses may not, for example, testify by speaking privately to governmental agents in a police station or in their living rooms. Since shortly after it was adopted, however, the confrontation right became obscured by the ascendance of a broader, but much weaker doctrine, the <b>rule</b> against <b>hearsay.</b> That <b>rule</b> is not limited to testimony-it applies to any out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of an assertion that it makes-but it has never been absolute.
