5|$|Concussions are {{particularly}} concerning, as repeated concussions may increase a person's risk {{in later life}} for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, impact against the ground or other players' <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> upper-body contact between opposing players. However, helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures. Cervical spine injuries can be catastrophic, but have sharply declined since the mid-1970s due to rule changes and improved workout regimes, equipment, and coaching.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} this study {{indicated}} that the elastic properties of tendon structures in <b>knee</b> extensors <b>and</b> plantar flexors did not affect the <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> ankle joint angles at contact during endurance running. Furthermore, the <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> ankle angles at contact were not related to the performance of long distance runners. Therefore, {{it may be that the}} <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> ankle joint angles at contact are related to the other parameters, e.g., mechanical properties of muscle, flexibility of joint.|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> ankle angles at contact during running were related to the elastic properties of tendon structures in <b>knee</b> extensors <b>and</b> plantar flexors and performance in trained long distance runners. Thirty-two highly trained male long distance runners participated in this study. Elongation of tendon structures in <b>knee</b> extensors <b>and</b> plantar flexors were measured using ultrasonography while subjects performed ramp isometric contractions up to the voluntary maximum. The relationship between estimated muscle force and tendon elongation was fit to a linear regression, the slope of which was defined as the stiffness of tendon structures. <b>Knee</b> <b>and</b> ankle angles at contact during running were determined at a speed of 18  km/h on a treadmill. <b>Knee</b> <b>and</b> ankle angles at contact were not correlated to the stiffness of tendon structures in <b>knee</b> extensors <b>and</b> plantar flexors. In addition, the best official record in a 5000 -m race was not significantly correlated to <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> ankle joint angles at contact. In conclusion, <b>knee</b> <b>and</b> ankle angles at contact were not related to the elastic properties of tendon structures in <b>knee</b> extensors <b>and</b> plantar flexor and the performance of long distance running.|$|R

5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{occurs when}} gas, {{which has been}} breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of an artery leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, <b>knees,</b> <b>and</b> ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers.

5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their <b>knees</b> <b>and,</b> after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E

The subjects were thirty-two eclectically trained, beginning to professional dancers. Turnout was studied with a plumb line apparatus attached at the hip, <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> ankle. Parallel position and ballet first and fifth positions were measured with straight legs and in demi-plie. In first position straight, the hip, <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> ankle provided 51. 2 %, 21. 4 %, and 27. 5 %, respectively of total unilateral turnout. In first position, demi-plie, the hip, <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> ankle contributed 76. 9 %, 7. 4 %, and 15. 7 %, respectively to total unilateral turnout. In fifth position right with legs straight, the right hip, <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> ankle contributed 61. 6 %, 23. 0 %, and 15. 4 %, respectively, of total turnout on the right; the left hip, <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> ankle contributed 51. 8 %, 17. 4 %, and 30. 8 %, respectively, to total turnout on the left. In fifth position right demi-plie, the right hip, <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> ankle provided 78. 4 %, 7. 4 %, and 14. 7 %, respectively, of total turnout on the right; the left hip, <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> ankle contributed 68. 3 %, 7. 3 %, and 23. 8 %, respectively, to total turnout on the left.

5|$|In the 1st and 2nd centuries, a Roman soldier's clothes {{consisted}} of a single-piece, short-sleeved tunic the hem of which reached the <b>knees</b> <b>and</b> special hobnailed sandals (caligae). This attire, which left the arms and legs bare, had evolved in a Mediterranean climate and was not suitable for northern Europe in cold weather. In northern Europe, long-sleeved tunics, trousers (bracae), socks (worn inside the caligae) and laced boots were commonly worn in winter from the 1st century. During the 3rd century, these items of clothing became much more widespread, apparently common in Mediterranean provinces also. However, {{it is likely that}} in warmer weather, trousers were dispensed with and caligae worn instead of socks and boots. Late Roman clothing was often highly decorated, with woven or embroidered strips, clavi, circular roundels, orbiculi, or square panels, tabulae, added to tunics and cloaks. These colourful decorative elements usually {{consisted of}} geometrical patterns and stylised plant motifs, but could include human or animal figures. A distinctive part of a soldier's costume, though it seems to have also been worn by non-military bureaucrats, was a type of round, brimless hat known as the pannonian cap (pileus pannonicus).|$|E
