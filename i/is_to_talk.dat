500|$|Meanwhile, Hunk grows {{tired of}} Vince's self-centered attitude. When Peggy shows up {{unexpectedly}} at another of Vince's parties, Vince {{is happy to}} see her at first but becomes upset when she says the purpose of her visit <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about business. Mr. Shores then approaches Vince with an offer from Geneva Records to purchase Laurel Records and sign him to a rich contract. Peggy refuses to sell, but Vince announces that he will close the deal since he owns a controlling interest, which deeply devastates Peggy. Enraged by Vince's attitude—and his treatment of Peggy—Hunk provokes Vince to fight, who refuses to fight back. [...] Hunk delivers several hard blows with the last one striking Vince in the throat, endangering his voice and therefore his singing ability. Vince is then rushed to a hospital, where he forgives Hunk and realizes he loves Peggy and she loves him. After being released from the hospital, Vince's doctor informs him that his vocal cords are fully recovered, but Vince is worried that his voice might have been affected. To test it, he sings [...] "Young and Beautiful" [...] to Peggy, which reassures him that his fears are unfounded.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} find out the truth, the family turns to the Internet to {{discover}} more about the powers they have in the game, but are accidentally sent to the game engine when Homer spills beer over the keyboard. There, they discover Will Wright, who is destroying copies of an old 8-bit The Simpsons game and its characters. The family manages to save their 8-bit predecessors before they are destroyed by Wright, and discover that they will also become obsolete when the next The Simpsons game is released. The only way to prevent this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the creator of the games and convince him not to destroy them. In order to access his mansion, the family needs to acquire four key cards from four upcoming Simpsons games. First, Homer and Marge defeat a two-headed dragon whose heads are those of Patty and Selma in the Neverquest game. Marge and Lisa then travel to Grand Theft Scratchy, eliminating all offensive material and replacing it with more family-friendly material. Next, Homer and Bart travel to France during World War II to thwart Mr. Burns' plan to steal priceless French paintings, in the [...] "Medal of Homer" [...] game. Lisa and Homer then travel to ancient Japan to defeat the evil Mr. Dirt and his [...] "Sparklemon" [...] in the Big Super Happy Fun Fun Game.|$|E
2500|$|According to Taegyo, at {{the time}} the fetus {{develops}} the ability to hear (during the fifth or sixth month of pregnancy), it also begins to feel the same emotions as the pregnant woman. [...] Taegyo practice <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the fetus with the intent of promoting and environment of affection, love, and happiness. [...] Involvement of the woman's husband and other children in the family is believed to increase the beneficial effects on the fetus, as well as bringing the existing family closer together.|$|E

2500|$|By nine weeks, a {{developing}} fetus can hiccup and react to loud noises. By {{the end of}} the second trimester it can hear. Among other mental feats, the fetus can distinguish between the voice of the mother and that of a stranger, and respond to a familiar story read to it. Taegyo holds that the best way to stimulate the developing brain of a fetus <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to it. [...] The belief is that children who were talked to in the mother's womb are faster language learners, more social, more athletic, and more emotionally sensitive. Talking to the fetus is also believed to increase the strength of the mother-child bond.|$|E
2500|$|In , Baseball Hall of Famer Don Drysdale joined ABC Sports with {{assignments}} such as Monday Night Baseball, Superstars, and Wide World of Sports. In , Drysdale {{covered the}} World Series Trophy presentation. According to Drysdale [...] "My thing <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about inside things. Keith [...] does play-by-play. Howard's [...] role is anything since {{anything can happen}} in broadcasting." [...] When ABC released and then rehired him in , Drysdale explained it by saying [...] "If {{there is nothing to}} say, be quiet." [...] Ultimately, Drysdale seemed to be slowly phased out of the ABC picture as fellow Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer was considered ABC's new poster child [...] " [...] superior looks and...popularity from underwear commercials." [...] By 1989, Palmer would earn $350,000 from ABC for appearing on around ten regular season broadcasts and making a few postseason appearances.|$|E
2500|$|One {{attempt to}} define {{goodness}} {{describes it as}} a property {{of the world with}} transcendental realism. According to this claim, to talk about the good <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about something real that exists in the object itself, independent of the perception of it. Plato advocated this view, in his expression {{that there is such a}} thing as an eternal realm of forms or ideas, and that the greatest of the ideas and the essence of being was goodness, or The good. [...] The good was defined by many ancient Greeks and other ancient philosophers as a perfect and eternal idea, or blueprint. [...] The good is the right relation between all that exists, and this exists in the mind of the Divine, or some heavenly realm. [...] The good is the harmony of a just political community, love, friendship, the ordered human soul of virtues, and the right relation to the Divine and to Nature. [...] The characters in Plato's dialogues mention the many virtues of a philosopher, or a lover of wisdom.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> all one <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my nephew, as it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{the rest}} before; he would go, he said, {{and he only}} wished he had left but ten men in the ship, for he {{could not think of}} having his men lost for want of help; he had rather, he said, lose the ship, the voyage, and his life, and all: and so away went he.|$|R

2500|$|The {{power of}} Mega Man's main weapon - the Buster Gun - [...] depends on Buster Parts {{equipped}}. Buster Parts can be equipped to upgrade four stats of the Buster Gun; Attack (how strong it is), Rapid (how fast it fires), Range (how far the shots go), and Energy (how many shots can be fired before stopping). Buster Parts can be retrieved from stores or from dungeons. Additionally, Roll {{is able to}} create Buster Parts from unusable objects found in the ruins. Roll is also able to make weapons for the player, using specific combinations of parts {{that can be found}} in dungeons or bought in shops. Many of these weapons supplement the Buster Gun. The only way to refill them in the field is an item that can be bought, but only one can be carried. Only one special weapon can be equipped at a time, {{and the only way to}} switch <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Roll, unlike the original series. Special weapons can be upgraded, and have five stats; Attack, Rapid, Range, Energy, and Special. In order to upgrade them, the player must pay a specific amount of Zenny.|$|E

6000|$|... "In many ways, my dear Fischer," [...] he said, [...] "one sympathises {{with that}} speech of yours; {{but the truth}} is best, and it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> truths that we have met this evening. We are gaining no ground here. I am not sure that we are not losing." ...|$|E

[...] His blankness showed for a little that he felt the chill of her cold logic; but as she waited for his {{rejoinder}} she knew to which of them it cost most.

60|$|I {{wrote an}} answer to yours fully some days ago, and, being quite alone and able to frank, you must excuse this {{subsequent}} epistle, which will cost nothing but the trouble of deciphering. I am expectant of agents to accompany me to Rochdale, a journey not to be anticipated with pleasure; though I feel very restless where I am, and shall probably ship off for Greece again; what nonsense it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of Soul, when a cloud makes it melancholy and wine makes it mad.|$|E

All things, human and divine, have arisen out of my simple endeavour {{to show you that}} you must come to Castle Blanch, the planners of the feast having so ordained, and it being good for all parties, due from the fairy godmother to the third princess, and seriously giving Cilly another chance of returning within the bounds of discretion.' ...|$|E
60|$|Tavernake was embarrassed. He {{saw that}} Beatrice <b>was</b> anxious <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her father; he saw, also, {{that her father}} <b>was</b> {{determined}} not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her. With a little sigh, however, she resigned herself to the inevitable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hoi! ho!" [...] exclaimed every one, {{especially}} Aglootook, {{who added}} [...] "hay!" [...] in a peculiar tone, thus giving him leave, as it <b>were,</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{as much as}} he pleased.|$|R

6000|$|But {{even if the}} {{imaginary}} traveller knew no alphabet of this earth at all, I think {{it would still be}} possible to suppose him seeing a difference between London and Paris, and, upon the whole, the real difference. He {{would not be able to}} read the words [...] "Quai Voltaire;" [...] but he would see the sneering statue and the hard, straight roads; without having heard of Voltaire he would understand that the city was Voltairean. He would not know that Fleet Street was named after the Fleet Prison. But the same national spirit which kept the Fleet Prison closed and narrow still keeps Fleet Street closed and narrow. Or, if you will, you may call Fleet Street cosy, and the Fleet Prison cosy. I think I could be more comfortable in the Fleet Prison, in an English way of comfort, than just under the statue of Voltaire. I think that the man from the moon would know France without knowing French; I think that he would know England without having heard the word. For in the last resort all men talk by signs. To talk by statues <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> by signs; to talk by cities <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> by signs. Pillars, palaces, cathedrals, temples, pyramids, are an enormous dumb alphabet: as if some giant held up his fingers of stone. The most important things at the last are always said by signs, even if, like the Cross on St. Paul's, they are signs in heaven. If men do not understand signs, they will never understand words.|$|E

"Professor Lancaster is {{a remarkably}} fine young man," [...] said the other, [...] "and {{as he is}} a friend of yours, and as I should like him to be a friend of mine, it would give me {{pleasure}} to talk to you more about him. But I may as well confess that my real object in coming here <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about your niece. Of course, as I said before, it might appear that I have no right to meddle with your family affairs, but in this case I certainly think I am justified; for, as Mrs. Easterfield invited the young lady to leave you and to come to her, and as all that has happened to her has happened at our house, and in consequence of that invitation, I think that you, as her nearest accessible relative, should be told of what has occurred." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} at the water side to look at the boat, at the wish of Madam de Lacey, the widow of my late noble Commander and Admiral; and, let other men think as they may, I am ready to swear that the 'Royal Caroline' has as well secured a {{bowsprit}} as any ship that carries the British flag! Ay, nor is that all I will say in her favour; she is throughout neatly and lightly sparred, and has no more of a wall-side than the walls of yonder church tumble-home. I am an old man, and my reckoning has got to the last leaf of the log-book; therefore it is little interest that I have, or can have, in this brig or that schooner, but this much will I say, which is, that it is just as wicked, and as little likely to be forgiven, to speak scandal of a wholesome and stout ship, as it <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> amiss of mortal Christian." ...|$|E
