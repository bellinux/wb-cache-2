The film {{includes}} the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover someone more <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> than you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – you care about your child more than you care about yourself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Microsoft {{considered}} several {{names for}} its new operating system. In the end, Microsoft chose Windows Vista as confirmed on July 22, 2005, believing {{it to be a}} [...] "wonderful intersection of what the product really does, what Windows stands for, and what resonates with customers, and their needs." [...] Group Project Manager Greg Sullivan told Paul Thurrott—"You want the PC to adapt to you and help you cut through the clutter to focus on what’s <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> That's what Windows Vista is all about: [...] "bringing clarity to your world." [...] (a reference to the three marketing points of Vista—Clear, Connected, Confident), so you can focus on what matters to you." [...] Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin also liked the name, saying that [...] "Vista" [...] creates the right imagery for the new product capabilities and inspires the imagination with all the possibilities of what can be done with Windows—making people’s passions come alive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Seemingly finding {{parenting}} difficult, Henry Sr. mostly bonded {{with his}} son through their mutual fascination with history. After {{the death of his}} wife Anna from influenza, the gulf between father and son grew {{to the point where they}} rarely spoke. Henry claims that he taught his son [...] "self reliance" [...] this way, while Indiana felt that his father simply cared more about his intellectual pursuits than he did about his own son, saying [...] "What you taught me, was that I was less <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> than some people who'd been dead for 500 years in another country." [...] To Indiana's constant exasperation, Henry refers to his son only as [...] "Junior" [...] (ironically, Indiana does the same thing to his own son), until the end of The Last Crusade when he finally calls him [...] "Indiana". As he was not a hands-on father, Indiana resented his father's aloof, distant nature, which may have influenced his own inability to settle down and start a family for much of his life, and also resented his father's lifelong pursuit of the quest for the Holy Grail. When Henry explains that the search for the Grail is [...] "a race against evil", Indy lashes out at him: [...] "This is an obsession, Dad! I never understood it! Never!" [...] Because of aloofness as a father, Indy embraced his father's friend Marcus Brody as a father figure and role model. Another factor which deteriorated Indiana and Henry's relationship was Indiana going off to enlist in the Belgian Army for World War I in 1916 without his father's consent, and the two went three years without seeing each other.|$|E

You will surely see that that is his meaning. We speak of making a thing after another thing; meaning, make it exactly like another thing. So, by making a man after God, St. Paul means making a man like God.|$|E

Mrs. Turner glances meaningly over at Murray, who is watching them whenever he thinks the matron is not aware of it--a note of sharp rebuke in her voice.) I think I can guess your secret, my dear, even if you're too stubborn to tell. This setback is your own fault.

At the various times when I have helped you a little you have said to me, [...] "We can get along very well now"; but {{in a very short time}} I find you in the same {{difficulty}} again. Now, this can only happen by some defect in your conduct. What that defect is, I think I know. You are not lazy, and still you are an idler. I doubt whether, since I saw you, you have done a good whole day's work in any one day. You do not very much dislike to work, and still you do not work much, merely because it does not seem to you that you could get much for it. This habit of uselessly wasting time is the whole difficulty; it is vastly <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and still more so to your children, that you should break the habit. It is more important to them, because they have longer to live, and can keep out of an idle habit before they are in it, easier than they can get out after they are in.|$|E
