The club rejected Given's request, which was then withdrawn by the goalkeeper, who later stated that his [...] "intention was simply to express [...] frustration at being left out of the team," [...] and that he [...] "never had any intention of actually leaving the club."

500|$|River {{dolphins}} {{have very}} small eyes for their size, {{and do not}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> sense of sight. In addition, the eyes are placed {{on the sides of}} the head, so the vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When river dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light. They have both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Most river dolphins have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a [...] tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. They also have glands on their eyelids and an outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea.|$|E
500|$|Oldfield, an Australian national, said he {{was making}} [...] "a protest against inequalities in British society, {{government}} cuts, reductions in civil liberties and a culture of elitism". Oxford number two, William Zeng, denounced Oldfield and described him as [...] "a mockery of a man", while Oxford boat club president Karl Hudspith tweeted [...] "my team went through seven months of hell, this {{was the culmination of}} our careers and [...] took it from us". [...] Educated at the Sydney Church of England Grammar School, the University of Sydney and the London School of Economics, and Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, Oldfield tweeted the day after the race, [...] "Having been deep within elite institutions I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> understanding of them. I protest their injustices – ask anyone that knows me". On his blog, Oldfield compared his actions to those of Emily Davison, the suffragette killed after stepping in front of the King's horse at The Derby in 1913. [...] Despite later stating he had some sympathy for both the rowers and spectators, he said he had no regrets and that he [...] "would have felt less of a man" [...] had he not made the protest. [...] In October 2012, Oldfield was jailed for six months for causing a public nuisance and ordered to pay £750 costs. In June 2013, he was refused leave to remain in the United Kingdom, the Home Office claiming his presence there was not [...] "conducive to the public good". Oldfield, whose wife is from India, appealed on the grounds that she would be threatened in Australia, and in December 2013, the deportation order was overturned. [...] Security for the 2013 race was increased as a result of Oldfield's actions, with Royal Marines, additional stewards and the Metropolitan Police Marine Policing Unit in attendance.|$|E

500|$|In 1908, {{his final}} season, {{the team was}} christened as the Zanesville Infants and joined the Central League. [...] According to Sporting Life, the [...] "schedule meeting" [...] for the Central League that year was {{to be held in}} Zanesville on March 17 (St. Patrick's Day). [...] "According to the plans of the magnates the season this year will consist of 140 games, not any of the club owners being willing to return to the 154-game schedule", the paper reported. [...] The paper added that Hogan was [...] "making light of his task" [...] of signing up players for his team. [...] "His {{acquaintance}} with players, especially in the independent ranks, gives him an advantage which few managers have". [...] Sporting Life also reported that by March, Hogan had [...] "signed his outfield, the players accepting terms being [...] Elson, Blount, and Miller". [...] Further {{research is needed to determine}} the Zanesville Infants' league ranking at the close of the 1908 season, but available information shows that the team neither won the championship nor placed as a runner-up. [...] More information is available on Hogan's dissatisfaction with his situation in Zanesville, which evidently stemmed from increasing limits on his control over the club. [...] An article that appeared in The (Pittsburgh) Gazette Times in December 1908 described Hogan's reasons for leaving the organization. [...] "There were too many directors connected with the Zanesville club to suit Hogan, as each one had his own idea of how a club should be run", the paper reported. [...] "As Hogan has his own, which did not exactly coincide with the numerous directors, he resigned". [...] The Gazette Times praised Hogan's performance in Zanesville, stating that his club [...] "was a pennant contender at all stages of the championship race". [...] The paper added: [...] "He did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> team, but kept the men playing the game at all times and was really the wonder of the [...] league".|$|E

2500|$|Early in his Glyndebourne career, Wallace {{consulted}} the festival's administrator Moran Caplat {{on whether he}} might sing in non-operatic productions elsewhere.

In 1953, as well as singing in opera in Britain and internationally, he was in the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium and in pantomime as one of the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella. [...] In 1962, invited to present a one-man show at the Criterion Theatre, London, he preferred to share the bill, and his [...] "after-dinner entertainment" [...] 4 to the Bar had a cast of four.

[...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult.
