40|$|MillionTreesNYC, {{which has}} the goal of {{planting}} one million trees in New York City by 2017, is intended to make New York City a greener, more sustainable city and {{is part of the}} Mayor’s comprehensive long term strategic plan, PlaNYC. Through planting a tree at every suitable sidewalk location in the city, the City of New York is transforming blocks and communities, and providing a variety of environmental, social and aesthetic benefits. This article examines the large scale municipal planting of new street trees and the reaction by some of the pubic to this planting. Trees offer benefits to the city overall, but the public may not understand these benefits or the street tree planting process. Between 2007 and 2009, the Department of Parks & Recreation planted 53, 235 new street trees, and received 4, 108 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> from the public. The majority <b>of</b> this <b>correspondence</b> consisted <b>of</b> public comments about the City’s new street tree planting policies and processes including placement objections, maintenance concerns, reports of resultant damage from tree planting operations, requests for new street trees and reports of tree conditions. This study describes the operational policies that guide New York City's municipal street tree planting, and results of content and spatial analysis <b>of</b> the <b>correspondence.</b> Qualitative analysis <b>of</b> the <b>correspondence</b> revealed the public perceptions and concerns related to the MillionTreesNYC program. Spatial analysis explored the relationship between the planting locations of new street trees and the locations <b>of</b> the citizen <b>correspondence.</b> Public reactions to this large scale municipal planting are related to the dual public and private nature of the sidewalk, issues of territoriality, responsibility, aesthetics and place attachment. Correspondence volume was associated with the scale of the new street tree block planting program, and the effectiveness of NYC’s 311 Customer Service Center. The discussion suggests that increased public education on tree benefits and notification of planting processes could change perceptions of new street tree planting, and identified the potential for targeted research studies to further investigate public reactions to new street tree planting...|$|R

40|$|While {{studying}} Sanskrit and Buddhist scriptures at Oxford, Nanjō Bunyū (1849 – 1929) sent {{a letter}} in 1879 to his senior Ogurusu Kōchō (1831 – 1905) who was then engaged in mission work in China. He asked Ogurusu for help in locating Sanskrit texts in China and Tibet. In this letter, Nanjō not only described the flourishing state of Buddhist Studies in the West, but also bitterly criticized the outdated mode of Buddhist scholarship in the East (Japan and China), arguing {{for the importance of}} studying Sanskrit scriptures. This doubtlessly foreshadowed a new development in the study of Buddhism in Asia. At the same time, a similar search for original Buddhist scriptures also began in China. At the beginning of the 1880 s, the famous layman Xu Xi’an (dates unknown) of Suzhou asked another layman, Shen Shandeng (1830 – 1902), to write a letter to a third layman, Yang Wenhui (1837 – 1911), who was working at the Chinese embassy in London. His intention was to ask for Yang’s assistance in looking for Sanskrit scriptures in the West in order to elucidate the original ideas of Sakyamuni. Yang had already made the acquaintance of Nanjō in London in 1880 and was engaged in close contact with him, enthusiastically discussing the state of Western Buddhist Studies together. Through these discussions, the two came to share the idea that a new understanding of Sakyamuni’s teachings could be gained through the study of early Buddhist texts. What {{can be seen from the}} above description is that the new trends in Western Buddhist Studies did not emerge in isolation, but that Japanese and Chinese Buddhists both reacted in their own way to them, entering into intricate mutual relations and interactions. Buddhist scholarship in East Asia, which was based on Chinese translations of the Indian Buddhist scriptures, began to take note of the original Indian texts. This marks the emergence of a new dawn in Buddhist scholarship in East Asia. However, the two <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>correspondence</b> mentioned above have so far not received any scholarly attention, and even the specific nature of this historical turning point is not well known. This paper therefore introduces the content <b>of</b> these <b>correspondences,</b> considers the contacts between Chinese and Japanese Buddhists, and by doing so elucidates the concrete circumstances under which Japanese and Chinese Buddhists entered this period of historical change...|$|R
