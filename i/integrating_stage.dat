40|$|The basic {{theme of}} the theory of speech {{production}} is that the speech wave is the response of the vocal tract filter system to a sound source. The technique of inverse filtering (8) is based on a cancelation of the filter function in order to gener-ate a signal which has the properties of the primary sound source. The vocal tract filter function of a non-nasalized vowel can be approximated mathematically in a limited frequency range by a number of conjugate poles, one pair for each formant, and a correction for the influence of higher poles above the fre-quency range of interest. The inverse function accordingly con-sists of a number of conjugate zeros and an inverse correction for the higher poles. The frequency proportional radiation transfer is similarly compensated by an <b>integrating</b> <b>stage...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the ability of staging systems (American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union Internationale contre le Cancer [AJCC/UICC], Japanese TNM, Pittsburgh, United Network for Organ Sharing [UNOS], Cancer of the Liver Italian Program [CLIP], Japan <b>Integrated</b> <b>Staging</b> [JIS], and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer [BCLC]) to predict {{survival}} after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma. Study Design Four hundred ninety consecutive patients who underwent liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma at 4 centers (1985 to 2005) were identified using a registry (US, Belgium, Germany). End points were overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Survival by stage was compared with the log-rank test. Sequential stage-wise discrimination of each system was evaluated using Cox regression. Results Three- and 5 -year overall survival rates were 71 % and 64 %, respectively; recurrence-free survival rates were 67 % and 61 %, respectively. Median followup among 327 living and 308 recurrence-free patients was 40 months. In only three systems—AJCC/UICC, Japanese TNM, and Pittsburgh—were overall and recurrence-free survivals longer for patients with low stage versus more advanced stage. For overall and recurrence-free survivals, sequential stages were different only for AJCC/UICC. In the Japanese TNM system, stages II and I were similar; for Pittsburgh, grades 3 and 2 were similar. For the United Network for Organ Sharing system, stages II and I and stages IVA 1 and III were similar. All stages were similar for the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program. For the Japan <b>Integrated</b> <b>Staging,</b> scores 2 and 1 and scores 4 and 3 were similar. In the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer, stage D patients had significantly better survival than patients at stage C. Conclusions The AJCC/UICC staging system provides the best stratification of prognosis for patients undergoing liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma. This confirms previous analyses in patients treated with hepatic resection. The AJCC/UICC staging system should be considered for uniform prediction of outcomes after surgery for hepatocellular carcinoma. PublishedN/...|$|R
