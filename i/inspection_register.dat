40|$|Implementation of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) -technology has {{received}} increased industrial interest {{during the last}} three decades. This is because utilisation of RFID is related to opportunities to increase logistical efficiency (in terms of reduced time and costs) in logistics operations, reduce risk of theft, control goods-characteristics (temperature, humidity), and in tracking and tracing of goods to ensure and preserve the safety and quality of goods in supply chains. In addition, previous studies in the area present logistics benefits in implementing the Electronic Product Code Information Service framework. This report focuses on potential impacts on logistics operations and opportunities in implementation of RFID technology and the EPCIS-framework to ensure unique identification of trailers at DFDS Seaways. The purpose is to investigate how RFID and EPCIS can be used for handling of trailers in port-areas. The report presents findings from literature reviews and a case study that investigated four research questions. The first question embraces potential logistics operations affected by implementation of EPCIS framework. The second question explores RFID-technology, suitable for unique identification of trailers in the two harbours Rotterdam and Immingham. The third question concerns the potential physical location of RFID technology on trailers and in the two port-areas. Finally, the fourth question explores potential business benefits in implementing a RFID-based identification system of trailers at DFDS terminals in Rotterdam and Immingham. The results show that logistics operations of identification, <b>inspection,</b> <b>registering,</b> picking, loading, un-loading, storage, and distribution of trailers are affected by implementation of the EPCIS framework, which is important for DFDS in management of trailers. RFID-tags suitable in identification of trailers are either passive or active. Similarly, the variety of RFIDreaders ranges from hand-held RFID-scanners to RFID-portals. The choice of RFIDtechnology should be based on the use of communication standards, presence of metal, and costs. The results show several potential physical locations on trailers, tugmasters, and in the Rotterdam and Immingham port-areas to place RFID-technology. Business benefits of implementing a RFID based identification system in Rotterdam and Immingham can be drawn from more effective logistics operations and reducing errors and problems occuring such as forbidden parking of trailers, language problems, service in self-service files, inspection and labelling of trailers. The report also examines the knowledge about RFIDtechnology among employees working with handling of trailers in the two ports Rotterdam and Immingham. The results presented contribute to the understanding of implementation of RFID-technology and the EPCIS-framework in handling of trailers within port-areas from a managerial point of view. This is useful for DFDS as well as for academia, since it shows that RFID-based and standardised solutions should be prioritised to influence future setups and theoretical development of the logistics research area...|$|R

40|$|The Netherlands, {{like many}} {{countries}} in this world, face a challenging task in managing civil infrastructures. The management of vital infrastructures, like road bridges, is necessary to ensure their safe and reliable functioning. The Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management in the Netherlands manages the structures in the national road network. A large number of bridges and viaducts were constructed during the 1960 's and 1970 's. Due to many factors, {{it is difficult to}} determine the exact length of the remaining life of a structure. This is why the manager frequently performs <b>inspections</b> and <b>registers</b> the state of each structure in a database. A principal element of bridge management systems is the estimation of the uncertain rate of deterioration. This is usually done by using a suitable model and by using information gathered on-site during inspections. This thesis proposes a statistical and probabilistic framework, which enables the decision maker to estimate the rate of deterioration and to quantify his uncertainty about this estimate. The framework consists of a continuous-time Markov process with a finite number of states to model the uncertain rate at which the quality of structures reduces over time. The result of this research is a unified approach to modeling uncertain deterioration and decision making for optimal maintenance management.

The PCAOB conducts <b>inspections</b> of <b>registered</b> public {{accounting}} firms that provide audits for publicly traded companies. The {{results of the}} inspection process are summarized in publicly available reports at the PCAOB website. Using these reports, we categorize the inspection reports into three levels of increasing severity: clean, GAAS-deficient, and GAAP-deficient. We examine the potential use of GAAP-deficient PCAOB inspection reports as perceived audit quality signals for the clients of GAAP-deficient auditors that are inspected on a triennial basis by the PCAOB. Our investigation is predicated {{on the notion that}} audit quality is generally not directly observable. Thus, the clients of these auditors may seek to signal their desire for audit quality by dismissing their GAAP-deficient auditors. Our results suggest that the clients of GAAP-deficient, triennially inspected auditors are more likely to dismiss these auditors in favor of triennially inspected auditors that are not GAAP-deficient. In addition, we find that greater agency conflicts, the presence of an independent and expert audit committee, and outside blockholdings magnify this effect. Interestingly, we find no evidence that the clients use GAAP-deficient reports to procure a subsequent-year audit fee discount or more favorable going-concern auditor reporting treatment. Our evidence indicates that PCAOB inspection reports created heterogeneity in auditor brand name among a group of non-Big N/non-national auditors that did not previously exist and are universally treated by prior research as “other auditors. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{developing}} a domain model, it seems natural {{to bring the}} traditional informal tools of inspection and verification, debuggers and automated test suites, to bear upon the problems that will inevitably arise. Debuggers that allow <b>inspection</b> of <b>registers</b> and memory and stepwise execution have been a staple of software development of all sorts from the very beginning. Automated testing has repeatedly proven its considerable worth, {{to the extent that}} an entire design philosophy (Test Driven Development) has been developed around the writing of tests. Unfortunately, while not entirely without their uses, the limitations of these tools {{and the nature of the}} complexity of models and the underlying planning systems make the diagnosis of certain classes of problems and the verification of their solutions difficult or impossible. Debuggers provide a good local view of executing code, allowing a fine-grained look at algorithms and data. This view is, however, usually only at the level of the current scope in the implementation language, and the data-inspection capabilities of most debuggers usually consist of on-line print statements. More modem graphical debuggers offer a sort of tree view of data structures, but even this is too low-level and is often inappropriate for the kinds of structures created by planning systems. For instance, god or constraint networks are at best awkward when visualized as trees. Any any non-structural link between data structures, as through a lookup table, isn't captured at all. Further, while debuggers have powerful breakpointing facilities that are suitable for finding specific algorithmic errors, they have little use in the diagnosis of modeling errors...|$|R
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 2003 Dr. Malcolm McKenzie ParkThis thesis began as {{an investigation of the}} effect of adverse possession upon the land market where the adverse possession extends only to {{a small portion of the}} abutting parcel and the subject land is under a title registration scheme. The consequence of such adverse possession on part only of a parcel is that the location of the boundary demarcating the limits of the respective domains of two adjoining land parcels may be displaced. If part parcel adverse possession effectively transfers ownership of a small portion of an abutting parcel, the boundaries are shifted consequent to long term occupation, and will prevail over the strict technical legal boundary. In a registered title land system the occupational boundary then prevails over the legal boundary as certified in the register notwithstanding that registered title schemes purport to confer conclusiveness upon register entries. Alternatively, the registered proprietor’s estate is not paramount where any part of the proprietor's parcel has been adversely occupied. Consequently the occupier has an interest in the proprietor's land that is not disclosed in the <b>register.</b> <b>Inspection</b> of the <b>register</b> and reliance upon the inspection is insufficient to ascertain the complete legal status of the particular land holding. Inspection with consequent reliance upon the register is the major function of a registered title scheme. Alternatively, if part parcel adverse possession is ineffective to transfer ownership of registered land, the technical legal boundary prevails over the occupational boundary despite the fact that it is not the boundary accepted by the parties involved as governing. Both alternatives present a problem to the orderly conduct of the land market. Where occupations prevail, the prudent market participant takes precautions besides relying on <b>inspection</b> of the <b>register.</b> Where the legal boundary prevails, the participant seeks confirmation that the occupational and legal boundaries coincide. Another alternative utilised in some registered title jurisdictions empowers a court to transfer small sections to an adjoining landholder where a building or similar improvement is erected so that it encroaches upon the adjacent holding. This alternative was included within the ambit of the thesis as it developed. The aim of this research was the formulation of the best solution suitable for a registered land system with particular reference towards a uniform solution suitable for adoption in all Australian jurisdictions. The existing systems utilising adverse possession and statutory encroachment were evaluated against three recent law cases that illustrate the workings of these systems including perceived shortcomings. These lawsuits serve as a test against which the existing systems are compared and evaluated and were also used to evaluate the proposed solution. The results suggest that adverse possession alone should not override the purpose of the register which is to fully disclose the proprietary interests in land parcels. It was concluded that a necessary step in acquiring title to land through adverse possession involves the registration of the interest acquired. Whereas the present modes of dealing with the boundary problem are adequate, it is concluded that the best mode is that of statutory encroachment because it best serves several competing interests. Adopting the proposed solution would involve change and compromise in some of the Australian jurisdictions; these being necessary to adopt a uniform scheme throughout Australia. The proposed solution has added benefits of removing an illogicality from some of the present systems, eliminating encouragement for an off-register land market, and fosters an accurate public land register.
