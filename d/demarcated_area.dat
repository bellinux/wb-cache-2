50|$|There {{are three}} types of environments where people can swim with dolphins: ponds, natural <b>demarcated</b> <b>areas</b> and at the sea. The ponds are very large and deep pools, such as the SeaWorld aquarium. The natural <b>demarcated</b> <b>areas</b> are places {{adjacent}} to the sea that share the sea's pure water and seabed, Riviera Maya, and Cozumel in Mexico. Some (though certainly not all) sea swim programs are done at certain points where wild dolphins are accustomed to getting food.

50|$|Traditionally, {{sites are}} {{distinguished}} {{by the presence}} of both artifacts and features. Common features include the remains of hearths and houses. Ecofacts, biological materials (such as bones, scales, and even feces) that are the result of human activity but are not deliberately modified, are also common at many archaeological sites. In the cases of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras, a mere scatter of flint flakes will also constitute a site worthy of study. Different archaeologists may see an ancient town, and its nearby cemetery as being two different sites, or as being part of the same wider site. The precepts of landscape archaeology attempt to see each discrete unit of human activity {{in the context of the}} wider environment, further distorting the concept of the site as a <b>demarcated</b> <b>area.</b> Furthermore, geoarchaeologists or environmental archaeologists would also consider a sequence of natural geological or organic deposition, in the absence of human activity, to constitute a site worthy of study.|$|E
50|$|Bangladesh Navy (BN) {{came into}} being during the liberation War {{of the country in}} 1971, in which it {{suffered}} a number of fatalities. The navy carried out around 45 operations during the war, including traditional naval operations as well as unconventional commando operations including guerrilla warfare. At the first leg of war, defected Bengali sailors joined the guerrilla forces. It was the eight sailors who defected Pakistan Navy sub-marine PNS Mangro, under construction in France, pioneered the formation of naval element of Liberation War. Later many other naval personnel participated. So far the information could be known, there are 334 naval participants; out of which 22 died. To avoid misunderstanding and to get necessary assistance naval planners used to co-ordinate in the planning phase with other sector commanders to carry out operation in their respective sectors. During the Liberation War East Pakistan was divided into 11 sectors. Each sector had a Commander and <b>demarcated</b> <b>area</b> of responsibility except sector 10. It is said that the area of responsibility of sector 10 was the coastal belt but in reality its operation was spread all over the country.|$|E

5000|$|Guts or disc guts (sometimes guts Frisbee in {{reference}} to the trademarked brand name) is a disc game inspired by dodgeball, involving teams throwing a flying disc (rather than balls) at members of the opposing team. One to five team members stand in a line facing the opposing team across the court, with the two teams lined up parallel to each other. Which team begins play is determined [...] "flipping the disc", an action similar to a coin toss, but using the disc itself.

If the thrower misses the [...] "scoring area" [...] (a <b>demarcated</b> <b>area</b> a bit larger than the space occupied by the opposing team), the receiving team scores a point.

If the throw is within the scoring area and the receiving team fails to catch, or catches but drops the disc, the throwing team gets a point. The receiving team then picks up the disc and becomes the throwing team. The receiving team must catch the disc cleanly in one hand, and may not move from position until after the disc leaves the hand of the thrower. The disc may not be trapped between the hand and any other part of the body, including the other hand. This frequently results in a challenging sequence of [...] "tips" [...] or [...] "bobbles", which are rebounds of the disc off of receivers' hands or body to slow the disc down and keep it in play until it can be caught. This often involves multiple players on the receiving team.Play continues until at least 21 points have been scored by one of the teams and there is a difference in score of at least 2 points.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Cecal volvulus is a {{relatively}} uncommon encountered clinical condition. Presentation of case: A 48 -year-old patient known with a large uterine leiomyoma, presented with progressive abdominal pain since one week. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a very large leiomyoma of the uterus, severely distended loops of the small bowel with a caliber change and a suggested ‘whirl sign’ of the mesenteric vessels. A laparotomy was performed, showing a very large uterus as well as torsion of the mesentery of the cecum with a sharp <b>demarcated</b> <b>area</b> of necrosis of the right hemicolon. Discussion: Cecal volvulus due to a large uterine mass is a rare encountered clinical entity. The suggested mechanism might be the same mechanism causing cecal volvulus during pregnancy; the enlarged uterus raisingout the mobile cecum out of the pelvis. Obstruction may occur from kinking of the colon at a fixed point. Conclusion: This case demonstrates that uterine leiomyoma can be a cause of a cecal volvulus, leading to severe intestinal strangulation...|$|E
40|$|Case summary: A 7 -week-old, intact female Pug was {{referred}} with an acute history of expiratory dyspnea, tachypnea, and pyrexia. Radiologic evaluation revealed bilateral pleural effusion and a poorly <b>demarcated</b> <b>area</b> of soft tissue opacity cranial to the heart. The presence of air bronchograms in the cranial lung lobes suggested alveolar parenchymal pathology consistent with pulmonary edema, congestion, or cellular infiltration. Exploratory thoracotomy revealed a segmental torsion {{of the left}} cranial lung lobe. The affected lobe was removed and the puppy recovered uneventfully. Unique information: Lung lobe torsion tends to occur more frequently in mature large breed dogs at {{a mean age of}} 3 years. The age, breed, and segmental nature of the torsion in the reported case are contrary to most of the previously documented cases of lung lobe torsion. To the authors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge, this is the first report of lung lobe torsion in a 7 -week-old dog...|$|E
30|$|Other placid {{disorders}} include serpiginous choroiditis and serpiginous-like choroiditis, {{two distinct}} forms of choroiditis also believed {{to result from}} the inflammation of the choriocapillaris/inner choroid and the RPE [24].

Point-to-point registration between the hypofluorescent areas on ICGA to the areas of flow-void demonstrated on OCTA can be precisely identified [25]. Additionally, intervening areas of preserved choriocapillaris [25, 26] and medium-sized choroidal vessels are identified between the active lesions. As the lesions heal, deeper medium-to-large choroidal vessels become more prominent and are better delineated on OCTA than on ICG.|$|R
