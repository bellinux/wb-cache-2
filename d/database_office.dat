40|$|Abstract: A {{scheme for}} {{gathering}} detailed assignment level data on curricula for assessment purposes is presented. An assessment tool {{that focuses on}} the individual assignment level can provide detailed information, which may not be apparent at the course or program level. An assignment database containing a record for each student assignment is proposed here to provide a means to access detailed assessment data that is readily available from the faculty teaching the courses in the major. The assessment scheme described here incorporates data that is based on actual student activities in the program. Assignment attributes that are based upon the desired outcomes of the program are provided for each assignment by the faculty responsible for each course. Therefore an inherent connection to the curricula, faculty input and a means for direct feedback to the curricula are built into this assessment scheme. The grade statistics available on the individual assignments can be a component of the performance measures utilized to assess the achievement of the program's desired student outcomes. This database, once built, can be efficiently maintained using standard personal computer spreadsheet and <b>database</b> <b>office</b> software...|$|E

40|$|Internet {{interventions}} {{are assumed to}} be cost-effective. However, it is unclear how strong this evidence is, and what the quality of this evidence is. Method. A comprehensive literature search (1990 - 2014) in Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, NHS Economic Evaluations Database, NHS Health Technology Assessment <b>Database,</b> <b>Office</b> of Health Economics Evaluations Database, Compendex and Inspec was conducted. We included economic evaluations alongside randomized controlled trials of Internet interventions for a range of mental health symptoms compared to a control group, consisting of a psychological or pharmaceutical intervention, treatment-as-usual (TAU), wait-list or an attention control group. Results. Of the 6587 abstracts identified, 16 papers met the inclusion criteria. Nine studies featured a societal perspective. Results demonstrated that guided Internet interventions for depression, anxiety, smoking cessation and alcohol consumption had favourable probabilities of being more cost-effective when compared to wait-list, TAU, group cognitive behaviour therapy (CBGT), attention control, telephone counselling or unguided Internet CBT. Unguided Internet interventions for suicide prevention, depression and smoking cessation demonstrated cost-effectiveness compared to TAU or attention control. In general, results from cost-utility analyses using more generic health outcomes (quality of life) were less favourable for unguided Internet interventions. Most studies adhered reasonably to economic guidelines. Conclusions. Results of guided Internet interventions being cost-effective are promising with most studies adhering to publication standards, but more economic evaluations are needed in order to determine cost-effectiveness of Internet interventions compared to the most cost-effective treatment currently available...|$|E

40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} subtype H 5 N 1 is a zoonotic disease {{and control of}} the disease is one of the highest priority in global health. Disease surveillance systems are valuable data sources for various researches and management projects, but the data quality has not been paid much attention in previous studies. Based on data from two commonly used <b>databases</b> (<b>Office</b> International des Epizooties (OIE) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)) of global HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks during the period of 2003 – 2009, we examined and compared their patterns of temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal distributions for the first time. OIE and FAO data showed similar trends in temporal and spatial distributions if they were considered separately. However, more advanced approaches detected a significant difference in joint spatio-temporal distribution. Because of incompleteness for both OIE and FAO data, an integrated dataset would provide a more complete picture of global HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks. We also displayed a mismatching profile of global HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks and found that the degree of mismatching was related to the epidemic severity.

40|$|An {{approach}} to the coordinated sharing and interchange of computerized information is described emphasizing partial, controlled sharing among autonomous <b>databases.</b> <b>Office</b> information systems provide a particularly appropriate context {{for this type of}} information sharing and exchange. A federated database architecture is described in which a collection of independent database systems are united into a loosely coupled federation in order to share and exchange information. A federation consists of components (of which there may be any number) and a single federal dictionary. The components represent individual users, applications, workstations, or other components in an office information system. The federal dictionary is a specialized component that maintains the topology of the federation and oversees the entry of new components. Each component in the federation controls its interactions with other components by means of an export schema and an import schema. The export schema specifies the information that a component will share with other components, while the import schema specifies the nonlocal information that a component wishes to manipulate. The federated architecture provides mechanisms for sharing data, for sharing transactions (via message types) for combining information from several components, and for coordinating activities among autonomous components (via negotiation). A prototype implementation of the federated database mechanism is currently operational on an experimental basis...|$|R
