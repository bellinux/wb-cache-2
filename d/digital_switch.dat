25|$|The {{concepts}} of digital switching {{were developed by}} various labs in the United States and in Europe from the 1930s onwards. The first prototype <b>digital</b> <b>switch</b> was developed by Bell Labs {{as part of the}} ESSEX project while the first true digital exchange to be combined with digital transmission systems was designed by LCT (Laboratoire Central de Telecommunications) in Paris. The first <b>digital</b> <b>switch</b> to be placed into a public network was the Empress Exchange in London, England which was designed by the General Post Office research labs. This was a tandem switch that connected three Strowger exchanges in the London area. The first commercial roll-out of a fully digital local switching system was Alcatel's E10 system which began serving customers in Brittany in Northwestern France in 1972.|$|E
25|$|A {{patchwork}} quilt of {{electromechanical switching}} equipment handled San Jose calls between 1949 and the 1980s. There were about eight Western Electric Crossbar switches, at least one Number 1 and mostly Number 5. There was a Western Electric 4A Crossbar that took up two floors of the Main telephone exchange. In the mid-1980s, the 4A crossbar was replaced with a <b>digital</b> <b>switch</b> which took up part of a single floor and quadrupled calling capacity.|$|E

A number of major FM radio stations which formerly broadcast from the site now use the IDS as a backup in case their primary location in Shoreview, Minnesota were to fail. One of the most notable broadcasters was 99.5 WLOL until the pop format signed off in late February 1991. In fact, one well-known reference was [...] "From the top-top-top of the IDS Center, 99 and 1/2 WLOL Minneapolis-Saint Paul!" [...] In 2009 the equipment was removed and digital towers were added for the national <b>digital</b> <b>switch.</b> Some television broadcasters using the towers include Univision affiliate WUMN-LP and KMBD-LD, which broadcasts HSN programming, while the area's major television stations use them for their STL towers and microwave relays to Shoreview and their studios and live trucks.|$|E

40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{features}} description of electronics <b>switches</b> for <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays and on the design of program for optimal calculation of switching points and the figure of <b>switches</b> in <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays investigation. The electronics switches types, used for time circuit separation, are described in the preamble. These switches are the base of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays and in principal two types are defined: the switch S and switch T. The switch S allows the interconnection only of the same channel intervals from incoming circuit with random outgoing circuit. The switch S is being used in multistage switching arrays in combination with the switches T because it can not be used separately. The switch T allows exchanging the time position of incoming circuit to different time position of outgoing circuit depending on connection needs. The time switch can substitute the space switch under specific work conditions. In practice, the time switch with controlled reading and writing is used. The following part of diploma thesis {{is focused on}} the designs and calculations of optimal <b>switching</b> points of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> array which is the executive unit of switching systems. These systems directly interconnect the signals from digital multiplexes and make the basic assumptions for telecommunication networks integration. The <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> array means the equipment which is able to connect the channels of digital multiplexes carrying the information in encoding form. The multiplexes are the most often with pulse coded modulation or adaptive delta modulation. The <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays are divided into the time and space one. The <b>switching</b> arrays of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> systems can be made by time switching array T whose realization is limited to specific capacity or by the connection of multistage arrays. Single stages sequenced one behind each other are made by the switches T and S. The space array S does not allow making the <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> array of switching centre. The program which determines possible proposals of switching arrays from defined figure of inputs and calculates the optimal figure of switching points and switches is a part of diploma thesis...|$|R
