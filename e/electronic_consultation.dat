Searches were conducted to identify relevant articles. Articles were included if the telehealth intervention restructured or made the referral process more efficient. We excluded studies that simply increased capacity. Two categories of interventions were identified – <b>electronic</b> <b>consultations</b> and image-based triage. <b>Electronic</b> <b>consultations</b> are asynchronous, text-based provider-to-provider <b>consultations.</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>consultations</b> {{have been reported to}} obviate the need for face-to-face appointments between the patient and the specialist in between 34 – 92 % of cases. However, it is often reported that <b>electronic</b> <b>consultations</b> are appropriate in less than 10 % of referrals for outpatient care. Image-based triage has been used successfully to reduce unnecessary or inappropriate referrals and was used most often in dermatology, ophthalmology and otolaryngology (ENT). Reported reduction rates for face-to-face appointments by specialty were: dermatology 38 – 88 %, ophthalmology 16 – 48 % and ENT 89 %. Image–based triage can be twice as effective as non-image based triage in reducing unnecessary appointments. Telehealth interventions can effectively be used to reduce waiting lists and improve the coordination of specialist services, and should be considered in conjunction with clinical requirements.

In May 2009 a module for <b>electronic</b> <b>consultation</b> referrals was introduced in the computer system Cosmic at the University Hospital in Uppsala. Previously, the primary care units had to use two different systems for management of referrals. Referrals sent internally within primary care have been sent electronically while referrals to the University Hospital or other external units were sent on paper. The introduction of the module for <b>electronic</b> <b>consultation</b> referrals at the hospital has meant that all primary care referrals can be sent electronically. The study contains an examination of the expectations on the introduction of the module for consultation referrals, and what preparations that have been made for the introduction. The methods used for data collection in the study have been interviews, contextual interviews and a survey. The results of the study show that there are different kinds of problems with computer use in primary care today. Some problems are due to technical shortcomings of the system, while others are of functional origin, and yet others due to lack of knowledge of the users. The primary care units have high expectations on the introduction of the consultation referral module at the hospital but have made little preparations for the introduction...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of chronic leg ulcers requires frequent assessments of local wound status and adjustment of therapy. The availability of reasonably priced photographic equipment and quick electronic transfer of high-quality digital images {{should make it}} possible that the assessment of wound status can be made by remote experts. Objective: This study examines the feasibility of using teledermatology for wound assessment and therapeutic suggestions for patients with chronic leg ulcers. Methods: One hundred ten chronic leg ulcers of different origins were examined in face-to-face consultations. The examining doctor assessed the wound, made therapeutic recommendations and took 1 - 4 photographs of the wound using a digital camera. The digital images and relevant clinical information were then transmitted via a web application to an expert in wound care, who provided an independent teledermatological assessment of wound status and therapeutic recommendations. Results: In our study, a high accordance between direct <b>consultations</b> and <b>electronic</b> <b>consultations</b> was found in the assessment of chronic leg ulcers, especially for important features like slough (concordance: 84. 6 %), necrosis (concordance: 98. 2 %) and granulation tissue formation (concordance: 76. 4 %). Furthermore, the teledermatologist generally felt confident in recommending further treatment strategies and in planning further wound assessments via the internet. Conclusions: Our results suggest that teledermatology offers great potential for the future in chronic wound care. By reducing the need to travel long distances to the hospital or to consult a physician with expertise in wound care, wound teleconsultation might lower health care costs and {{improve the quality of life}} for patients with chronic wounds, while still maintaining a high quality of wound care...|$|R

There is no full understanding of patients’ attitude on eHealth yet. Aim {{of this study is to}} gain insight into the level of knowledge and experiences with eHealth of people with chronic lung diseases. Method: A telephone survey among 400 people with a medical diagnosis of asthma or COPD was conducted. All patients participated in the larger research program National Panel of people with Chronic diseases or Disabilities (NPCD) conducted by NIVEL. Results: Eight percent of the asthma and COPD patients knew of the term eHealth. Knowledge of specific eHealth applications (e. g. electronic medical record, <b>electronic</b> <b>consultations,</b> monitoring from a distance) was higher and ranged from 21 to 88 %. Most available applications were used by less than 20 % of the patients, although figures differ by age and educational level. People who have used applications were in general rather positive about their use. Non-users did not see clear advantages of using eHealth applications. A majority thought that eHealth decreases human contact in health care and will not contribute to a higher quality of care. On the contrary, almost half of the patients considered eHealth as a possibility to take more responsibility in their own care. Asthma and COPD patients were unanimous that the use of eHealth should always be a free choice. Conclusion: Although most asthma and COPD patient know of one or more eHealth applications, actual use remains low. Patients who do have experience with the use of eHealth are on the whole positive. However, patients without experience have no clear ideas about the advantages. They should be convinced first, and stressing the possibilities for more personal control might be an important argument to persuade them. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

Although chemical pathologists have a long-standing practice in advising test strategy and result interpretation especially from primary care, such consultations are usually informal, unstructured and {{those related to}} IEM are infrequently requested. This study aims to provide a formal <b>electronic</b> <b>consultation</b> service and to apply tandem mass spectrometry-based dried blood spot metabolic screening (DBSM) as a rapid first-line test for patients suspected of IEM. METHODS: DBSM and a chemical pathology consultation were ordered through the hospital computer terminals. DBSM detected 29 metabolic disorders. The clinical data and metabolic results for the 12 -month period were reviewed. RESULTS: There were 279 consultations of which 209 were initiated by paediatricians and 70 by adult physicians. The main reasons for consultation were developmental delay, neurological abnormalities, unexplained biochemical abnormalities and monitoring of patients with IEM. There were 158 DBSM requests. One positive case of isovaleric acidaemia was detected.

The Chilean Pension System is composed of two phases. On the accumulation phase, savings are collected and managed by asset managers.

40|$|Abstract Background Patients have {{typically}} received health care through face-to-face encounters. However, expansion of electronic communication and electronic health records (EHRs) provide alternative means for patient and physicians to interact. <b>Electronic</b> <b>consultations</b> may complement regular healthcare by providing “better, faster, cheaper” processes for diagnosing, treating, and monitoring health conditions. Virtual consultation between physicians {{may provide a}} method of streamlining care, potentially saving patients the time and expense of added visits. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare physician usage and patient satisfaction with virtual consultations (VCs) with traditional consultations (TCs) facilitated within an EHR. Methods We conducted an observational case–control survey study within Kaiser Permanente, Colorado. A sample of patients who had VCs requested by physicians (N = 270) were matched with patients who had TCs requested by physicians (N = 270), by patient age, gender, reason for the consult, and specialty department. These patients (VC and TC), were invited to participate in a satisfaction survey. In addition, 205 primary care physicians who submitted a VC or TC were surveyed. Results During the study period, 58, 146 VC or TC were requested (TC = 96. 3 %). Patients who completed a satisfaction survey (267 out of 540 patients, 49. 4 % response rate) indicated they were satisfied with their care, irrespective of the kind of consult (mean 10 -point Likert score of 8. 5). 88 of 205 primary care physicians surveyed (42. 9 %) returned at least one survey; VC and TC survey response rates and consulted departments were comparable (p = 0. 13). More TCs than VCs requested transfer of patient care (p = 0. 03), assistance with diagnosis (p = 0. 04) or initiating treatment (p = 0. 04). Within 3 weeks of the consultation request, 72. 1 % of respondents reported receiving information from VCs, compared with 33. 9 % of the TCs (p Conclusions Referring physicians received information from consultants more quickly from VCs compared with TCs, but the value and application of information from both types of consultations were similar.
