We {{assume that the}} federal government sets emission targets, which are implemented at the national level. We also assume that the <b>economic</b> <b>federation</b> is decentralized, meaning that the national governments are first movers vis-à-vis the federal government. Our results show that each country uses its policy instruments, at least in part, to influence the emission target. This has several implications: first, the commodity taxes do not satisfy the so-called additivity property often emphasized in earlier literature, and, second, it provides an argument for using distortionary labor income taxation. income and commodity taxation, <b>economic</b> <b>federation,</b> environmental policy...|$|R

40|$|In 1991, {{the general}} {{assembly}} of Japanese agricultural cooperatives agreed on an organizational restructuring called the “two level business and administrative reorganization” Under this proposal, prefectural-level federations of agricultural cooperatives were to be abolished and their functions were to {{taken over by the}} national-level federations and business unit associations. The national-level federation was to supervise the business unit associations directly, i. e., so-called “two-level restructuring without middle levels”. Following this decision, the prefectural <b>economic</b> <b>federation</b> of agricultural cooperatives was reorganized into 34 prefectural headquarters under the Zennoh federation (Zennoh integrated type). In 5 prefectures, the former prefectural <b>economic</b> <b>federation</b> of agricultural cooperatives reorganized into 5 agricultural cooperatives; one per prefecture (United one type).

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} redistribution and {{provision of}} public goods in an <b>economic</b> <b>federation</b> with {{two levels of}} government: a local government in each locality and a central government for the <b>economic</b> <b>federation</b> as a whole. We assume that each locality is characterized by two ability-types (high and low), and that their distribution differs between localities. The set of policy instruments facing the central government consists of a nonlinear income tax and a lump-sum transfer to each local government, while the local governments use proportional income taxes and the transfers from the central government to finance the provision of local public goods. The purpose is to characterize the tax and expenditure structure in a decentralized setting, where the central and local governments have distinct roles to play, and also compare this tax and expenditure structure with the second best resource allocation. We show how the redistributive role of taxation is combined with a corrective role, since tax base sharing among the central and local governments {{gives rise to a}} vertical fiscal external effect. In addition, the central government does not in general implement the second best resource allocation with the instruments at its disposal. Fiscal external effects; nonlinear taxation...|$|R

As such, it tries to extend earlier literature on the welfare equivalence of the comprehensive net national product in two main directions, both of which refer to the public sector. One is by considering welfare measurement problems associated with redistributive policy and public good provision, when the public revenues are raised by distortionary taxes. The other is by addressing the consequences of a 'federation-like' decision structure, where independent tax and expenditure decisions are made both by the central government and by lower level governments. In particular, the analysis shows how so called vertical fiscal external effects, which are associated with tax base sharing among the central and lower level governments, contribute to social accounting.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a summary and four papers. The first two papers address political economy and industrial organization aspects of agricultural policy, and the last two international aspects of environmental policy. Paper [1] explains Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies to farmers by the influence of farmer interest-groups with an EU-wide membership. The analysis is based on panel-data for fifteen commodities over the period 1986 - 2003. Because the CAP is set as an overall EU policy, effective lobbying presents a collective action problem to the farmers of the EU as a whole. Indicators of lobbying, {{which are based on}} this perception, are found to explain part of the variation in agricultural support. In Paper [II], the Bresnahan-Lau framework is used to analyze whether policy reforms, i. e. the two-price system (an input quota, 1986 - 1991) and a general deregulation of dairy policy (1991 - 1994) had any market power effects on the Swedish butter market. The results show that the null hypothesis of no market power cannot be rejected, for any of the specific policy reforms, at any reasonable significance level. Paper [III] concerns the welfare consequences of environmental policy cooperation. It is assumed that countries finance their public expenditures by using distortionary taxes, and that they differ with respect to competition in the labor market. It is shown how the welfare effect of an increase in the expenditures on abatement depends on changes in environmental damage, employment and work hours. The welfare effect is also related to the strategic interaction among the countries in the prereform equilibrium. In Paper [IV] environmental policy in an <b>economic</b> <b>federation,</b> where each national government faces a mixed tax problem, is addressed. It is assumed that the federal government sets emission targets, which are implemented at the national level. It is also assumed that the <b>economic</b> <b>federation</b> is decentralized.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of an introductory chapter and four papers, which relate to environmental policy {{in the presence of}} transboundary environmental damage. Paper [I] concerns public policy in a multi-jurisdiction framework with transboundary environmental damage. Each jurisdiction is assumed large in the sense that its government is able to infuence the world-market producer price of the externality-generating good. This gives rise to additional incentives of relevance for national public policy in the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium. With the uncoordinated equilibrium as the reference case, the welfare effects from coordinated changes in public policy variables are analyzed. Paper [II] analyses welfare effects of coordinated changes in environmental and capital taxation in the presence of transboundary environmental externalities and wage bargaining externalities. In the wage bargaining between frms and labor unions, firms use the threat of moving abroad to moderate wage claims, which means that domestic policy infuences wage formation abroad. The specific framework implies welfare effects of policy coordination that correspond to each of the respective international interaction mentioned above. In paper [III], national governments face political pressure from environmental and industrial lobby groups, while pollution taxes are determined in an international negotiation. It is shown that a general increase in the environmental concern and the weight the governments attach to social welfare both tend to increase the pollution tax. However, allowing for asymmetries between the countries means that a general increase in the environmental concern has the potential to reduce the pollution tax. Paper [IV] studies national environmental policies in an <b>economic</b> <b>federation</b> characterized by decentralized leadership. The federal government sets emission targets for each member country, which are implemented by the national governments. Although all national governments have commitment power vis-à-vis the federal government, one of them also has commitment power vis-à-vis the other member countries.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a summary and four papers. The first two concerns health care and sickness absence, and the last two pharmaceutical costs and prices. Paper [I] presents an <b>economic</b> <b>federation</b> model which resembles the situation in, for example, Sweden. In the model the state governments provide health care, the federal government provides a sickness benefit and both levels tax labor income. The {{results show that the}} states can have either an incentive to under- or over-provide health care. The federal government can, by introducing an intergovernmental transfer, induce the state governments to provide the socially optimal amount of health care. In Paper [II] the effect of aggregated public health care expenditure on absence from work due to sickness or disability was estimated. The analysis was based on data from a panel of the Swedish municipalities for the period 1993 - 2004. Public health care expenditure was found to have no statistically significant effect on absence and the standard errors were small enough to rule out all but a minimal effect. The result held when separate estimations were conducted for women and men, and for absence due to sickness and disability. The purpose of Paper [III] was to study the effects of the introduction of fixed pharmaceutical budgets for two health centers in Västerbotten, Sweden. Estimation results using propensity score matching methods show that there are no systematic differences for either price or quantity per prescription between health centers using fixed and open-ended budgets. The analysis was based on individual prescription data from the two health centers and a control group {{both before and after the}} introduction of fixed budgets. In Paper [IV] the introduction of the Swedish substitution reform in October 2002 was used as a natural experiment to examine the effects of increased consumer information on pharmaceutical prices. Using monthly data on individual pharmaceutical prices, the average reduction of prices due to the reform was estimated to four percent for both brand name and generic pharmaceuticals during the first four years after the reform. The results also show that the price adjustment was not instant. vertical fiscal externalities; sickness absence; sickness benefits; health care expenditure; fixed budgets; pharmaceuticals; cost containment; dynamic panel data models; endogeneity; propensity score matching...|$|R
