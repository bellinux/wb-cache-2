5|$|As the Enterprise arrives, {{the crew}} members explore the offerings of Farpoint Station and {{establish}} relations with their Bandi host, Groppler Zorn (Michael Bell). The crew becomes suspicious when items they desire seem to appear out of nowhere moments later, and are unable to identify the power source that feeds the station. Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis), an empath, senses a being with powerful yet despairing emotions nearby, and the crew discover a strange labyrinth beneath the station, but Zorn does not offer an explanation. As the Enterprise crew continues its explorations, a large unknown alien craft enters orbit and begins to fire upon an older Bandi settlement near Farpoint Station, and abducts Zorn. Before Picard orders the ship's phasers to be fired at the craft, Q appears {{to remind him of}} humanity's trial and prompts Picard to send an away team to the alien craft. The away team discovers the craft has passages similar to those under Farpoint and they are able to free Zorn. Their actions cause the alien craft to transform into a jellyfish-like space creature, and Picard is able to deduce the mystery of Farpoint Station. He confirms with the apologetic Zorn that the Bandi found a similar lifeform injured on their planet and, while attempting to care for it, they also exploited its ability to synthesize matter to create Farpoint Station. The creature now in orbit <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> free its mate by attacking those who hold it captive.|$|E

500|$|Alex Chan, 27 {{years old}} at the time of the civil unrest, was a French-born {{freelance}} industrial designer whose parents were Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong. Although Chan was successful professionally, he felt that there was racial and cultural discrimination in France, based on his own previous attempts to find housing and violence directed towards him. He lived in Seine-Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris, near housing projects where rioting had caused the destruction of cars owned by acquaintances. In the aftermath of the unrest, Chan was dissatisfied, stating that [...] "the media, especially in the United States, ... linked what was happening, the riots, to terrorism and put the blame on the Muslim community". Chan wanted instead to depict [...] "more human" [...] rioters who turned to violence in response to racism. According to Chan, the title The French Democracy is meant to be ironic, in that the youths express themselves by rioting rather than through the political system. He elaborated: a shortcut made with The Movies technology about the recent events concerning riots in French suburbs. This movie <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> people have a better understanding of the origin of these events, as some reasons that pushed all this youth to have such violent acts. As a matter of fact TFD offers a sincere inside view from a French citizen who lives in one of these neighborhoods where the riots took place. This fictional documentary is strongly inspired by real events and reactions and tries to make the spectator think more about how French society could and should potentially be.|$|E

Taking off without permission, Blake carries out the aerial testing of the new suit anyway, but when the oxygen regulator fails, he loses consciousness and fatally crashes.

2500|$|The Fanzine's Richard Parks, {{interviewing}} Mikey Heppner, {{noted that}} many of the album's lyrics were threatening in some way; in addition to the aforementioned references to death, other songs have dark subtexts. [...] "Time Will Cut You Down" [...] has a straightforward message of [...] "one frustrated person warning someone else", according to Heppner, while [...] "Talk to Her" [...] seemed according to Parks to be [...] a distorted take on the Beatles song [...] "She Loves You". [...] "In 'She Loves You', the guy <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> his friend who's in a relationship," [...] explained Parks, [...] "but in 'Talk to Her' it becomes a threat - more like, I'm going to take your girl away from you." [...] Heppner remarked that a closer comparison would be to the other Beatles tune [...] "You're Going to Lose That Girl", whose message about losing in a relationship was similarly blunt. Heppner acknowledged that the songs [...] "fit together" [...] with regard to their apparent similarities in subject matter, but denied the presence of an intentional unifying theme around which the songs were written.|$|E
