As our paper is a case study paper, we proved that by implementing this stochastic model in Isfahan kashani Hospital, {{we will have a}} good reduction in overall cost. According to our experiments, if it is possible <b>for</b> <b>hospitals</b> to have short horizon planning, exact method is a very useful optimization method, and it shows that; it is a very good idea {{to take into account the}} emergency cases and also take into account surgeons coefficient factor in using this unique equipment for having better prediction in length of operations. The planning model proposed in this work is useful <b>for</b> <b>hospitals</b> <b>using</b> a “blocked” advance scheduling system, which reserve blocks of OR time to surgical specialties. Each specialty serving elective and emergency surgery demand can use the proposed model for the planning of electives’ cases. Extension of the model to take into account various real-world constraints such as limited overtime capacity, assignment of patient to ORs, different types of ORs, random operating time is a direction of future research.|$|R

The County itself lacked money to convert the old hotel into a hospital, so in 1946 various community leaders {{and representatives of the}} Adventist Church agreed the old hotel should be converted into a hospital. A subsidiary group of the Adventist Church purchased the old hotel building and other buildings on the site from the Federal government in June 1947 at a 100% discount with the provision that $150,000 be raised by October 1947 to be used toward converting the building <b>for</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>use.</b> The Adventist Church spent $400,000 to aid in developing the hospital.

40|$|Background: Pay-for-performance is an {{increasingly}} popular approach to improving health care quality, and the US government will soon implement pay-for-performance in hospitals nationwide. Yet hospital capacity to perform (and improve performance) likely depends on local resources. In this study, we quantify {{the association between}} hospital performance and local economic and human resources, and describe possible implications of pay-for-performance for socioeconomic equity. Methods and Findings: We applied county-level measures of local economic and workforce resources to a national sample of US hospitals (n = 2, 705), during the period 2004 – 2007. We analyzed performance for two common cardiac conditions (acute myocardial infarction [AMI] and heart failure [HF]), using process-of-care measures from the Hospital Quality Alliance [HQA], and isolated temporal trends and the contributions of individual resource dimensions on performance, using multivariable mixed models. Performance scores were translated into net scores <b>for</b> <b>hospitals</b> <b>using</b> the Performance Assessment Model, which has been suggested {{as a basis for}} reimbursement under Medicare’s ‘‘Value-Based Purchasing’’ program. Our analyses showed that hospital performance is substantially associated with local economic and workforce resources. For example, for HF in 2004, hospitals located in counties with longstanding poverty had mean HQA composite scores of 73. 0, compared with a mean of 84. 1 <b>for</b> <b>hospitals</b> in counties without longstanding poverty (p, 0. 001).
