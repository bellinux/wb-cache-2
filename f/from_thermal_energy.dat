50|$|A {{concentration}} cell generates electricity from {{the reduction in}} the thermodynamic free energy of the electrochemical system as the difference in the chemical concentrations in the two half-cells is reduced. The same reaction occurs in the half-cells but in opposite directions, increasing the lower and decreasing the higher concentration. The energy is generated <b>from</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> that the cell absorbs as heat, as the electricity flows. This generation of electricity from ambient thermal energy, without a temperature gradient, is possible because the convergence of the chemical concentrations in the two half-cells increases entropy, and this increase more than compensates for the entropy decrease when heat is converted into electrical energy.|$|E

40|$|Proton therapy uses proton beams with {{energies}} typically between 50 and 230 MeV {{to treat}} cancerous tumors very efficiently, while protecting {{as much as}} possible surrounding healthy tissues from radiation damage. Protons interacting with matter inevitably induce secondary radiation from which all people inside the proton therapy center have to be protected. The ambient dose equivalent H*(10) in such a facility is mainly due to neutrons, which can have energies up to 230 MeV. Although various dose monitoring systems sensitive to high energy neutrons have already been developed, the response function of these detectors is often insufficiently characterized, and so are the calibration factors appropriate for the specific neutron spectra encountered inside a proton therapy facility. In this work, the Monte Carlo code MCNPX 2. 5. 0 has been used to study the response function of the extended-range rem-meter WENDI- 2 <b>from</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>energies</b> up to 5 GeV. A good match has been obtained with equivalent simulation results found in literature. As a first step towards the characterization of the WENDI- 2 response in continuous neutron fields, MCNPX simulations have also been carried out for the case-study of a bunker around an 18 MeV H-cyclotron, which involves neutron fields <b>from</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>energies</b> up to 18 MeV...|$|R
5000|$|The {{result is}} that an {{elastomer}} behaves somewhat like an ideal monatomic gas, inasmuch as (to good approximation) elastic polymers do not store any potential energy in stretched chemical bonds or elastic work done in stretching molecules, when work is done upon them. Instead, all work done on the rubber is [...] "released" [...] (not stored) and appears immediately in the polymer as thermal energy. In the same way, all work that the elastic does on the surroundings results in the disappearance of thermal energy {{in order to do}} the work (the elastic band grows cooler, like an expanding gas). This last phenomenon is the critical clue that the ability of an elastomer to do work depends (as with an ideal gas) only on entropy-change considerations, and not on any stored (i.e., potential) energy within the polymer bonds. Instead, the energy to do work comes entirely <b>from</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>energy,</b> and (as {{in the case of an}} expanding ideal gas) only the positive entropy change of the polymer allows its internal thermal energy to be converted efficiently (100% in theory) into work.|$|E
50|$|It {{might at}} first be {{astonishing}} {{that the work}} done in stretching the polymer chain can be related entirely to the change in entropy of {{the system as a}} result of the stretching. However, this is typical of systems that do not store any energy as potential energy, such as ideal gases. That such systems are entirely driven by entropy changes at a given temperature, can be seen whenever it is the case that are allowed to do work on the surroundings (such as when an elastic band does work on the environment by contracting, or an ideal gas does work on the environment by expanding). Because the free energy change in such cases derives entirely from entropy change rather than internal (potential) energy conversion, in both cases the work done can be drawn entirely <b>from</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> in the polymer, with 100% efficiency of conversion of thermal energy to work. In both the ideal gas and the polymer, this is made possible by a material entropy increase from contraction that makes up for the loss of entropy from absorption of the thermal energy, and cooling of the material.|$|E

40|$|A {{paradigm}} for isothermal, mechanical rectification of stochastic fluctuations is introduced in this paper. The central {{idea is to}} transform energy injected by random perturbations into rigid-body rotational kinetic energy. The prototype considered in this paper is a mechanical system consisting {{of a set of}} rigid bodies in interaction through magnetic fields. The system is stochastically forced by white noise and dissipative through mechanical friction. The Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at a specific temperature defines the unique invariant measure under the flow of this stochastic process and allows us to define ``the temperature'' of the system. This measure is also ergodic and weakly mixing. Although the system does not exhibit global directed motion, it is shown that global ballistic motion is possible (the mean-squared displacement grows like t squared). More precisely, although work cannot be extracted <b>from</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> by the second law of thermodynamics, it is shown that ballistic transport <b>from</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>energy</b> is possible. In particular, the dynamics is characterized by a meta-stable state in which the system exhibits directed motion over random time scales. This phenomenon is caused by interaction of three attributes of the system: a non flat (yet bounded) potential energy landscape, a rigid body effect (coupling translational momentum and angular momentum through friction) and the degeneracy of the noise/friction tensor on the momentums (the fact that noise is not applied to all degrees of freedom).
