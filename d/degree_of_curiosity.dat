5000|$|The {{will to live}} is {{considered}} to be a very basic drive in humans; but not necessarily the main driving force. In psychotherapy, Sigmund Freud termed the pleasure principle, which is the seeking of pleasure and avoiding of pain. Viktor Frankl, after spending time in a German concentration camp, developed psychotherapy called logotherapy, or the will to meaning. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs highlights the innate appetite that people possess for love and belonging but before all this there is the very basic and powerful will to live.Psychologists have established that human beings are a goal-oriented species. In assessing the will to live, it should be borne in mind that it could be augmented or diminished by the relative strength of other simultaneously existent drives. Psychologists generally agree that there is the will to live, the will to pleasure, the will to superiority and the will to connection. There are also usually varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> with regard to what may be termed the will to identity or establishing meaningful personal responses. The will to live is a platform without which it would not be possible to satisfy the other drives. However, this overlooks the possibility that there is a commonality among all creatures that drives all others urges. And that is the need to reproduce and ensure the preservation of the species.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether in a modular technology education (MTE) classroom, gender groupings and learning styles predicted <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curiosity.</b> Based {{on the assumption}} that gender grouping and learning style are factors that influence the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> of both individuals and teams, it was hypothesized that a student’s learning style (i. e., Accommodating, Converging, Diverging, and Assimilating) and gender grouping (girl/girl, boy/boy, and girl/boy) at the module would be essential elements to consider when measuring the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> of learners in MTE classrooms.

50|$|Openness to experience: (inventive/curious vs. consistent/cautious). Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, <b>curiosity,</b> {{and variety}} <b>of</b> experience. Openness {{reflects}} the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> intellectual <b>curiosity,</b> creativity and {{a preference for}} novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as {{the extent to which}} a person is imaginative or independent, and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences, such as skydiving, living abroad, gambling, et cetera. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance, and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — It is {{observed}} that human infants can successfully acquire lexicon; understanding {{the relationship between}} the meaning and the uttered word from only one teaching by care-giver, even though there are many other possible mappings. It is thought that the infants utilize various kinds of cognitive biases for efficient learning. This paper proposes a lexical acquisition model which makes use of curiosity to associate visual features of observed objects with the labels that is uttered by a caregiver. This model is applied to a virtual robot. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> that the robot feels to the objects is determined by the two kinds of saliency; habituation saliency and knowledge one. The former saliency is related to the habituation and the latter one is related to the strength of the association between the visual features and the labels. A robot changes its attention and learning rate based on curiosity. Simulation experiments show that the learning model with curiosity effectively associate the labels with the observed visual features...|$|E

40|$|What can {{we learn}} from the very young? This keynote offers an artist-teacher’s {{perspective}} on children’s spontaneous responses to certain visual images. These images (their own, those by peers, a reproduction and a video) attracted passionate attention and seemed to inspire children to make conceptual leaps in thinking and drawing. What do these examples tell us about visual perception? What do they reveal about factors that prompt children to set themselves new graphic challenges? By unpacking these examples and considering various pictorial repertoires and factors such as visual surprise and defamiliarisation, I hope to provide a window onto kinds of action research that practitioners are uniquely able to undertake. It is a great honour to {{have been invited to}} address this conference. On thinking through what I could offer, I realised that here was an opportunity to revisit certain goose-bump inducing moments that gave me new insights into children’s thinking. I decided my focus today would be on unpacking these moments in order to raise new questions. As a part-time artist-teacher in day care centres I have occasionally observed children suddenly see in certain images something utterly surprising- something that aroused strong feelings. More than that, their findings prompted them into making conceptual leaps in thinking, drawing or painting. It was not simply content that excited them. Other factors were at work too. What were they? These chance observations – made at different times and in various centres – may appear unconnected, yet to me they seem powerfully linked. In each incident, the children seemed to regard the images with the same <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> as they do any unfamiliar object.

Chapter 1 discusses the underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> in human beings, including the major categories <b>of</b> <b>curiosity,</b> curiosity-related emotions and behaviors, and the benefits <b>of</b> <b>curiosity.</b> Chapter 2 reviews the arousal theories <b>of</b> <b>curiosity</b> in psychology and summarizes a general two-step process model for computational curiosity. Base on the perspective of the two-step process model, Chapter 3 reviews and analyzes some of the traditional computational models <b>of</b> <b>curiosity.</b> Chapter 4 introduces a novel generic computational model <b>of</b> <b>curiosity,</b> which is developed based on the arousal theories <b>of</b> <b>curiosity.</b> After the discussion of computational models <b>of</b> <b>curiosity,</b> we outline the important applications where computational curiosity may bring significant impacts in Chapter 5.
