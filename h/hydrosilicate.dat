40|$|Abstract. Radiation {{safety of}} the rooms with X-ray sources often {{achieved}} by means of creating protective coatings. Such coatings are made of special mortar containing barite. There is the alternative for barite – barium <b>hydrosilicates.</b> It is advisable to synthesize barium <b>hydrosilicates</b> from available components – sodium <b>hydrosilicates</b> and soluble salts of barium. To improve {{the effectiveness of the}} protective coatings the composition and technology of the shielding material is recommended. In this work the synthesis was carried out by means of precipitation the barium <b>hydrosilicates</b> from solution of sodium <b>hydrosilicates</b> and barium chloride. It is found that composition of the synthesized product obtained by precipitation of sodium <b>hydrosilicates</b> with barium chloride contains barium <b>hydrosilicates,</b> barium carbonate and silicic acid. This is due to technological processes: intensive mixing of solutions leads to air entrapment. The properties of the composite binder made of portland cement and barium <b>hydrosilicates</b> are examined.

40|$|Abstract. The {{volumetric}} rate of filler {{affects the}} type and structure of chemical products emerging during the hardening process of binders and composites based on barium <b>hydrosilicates.</b> It is shown that by means of using the inert filler {{it is possible to}} change the composition of the hardened material. In particular, instead of BaO· 2 SiO 2 · 4 Н 2 О formation, the formation of Ba 5 [Si 4 O 12](OH) 2 can occur. This is due to steric effects and extra amount of the barium cations near the particles of fine filler. It is revealed also that the increase of the filling rate leads to the formation of crystal form of barium <b>hydrosilicates.</b> Such <b>hydrosilicates</b> are characterized by increased interfacial distance. These phenomena prove the presence of the steric effects. However, the chemical reaction of binder (water glass) with hardener (barium chloride) proceeds completely to the end. Thus, neither barium chloride nor sodium <b>hydrosilicates</b> are present in hardened composite. Because of this, disperse filled binders based on barium <b>hydrosilicates</b> (products of reaction between water glass and barium chloride) can be considered as a promising component for effective composites intended for protection from gamma-and neutron radiation...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{examination}} of the structure formation process undergoing in {{the system composed of}} sodium <b>hydrosilicates</b> and barium chloride are presented in the paper. It is proven that the process of initial structure formation comprises two stages. During the first stage, the primary frame structure of barium <b>hydrosilicates</b> is formed. It is followed by the process of restructuring accompanied by the dissolution of the silica acid and formation of barium <b>hydrosilicates.</b> Later, <b>hydrosilicates</b> consolidate and reinforce the material. Results of optical examinations are confirmed by the study of the rheological characteristics of the mixture. Methodology of identification of the moment of initiation and completion of the hardening process together with duration of primary and secondary frame formation is developed on the basis of theoretical rheological curves. Time intervals of initial structurization are revealed for the system comprising sodium <b>hydrosilicates</b> and a modified curing agent in the event of different amounts of admixtures. Time intervals and average rates of structurization are also identified for each stage of the process.

40|$|AbstractThe {{lime putty}} is a non-Newtonian fluid {{that can be}} either {{thixotropic}} or rheopectic depending on burning process of the lime, {{the presence of the}} quartz sand and other parameters. One of the most important lime putty characteristics is its plasticity which affects its workability and use. It is possible to increase the lime putty plasticity by mechanical activation. This work focuses on the effect of the mechanical activation of the lime putty on its rheological behavior and on properties of lime <b>hydrosilicate</b> autoclaved materials. Fresh lime putty was activated in a high-speed mixer at 1000 RPM for 1, 3, 5 and 10 minutes. Non-activated lime putties show rheopectic behavior. Rheopectic behavior becomes slightly more distinct after 1 min. of activation and then less distinct with increasing time of activation. After 10 min. of activation, the system shows no time-dependent properties, nor even slight thixotropic behavior. This trend can be related to process where smaller and smaller aggregates are fragmented in the suspension. The <b>hydrosilicate</b> materials were prepared in two series from quicklime and finely ground sand with the ratio C/S 0. 85, under hydrothermal conditions. The amount of xonotlite in <b>hydrosilicate</b> material increases with activation time as the increased amount of portlandite particles retards the reaction. 11. 3 Å tobermorite crystallizes more slowly and formation of xonotlite is accelerated...|$|E

40|$|The {{cordierite}} was synthesized by two unconventional methods: 1) {{the method}} which uses <b>hydrosilicate</b> precursors and 2) the method which uses organic precursors. Comparison of these synthesis methods with the classical {{one is the}} main subject of the presented paper. The influence of Li 2 O on the cordierite phase formation was investigated too. The results {{have suggested that the}} method which uses <b>hydrosilicate</b> precursors provides the SiO 2 linkage as magnesium metasilicate, but is not adequate for the cordierite synthesis. Only in the presence of Li 2 O considerably amount of the μ-cordierite modification was formed, confirming the mineralizing effect of this oxide. In addition, the results have clearly demonstrated that the method which uses organic precursors is suitable for the cordierite synthesis. Thus, even without mineralizer it can be used for the preparation of the almost pure α-cordierite at 1200 °C.

The catalysts were prepared by homogeneous deposition-precipitation. It was found that Cu- 0 particles were formed {{on the surface of}} a layered <b>hydrosilicate</b> with the zincsilite structure upon reduction with hydrogen. The reoxidation of the reduced samples with a mixture of oxygen and an inert gas, which contained no more than 0. 05 vol % O- 2, resulted in the formation of individual Cu 2 O and CuO phases; copper ions did not return to the <b>hydrosilicate</b> structure. Catalytic tests of Cu-Zn-Si catalysts in methanol synthesis indicate that the specific catalytic activity of copper metal particles grows linearly with increasing zinc loading. This fact suggests that copper metal particles, which were obtained by the reduction of Cu 2 + ions from the copper-zinc hydroxo silicate with the zincsilite structure, were responsible for activity in methanol synthesis. Consequently, the ability to return copper ions to a precursor compound in reoxidation with oxygen at low concentrations, which is known for reduced Cu/ZnO catalysts (these catalysts are highly active in methanol synthesis), is not related to the catalytic activity in methanol synthesis...|$|E

The possibility to enhance the manufacturability and operational properties of concretes results in significant reduction of overall operating costs. Many enhancement methods have been elaborated. Among them there is one based on introduction of calcium <b>hydrosilicates</b> into construction composition. The authors set up a hypothesis that similarity between properties and structures of different <b>hydrosilicates</b> (for example, alkaline earth metals and metals of the second group) will provide similar increased operational characteristics. The specialists of Research and Educational Center «Nanotechnology» are developing cement composites nanomodification methods which include introduction of nanodimensional barium <b>hydrosilicates</b> particles.

40|$|Construction of {{concrete}} road paving which {{was started in}} the 30 -ies {{of the last century}} in the United States has proved its perspectiveness from the viewpoint of service life. In addition to that an analysis of road usage has shown that concrete paving is a deformation tendency due to some reasons and the tendency entails some difficulties in their repair after rather long operation. The deformations appear more intensively after 5 - 10 -year road operational period. The following negative effects are practically unavoidable: micro-crack formation, scaling, deformation due to freezing of angular edges in concrete plates, destruction of deformation joints etc. The defects are characterized by rather large scope and they are present practically on all the roads. It is necessary to note the fact that a great number of the above-mentioned defects can be avoided on the condition that measures on strengthening surface layer {{of concrete}} paving will be undertaken in time. The measures presuppose application of impregnating method while using compositions that contain hydrophobisator and silicon dioxide sol. Industry-produced potassium methyl siliconate, oligomethyl hydride siliconate, tetraethoxysilane have been used as hydrophobisator and they form not easily soluble film on the surface of concrete pores which prevents penetration of water into concrete.

The PGE are associated with base metal sulphides in the uppermost pyroxenites of the Ultramafic Sequence of the Great Dyke. The following minerals have been indentified: bismuthotellurides (moncheite, maslovite, michenerite, kotulskite and polarite); arsenides (sperrylite); and sulphides and sulpharsenides (cooperite, laurite, braggite and hollingworthite). Platinum Group Minerals (PGM) occur in three distinct extural environments: (1) at the boundary of sulphides and silicates/hydrosilicates, (2) entirely enclosed within sulphides, and (3) entirely enclosed within silicate or <b>hydrosilicate</b> minerals. The stratigraphic distribution, environments and textures of the PGM have important genetic implications, and cannot be explained by a single process. A multi-process model for the petrogenesis of the PGE mineralisation in terms of complexation and intermediate compound formation is proposed.

Because of this, ensuring the biological safety in buildings is becoming more and more important today. The preferred way to guarantee the biological safety of a building is to employ modern building materials that prevent the settlement of the fungi colonies on the inner surfaces of walls. Such building materials can be produced using novel biocidal modifiers that allow controlling the number of microorganisms on the surface and in the bulk of a composite construction. The precipitation product of zinc <b>hydrosilicates</b> and sodium sulfate is one of the mentioned modifiers. Till now, the exact chemical composition of such precipitation product is controversial; it is obvious, though, that the efficacy of the biocidal modifier is mostly determined by the type of the copper compounds.

Such an approach consists in the examination of the modifier’s composition by means of different, yet complementary, research methods: X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and DTA.
