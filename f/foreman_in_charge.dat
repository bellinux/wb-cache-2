House does not fire Brennan because he did what he believed, but he tells him to quit instead, stating he is ethically insane, while notifying Foreman to call the authorities. After expressing apparent anger with the question, [...] "Who the hell did I leave in charge?"

50|$|In early 1855, William {{worked on}} William Skene's Kanawalla Station (Hensley Park) on the Wannon River near Hamilton. He {{returned}} to Ballarat in April 1855 and {{towards the end}} of the year he began to study surveying. He was appointed as an amateur to the office of John Hamlet Taylor, Acting District Surveyor in the Ballarat Survey Office on Sturt Street. William spent several months learning trigonometry, Euclid drawing and geometry and then in 1856 he went on to learn field-surveying. He started his practical experience at Glendaruel, near Tourello, where he worked under the supervision of Frederick John Byerly, Assistant Surveyor, on ₤150 p.a. plus board. In February 1857 he was working at Bullarook Creek Camp and in March 1857 he was surveying at Kingower near Inglewood. In the middle of 1857 he was promoted to <b>foreman</b> and placed <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of a field party and his salary increased to ₤185 p.a. From April to June 1858 he was surveying at St Arnaud. His field party contract was terminated in June and he returned to Ballarat in July and took occasional contracts surveying for Clement Hodgkinson, the Deputy Surveyor General.|$|R

Construction was undertaken by J V Hamilton & L F Weldon of the Public Works Department, Nicosia. The main structure was built of Yerolakkos sandstone, with harder sandstone from Limassol used for the staircases. Construction was completed in 1937, at a total cost of £70,000. Among the Palace's most prominent features are the British coat-of-arms, and four gargoyles with human heads depicting the British General <b>Foreman</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of construction, the head mason, the head carpenter, and an unknown labourer.The building was originally named Government House; in 1960, it was renamed the Presidential Palace.|$|E

5000|$|Drag racer Casey Alfonso {{experiences}} {{blurred vision}} and distorted hearing after she develops a seizure following a race. Sent to Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, House takes the case, hoping that by solving it, {{he will be}} able to test drive a dragster, but Foreman does not believe her symptoms are life-threatening, suggesting she is simply suffering from heatstroke. When an agent from the CIA recruits House to help diagnose a mortally ill agent named [...] "John", House puts <b>Foreman</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the fellowship candidates and the case. Foreman reiterates his heatstroke diagnosis to Casey, until she suffers a second seizure and a vertical nystagmus.

5000|$|Since Foreman's {{return to}} Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital, {{it has been}} shown that House still holds a great deal of respect for Foreman. In stark {{contrast}} to previous seasons, he tends to treat Foreman as an equal in his understanding of diagnostics and Foreman in return shows a marked regret at having quit the job in the first place. In [...] "Whatever It Takes", House reprimands his new fellowship candidates when they fail to listen to Foreman's instructions while House is away. House tells the candidates that the reason he left <b>Foreman</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> was because Foreman knows what he's doing and that they should listen to him next time. Later, in [...] "No More Mr. Nice Guy" [...] Foreman believes he is not getting the respect he deserves from Kutner, Taub and Thirteen when he tries, and fails, to do their performance reviews, which he believes is due to House frequently humiliating him. House replies that if he did not humiliate and taunt Foreman, he would not be strong and able enough to handle the rest of the team. In future episodes, Foreman was considered to be in charge whenever House is unavailable. He is also the primary attending physician whenever House is legally unable to do so, such as when House's license was suspended at the beginning of season 6, or when House was recovering from a bus crash and drug overdose while diagnosing Amber.|$|E
40|$|In an {{era where}} the {{discovery}} and development of new medicine have hit its peak, areas of study that generate new thinking and related opportunity for medicine development are of great value. Society requires new medicine as an expanding ageing population {{in the developed world}} and the emergence of Western world diseases in the developing world place pressure on our global healthcare capability. Here we explore the possible meaning of elite sport to global, cutting edge medical advance. Why the elite sports industry might drive such advance? We believe that there are two broad areas to do this: 1. Discovery of bioactive molecules with medicine development potential based upon the exploration of the molecular basis of responses to exercise and physical activity and area of research endeavor known as mechanotransduction. This area of study has revealed the incredible potential for a range of naturally occurring molecules to maintain musculoskeletal health and has identified some of the key cell types responsible for orchestrating the beneficial responses. In particular, the bone resident osteocyte has been transformed from a little studies quiescent cell type into the <b>foreman</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of bone shape, size, and strength and also distant kidney function. 2. The clinical need generated by sport injuries in the elite competing population. Injury in this professional group has greater meaning then in the amateur sports person in terms of both earnings and career progression. The generation of novel medicine and therapies is of great value and includes the emerging clinical specialty of regenerative medicine. This specialty includes the use of cell-based therapies and is emerging fast. At its best, a cellbased therapy will not just treat a clinical condition; rather, it will cure it. Instead of requiring multiple doses over extended periods to control a clinical condition, one dose will cure the condition through the establishment of live cells in the tissues of need. The future holds medical promise and a little acknowledged role that elite sport plays important role in the realization of that promise might well represent a legitimate area for clinical therapy discovery...|$|E
