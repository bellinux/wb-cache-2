5|$|Meteor showers {{should be}} predictable, but some meteors are cometary debris and so require {{calculations}} of orbits which are currently <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> complete. Other events noted by ancients include aurorae, sun dogs and rainbows {{all of which}} are as <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> predict as the ancient weather, but nevertheless may have been considered important phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} {{evolution}} equations is intimately tied in with {{another aspect of}} general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, {{it turns out to}} be <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> localize that energy.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Westerfield {{released}} her guest's bull-neck {{at the word}} of command. It was <b>impossible</b> not <b>to</b> submit to him--he was so brutal. <b>Impossible</b> not <b>to</b> admire him--he was so big.|$|R

5|$|A Canadian roughhouser {{with the}} mutant ability to sense others with {{enhanced}} animal-like senses, heal rapidly from numerous injuries (which makes his age <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> determine) and wield three claws extending past {{the bridge of}} each knuckle, who has lived for fifteen years without memory of his past apart from his dog tags and an adamantium-encased skeleton.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Tatsuguchi left for his new assignment, the IJA {{delivered}} a lock of his hair to Taeko. The IJA did this whenever soldiers were sent to a high-risk combat area in case the soldier was killed and it proved <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> repatriate the remains for proper funeral rites.|$|E

5000|$|In 2015, {{there was}} a major {{explosion}} of zebra mussels in Lake Winnipeg, the reduction of which is next <b>to</b> <b>impossible</b> due <b>to</b> a lack of natural predators in the lake. The mussels are devastating to the ecological opportunities of the lake.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{some early}} adopters, the 808 was a {{commercial}} failure {{and fewer than}} 12,000 units were sold. Roland ended production in 1983 after semiconductor improvements made the faulty transistors that were essential to its design <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> restock.|$|E
5|$|During Fiscal Year 2009, {{the city}} {{assessed}} property owners {{a total of}} $37 million for property taxes. However, the Mayor's Office expects $1 million of this assessment to be difficult or <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> collect. Revenues of $36 million were recognized, because {{this portion of the}} assessment was available and measurable within the current period.|$|E

5|$|Eyre {{is thought}} to have been passing through the Toolinna Cove sand patch at the time of writing. B.epica and B.media are the only Banksia species that occur at that location, and both have a form and habit that accords with Eyre's description. As he did not collect specimens, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} what species he saw.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not <b>impossible,</b> <b>to</b> access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{examination}} of any trace evidence {{is based upon}} Locard's exchange principle. This states that every contact leaves a trace. In practice, even though a transfer of material has taken place, it may be <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> detect, because the amount transferred is very small.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{describe}} how to decide a n-gram is actually impossible in a language. We use decision rules on a corpus tagged with POS. These rules {{are based on}} statistics and phonological criteria. In terms of statistical language modeling, deciding that a n-gram is <b>impossible</b> leads <b>to</b> assign to it a null probability. We defer on the possible n-grams the released mass of probabilities. To do this, we deﬁne a new formulation of P(w|h). We apply the principle of <b>impossible</b> events <b>to</b> bigrams. Then we use the list of <b>impossible</b> bigrams <b>to</b> build a list of impossible trigrams. The new trigram model exceeds the baseline model by 5. 53 % in terms of perplexity...|$|R

5|$|In the C++ {{programming}} language, decltype is {{a keyword}} used to query {{the type of}} an expression.
