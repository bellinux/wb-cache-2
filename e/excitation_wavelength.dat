40|$|Multiphoton {{microscopy}} {{relies on}} nonlinear light-matter interactions to provide contrast and optical sectioning capability for high-resolution imaging. Most multiphoton microscopy studies in biological systems {{have relied on}} two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) to produce images. With increasing applications of multiphoton microscopy to thick-tissue "intravital" imaging, second-harmonic generation (SHG) from structural proteins {{has emerged as a}} potentially important new contrast mechanism. However, SHG is typically detected in transmission mode, thus limiting TPEF/SHG coregistration and its practical utility for in vivo thick-tissue applications. In this study, we use a broad range of <b>excitation</b> <b>wavelengths</b> (730 - 880 nm) to demonstrate that TPEF/SHG coregistration can easily be achieved in unstained tissues by using a simple backscattering geometry. The combined TPEF/SHG technique was applied to imaging a three-dimensional organotypic tissue model (RAFT). The structural and molecular origin of the image-forming signal from the various tissue constituents was determined by simultaneous spectroscopic measurements and confirming immunofluorescence staining. Our results show that at shorter <b>excitation</b> <b>wavelengths</b> (< 800 nm), the signal emitted from the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a combination of SHG and TPEF from collagen, whereas at longer <b>excitation</b> <b>wavelengths</b> the ECM signal is exclusively due to SHG. Endogenous cellular signals are consistent with TPEF spectra of cofactors NAD(P) H and FAD at all <b>excitation</b> <b>wavelengths.</b> The reflected SHG intensity follows a quadratic dependence on the excitation power, decays exponentially with depth, and exhibits a spectral dependence in accordance with previous theoretical studies. The use of SHG and TPEF in combination provides complementary information that allows noninvasive, spatially localized in vivo characterization of cell-ECM interactions in unstained thick tissues...|$|R

Fluores-cence spectroscopy has potential {{to bridge the gap}} be-tween clinical examination and invasive biopsy; however, optimal <b>excitation</b> <b>wavelengths</b> have not yet been deter-mined. The goals of this study were to determine optimal excitation–emission wavelength combinations to discrim-inate normal and precancerous/cancerous tissue, and es-timate the performance of algorithms based on fluores-cence. Fluorescence excitation–emission matrices (EEM) were measured in vivo from 62 sites in nine normal vol-unteers and 11 patients with a known or suspected pre-malignant or malignant oral cavity lesion. Using these data as a training set, algorithms were developed based on combinations of emission spectra at various <b>excitation</b> <b>wavelengths</b> to determine which <b>excitation</b> <b>wavelengths</b> contained the most diagnostic information. A second val-idation set of fluorescence EEM was measured in vivo from 281 sites in 56 normal volunteers and three patients with a known or suspected premalignant or malignant oral cavity lesion. Algorithms developed in the training set were applied without change to data from the vali-dation set to obtain an unbiased estimate of algorithm performance. Optimal <b>excitation</b> <b>wavelengths</b> for detec-tion of oral neoplasia were 350, 380 and 400 nm. Using only a single emission wavelength of 472 nm, and 350 and 400 nm excitation, algorithm performance in the training set was 90 % sensitivity and 88 % specificity and in the validation set was 100 % sensitivity, 98 % specific-ity.
