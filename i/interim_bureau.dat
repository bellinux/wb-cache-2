2500|$|The {{interval}} witnessed renewed republican agitation, {{during which}} Nicolae Fleva openly sided with revolutionary politics. In 1883, {{when members of}} his party hoped to obtain Carol's resignation, he instructed {{the public about the}} right of revolution. His speech was reviewed in 2012 by academic Codrin Liviu Cuțitaru as a classic misinterpretation of that principle, since it validated a permanent [...] "state of revolt" [...] among those who felt disenfranchised. Fleva's position as deputy was reconfirmed in the 1883 national elections, and again in the 1884 vote. These were the first-ever elections to be carried under a new electoral law, pushed by the core group of National Liberal, and extending representation and disestablishing the 4th Electoral College. By then, the [...] "Tribune" [...] had his fief in Bucharest, and his appeal there propelled him to the office of Mayor during the local election of 1884. However, he also benefited from Eugeniu Stătescu's withdrawal from the National Liberal caucus, which propelled Fleva to head of the electoral list. Fleva did not replace an active Mayor, but rather took his seat from an <b>interim</b> <b>bureau,</b> presided upon by M. Török.|$|E

50|$|The {{increase}} in coastal trade along the Atlantic seaboard {{after the civil}} war and the purchase of Alaska in 1867 {{had a significant impact on}} the development of the Revenue Cutter Service. Demands by the public to do something about losses in lives and property at sea prompted Secretary of the Treasury George S. Boutwell, under President Ulysses S. Grant, to reorganize the service. He appointed N. Broughton Devereux on 1 July 1869 as chief of an <b>interim</b> Revenue Marine <b>Bureau</b> that included the Revenue Cutter Service, the Steamboat Inspection Service, the Marine Hospital Service and the Life-Saving Service. Devereaux appointed two boards to study the problems facing the service; one investigated personnel requirements, the other analyzed the requirements for the cutter fleet.The fleet board produced a study that was presented to Congress on 26 May 1870, the result of which was that of the twenty-four steaming cutters in the service, four were harbor tugs, six were stationed on the Great Lakes and the remaining steaming cutters were stationed in the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The harbor tugs were left where they were stationed and all of the lake cutters were recommended for repair and stayed located where they were except for one which was home-ported in a different city. All of the steaming coastal cutters except for two were a successful side-wheel design which were retained. The board recommended keeping only one of the propeller driven steam cutters, the USRC Mahoning. Of the twelve sail cutters in the fleet, only five of the most seaworthy were recommended by the board to be retained. Devereaux's report to Congress included a request for four new steam cutters: a large propeller-driven ship, a large side-wheeler and two smaller side-wheelers. Recommendations were made as to the types of engines to be used on various cutters and all were to be equipped with sails to save on coal consumption. Additionally, Devereaux requested $125,000 to cover the unexpected costs of operating cutters Lincoln, Wayanda and Reliance in Alaskan waters during 1869.|$|R
