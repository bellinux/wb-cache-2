Details are presented on the efficiency of energy transfer, the dependence of laser performance on input energy deposition, circuit parameters and gas mixture. The F atom production rate is estimated from the linear dependence of the specific output energy on the electric charge passed through the discharge. Output energies of 135 mJ were obtained at 1. 2 % efficiency from a small active discharge of 10 cm(3) volume and 38 cm length. These values compare favourably with the values reported for similar laser systems, while the maximum values of specific input and output energy extraction obtained, of 1700 and 15 J/l respectively, are among the highest reported for non-chain-reaction type gas mixtures.

40|$|Abstract. The {{validity}} of the adiabatic-nuclear-rotation theory of electron-molecule scattering is assessed for near-threshold rotational excitation of Hz. Integrated and differential cross sections calculated using this theory are compared with those determined using the more accurate laboratory frame close-coupling theory. A recently proposed energy-modified adiabatic theory is tested and shown to lead to marked improvement in the approximate integrated (but not differential) cross sections. Accurate cross sections for the excitation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of small molecules by low-energy electron impact are required {{for a wide range}} of applications, from e-beam initiated <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lasers</b> to models of planetary atmospheres. Theoretical calculations of cross sections for ro-vibrational excitation rely heavily on the adiabatic nuclei (AN) theory (Lane 1980). Indeed, use of this theory, instead of the more accurate laboratory frame close-coupling (LFCC) method, is necessary for all but the simplest systems by the huge number of target states that are energetically accessible and by the substantial partial-wave coupling that obtains at low energies.

An analytical method is used to investigate the spatial overlap between the distributions of laser mode intensity and the medium gain and cavity loss, and its effect on mode.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} a short {{review of the}} main progresses achieved at the GANIL facilities during {{the last thirty years}} in the field of ion-atom and ion-diatomic molecule collisions. Thanks to the wide range of projectile energies and species available on the different beam lines of the facility, elementary processes such as electron capture, ionization and excitation have been extensively studied. Beside primary collision mechanisms, the relaxation processes of the collision partners after the collision have been another specific source of interest. Progresses on other fundamental processes such as Young type interferences induced by ion-molecule collisions or shake off ionization resulting from nuclear beta decay are also presented. 1. Introduction For the electronic structures of atoms and molecules, precise theoretical knowledge and high-resolution experimental data are available. But the complete understanding of dynamic processes in atomic collisions remains a challenge, due to large theoretical problems in describing time-dependent many-particle reactions, and to experimental difficulties in performing complete experiments in which all relevant quantities are accessible. Elementary collisions involving ions, atoms and molecules {{play an important role in}} many gaseous and plasma environments, where they provide both the heating and cooling mechanisms. The study of such collisions is thus not only of fundamental importance, it is also essential for the understanding of large-scale systems such as astrophysical plasmas, planetary atmospheres, <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lasers,</b> semiconductor processing plasmas, and fusion plasmas. Collisions between ions and atoms (or simple molecules) give also access to the elementary processes responsible for energy transfer in ion-matter and ion-biological molecule collisions.
