5|$|One skull, {{assigned}} to Triceratops, was observed {{to have a}} <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the jugal {{which appears to be}} a puncture wound that was sustained while this individual was still alive. This is supported by signs of healing that are present in the bone around the supposed wound. When examined closely, the <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the bone has a diameter that is very similar to diameter of the distal end of a Triceratops horn. This, and other apparent healed wounds in the skulls of ceratopsians, has been cited as evidence of non-fatal intraspecific competition in these dinosaurs.|$|E

40|$|Many {{kinds of}} {{recently}} developed materials are {{very hard and}} brittle, {{and it is very}} difficult and expensive to process them. Thus, it is necessary to develop an easier and more economical method to process these materials. As an example, punching <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> sheet glass was studied. Because punching <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> sheet glass by ordinary methods is impossible, we present a method for punching <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> sheet glass under static high pressure.

5|$|There {{are also}} three {{swimming}} holes, known collectively as the Powder Hole, on Big Wapwallopen Creek.

Between 1986 and 2001, at least three people died at the swimming holes and three others were severely injured.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear <b>hole</b> <b>in</b> the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of <b>holes</b> created <b>in</b> vertically vibrated dense suspensions and viscous Newtonian liquids. We find that all holes oscillate with the driving frequency, with a phase shift of π/ 2. <b>In</b> Newtonian liquids <b>holes</b> always close, while <b>in</b> suspensions <b>holes</b> may grow <b>in</b> time. We present a lubrication model for the closure of <b>holes</b> which is <b>in</b> good agreement with the experiments in Newtonian liquids. The growth rate of growing <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> suspensions is found to scale with the particle diameter over the suspending liquid viscosity. Comparing closing <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> Newtonian liquids to growing <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> dense suspensions we find a sinusoidal, linear response in the first, and a highly non-linear one in the latter. Moreover, the symmetry of the oscillation is broken and is shown to provide {{an explanation for the}} observation that <b>holes</b> <b>in</b> dense suspensions can grow...|$|R

5|$|Attempts by law {{enforcement}} to investigate conditions at Gold Base have been blocked by legal difficulties and the unwillingness {{of those on the}} base to talk to the police. According to Lawrence Wright, who wrote an account of the <b>Hole</b> <b>in</b> his 2013 book , the Riverside County sheriff's office has never received a complaint from someone at the base about their treatment there, despite the many accounts of mistreatment. Wright attributes this to the fear that many Scientologists have of bringing shame upon Scientology and of being forced to break off contact with their families and friends.|$|E
