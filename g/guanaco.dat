5|$|In 2007, Peng Cui of the Chinese Academy of Sciences {{and colleagues}} {{carried out a}} phylogenetic study of the {{evolutionary}} relationships between the two tribes of Camelidae; Camelini – consisting of the three Camelus species (the study considered the wild Bactrian camel as a subspecies of the Bactrian camel) – and Lamini, which consists of the alpaca (Vicugna pacos), the <b>guanaco</b> (Lama guanicoe), the llama (L. glama) and the vicuña (V. vicugna). The study showed the two tribes had diverged 25 million years ago (early Miocene), earlier than previously estimated from North American fossils.|$|E
5|$|In South America, {{especially}} in Patagonia, {{there is an}} active modern sheep industry. Sheep keeping was largely introduced through immigration to the continent by Spanish and British peoples, for whom sheep were a major industry during the period. South America has {{a large number of}} sheep, but the highest-producing nation (Brazil) kept only just over 15 million head in 2004, far fewer than most centers of sheep husbandry. The primary challenges to the sheep industry in South America are the phenomenal drop in wool prices in the late 20th century and the loss of habitat through logging and overgrazing. The most influential region internationally is that of Patagonia, which has been the first to rebound from the fall in wool prices. With few predators and almost no grazing competition (the only large native grazing mammal is the <b>guanaco),</b> the region is prime land for sheep raising. The most exceptional area of production is surrounding the La Plata river in the Pampas region. Sheep production in Patagonia peaked in 1952 at more than 21 million head, but has steadily fallen to fewer than ten today. Most operations focus on wool production for export from Merino and Corriedale sheep; the economic sustainability of wool flocks has fallen with the drop in prices, while the cattle industry continues to grow.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We studied abundance, habitat use {{and social}} structureofan isolatedpopulationof <b>guanacos</b> in theLihue Calel National Park in central Argentina, {{based on data}} from foot surveys during 1998 – 2000. Based on {{topography}} and vegetation characteristics we distinguished three types of habitat: hills, valleys and piedmonts, and lowlands. Three types of social groups were observed: solitary males, family groups and male groups. The <b>guanacos</b> used hills preferentially, followed by valley and piedmont. The <b>guanacos</b> avoided the lowlands where the vegetation is dense. Habitat selection, both on a coarse and a fine scale, could be explained by habitat quality and possibly also predator avoidance behaviour. Abundance of <b>guanacos</b> increased by 21 % over the 3 -year-study period. However, the specificity of habitat requirements of <b>guanacos</b> and the susceptibility of the study area to wildfires could cause <b>guanacos</b> to move into sub-optimal areas were they are more vulnerable to predation and human persecution...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the species}} is still {{considered}} wild, around 300 <b>guanacos</b> are in US zoos and around 200 are registered in private herds. [...] <b>Guanacos</b> are the parent species of the domesticated llama.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to compare the}} diet composition of <b>guanacos</b> (Lama guanicoe) and sheep (Ovis aries) when pastured on improved and unimproved Agrostis spp. /Festuca spp. dominated grassland typical of the UK uplands. Samples were collected from oesophageal fistulated <b>guanacos</b> and sheep grazing experimental plots that had been grazed previously by either sheep or <b>guanacos.</b> Sward composition and herbage biomass were determined for each plot using quadrat cuts. The sward composition and diet composition results obtained were used to calculate selectivity indices for individual dietary components. Green leaf of broad-leaved grasses was the main dietary component for both animal species on both the improved and unimproved grasslands. In general, the <b>guanacos</b> consumed less green grass leaf and more dead grass leaf than the sheep. Their diets also contained significantly more Nardus stricta than sheep diets. The sheep diets contained significantly more Trifolium repens, which was consistently avoided by the <b>guanacos.</b> Only one dicotyledonous species (Cirsium palustre) was consistently selected by the <b>guanacos.</b> There were fewer between-species differences in diet composition on the previously sheep-grazed plots than on the previously guanaco-grazed plotsPeer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|The <b>guanaco</b> (Lama guanicoe), the cougar, the Patagonian fox (Lycalopex griseus), the Patagonian hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus humboldtii), and the Magellanic {{tuco-tuco}} (Ctenomys magellanicus; a subterranean rodent) are {{the most}} characteristic mammals of the Patagonian plains. The Patagonian steppe {{is one of the}} last strongholds of the <b>guanaco</b> and Darwin's rheas (Rhea pennata), which had been hunted for their skins by the Tehuelches, on foot using boleadoras, before the diffusion of firearms and horses; they were formerly the chief means of subsistence for the natives, who hunted them on horseback with dogs and bolas. Vizcachas (Lagidum spp.) and the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum) are also characteristic of the steppe and the Pampas to the north.|$|E
25|$|Fatal {{infection}} of an alpaca (Lama pacos) with an unnamed species has been reported. Findings included disseminated eosinophilic myositis, abortion and haemoabdomen. The myositis {{was associated with}} hameorrhage, necrosis and degeration. Infection by S. tilopodi of muscle tissue in the <b>Guanaco</b> has been reported.|$|E

50|$|<b>Guanacos</b> {{are one of}} {{the largest}} wild mammal species found in South America (along with the manatee, the Amazon river dolphin, the tapir, and the jaguar). Natural predators include cougars, jaguars, and foxes. <b>Guanacos</b> often spit when threatened.|$|R
50|$|<b>Guanacos</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} common mammals found in the park. Other mammals include foxes and pumas. It is also home to the {{endangered}} Chilean Huemul. The puma's predation on <b>guanacos</b> in the park has been studied.|$|R
25|$|Chile's {{geographical}} isolation has {{restricted the}} immigration of faunal life, {{so that only}} a few of the many distinctive South American animals are found. Among the larger mammals are the puma or cougar, the llama-like <b>guanaco</b> and the fox-like chilla. In the forest region, several types of marsupials and a small deer known as the pudu are found.|$|E
25|$|The llama and alpaca {{are only}} {{known in the}} {{domestic}} state, and are variable in size and of many colors, being often white, brown, or piebald. Some are grey or black. The <b>guanaco</b> and vicuña are wild, the former being endangered, and of a nearly uniform light-brown color, passing into white below. They certainly differ from each other, the vicuña being smaller, more slender in its proportions, and having a shorter head than the <b>guanaco.</b> The vicuña lives in herds on the bleak and elevated parts of the mountain range bordering the region of perpetual snow, amidst rocks and precipices, occurring in various suitable localities throughout Peru, {{in the southern part}} of Ecuador, and as far south as the middle of Bolivia. Its manners very much resemble those of the chamois of the European Alps; it is as vigilant, wild, and timid. The fiber is extremely delicate and soft, and highly valued for the purposes of weaving, but the quantity that each animal produces is minimal.|$|E
25|$|Argentine Patagonian cuisine {{is largely}} {{the same as}} the cuisine of Buenos Aires – grilled meats and pasta – with {{extensive}} use of local ingredients and less use of those products which have to be imported into the region. Lamb is considered the traditional Patagonian meat, grilled for several hours over an open fire. Some guide books have reported that game, especially <b>guanaco</b> and introduced deer and boar, are popular in restaurant cuisine. However, since the <b>guanaco</b> is a protected animal in both Chile and Argentina, it is unlikely to appear commonly as restaurant fare. Trout and centolla (king crab) are also common, though over-fishing of centolla has made it increasingly scarce. In the area around Bariloche, there is a noted Alpine cuisine tradition, with chocolate bars and even fondue restaurants, and tea rooms are a feature of the Welsh communities in Gaiman and Trevelin {{as well as in the}} mountains. Since the mid-1990s there has been some success with winemaking in Argentine Patagonia, especially in Neuquén.|$|E
5000|$|... 90% of the world's <b>guanacos</b> are in Argentina, {{distributed}} {{from the}} islands of the Beagle Channel and the southern extremity of the Patagonia to the Puna grassland in northeastern Argentina. <b>Guanacos</b> {{can also be found}} in Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Peru.|$|R

25|$|The puna zone is {{composed}} of high, cold grasslands, suitable largely for pasture by camelids, the domesticated llama and alpaca, {{as well as the}} wild vicuña and <b>guanaco.</b> The former were used as not only as pack animals, but also for their meat and wool. Vicuñas and guanacos, though undomesticated, were used for their fine and much-prized wool. Little agriculture is performed in the puna, though in the Bolivian altiplano intensive agriculture was possible through the use of waru waru raised bed agriculture, which used specialized irrigation techniques to prevent frost from destroying crops.|$|E
25|$|Rare Animal Range was a trail {{which focused}} on highly {{endangered}} species. Featured species included <b>guanaco,</b> Formosan sika deer, pied ruffed lemurs, and blue-eyed black lemurs. The exhibit also had duplicate enclosures for the zoo's Arabian oryx, blesbok, Père David's deer, and broad-snouted caiman {{as well as a}} large pond with a pair of small islands in the center which were home to a pair of golden-cheeked gibbons. Due to budget cuts and the unpopularity of many of the species, the zoo was forced to close the exhibit in 2009.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century, tourism became an ever more {{important}} part of Patagonia's economy. Originally a remote backpacking destination, the region has attracted increasing numbers of upmarket visitors, cruise passengers rounding Cape Horn or visiting Antarctica, and adventure and activity holiday-makers. Principal tourist attractions include the Perito Moreno glacier, the Valdés Peninsula, the Argentine Lake District and Ushuaia and Tierra del Fuego (the city is also a jumping off place for travel to Antarctica, bringing in still more visitors). Tourism has created new markets locally and for export for traditional crafts such as Mapuche handicrafts, <b>guanaco</b> textiles, and confectionery and preserves.|$|E

50|$|<b>Guanacos</b> live in herds {{composed}} of females, their young, and a dominant male. Bachelor males form separate herds. While reproductive groups tend to remain small, often containing {{no more than}} 10 adults, bachelor herds may contain as many as 50 males. When they feel threatened, <b>guanacos</b> alert the herd to flee with a high-pitched, bleating call. The male usually runs behind the herd to defend them. They can run at 56 km (35 mi) per hour, often over steep and rocky terrain. They are also excellent swimmers. A <b>guanaco's</b> typical lifespan is 20 to 25 years.|$|R

500|$|By mid-March, Darwin was speculating in his Red Notebook on the {{possibility}} that [...] "one species does change into another" [...] to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange Macrauchenia, which resembled a giant <b>guanaco.</b> His thoughts on lifespan, asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction developed in his [...] "B" [...] notebook around mid-July on to variation in offspring [...] "to adapt & alter the race to changing world" [...] explaining the Galápagos tortoises, mockingbirds and rheas.

500|$|Lowland {{livestock}} farms concentrate {{largely on}} beef cattle and various breeds of sheep, {{but there are}} also small units producing rarer animals including goats, deer, alpaca, <b>guanaco,</b> llama, buffalo and ostrich, as well as specialised pig and poultry farms. Most cattle are now housed in winter with their main feed being silage. Systems adopted include suckler cows, where the calf is reared by its mother, and the buying in, and growing on, of young beef cattle. Some of these are crossbred calves, a by-product of the dairy industry, where the dairy cow is put to a Charolais, Limousin, Angus, Hereford or similar beef bull. Many of these [...] "stores" [...] are later sold {{to other parts of the}} United Kingdom for fattening.

500|$|Despite being {{lower than}} many {{neighbouring}} mountains, Licancabur stands out from other volcanoes {{in the region}} and is well-known. The Atacameno people worshiped it, and other high mountains are still considered sacred. Licancabur was considered divine, and attempts to climb it were discouraged and sometimes met by force; climbing it supposedly brought misfortune. It is said that Licancabur would punish people who climbed it, and the volcano is the mate of Quimal in the Cordillera Domeyko; at the solstices, the mountains overshadow one another. According to local myth, this copulation fertilizes the earth. Licancabur is considered [...] "male" [...] and a mountain of fire, in contrast to San Pedro (considered a mountain of water). The [...] was considered divine retribution for an attempt to climb the mountain that year.

500|$|Back at Montevideo, Darwin was {{introduced}} to Conrad Martens, the replacement artist brought on board the Beagle after Augustus Earle had to leave due to health problems. They sailed south, putting in at Port Desire on 23December, and the following day Darwin shot a <b>guanaco</b> which provided them with a Christmas meal. Early in the new year, Martens shot a rhea which they enjoyed eating before Darwin realised {{that this was the}} elusive smaller rhea, and preserved the remains. On 9January1834, [...] further south, they reached Port St Julian and exploring the local geology in cliffs near the harbour Darwin found fossils of pieces of spine and a hind leg of [...] "some large animal, I fancy a Mastodon".

2500|$|Based on {{artifacts}} {{found in}} the region, it appears that hunting of <b>guanaco,</b> {{and to a lesser}} extent rhea (ñandú), were the primary food sources of tribes living on the eastern plains [...] It is unclear whether the megafauna of Patagonia, including the ground sloth and horse, were extinct in the area before the arrival of humans, although this is now the more widely accepted account. It is also not clear if domestic dogs were part of early human activity. Bolas are commonly found and were used to catch <b>guanaco</b> and rhea.
