50|$|Saprolite is a {{particular}} example of a residual soil formed from the transformation of granite, metamorphic {{and other types of}} bedrock into clay minerals. Often called granite, saprolite is the result of weathering processes that include: hydrolysis, chelation from organic compounds, hydration (the solution of minerals in water with resulting cation and anion pairs) and physical processes that include freezing and thawing. The mineralogical and chemical composition of the primary bedrock material, its physical features, including grain size and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation,</b> and the rate and type of weathering transforms the parent material into a different mineral. The texture, pH and mineral constituents of saprolite are inherited from its parent material. This process is also called arenization, resulting in the formation of sandy soils (granitic arenas), thanks to the much higher resistance of quartz compared to other mineral components of granite (micas, amphiboles, feldspars).|$|E

The failure of embankments on soft soils is attributed also to the undrained shear when the embankments are constructed in a short time.

Surcharge of equivalent working load after taking into account submergence effect and settlement of the reclaimed land is placed until the required <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> of the soft clay is obtained. The assessment of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> of the marine clay is of paramount importance prior to the removal of preload. This analysis can be carried out by means of observational methods with the use of field settlement plates and piezometer monitoring. Field settlement monitoring data can be used to ascertain the settlement of the reclaimed fill from the time of initial installation. The field settlement data can be analysed by the Asaoka and Hyperbolic methods to predict the ultimate settlement of the reclaimed land under the surcharge fill. Back-analysis of the field settlement data by the Asaoka method will enable the coefficient of consolidation due to horizontal flow to be closely estimated. Piezometer monitoring data can be analysed to obtain the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> of the improved marine clay. Back-analysis of the piezometer data will also enable the coefficient of consolidation due to horizontal flow to be estimated. The authors' findings of the Asaoka method reveal that the magnitude of ultimate settlement decreases and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> subsequently increases as a longer period of assessment is used in the prediction. It is apparent that as the time interval increases, a cut-off time interval is obtained after which increasing time intervals would converge to the same magnitude of ultimate settlement.

We propose a path dependence approach to study the single authority versus multi-authority dilemma, considering the level <b>of</b> financial supervision <b>consolidation</b> as the dependent variable. In particular, in a movement towards full consolidation in supervision, one can think of two sharp alternatives: a monopolist central bank or a pure single financial authority. Given that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> supervision <b>consolidation</b> seems to be inversely correlated with central bank involvement in supervision itself, the paper sheds light on the possible explanation of this trade-off. The trade off is tested using Probit techniques {{with a sample of}} 68 countries. Copyright Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2006 financial supervision, single authority, central bank,...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{efforts to}} bolster failed {{states over the}} past two decades, many states in the {{international}} system still exhibit endemic weakness. External intervention often leads to political instability and in most cases fails to foster state consolidation, instead empowering and creating ties with the ones it aims to weaken. Using the case of Afghanistan, I develop a typology of political orders that explains variation in <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> state <b>consolidation</b> and provides the basis for more systematic comparative analysis. I demonstrate the resilience of a political logic according to which non-state armed actors (warlords) “shape-shift” and constantly reinvent themselves to adapt to changing political environments. This article, based on extensive field research in Afghanistan, shows why failed states are unlikely to consolidate and exhibit Western-style state building, as a result of intervention or otherwise...|$|R
