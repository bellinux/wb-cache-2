5|$|Several {{commercial}} mushroom ketchups {{were produced}} in the United Kingdom; some of the brands included Crosse and Blackswell's Mushroom Catsup, Morton's Mushroom <b>Ketchup</b> and Geo Watkins Mushroom <b>Ketchup.</b> Some of these companies exported their product to the United States, which created competition with <b>ketchup</b> products manufactured in the U.S. by the H. J. Heinz Company.|$|E
5|$|Geo Watkins Mushroom <b>Ketchup</b> {{continues}} to be produced today. It is a commercial, mass-produced product that is marketed and purveyed to consumers, and remains available in the United Kingdom. The company was founded in 1830. It is prepared in a liquid form and has a dark brown coloration. Contemporary preparation of Geo Watkins Mushroom <b>Ketchup</b> consists mostly of water, salt, vinegar, and hydrolised vegetable protein, containing just 3% mushroom powder.|$|E

40|$|Different {{varieties}} of chili sauces that are commercially available in Malaysia were randomly collected and their {{physical and chemical}} parameters were determined. Initially, pattern recognition techniques were applied in order to categorize the chili sauce varieties. With the aid of principal component analysis and cluster analysis, {{it is possible to}} visualize the clustering tendencies of the different {{varieties of}} chili sauces where four major clusters, namely chili sauces, general chili <b>ketchups,</b> hot/garlic added <b>ketchups,</b> and Thai <b>ketchups</b> have been successfully partitioned. Color and taste parameters {{have been found to be}} the most discriminating variables among them. With the K-nearest neighbor technique, a good prediction of chili sauces' categories could be achieved. With appropriate customer preference survey, it would be possible to map these characteristics to the preferences. This would certainly help producers of chili sauces in upgrading the quality and taste of their products. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R

5|$|They then wander to the {{concessions}} stand. There the babies find popcorn, orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, candy bars, <b>ketchup,</b> mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice the babies because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks the popcorn both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take {{interest in the}} soda dispensers, pushing the buttons and spilling the soft drinks on the counters and floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start playing with the <b>ketchup</b> and mustard dispensers by the hot dog sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie points out the stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs. As soon as the babies leave, the two teenagers notice the massive mess and scream.|$|E

5|$|A grilled Italian sausage {{sandwich}} {{was sold}} in 1992 and was served with onions and peppers or parmigiana style with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce. As part of the company's BK Dinner Baskets promotion in 1993, the chain introduced a grilled meatloaf sandwich with <b>ketchup</b> and onions in the United States. In 2013, Burger King sold a bratwurst sandwich in a regional limited time offering in the US states of Wisconsin and Illinois. The sandwich featured a bratwurst manufactured by Johnsonville Foods, raw onion and yellow mustard. Despite being discontinued, versions of the steak sandwich have been re-released several times since the 1970s. The BK Dinner baskets featured a steak sandwich, and in 2003 Burger King New Zealand introduced the Big Bloke Steak Sandwich which was almost identical to the 1979 sandwich.|$|E

5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, <b>ketchup</b> or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at −18°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and a fork and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{intends to}} change the menu every three months, each menu containing historical dishes ranging from the 14th to 19th centuries. Prior to opening, rumours were abound regarding the dishes to be served at Dinner, including one report from The Guardian which claimed that an ice-cream meat pie was {{to appear on the}} menu. Dishes that do appear include scallops and peas with cucumber <b>ketchup</b> and bergamot cured mackerel salad. Each item has been based on a historical recipe, such as the scallop dish which dates from 1826 and was published in The Cook and Housewife's Manual Mistress by Meg Dodds. One item which was reported in multiple reviews was the meat fruit, a chicken liver mousse made to look like a textured mandarin orange. The meat fruit was proving so popular that by November 2011, some 900 were being sold per week and the restaurant was aiming to increase production to be able to supply up to 1200 a week. During the Christmas period, the Meat Fruit is decorated to appear like a plum rather than a mandarine to accord with the holiday season.|$|E

50|$|Preparing Mangalorean Bangude Masala {{involves}} stewing skinned {{and cleaned}} mackerel {{in a thick}} gravy. Even though the gravies for most seafood dishes consumed along the Arabian Sea coast have generous amounts of grated coconut, the bangude masala gravy does not. The ingredients for the gravy are garlic, coriander, red chilli powder, ginger, onion and tomatoes. However, in coastal Kerala generous amounts of grated coconut is used. The tomatoes give a tangy taste to the dish. Recently, restaurants serving this dish have started using tomato puree and <b>ketchups</b> that are readily available in the market. Freshly chopped coriander leaves are used to garnish this dish.|$|R
50|$|The most {{successful}} {{of these was}} Der Steuersong (en: The Tax Song), which reached the number one spot in Germany and Austria in 2002, and went double platinum in 2004, having sold over an million copies. Based on Las <b>Ketchup's</b> summer dance hit Aserejé, the song lampooned Schröder's tax policy, listing a number of perceived absurd indirect taxes (such as an tax on dogs) and suggesting new ones on breathing and bad weather, and depicting the Chancellor as a cheat and an promise breaker. The song {{was accompanied by a}} video, in which an unflattering Spitting Image style puppet of Schröder stole coins from a charity collection tin, and medicine from the sick.|$|R

25|$|A way for <b>ketchup</b> {{manufacturing}} companies to avoid leaching {{of their products}} would be to add a hydrocolloid. Xanthan gum is able to stabilize <b>ketchup</b> by covalently binding to water. This strong bond keeps water from separating out of the <b>ketchup</b> and creating a layer at the surface.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketchup</b> is a condiment. Traditionally, recipes used egg whites, mushrooms, oysters, mussels, or walnuts, {{among other}} ingredients, but {{in modern times}} the unmodified term usually refers to tomato <b>ketchup.</b>|$|E
25|$|Heinz tomato <b>ketchup’s</b> {{ingredients}} are: {{tomato concentrate}} from red ripe tomatoes, distilled vinegar, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, salt, spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring. Tomato concentrate from red ripe tomatoes {{is the first}} ingredient on the list, which means it has {{the highest percentage of}} weight within the final product. Tomatoes have a complex composition of sugars, starch, pectin, ascorbic acids, organic acids, amino acids, steroids, carotenoids, lipids, free fatty acids, and volatiles. The second ingredient listed is distilled vinegar, which is eighty percent pure water and twenty percent acetic acid. Next is high fructose corn syrup, which is made up of 42% fructose, 53% glucose, and 5% other polysaccharides and sugars. Corn syrup is 100% glucose. Salt is the next ingredient listed and is composed of sodium and chloride ions. Spice, onion powder, and natural flavoring are the last ingredients on the list, meaning that they have the least percent weight. These three ingredients contribute to overall flavor of the product.|$|R
40|$|Hybrids or open pollinated tomato cultivars {{used for}} sauces and <b>ketchups</b> {{production}} usually has determinate growth habit, {{while most of}} the genotypes used in the production to salads (in natura consumption) has indeterminate growth habit. Additionally, growth habit can have influence on culture management, productivity and total soluble solids (TSS) in fruits. The growth habit is mainly controlled by the gene SELF-PRUNING (SP), which is a component of a small gene family which is also part of the gene SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT), currently considered one of the components so sought after 'florigin'. Understanding the biochemical function and physiological effect of such genes in interaction with the environment and other genes (epistasis), allows the manipulation of parameters such as precocity and TSS. It also provides subsidies to understand the genetic basis of semideterminate growth, which combines the advantages of determinate and indeterminate habit and can be used for plant breeders to development of new cultivars...|$|R

25|$|<b>Ketchup</b> {{is one of}} {{the many}} {{products}} that is leachable; meaning that the water within the product migrates together as the larger molecules within the product sediment, ultimately causing water to separate out. This forms a layer of water on top of the <b>ketchup</b> due to the molecular instability within the product. This instability is caused by interactions between hydrophobic molecules and charged molecules within the <b>ketchup</b> suspension.|$|E

500|$|David {{consciously}} {{followed in}} the path of Hilda Leyel and Dorothy Hartley in researching British ingredients and dishes. [...] Like them, she looked back into regional history to find what she saw as [...] "the traditions of a culture rooted to the soil" [...] before [...] "the ravages of the Industrial Revolution". She did not romanticise Britain's culinary past: [...] "Farm and factory labourers, artisans and clerical workers, still lived on a very restricted diet... their cooking facilities were so primitive and their equipment so scanty that only the most basic forms of cookery could be attempted". But her constant benchmarks were honest ingredients and uncomplicated cooking. She condemned—and explained the alternatives to—the artificial, the ersatz, the [...] "notorious Chorleywood bread", and [...] "all synthetic aids to flavouring... Nobody has ever been able to find out why the English regard a glass of wine added to a soup or stew as a reckless extravagance {{and at the same time}} spend pounds on bottled sauces, gravy powders, soup cubes, <b>ketchups</b> and artificial flavourings".|$|R
40|$|Pressure {{gradients}} and {{the corresponding}} mass flow rates of five different non-Newtonian fluid foods: 1 % solutions of sodium alginate and CMC, 1. 5 % CMC solution, two different tomato <b>ketchups,</b> oyster sauce, in four different diameter stainless steel tubes ranging from 7. 51 to 16. 34 mm i. d. were recorded using a continuous recording type tube flow viscometer capable of operating in both transient and continuous flow modes. The fluids were pseudoplastic in nature and followed the power law model. The flow was confined to the laminar flow regime and appreciable slippage occurred in all cases. Commercially available artificial neural networks based on back-propagation and generalized regression algorithm were applied to predict the pressure gradients in tube flow providing mass flow rate, consistency coefficients and flow behavior indices obtained from a low shear rate rotational viscometer, mass density and tube diameters as inputs. The net predicted values closely followed the experimental ones with an average absolute error below 5. 44 %. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|The main text of {{the book}} begins with [...] "Batterie de cuisine", a serious and {{thorough}} examination of the equipment that David thought necessary in a good kitchen. Many of the items she mentioned were not widely available in England in the 1950s, such as moulinettes for puréeing, mandolines for slicing vegetables, hâchoires (or mezzalunas) for chopping. The second section {{of the book is}} [...] "Wine in the kitchen", which opens: Nobody has ever been able to find out why the English regard a glass of wine added to a soup or stew as a reckless and foreign extravagance {{and at the same time}} spend pounds on bottled sauces, gravy powders, soup cubes, <b>ketchups</b> and artificial flavourings. If every kitchen contained a bottle each of red wine, white wine and inexpensive port for cooking, hundreds of store cupboards could be swept clean for ever of the cluttering debris of commercial sauce bottles and all synthetic aids to flavouring. [...] The remaining chapters of the book follow the pattern of Mediterranean Food: soups; fish; eggs; luncheon, supper and family dishes; meat; poultry; game; vegetables; salads; sweets; sauces; and preserves.|$|R
