40|$|Advanced {{laser-based}} diagnostics {{have been}} developed to examine catalytic effects and atom/surface interactions on thermal protection materials. This study establishes the feasibility of using laser-induced fluorescence for detection of O and N atom loss in a <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> to measure surface catalytic activity. The experimental apparatus is versatile in that it allows fluorescence detection to be used for measuring species selective recombination coefficients as well as <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> and microwave discharge diagnostics. Many of the potential sources of error in measuring atom recombination coefficients by this method have been identified and taken into account. These include scattered light, detector saturation, sample surface cleanliness, reactor design, gas pressure and composition, and selectivity of the laser probe. Recombination coefficients and their associated errors are reported for N and O atoms on a quartz surface at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A aerosol {{sampling}} inlet {{has been}} designed from high-speed aircraft. The objective of the design is to achieving isokinetic and minimizing disturbance for the sampling system. This study was conducted using the CFD code to perform a turbulent simulation of the airflow on the aerosol sampling inlet. The inlet is flown regularly on board an aircraft of Yun- 12. The flow rate through the sampling suction tube is a constant value of 100 L/min. The shroud diameter is 150 mm. The <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> inlet and outlet diameter is 35. 3 mm. The suction tube diameter is 20. 6 mm, which act as transferring aerosol at the velocity of 5 m/s. Results are presented graphically, showing the suction bending radius take 50 mm is more appropriate. It is shown that the <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> slows the sample flow from 40 m/s of the airspeed of the aircraft to approximately 5 m/s. It is suggested that CFD simulation can be useful for improving the optimum aircraft-carried aerosol sampling inlet...|$|E
40|$|Palmes-type passive <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> {{were shown}} to be as {{accurate}} in the measurement of indoor NO 2 during short-term (2 - and 3 -d) exposures as during 1 -week exposures. The statistical limit of detection for cumulative NO 2 in 2 - and 3 -d exposure was 150 (nL L− 1 h). The mean coefficient of variation for duplicate 2 - and 3 -d exposures was < 13 %. A pilot study measuring personal, indoor (living room) and outdoor (just outside the home) NO 2 over 3 d for 8 volunteers demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of using passive <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> for short-term personal exposure measurements, and confirmed the necessity of obtaining actual exposure profiles for a specific subpopulation...|$|R
30|$|The THS system {{consists}} of divided units with perforated <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> in each unit as schematically described in Figs.  7 and 8. The perforated tubes enable air to diffuse throughout the absorbent uniformly which {{is crucial for}} the maximising reaction performance. The tubes overcome the issue of increased air resistance at the front surface of the material due to {{the thickness of the}} absorbent bed. This resistance can slow down the reaction kinetics whilst also causing a pressure drop which results in high fan energy consumption and low temperature lift. Similarly to the <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes,</b> perforated collector pipes are connected to the outlet side of the reactor. This allows the humid air to diffuse through the material and the hot air to be collected via outlet pipes. This concept increases the contact area of air and absorbent providing one possible solution to non-uniform HAM transfer in larger scale applications.|$|R
40|$|Numerous passive {{samplers}} {{based on}} the ‘Palmes-tube’ {{have been developed for}} ambient air monitoring. In each case, the diffusion path length and/or crosssectional area are modified to achieve the desired sampling rate. ‘Tube-type’ samplers are low sensitivity samplers suitable for long-term monitoring, whereas the ‘badge-type’ samplers have faster sampling rates suited to short-term monitoring. In the U. K., <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> are widely used for monitoring nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ammonia (NH 3). The open-ended <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> are prone to positive bias caused by incursion of wind eddies, leading to a shortening of the diffusion path. By using a porous membrane at the inlet, wind incursion is prevented, but an additional diffusion resistance is imposed and it is necessary to calibrate the tubes against a reference method to obtain an effective sampling rate. For NO 2 sampling, positive bias also arises from the reaction of NO with O 3 within the sampler. The interference from the chemical reaction is severe close to NO sources, with errors up to 30 % for curbside locations when using the ‘tubetype’ sampler. In rural areas, where NO concentrations are small relative to NO 2, these errors are small. In some implementations, there is also a negative bias over long sampling periods caused by the degradation of trapped NO 2. The low sampling rates of <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> make them too uncertain for use at background NH 3 concentrations (< 1 μg NH 3 m- 3) where they significantly overestimate concentrations. Badge-type samplers such as the ‘Willems badge’ samplers permit accurate sampling at low ambient NH 3 concentrations, but suffer from saturation at high concentrations and sensitivity to wind speed. A passive sampler optimised for monthly measurements of NH 3 is reported here, together with its application in the U. K. National Ammonia Monitoring Network...|$|R
40|$|Atomic {{hydrogen}} {{is a very}} important constituent for processes ranging from cleaning oxide from GaAs and annealing amorphous silicon to the deposition of diamond. Because the usual techniques for measuring atomic fraction are either expensive and cumbersome to use, or unsuitable for application to highly dissociated hydrogen, a specially designed sensor was developed. Sensor design is based on a <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> with noncatalytic walls, having one end open to the atom source and a catalytic closure at the other end. The sensor is simple and inexpensive to fabricate, and determining atom density is straightforward. Sensor design also inhibits thermal runaway, which occurs when atom density is high enough to impart enough recombination energy to the non-catalytic surface to substantially raise its temperature. While recombination coefficients for such surfaces are very low near room temperature, they increase nearly exponentially with temperature unless actively cooled. With the use of a straightforward calibration scheme to determine the variation in species fraction along the <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube,</b> the atomic fraction at the tube opening is determined. Design strategy, implementation considerations, and calibration method are presented. In addition, data obtained from an atomic hydrogen source are compared to relevant published data...|$|E
40|$|The <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> was {{designed}} to operate below about 0. 25 percent of water supersaturation. It is simply a long tube lined on the inside with a damp chamois cloth, and heated isothermally to a few degrees centigrade above the incoming air. The diffusion coefficient for water vapor is slightly larger than that for heat, {{making it possible to}} supersaturate the airflow. This is the same principle by which transient supersaturations may occur in parallel plate cloud chambers. Only the diffusion of vapor and heat from the walls into the moving air are considered...|$|E

The method allowed for the rapid (15 min irradiation, included phenol, benzyl alcohol and phthalic anhydride.

Several sampling techniques produced significantly different 15 NH 3 signals when sampling the same NH 3 source released from field site fumigation campaigns. Conventional passive NH 3 -monitoring systems have shown to provide insufficient N for isotope-ratio mass spectrometry and various modified devices have been developed, based on existing <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> designs, to overcome this problem.

40|$|The {{determination}} of specific {{characteristics of materials}} commonly used {{in the preparation of}} cloths {{for the protection of the}} human body, lungs and other human organs, based on the principles of the effective adsorption of highly toxic organic vapors initially requires the development of specific and reliable techniques for the preparation of a gas stream with the relevant highly toxic organic substances. The dynamic method, one of the techniques commonly used for material characterization, is based on the procedure of determining the concentration of different substances in the gas stream at the inlet and after passing through a specific thin layer of the adsorption material (outlet). Therefore, the generation of a gas phase containing highly toxic organic substances in a defined quantity during a specific time interval, is the requirement that must previously be fulfilled before using the dynamic method for testing specific materials for protection of the human body. Usually, a dynamic method of determining the quality of cloths prepared with specific adsorbents requires a relatively low volumetric flow rate of the gas phase containing the test substance which may be achieved by using a <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> (DT) as the standard equipment for the generation of test substances. A very wide range of concentrations of the test substances in a specific gas phase (inert, air) can be obtained by varying the working conditions (temperature, pressure, gas flow rate) and the geometrical size of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube,</b> taking into account that the concentration of toxic substances, is determined as the ratio of their diffusion rate and from the DT and the carrier gas flow rate. The diffusion rate of the test substances from the DT is caused by the concentration gradient between the partial pressure of the saturated vapor at one end of the DT capillary and the partial pressure at the outlet of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> according to Fick's law. The mass rate of the generated test substances from the DT is constant for constant conditions (temperature and pressure) in the reservoir of the DT On the basis of a detailed theoretical calculation such a rate (R) may be defined by the equation: R = 16. 624 DM(P/T) (A/L) log [P/(P- pv) l, mg/min where: D - the diffusion coefficient, cm/s; M - the molar mass of the test substance, g/mol; P - the pressure in the DT kPa; pv - the vapor pressure of the test substance, kPa; A - the cross sectional area of the capillary of the DT cm 2 : L - the length of the capillary of the DT cm; T - the temperature, K. A procedure for the constant isothermal vapor generation of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and 2 -bromo- 2 -chloro- 1, 1, 1 -trifluoroethane (halotane) into air by a using <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> is described. The DT was placed into a thermostat 0. 5 °C) and the diffusion rates of the substance were measured during some time interval and the above equation was used for the {{determination of}} the diffusion coefficient.

The relative differences in the experimentally determined and theoretically calculated values of the diffusion coefficient for hydrogen cyanide at different temperature (19 - 23. 2 °C) were 26 - 31 % and for halotane (26 - 45 °C) 8 - 14 %...|$|E

Tube-type diffusion samplers are prone to several sources of uncertainty, arising from the materials of construction, the absorbent used, the methods of preparation, the details of their deployment (including the exposure time) and the analytical methods used to establish the concentration of nitrite ion absorbed.

40|$|Hereafter, a {{modification}} of the traditional Palmes <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> by fitting a membrane at the open end of the tube is presented. The membrane is placed to avoid the effect of turbulence due to wind speed. Further optimisations {{of the volume of}} absorbent and number of meshes retaining the absorbent are also described. Finally, the sampler is placed in an air proof container and is ready to use in order {{to improve the quality of}} measurement. In order to evaluate the performance of the membrane-closed Palmes <b>diffusion</b> <b>tube</b> to monitor nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), experiments were carried out in an exposure chamber. The relative effect of NO 2, temperature, humidity, averaging time and wind speed on the uptake rate of the sampler were then studied. Among the uncontrolled variables, temperature and humidity are found to be the most important ones leading to variability of the uptake rate. Two equations, used to estimate the uptake rate are established. These equations were then applied on some field data and laboratory inter-comparison tests. The agreement between the chemiluminescence method and diffusive samplers changes from 20 % of mean bias with the traditional Palmes diffusion tubes to 5 % of mean bias with the membraneclosed Palmes tube (MCPT) at the same monitoring site. In the laboratory inter-comparison, the MCPT has shown to be able to correctly measure NO 2 under two extreme exposure conditions in contrast with other diffusive samplers. The uncertainty of the sampler is evaluated. It fulfils the European Directive data quality objective of 25 % for accuracy and therefore the sampler qualifies as an indicative method for NO 2 monitoring. JRC.

The sensor units were initially operated at air quality monitoring sites for 3  months for performance analysis and initial calibration. Afterwards, they were relocated and operated within a sensor network consisting of six locations for more than 1 year. Our analyses show that the employed O 3 and NO 2 sensors can be accurate to 2 – 5 and 5 – 7  ppb, respectively, during the first 3  months of operation. This accuracy, however, could not be maintained during their operation within the sensor network related to changes in sensor behaviour. For most of the O 3 sensors a decrease in sensitivity was encountered over time, clearly impacting the data quality. The NO 2 low-cost sensors in our configuration exhibited better performance but did not reach the accuracy level of NO 2 <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes</b> (∼  2  ppb for uncorrected 14 -day average concentrations). Tests in the laboratory revealed that changes in relative humidity can impact the signal of the employed NO 2 sensors similarly to changes in ambient NO 2 concentration. All the employed low-cost sensors need to be individually calibrated. Best performance of NO 2 sensors is achieved when the calibration models also include time-dependent parameters accounting for changes in sensor response over time. Accordingly, an effective procedure for continuous data control and correction is essential for obtaining meaningful data.

Methods: Environmental samples were taken {{over a period}} of four hours using passive <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes.</b> Urine measurements were taken {{at the start of the}} shift and after four hours. Results: Environmental levels exceeded the legal occupational exposure standards for nitrous oxide (100 ppm over an 8 hour time weighted average) in 35 of 46 midwife shifts monitored. There was a high correlation between personal environmental concentrations and biological uptake of nitrous oxide for those midwives with no body burden of nitrous oxide at the start of a shift, but not for others. Conclusions: Greater engineering control measures are needed to reduce daily exposure to midwives to below the occupational exposure standard. Further investigation of the toxicokinetics of nitrous oxide is needed. N itrous oxide is used as an analgesic during labour. A number of epidemiological studies have linked occu-pational exposure to nitrous oxide with spontaneou...|$|R
40|$|Fortnightly average NO 2 {{concentrations}} {{have been}} measured at 49 {{sites in the}} small city of Lancaster, U. K., over a continuous 1 -year period using passive <b>diffusion</b> <b>tubes.</b> At sampling sites on a congested main road in the city centre considerable spatial and temporal variability in concentrations was found. An annual mean concentration of 63 μgm− 3 was found witha range of 12 – 222 μgm− 3. The mean concentration in an adjacent main road was 58 μgm− 3 {{with a range of}} 5 – 107 μgm− 3. Rather less variability was seen in a suburban main road and in a suburban residential street, which had annual mean concentrations of 38 and 30 μm− 3, respectively. Concentrations in a city centre pedestrian precinct decreased with distance from the main road, having an annual mean value of 30 μm− 3. The data suggest that the precise location of a sampling device may be crucial in determining whether or not a given NO 2, concentration or standard is exceeded...|$|R
