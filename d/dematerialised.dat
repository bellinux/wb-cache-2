2500|$|Spencer {{influenced}} literature {{inasmuch as}} many novelists and short story authors came to address his ideas in their work. George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Hardy, George Bernard Shaw, Bolesław Prus, Abraham Cahan, D. H. Lawrence, Machado de Assis, Richard Austin Freeman, and Jorge Luis Borges all referenced Spencer. Arnold Bennett greatly praised First Principles, {{and the influence}} it had on Bennett {{may be seen in}} his many novels. Jack London {{went so far as to}} create a character, Martin Eden, a staunch Spencerian. It has also been suggested that the character of Vershinin in Anton Chekhov's play The Three Sisters is a dedicated Spencerian. H.G. Wells used Spencer's ideas as a theme in his novella, The Time Machine, employing them to explain the evolution of man into two species. It is perhaps the best testimony to the influence of Spencer's beliefs and writings that his reach was so diverse. He influenced not only the administrators who shaped their societies' inner workings, but also the artists who helped shape those societies' ideals and beliefs. In Rudyard Kipling's novel Kim, the Anglophile Bengali spy Hurree Babu admires of Herbert Spencer and quotes him to comic effect: [...] "They are, of course, <b>dematerialised</b> phenomena. [...] Spencer says." [...] "I am good enough Herbert Spencerian, I trust, to meet little thing like death, which is all in my fate, you know." [...] "He thanked all the Gods of Hindustan, and Herbert Spencer, that there remained some valuables to steal." ...|$|E

60|$|The real {{object of}} these {{preliminary}} feats, however performed, is, probably, to inspire faith, which Dr. Charcot {{might have done}} by swallowing a cradle. The Indians explain that the barrel staves apparently swallowed are merely <b>dematerialised</b> by 'spirits,' leaving only the forked end {{sticking out of the}} conjurer's mouth. In fact, Hearne caught the conjurer in the act of making a separate forked end.|$|E

60|$|It {{is not an}} easy {{matter to}} write from the front. You know that there are several courteous but inexorable gentlemen who may have a word in the matter, and their {{presence}} 'imparts but small ease to the style.' But above all you have the twin censors of your own conscience and common sense, which assure you that, if all other readers fail you, you will certainly find a most attentive one in the neighbourhood of the Haupt-Quartier. An instructive story is still told of how a certain well-meaning traveller recorded his satisfaction with the appearance of the big guns at the retiring and peaceful village of Jamais, and how three days later, by an interesting coincidence, the village of Jamais passed suddenly off the map and <b>dematerialised</b> into brickdust and splinters.|$|E

Anton is unsure if it is a <b>dematerialised</b> Other, or if it is simply a part of a trap put into place by Zabulon.|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} and economic imperatives to <b>dematerialise</b> economies, or ‘do more with less’, have been established for some years. Yet, to date {{little is known about}} the personal drivers associated with <b>dematerialising.</b> This paper explores the prevalence and profile of those who are taking action to reduce consumption in different cultural contexts (UK and Brazil) and considers influences on dematerialisation behaviours. We find exemplar behaviours (avoiding buying new things and avoiding packaging) are far less common than archetypal environmental behaviours (e. g., recycling), but also that cultural context is important (Brazilians are more likely to reduce their material consumption than people in the UK). We also find the two dematerialisation behaviours are associated with different pro-environmental actions (more radical action versus green consumption, respectively); and have distinct, but overlapping, psychological (e. g., identity) and socio-demographic (e. g., education) predictors. Comparing a more traditional valueidentity model of pro-environmental behaviour with a motivation-based (self-determination) model, we find the latter explains somewhat more variance than the former. However, overall little variance is explained, suggesting that additional factors at the personal and structural levels are important for determining these consumption behaviours. We conclude by outlining policy implications and avenues for further research...|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Estève is {{entrusted}} {{with the design}} of a soundtrack for a new Cryo production, a game of divine simulation called Deo Gratias. The composer makes up mystical atmospheres dealing with the original divine chaos, while including unusual pop sounds within some liturgic sounds. Following the request by a lot of fans, the album to the original soundtrack appears in 2014, on a <b>dematerialised</b> media.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{between being}} and non-being, {{in a world}} in which {{communication}} is increasingly being <b>dematerialised</b> as time goes by, the supporters of rationality see in all this nothing more than just an expression of what is not determined, improbable or unmentionable, thereby refusing to get involved in the whole issue.

50|$|Indeed, except rare exceptions, any {{chain of}} <b>dematerialised</b> {{securities}} contains {{at least four}} degrees: (1) the issuer, (2) the Central Securities Depository of the issuer ("CSD"), (3) the final intermediary and (4) the investor.
