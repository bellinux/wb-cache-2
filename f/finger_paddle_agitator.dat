These results are compared with available experimental data: good agreement is observed. The tangential velocities calculation was carried out for <b>paddle</b> <b>agitator</b> with height W = 1. 5 T. Early studies confirmed {{that this type of}} geometry generates essentially a tangential flow. The results obtained show good agreement with those obtained by many authors. The second agitator height was W = 0. 25 T which behaves, generally, like a turbine and generates more important axial and radial velocities which are at the origin of secondary flows {{on both sides of the}} blade. The axial velocities calculation for blades of various heights confirmed the observations of many authors; especially, a maximum velocity for the lowest height considered. The position of the impeller in the tank was analysed and the axial velocity change with the positions of the impeller...|$|R

40|$|The International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) {{scientists}} monitored butter-making on five Ethiopian farms for a nine-month {{period in}} 1989 {{to see if}} traditional butter-making practices could be accelerated whilst leaving the basic technique unchanged. Traditionally, milk for churning is collected in a clay Dot for several days, soured naturally, and then churned by shaking the pot until butter granules form. This takes up to four hours of churning. The ILCA team developed a simple internal wooden <b>paddle</b> <b>agitator</b> to improve {{the efficiency of the}} simple clay pot churn. The temperature and acidity of the milk are not changed. Fifty-nine churnings were observed, of which the shortest was 50 minutes and the longest 65. This significant shortening of the process not only eases women's work load but also boosts the butter yield, thereby increasing income, because the amount of fat left in the buttermilk is reduced.

A numerical model is presented here that captures such a vortex. The volume of fluid model, a multiphase flow model was employed in conjunction with a multiple reference frame model and the shear stress turbulence model. The dimensions of the tank considered here, were 0. 585 m for the liquid depth and tank diameter with a 0. 2925 m diameter impeller at a height of 0. 2925 m.

[...] A drawing of an early washing machine appeared in the January 1752 issue of The Gentlemen's Magazine, a British publication.

In 1782, Henry Sidgier issued a British patent for a rotating drum washer, and in the 1790s Edward Beetham sold numerous [...] "patent washing mills" [...] in England. One of the first innovations in washing machine technology was the use of enclosed containers or basins that had grooves, <b>fingers,</b> or <b>paddles</b> to help with the scrubbing and rubbing of the clothes. The person using the washer would use a stick to press and rotate the clothes along the textured sides of the basin or container, agitating the clothes to remove dirt and mud.

The tiller may contain other features as well, for example a speed limiter, lighting controls (for nighttime use) and turning signals. A battery use indicator is also often included. Forward/reverse direction can be controlled by thumb <b>paddles,</b> <b>finger</b> controls, or a switch. There are two types of mobility scooters: front-wheel drive (FD) or rear-wheel drive (RD). The FD is usually a smaller device and is best used indoors. Rider weight capacity is a minimum of 170 lb generally upwards to 250 lb maximum. The RD is used both indoors and outdoors with rider weight capacity of 350 lb. A heavy duty rear-drive can carry up to 500 lb, varying by manufacturer.|$|R

Bioethanol is an energy source with good prospects {{as a substitute for}} liquid fuels renewable raw materials, friendly to the environment and the very favorable economic terms. One of the materials that can be used as raw material for bioethanol is pineapple. The fermentation process is influenced by several factors, among which the fermentation time and stirring in a liquid medium. Flow pattern and degree of turbulence is an important aspect which affects the quality of mixing that depends on several factors such as tank geometry, physical properties of fluids and type of impeller. Fermentation time very big influence on the activity of yeast because the longer the fermentation, the more number of increasingly active yeast or yeast to proliferate.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of in vitro {{parameters}} on the theophylline release from the hydrogel system of atactic -PVA/NaCl/H 2 O, in vitro parameters such as agitators, rotation speed, release medium and release temperature were evaluated. Theophylline release was studied {{for a period of}} 750 min using <b>paddle</b> and propeller <b>agitator,</b> rotation speed (25, 50, 100 and 150 rpm), release medium (simulated fluids pH 1. 2, 7. 5 and phosphate buffer pH 8. 5 with 0. 05 M at 37 °C) and release temperatures (27, 37 and 47 °C). SEM and DSC studies were performed to evaluate the surface morphology and heat capacity as well as melting temperatures of the hydrogels affected by various simulated fluids and phosphate buffer. A regular Fickian diffusion was found (Higuchi Model) for first 60 to 70 % release. A faster release rate was found in paddle rotation than that of propeller one. Among the release medium comparatively high release rate in extremely low pH (1. 2) and near about same release rate in distilled water, pH 7. 5 and pH 8. 5 were found. DSC thermogram of these treated xerogels showed low melting temperature as well as high heat capacity of pH 1. 2 sample than that of others. Rotation speed had a little effect on release rate but the diffusion exponent. It decreased linearly with increasing rotation speed. On the other hand release rate increased proportionally to temperature where diffusion exponent decreased with increasing temperature in a parabolic fashion. Theophylline release behavior was regular Fickian diffusion (Higuchi Model) irrespective of in vitro conditions studied here. However release rate, diffusion exponent, kinetic constant and diffusion co-efficient vary with rotator type, rotation speed, release medium and temperature...|$|R

There was a canoe {{at the mouth of}} the cave, beyond which lay water. While all were asleep I crept to the canoe. As I loosed the rope one of the priests woke up and ran at me. But I hit him on the head with the paddle, for though only a boy I was bold and strong, and he fell into the water. He came up again and gripped the edge of the canoe, but I struck his <b>fingers</b> with the <b>paddle</b> till he let go. A great wind was blowing that night, tearing off boughs from the trees which grew upon the other shore of the water. It whirled the canoe round and round and one of the boughs struck me in the eye. I scarcely felt it at the time, but afterwards the eye withered. Or perhaps it was a spear or a knife that struck me in the eye, I do not know. I paddled till I lost my senses and always that wind blew. The last thing that I remember was the sound of the canoe being driven by the gale through reeds. When I woke up again I found myself near a shore, to which I waded through the mud, scaring great crocodiles. But this must have been some days later, for now I was quite thin. I fell down upon the shore, and there some of our people found me and nursed me till I recovered. That is all." ...|$|R
