A total of 8 <b>horticultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> were chosen through a pilot survey {{to form the}} sample size. Results show that horticultural farming is an activity {{for both males and}} females. A greater number of the horticultural farmers, who were married with an average household size of 5, fall within the age range of 31 – 40 years, which inferred that horticultural farming is not an activity of the teenage and also not for the aged. Majority of the horticultural farmers acquired formal education {{in order to meet the}} technical demands of the business. Results also show that majority of the horticultural farmers engage in full time farming with 1 - 5 years experience. They do not have access to extension services and formal borrowing of capital in spite of the existing commercial banks in the study area. Most of them do not belong to farmers co-operative or association. They acquired land by lease and employ both hired and family labour. They engage in nursing and pinning propagation methods and involve mainly floriculture and ornamental plant practices. The result shows that <b>horticultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> incurred fixed cost of N 34, 012. 50, variable cost of N 74, 297. 56, with a total cost of N 108, 310. 06, and realised a total revenue of N 366, 813. 00 and an estimated Net Farm Income of N 258, 502. 94, which implies that horticultural farming in Yenagoa metropolis of Bayelsa State is a profitable venture...|$|R

40|$|Although {{simulation}} models are most suitable to examine real world systems, {{they would not}} be used enough for optimization programs. Genetic algorithms are now offering a good way to integrate {{simulation models}} in optimization tools. The search for optimized energy supply systems in horticulture serves as an example for this assumption: The design tools HORTSI and HORTOS were developed to support the efforts for a resource and environ-mentally friendly energy supply in horticulture. The simulation tool HORTSI integrates the simulation of selected energy supply systems whereby total costs, primary energy demands and carbon dioxide emissions are calculated. HORTSI covers the heat and power demand that is calculated by the tool HORTEX (T. Rath, 1992. Dissertation, Universität Hannover). The optimization tool HORTOS is based on HORTSI: the aim is to cover the heat, power and carbon dioxide demands with optimized supply systems. The designer can optimize the energy supply system for a given <b>horticultural</b> <b>enterprise</b> by hand or can automatically generate optimal solutions with the available optimization tool, where a genetic algorithm achieves and offers several optimal solutions. The tool optimizes the system as a whole, thereby taking into account interrelations between the supply components. All the tools ar...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{key issues}} in {{evaluating}} the financial condition of a company is the analysis of assets {{in relation to the}} due indebtedness, i. e., short-term obligations. Liquidity ratios calculated in such a manner help in the drawing of conclusions on the liquidity of the enterprise and its ability to pay its short-term liabilities. This paper examines the financial liquidity in 2005 - 2007 of a <b>horticultural</b> <b>enterprise,</b> producing and selling food, based on information available in the balance sheet, income statement, and the cash flow statement, as published in the company’s financial reports. The company was selected using the following criteria: location in Lower Silesia, Poland, in a municipal-rural commune, and operating in the agricultural-food sector. The study was based on business books of the examined company. The economic analysis involved mainly the financial liquidity ratios. Additionally, descriptive and comparative methods were used to characterize and interpret the results. The results of the study show that the company had a good financial situation and had no problems with payment of current obligations without waiting for accounts receivable or de-stocking. Additionally, liquidity analysis based on transfers from its operating activity showed that the obligations of the examined company could be covered by money obtained during its operating activities. enterprise, financial solvency, horticulture, Lower Silesia, Poland...|$|E

40|$|A social {{accounting}} matrix {{was developed for}} the Western Cape to meet growing needs for quantitative analysis of the agricultural sector. Twenty-five farm commodities and seven agribusinesses are explicitly included in the model. The coloured and black populations dominate provincial expenditure on fresh and processed farm commodities, suggesting that future demand growth depends on income increases among these household groups. In the aggregate, agriculture’s contributions to job creation, value added and government revenue significantly exceed those of the nonagricultural sectors; agribusiness exceeds other nonagricultural sectors because of their backward links to production agriculture. Within agriculture, horticulture and livestock subsectors make the most significant contributions to the macro economy. Similar patterns are found with respect to generating household incomes, and in the equality with which such incomes are distributed. Household economic behaviour is explicit. Spending by the poor {{is found to be}} more labour intensive than spending by the rich, and generates greater impacts on value added (GGP), gross operating surplus and the demand for most farm and non-farm commodities. A composite ranking of macroeconomic contributions to development is constructed. Nine <b>horticultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> and broilers comprise the ten top sectors. Farm Management,...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the diversity of}} horticultural production systems practised in the tropics. With this knowledge it will then be possible to review the variety and rele-vance of the specific production practices employed in the successful growing of veget-ables (in Chapter 4) and fruits and flowers (in Chapter 5) in the tropical environment. Production systems that take resources, natural and human, and transform them into horticultural products can be classified according to temporal, spatial, economic and social criteria. Next, within the production systems the particular farming system, the cropping sequence, pattern and management can be further classified according to conformity within specifically defined classes or groups. It must be recognized that no two farms, even if adjacent, would have identical farming systems. This {{would be even more}} so for <b>horticultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> than for those producing grain, dairy or meat products, for the diversity of horticultural commodities and their means of production far exceed those of broad-acre and animal-based systems.

40|$|Abstract: Strategies {{to reduce}} {{potential}} food safety risks in {{fresh fruit and}} vegetables need to start in the paddock or orchard with the horticulturalist. Although Commonwealth and State food safety legislation is not directed at regulating inside farm gate activities, the market itself is demanding that growers, packers and distributors apply the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) methodology within their quality management systems to prevent, eliminate or reduce the food safety risk to an acceptable level. The identified food safety risks in horticulture include chemical (agricultural chemical residues in produce and soil, cleaning agents etc.), physical contamination (sticks, stones, glass, plant matter etc.) and microbiological (bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites). These three food safety risks have the potential to harm humans. HACCP has made a significant impact in the reduction of foodborne illness relating to the consumption of fresh (and processed) horticultural produce. It has also led to improvements in the consistency and quality of produce. However there is emerging concern that HACCP, particularly when applied at the grower level, is not truly addressing potential excess chemical residue contamination. This paper explores the Codex Alimentarius Commission Guidelines for HACCP and its application in the horticultural industry, focusing on small <b>horticultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> (SHE), in ensuring maximum chemical residue limits are not exceeded...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Water {{reforms in}} Australia {{acknowledge}} {{the environment as}} a legitimate user of a groundwater resource. The challenge facing groundwater managers is how to identify and assess ecosystems that have a dependency on groundwater, and how to incorporate environmental groundwater requirements into aquifer management plans. The Alstonville Plateau Basalt Groundwater Management Area (GWMA 804) located on the far north coast of New South Wales {{was used as a}} case study to develop a methodology to assess the environmental dependencies on a groundwater resource. The original subtropical rainforest on the dissected Tertiary basaltic plateau was cleared from the late 19 th century for dairying and sugar cane. From the 1970 s, <b>horticultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> such as macadamias, avocadoes and stone fruits started to expand. Today, less than 1 % of the original rainforest remains on the plateau. The intensification of horticulture, combined with a rapidly growing regional population, has increased the demand for water. Increased groundwater allocations with the possibility of over-extraction and contamination, resulted in the plateau being designated a Groundwater Management Area in 1985. This requires an assessment of the sustainable yield of the groundwater resource, including an understanding of groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs), the components of the environment that have a dependency based on the permanent or temporary presence of groundwater. There is a high degree of connectivity between groundwater and surface water on the plateau. The permeable krasnoze...|$|R

40|$|Purpose- The {{issue of}} export {{success and the}} ability to sustain oneself in {{international}} horticultural markets have become more critical in the recent global and economic downturn because of its significance to the economy and to actors in the horticultural export chain. The extent of success is even much critical for enterprises. Therefore this study establishes the factors which influence the intensity of export success which measures the extent of export success. Design- Primary data were collected from 52 managers and representatives of horticultural exporting firms through a semi-structured questionnaire. The tobit model was used to estimate the intensity of export success by <b>horticultural</b> <b>enterprises</b> in Ghana. Findings- The result indicates that, manager’s educational level, managers past experience, manager trained in export management, manager’s entrepreneurial orientation, presence of export department, product diversification and government support directly influences the intensity of export success. Export barriers and constraints in accessing working capital negatively influences intensity of export success. Practical implications- Personnel or personal development in terms of training in export management and build up of experience is important in the quest to improve the intensity of export success. Organizational reforms such as institution of export department and diversifying horticultural export products improves the intensity of export success. To improve the intensity of success, external factors such as working capital inaccessibility and trade barriers should be addressed by various stake holders. In all government and institutional interventions has been proved to be of the essence. Originality/value- Although various determinants of export performance or success have been established by researchers the factors that influence the intensity of export success is not known. This study therefore bridges this gab. Tobit, export success, horticulture, enterprises, Ghana, Crop Production/Industries, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of the agricultural and downstream processing sectors in the New Zealand economy, there is no tradition of using partial or general equilibrium models to evaluate policies or other measures directed at the agricultural sector. Policy-makers have instead relied on the development of ad hoc scenarios of land use change, farm budget models, and simple multiplier analysis of flow-on effects. To redress this situation, we have developed a catchment-scale partial equilibrium framework based on the US REAP model, which we have thus far calibrated for two different catchments. In this paper, we present an application of the model to the Hurunui Catchment in North Canterbury in which we assess several scenarios for the development of irrigated area under several water storage options. This application is timely, given that there are increasing pressures on water resources in the catchment, and frequent conflicts between abstractive users (mainly pastoral), recreational users (e. g. kayaking, fishing) users, and environmental needs. Currently, a private consortium are pursuing storage options similar to those that we have modelled, while a newly constituted Water Management Zone Committee is tasked with developing a strategic approach to managing water in the Hurunui and adjacent Waiau catchments. In addition, water quality limits are also being developed in the Hurunui catchment. Our modelling approach includes pastoral (dairy, sheep, beef and deer), arable, <b>horticultural</b> and forestry <b>enterprises</b> along with an array of management including various irrigation and fertiliser regimes. The model allows us to test policy scenarios for addressing environmental issues such as mitigating climate change and improving water quality, and changes in resource constraints such as water availability. Using a profit maximizing objective function we compare the impact of the proposed irrigation scenarios in the Hurunui catchment on total catchment profits and a variety of environmental parameters like greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient losses.
