The contemporary reader may <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Polwhele's preoccupations, particularly botany and fashion, amusing. The Unsex'd Females, however, was a salvo in a propaganda war that the participants took extremely seriously. After the revolution in literary criticism in the 1970s and 1980s when it was successfully argued that works could not solely be judged on their literary merit, poems such as Polwhele's were resurrected. They have subsequently shed considerable light on the cultural moments during which they were written. The Unsex'd Females remains of considerable interest today as a vibrant example of the politically charged culture of the revolutionary period in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Result: Platinum {{got out to}} {{an early}} start, getting some {{relatively}} good discounts on their first few items, but things were marred by infighting among the sub-team of David, Amy and Lucy. The team also struggled to <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the more expensive items on the list, and were late back to the Coliseum. None of the Odyssey members started buying anything until three hours in, with the sub-team of Patrick, Maria and Navdeep spending a further three hours doing research. Their research did pay off however, as they got some significant discounts on the items that they did buy. Ultimately the teams both bought only five of the ten items each. However, Platinum were cost dearly by being late and not buying a second-hand car, the most expensive item on the list and correspondingly {{the one with the}} biggest fine. Platinum's total spend was £2,204, and Odyssey's total spend was £2,033.|$|E

Jones’ speech about all living creatures needing incentive might have been goofy coming from any other actor, but from Harris, it is creepy beyond belief. So glad Fringe found a way to bring David Robert Jones back." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated it 9.0/10 for being a [...] "fast-paced story" [...] that was [...] "the best episode of the season so far".

2500|$|MacLeod gave Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry a {{positive}} review, crediting Ruse with providing a detailed survey of current research {{in medicine and}} the behavioral sciences relevant to homosexuality, and writing that his [...] "careful questioning" [...] resulted in [...] "a comprehensive analysis of issues relating to homosexuality in both men and women." [...] He concluded that the book was a welcome addition to the literature on homosexuality. Futuyma also gave the book {{a positive}} review, writing that Ruse helped to {{provide the kind of}} objective discussion of sexual orientation that had previously been lacking. He credited Ruse with carefully discussing various theories of homosexuality, concluding that Ruse rightly took a more skeptical view of evolutionary explanations of homosexuality in the book than he had in his previous writings. Futuyma expressed agreement with Ruse's skepticism about hormonal explanations of homosexuality and the psychoanalytic theories, and also with Ruse's view that a person's sexual orientation is not a choice, that homosexuality is not unnatural, and that both neo-Kantian and utilitarian ethical theories must support gay rights. However, he noted that while Ruse's book was easy to read and avoided philosophical jargon, it was not always graceful in style, and suggested that gay readers might <b>find</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Ruse's comments about homosexuality insensitive.|$|E

[...] According to Andrew Alfonso's GameSpy guide to Dead or Alive Ultimate, Kasumi's key moves include high kicks and a cartwheel attack, which is perfect against low attackers. Kasumi's preferred and recommended tag team partner is Ryu Hayabusa. GameSpy's Chau wrote that in DOA3, [...] "Kasumi's got some very good long-range attacks; combined with her speed and she's able to hit opponents from a good distance away," [...] especially since many of her attacks can stun with one hit, allowing her [...] "to deliver her great punch and kick combinations, regarded by some as being {{the best in the}} game," [...] that are exceptionally dangerous since many of them end in a powerful launching attack. In addition, [...] "to balance her great speed and superb punch-kick combination game, Kasumi also can throw with the best of them." [...] Chau opined Kasumi is a good tag team partner for any fighter, but in particular for Ryu, Bass, Helena and Ayane. GamesRadar US recommended that DOA3 [...] "beginners should start with Kasumi because she's got some nice combos". According to Bryan Dawson in Prima Games' official guide for Dead or Alive 4, this game's Kasumi is [...] "faster than ever" [...] and her techniques have been modified considerably; she was ranked overall 8/10, while her clone Alpha-152 was ranked 10/10. In GameSpy's guide to DOA4, David McCutcheon wrote that [...] "Kasumi is a very well-rounded character that is diverse in usefulness," [...] that she [...] "can be a pure powerhouse character outside of her looks that will certainly drive the point across even to the most defensive of fighters," [...] and that novice players might especially appreciate her very accessible high combos. In an official description of Kasumi in Dead or Alive 5, she uses [...] "beautiful yet varied attacks executed at a high speed that few can guard against." [...] Dean James from Attack of the Fanboy recommended her especially [...] "for those who haven’t played the series in the past and are just starting with Dead or Alive 5 Last Round" [...] for her [...] "probably the most balanced setup in the series." ...|$|E
