However, {{the people with whom}} Koenig and Nichols speak were extras hired off the street for that day's shooting and, despite legends to the contrary, knew they were being filmed. In an interview with StarTrek.com, Layla Sarakalo, the extra who said, [...] "I don't know if <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to that... I think it's across the bay, in Alameda," [...] stated that after her car was impounded because she refused to move it for the filming, she approached the assistant director about appearing with the other extras, hoping to be paid enough to get her car out of impoundment. She had been told to act naturally, and so she answered them and the filmmakers kept her response in the film, though she had to be inducted into the Screen Actors Guild in order for her lines to be kept.|$|E

60|$|The {{fundamental}} {{trouble is}} {{that men and women}} are different creatures, with different minds and different aptitudes and different paths in life. There is no need to raise here the question of which is superior and which is inferior (though I think, the Lord help me, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to that too). The point {{lies in the fact that}} they are different.|$|E

60|$|And then, as swift {{as light}} from a fixed star, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> came to me.

60|$|The {{answer to}} these {{questions}} would settle all the enigmas of the universe. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> I am not a fool. And some day, if I am plagued too desperately, I shall give the answer myself. I shall give the name of him who mislays my pen and uses up my ink. It is so silly to think that I could use such a quantity of ink. The servant lies. I know.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> is ready. Get Christ {{and go to}} heaven. But methinks {{the height}} of the place, and the glory of the state that we are to enjoy therein, should a little concern us, at least so as to make us wonder in our thinking, that the time is coming that we must mount up thither. And since there are so many heights between this place, between us, and that; it should make us admire at the heights of the grace and mercy of God, by which, means is {{provided}} to bring us thither. And I believe that this thing, this very thing, is included here by the Apostle when he prays for the Ephesians, that they might know the height.|$|E

5000|$|Dreyer was a {{contestant}} on the October 30, 2014 {{episode of}} Jeopardy!, though she didn't win. She credited {{her ability to}} make it on the show and compete with reading a wide range of genres, but especially romance -- [...] "I think I picked up the best information from romance." [...] This was especially true for Final Jeopardy!. As she related in an interview, [...] "So the Final Jeopardy! category was English Monarchs, and I had to place my bet before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> <b>I</b> had $6,400 at the time. I bet $6,200 because I had a strong feeling after my own history with historical romance, <b>I</b> would <b>know</b> this one. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> was, 'The name of two kings, fifth and eighth, who were notable for being king but not crowned.' (Cue music.) And yes, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>the</b> two kings, one of the boys Richard III allegedly killed in the Tower, and the king who abdicated for Wallace Simpson, were named Edward. I didn't win. Unfortunately, the other two players knew it, too. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it because <b>I</b> read and write historical romance." ...|$|R

It just made me feel bad. I felt sick to my stomach. It doesn't really help you because then you're just inhibited.” [...]...|$|R

There's no moss growing on my brain. 'I think that'll {{do for the}} present, sister,' said the little man, and the nurse left the room {{in a sort of}} brisk well-trained way. But I caught her handing me out a look of deep curiosity as she passed through the door.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the Arizona Daily Star, Walker said [...] "In todays world, you couple the music thats out there and the world events, I think people just want some stuff thats got substance to it, its kind of neat to have one of those songs." [...] In {{an interview}} with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Walker stated, [...] "I was in Salt Lake City and took a call from a lady, and she was crying. She said the song really affected her in a way, because theres a line that goes, [...] "How can two people whove built a loving home/Try for years and never have a child of their own?/And somewhere out there tonight/Theres a baby no ones holding tight." [...] She told me, [...] "I watched my sister-in-law have two children and not even care about them. Ive always wanted kids and cant even have them. And now <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to that question the song, because Ive adopted those two kids." [...] So the song has really had an impact on people, and Ive been really blessed to have a song like that." [...] After playing a concert in Oregon Walker said, [...] "Its so exciting to see the reaction of the fans and realize that this song has moved them the way it moved me the first time I heard it." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} several interpretations of what The Master is really about. Some have viewed it as an existential tale of post-war America, while others have viewed it as a {{depiction}} {{of the birth of}} Scientology. Some have argued that the film is also mainly a love story between Lancaster Dodd and Freddie Quell; Dana Stevens of Slate commented that [...] "After three viewings, I’m still not sure <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to the “what’s it all about” question, but I lean the interpretation that The Master is above all a love story between Joaquin Phoenix’s damaged World War II vet, Freddie Quell, and Philip Seymour Hoffmann’s charismatic charlatan, Lancaster Dodd. And that relationship is powerful and funny and twisted and strange enough that maybe that’s all the movie needs to be about. " [...] Others have argued that the film is partly about acting; Richard Brody of the New Yorker observed that [...] "Similarly, it’s perhaps notable that Phoenix’s performance seems to represent the tormented, physical acting styles of {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century (the Brandos, the Deans, the Clifts) whereas Hoffman’s acting seems to hearken back to the controlled, elusive manner of the previous half (many have described his turn as “Wellesian”). In these acting styles, we see a miniature version of the journey of American society during this period — and, specifically, American maleness." [...] Still other persuasive arguments regarding the film's main theme is that it's about humanity, and man's struggle to cope with his animalistic nature. Glenn Kenny of MSN Movies wrote that the film is [...] "Less about Scientology’s specific set of beliefs than about how humans rely on belief systems in general to try and lift themselves out of an elemental rage, and to assert, yes, that man is not an animal. " ...|$|E

5000|$|This was {{supposed}} to be the twist of the Twenty One program. In other words, the omniscient genius {{was supposed}} to <b>know</b> all <b>the</b> hard <b>answers,</b> but miss on the easy ones, because the public would figure one of two things. Either in his very, very erudite studies he had either glossed over this and missed it, or it was intended as a sop to the public at large to make them say, 'See, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to this and the great genius, so and so, didn't.'

5000|$|I was {{watching}} it one night {{for ten minutes}} or so and I {{had had enough of}} that so I decided to flick around and I came back about half an hour later the presenters was still at the same puzzle, they had 2 or 3 pictures and you have to pick out 3 things that were different, I spent some time figuring it out but it was simple enough and I thought surely somebody has seen those differences and she was giving more and more time for people to ring in, so I rang up. I got through to some lady who asked me some simple question to which <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> <b>I</b> was surprised to be asked another question because there was no forewarning of that but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> as it happened and then she said [...] "Sorry try again you are not getting through" [...] and that was it. So I was talking to a friend and she told me that I should ring the regulator called the Broadcasting Complaints Commission (BCC) they stated that they weren't the right people and pass my email on to another regulator I have not got a reply. It didn't cost much but if they are getting numerous calls in each night that amounts to a huge take for them and I feel it is a rip off. I am surprised that any TV station would be operating like this and would be allowing it to go on.|$|R

McCaw denied New Zealand's easy run into the quarter-finals played a part in the loss [...] "A lot of the guys have been through this before, they've played big test matches." [...] Graham Henry's policy of using squad rotation and resting key players during the Super 14 was [...] criticised. McCaw also came under attack. He was accused of not inspiring his team, lacking the ability to change policy when plan A was not working and not providing enough leadership on the field.|$|R
