40|$|Interaction between CD 40, {{a member}} of the tumor {{necrosis}} factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, and its ligand CD 40 L, a 39 -kDa glycoprotein, is essential for the development of humoral and cellular immune responses 1, 2. Selective blockade or activation of this pathway provides the ground for the development of new treatments against <b>immunologically</b> <b>based</b> diseases 3, 4 and malignancies 5, 6. Like other members of the TNF superfamily, CD 40 L monomers self-assemble around a threefold symmetry axis to form noncovalent homotrimers that can each bind three receptor molecules 7, 8. Here, we report on the structure-based design of small synthetic molecules with C 3 symmetry that can mimic CD 40 L homotrimers. These molecules interact with CD 40, compete with the binding of CD 40 L to CD 40, and reproduce, to a certain extent, the functional properties of the much larger homotrimeric soluble CD 40 L.

The method utilizes a monoclonal antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-MAb) to label the surface of A. anophagefferens cells which are then detected and enumerated by using a flow cytometer. Optimal conditions for FITC-MAb staining, including solution com-position, incubation times, and FITC-MAb concentrations, were determined. The FITC-MAb method was tested for cross-reactivity with nontarget, similarly sized, photoautotrophic protists, and the method was compared to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the same MAb. Comparisons of the IFCM technique to traditional microscopy enumeration of cultures and spiked environmental samples showed consistent agreement over several orders of magnitude (r 2 > 0. 99). Comparisons of the IFCM and ELISA techniques for enumerating cells from a predation experiment showed a substantial overestimation (up to 10 times higher) of the ELISA in the presence of consumers of A. anophagefferens, presumably due to egested cell fragments that retained antigenicity, using the ELISA method, but were not characterized as whole algal cells by the IFCM method.

The generation of NO by this enzyme was detectable after a lag period of 2 hr, reached a maximum between 6 and 12 hr, and was maintained {{for the duration of the}} experiment (48 hr). The expression of the inducible NO synthase was inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, a compound that had no direct effect on the activity of either of the two enzymes.

40|$|West African Dwarf (WAD) goats are {{extremely}} {{important in the}} rural village economy of West Africa, but still {{little is known about}} their biology, ecology and capacity to cope with gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infections. Here, we summarise the history of this breed and explain its economic importance in rural West Africa. We review recent work showing that Nigerian WAD goats are highly trypanotolerant and resist infections with Haemonchus contortus more effectively than other breeds of domestic goat (haemonchotolerance). We believe that haemonchotolerance is largely responsible for the generally low level GIN infections and absence of clinical haemonchosis in WADs under field conditions, and has contributed to the relatively successful and sustainable, anthelmintics-free, small-scale system of goat husbandry in Nigeria’s humid zone, and is <b>immunologically</b> <b>based</b> and genetically controlled.

Although the World Health Organization has been {{successful}} in reducing onchocerciasis as a public health problem in parts of West Africa, there remain an estimated 17 million people infected with Onchocerca volvulus, the parasite that causes this disease. Ocular pathology can be manifested in any part of the eye, although disease manifestations are frequently characterized as either posterior or anterior eye disease. This review focuses on onchocerca-mediated keratitis that results from an inflammatory response in the anterior portion of the eye and summarizes what is currently known about human disease. This review also describes studies with experimental models that have been established to determine the immunological mechanisms underlying interstitial keratitis. The pathogenesis of keratitis is thought to be due to the host inflammatory response to degenerating parasites in the eye; therefore, the primary clinical symptoms of onchocercal keratitis (corneal opacification and neovascularization) are induced after injection of soluble O. volvulus antigens into the corneal stroma. Experimental approaches have demonstrated an essential role for sensitized T helper cells and shown that cytokines can regulate the severity of keratitis by controlling recruitment of inflammatory cells into the cornea. Chemokines are also important in inflammatory cell recruitment to the cornea, and their role in onchocerciasis is being examined.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although insulin is lifesaving and {{sustaining}} {{for those with}} type 1 diabetes (T 1 D), curing the disease {{will be much more}} complex than simple replacement of this hormone. T 1 D is an autoimmune disease orchestrated by T cells, and includes many arms of the immune response. Tremendous effort has gone into understanding its underlying immune, genetic, and environmental causes, and this progress has led to <b>immunologically</b> <b>based</b> clinical trials in T 1 D. This review will focus primarily on the clinical trials of the past decade that have attempted to translate these fundamental findings. RECENT FINDINGS: It is known that powerful, nonspecific immune suppressants can temporarily slow the course of newly diagnosed T 1 D, yet are too toxic for long-term use, especially in children. Recent clinical trials to reverse T 1 D have used newly developed therapies that target specific components of the immune process believed to be involved with T 1 D. Although well justified and designed, no recent approach has resulted in clinical remission and few have had any effect on disease course. SUMMARY: Advances in our fundamental understanding of how the human diabetes immune response is activated and regulated coupled with lessons that have been learnt from the most recent era of completed trials are guiding us toward the development of more effective, multipronged therapies to ablate diabetes autoimmunity, restore immune tolerance, preserve β cells, and, ultimately, improve the lives of patients with T 1 D...|$|R
40|$|Guinea-pigs {{developed}} {{resistance to}} larvae of the ixodid tick, Dermacentor andersoni, after one infestation. Resistant hosts {{were characterized by}} allowing significantly fewer larvae to engorge than non-resistant hosts. Larvae engorging on non-resistant hosts had a mean weight six times that of larvae obtained from resistant hosts {{at the end of}} a 5 -day infestation. This <b>immunologically</b> <b>based</b> resistance was previously shown to have a cell-mediated and a humoral component. In an attempt to ascertain the role of complement in the resistance response, cobra venom factor (CoF) was administered to guinea-pigs producing prolonged (85 – 95 per cent) depletion of complement titres. CoF was administered during an initial infestation with tick larvae to determine if complement depletion altered the acquisition of tick resistance. CoF was also administered to tick-resistant hosts in an attempt to determine if the expression of tick resistance and the development of the basophil-packed lesion, characteristic of the tick-attachment site in resistant hosts, could be altered by complement depletion. CoF did not alter the acquisition of resistance when complement levels were reduced during a primary infestation. However, complement depletion of an animal which had acquired tick resistance blocked the expression of that resistance during a challenge infestation. In addition to increased numbers and weights of larvae engorging on tick-resistant animals depleted of complement, the basophil packed lesion at the tick attachment site was greatly reduced. Complement plays an important role in the expression of tick resistance in guinea-pigs...|$|R

We recommend that eumenorrheic females without oral <b>contraception</b> <b>base</b> the periodization of strength training on their individual menstrual cycle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – West African Dwarf (WAD) goats are {{extremely}} {{important in the}} rural village economy of West Africa, but still {{little is known about}} their biology, ecology and capacity to cope with gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infections. Here, we summarise the history of this breed and explain its economic importance in rural West Africa. We review recent work showing that Nigerian WAD goats are highly trypanotolerant and resist infections with Haemonchus contortus more effectively than other breeds of domestic goat (haemonchotolerance). We believe that haemonchotolerance is largely responsible for the generally low level GIN infections and absence of clinical haemon-chosis in WADs under field conditions, and has contributed to the relatively successful and sustainable, anthelmintics-free, small-scale system of goat husbandry in Nigeria’s humid zone, and is <b>immunologically</b> <b>based</b> and genetically controlled. If haemonchotolerance can be shown to be genetically controlled, {{it should be possible to}} exploit the underlying genes to improve GIN resistance among productive fibre and milk producing breeds of goats, most of which are highly susceptible to nematode infections. Genetic resistance to GIN and trypanosome infections would obviate the need for expensive chemotherapy, mostly unaffordable to small-holder farmers in Africa, and a significant cost of goat husbandry in more developed countries. Either introgression of resistance alleles into susceptible breeds by conventional breeding, or transgenesis could be used to develop novel parasite-resistant, but highly productive breeds, or to improve the resistance of existing breeds, benefitting the local West African rural economy as well as global caprine livestock agriculture...|$|R
