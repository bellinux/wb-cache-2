500|$|Lennon's first son, Julian, {{was born}} during his {{marriage}} to Cynthia as his commitments with the Beatles intensified {{at the height of}} Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, [...] "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'" [...] Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, [...] "It's not an acid song." [...] McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, [...] "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song [...] "Hey Jude". Lennon later said, [...] "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Byrds' version, {{released}} {{as a single}} on April 2, 1968, reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. They transformed it into a classic of the then burgeoning genre of country rock, whereas on the basement version the country music flavor {{is more of an}} undercurrent, suggested by [...] "the lilting chorus melody". Roger McGuinn felt that the song was perfect for the Byrds: [...] "It was country-ish and had that Dylan mystique where you couldn't really figure what he was talking about, yet the lyrics nevertheless drew you in. ... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about when Bob was laid up in Woodstock after the bike accident and sure wasn't going anywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure you}} are very kind, Mr. Rollstone. I had no notion--Ida can tell you I was quite overcome--though when I came to think of it, my poor, dear Morton always did say he had high connections, but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of his jokes.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I've seen it done," [...] said Dan, [...] "but I {{never knew}} how it was managed. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to blow up; {{but it seemed to}} me that if you were good and true and very meek, and had a {{conscience}} void of offence, it wouldn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{wondering}} {{when he was}} going to appear on the scene. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> customary on these occasions for the young man to present himself in person, and not let the lady fight his battles for him. Is this Mr. Winfield a little deficient in nerve?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither did I. An' {{until now}} <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a lark." [...] He changed his {{position}} on the maddening sand and sighed heavily. [...] "But we'll get used to it in time, I guess. What other folks can do, we can, an' a mighty lot of 'em has camped out. It's all right. Here we are, free an' independent, no rent to pay, our own bosses--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, papa. I like KÃ¶nigsgraaf very much. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{the prettiest}} place I know. But I {{do not like}} looking forward to staying here without knowing when I am to go away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do indeed. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{matter of}} great regret that Augustus {{should have been}} sent there, after the scandalous {{treatment}} that Bob received." [...] Bob was the little boy who had drank the champagne and required the carriage exercise.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then why {{not leave}} it, {{and do what}} suits you better? <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> a foolish thing, you know,' said Nan, with a trace of anxiety in the keen eyes that searched for signs of illness in a face as ruddy as a Baldwin apple.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{because you}} knew I wanted a lodgin', though I confess it has puzzled {{me to make}} out why {{you wanted me to}} come to such an out-o'-the-way part o' the city; and, to tell you the truth, it is rather inconvenient, but your letter was so urgent, Miss Ruth, that I knew you must have some good reason, and as your dear father's {{daughter}} has a right to command me, I obeyed, as you know, without question." ...|$|E
60|$|LARRY [coming down on Mat promptly]. I'll tell you, Mat. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a stupid, lazy, good-for-nothing sort {{of thing}} to leave the land {{in the hands of}} the old landlords without calling them to a strict account for the use they made of it, and the {{condition}} of the people on it. I could see for myself that they thought of nothing but what they could get out of it to spend in England; and that they mortgaged and mortgaged until hardly one of them owned his own property or could have afforded to keep it up decently if he'd wanted to. But I tell you plump and plain, Mat, that if anybody thinks things will be any better now that the land is handed over to a lot of little men like you, without calling you to account either, they're mistaken.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, Miles," [...] he answered, when I was through, [...] "this may all be true enough, but it's rather {{late in the}} day for me to go to school. I've heard most of it before, in one {{shape or}} another, but it always came so much in scraps and fragments, that before I could bend one idee on to another, so as to make any useful gear of the whole, some of the pieces have slipped through my fingers. Hows'ever, I've been hard at work at the good book, the whole of this v'y'ge, and you know it's been a long one; and I must say that I've picked up a good deal that {{seems to me to be}} of the right quality. Now <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one of the foolishest things a man could do, to forgive one's enemies, my rule having been to return {{broadside}} for broadside, as you must pretty well know; but, I now see that it is more like a kind natur' to pardon, than to revenge." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There {{was a line}} in one of {{the last}} episodes, [...] "one of them seems perfect for you" [...] and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that summed <b>it</b> up. Dan and Maddy have always been {{incredibly}} close without becoming lovers, but it is obvious that they are great together, so when it happens it is effortless and joyous and has wonderful potential. But Dan's private demons prevent it from being allowed to live and grow. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might be great for him, if only he could have let it be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{never see}} such times as these Mr Trotman, nor the like of such. But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{would come to}} this; {{everything}} turned topsy-turvy as it were, the children getting all the wages, and decent folk turned adrift {{to pick up a}} living as they could. It's something of a judgment in my mind, Mr Trotman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I really don't {{think it}} was {{altogether}} what you call malice, {{so much as the}} Lester idea of fun,' said Ellen, recovering herself after her outpouring. 'A very odd notion <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was; and Mary and Louisa are not really ill-natured, and cannot wish to do the harm they might have done, if I did not know Griff too well.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and {{she asked}} if there was to be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didn't think that was a very proper {{question}} to ask because it hadn't any connection with the lesson--the lesson was about Daniel in the lions' den--but Mrs. Allan just smiled and said she thought there would be. Mrs. Allan has a lovely smile; she has such EXQUISITE dimples in her cheeks. I wish I had dimples in my cheeks, Marilla. I'm not half so skinny as I was when I came here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence people for good. Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence other people for good. She talked so nice about everything. I never knew before that religion was such a cheerful thing. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> kind of melancholy, but Mrs. Allan's isn't, and I'd like to be a Christian if I could be one like her. I wouldn't want to be one like Mr. Superintendent Bell." ...|$|E

Right and wrong, {{who knows}} what THEY mean, except that one's {{to be done and}} one's to be forsworn; or--forgive, my friend, the truest thing I ever said--or else we lose the savour of both. Oh, then, and I know, too, you'd weary of me. I know you, Monsieur Nicholas, better than you can ever know yourself, though you have risen from your grave. You follow a dream, no voice or face or flesh and blood; and not to do what the one old raven within you cries you must, would be in time to hate the very sound of my footsteps. You shall go back, poor turncoat, and face the clearness, the utterly more difficult, bald, and heartless clearness, as {{together}} we faced the dark. Life is a little while. And though I have no words to tell what always are and must be foolish reasons because they are not reasons at all but ghosts of memory, I know in my heart that to face the worst is your only hope of peace. Should I have staked so much on your finding that, and now throw up the game? Don't let us talk any more. I'll walk half the way, perhaps. Perhaps I will walk all the way. I think my brother guesses--at least MY madness. I've talked and talked him nearly past his patience. And then, when you are quite safely, oh yes, quite safely and soundly gone, then I shall go away for a little, so that we can't even hear each other speak, except in dreams. Life!--well, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> much too plain a tale to have as dull an ending. And with us the powers beyond have played a newer trick, that's all. Another hour, and we will go. Till then there's just the solitary walk home and only the dull old haunted house that hoards as many ghosts as we ourselves to watch our coming.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, {{the horror}} film Black Eyed Kids was {{produced}} with Kickstarter funding, its director commenting {{that the black}} eyed children were [...] "an urban legend that's been floating around on the Internet for years now, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fascinating". A 2013 episode of MSN's Weekly Strange that featured reports of black eyed children {{is thought to have}} helped spread the legend on the internet.|$|E

5000|$|While {{not playing}} with the band Trenchmouth, Armisen's {{interests}} switched to acting. In a January 2006 interview, he said, [...] "I {{wanted to be on}} TV somehow.

I just wanted to do something with performing that would lead me there." ...|$|R

50|$|Director Leslie Norman later recalled:Dunkirk was bloody {{difficult}} to make from a logistics point of view. Yet it was made for â¤400,000 and came in under budget... I was the council school boy who became a major in the war, and that {{had a lot to}} do with the way I felt about Dunkirk. I didn't think that Dunkirk was a defeat; <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a very gallant effort but not a victory.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the liner}} {{notes of the}} {{compilation}} album, Sunnyboys, Our Best of (December 2013), Jeremy Oxley wrote [...] "'Alone With You' was picked as the second single off the album although <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the song with the most {{potential to be a}} hit. It was written at Longdown Street in between going to Art School and rehearsals... It was partly about a chick I knew and partly a generalisation about the pent up feelings of teenage lust and love." ...|$|E

When {{asked about it}} in an interview his response was, [...] "I've never recognized 'emo' as a genre of music. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the most retarded term ever. I know there is this generic commonplace that every band that gets labeled with that term hates it. They feel scandalized by it.

5000|$|Chris Cester {{addressed}} the media speculation in a Jared story interview for Uptown Magazine Online, stating: [...] "It's funny because I asked him point blank about that. He said I was crazy. He {{said that when}} he and David Bowie were writing 'Lust for Life', they were ripping off Motown's beat. It's funny that he said that to me because we also thought we were ripping off Motown more than 'Lust for Life'. To be honest with you that kind of annoyed me a lot, because <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> really lazy. People just go well 'Lust for Life' is more well-known so that's what they go for, but if you listen to a song like 'You Can't Hurry Love' (The Supremes) I think you'll find it's closer to 'Are You Gonna Be My Girl' than 'Lust for Life' ever was. And that's what Iggy said as well." ...|$|E
