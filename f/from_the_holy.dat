5|$|The pope is also Sovereign of Vatican City, a small {{city-state}} entirely enclaved {{within the}} city of Rome, which is an entity distinct <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> See. It is {{as head of the}} Holy See, not as head of Vatican City State, that the pope receives ambassadors of states and sends them his own diplomatic representatives. The Holy See also confers orders, decorations and medals, such as the orders of chivalry in the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|When Prince Mestwin {{was buried}} in Oliwa, Przemysł arrived in Gdańsk and took {{possession}} of the duchy of Pomerania. Then he received <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> See the crown of the Polish Kingdom. He lived another year and was captured by {{the men of the}} Margrave of Brandenburg, Waldemar, who killed him to avenge the holy Lukarda his wife, suspecting that he had strangled her.|$|E
5|$|Windsor Castle {{continued}} to be favoured by monarchs in the 15th century, despite England beginning to slip into increasing political violence. Henry IV seized the castle during his coup in 1399, although failing to catch Richard II, who had escaped to London. Under Henry V, the castle hosted a visit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Emperor in 1417, a massive diplomatic event that stretched the accommodation of the castle to its limits.|$|E
5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E

5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Land in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cathedral}} in Gamla Uppsala was damaged by fire in 1204, the Chapter sought {{permission}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> See {{to move the}} building to a larger site. Pope Alexander IV granted this request in 1258 on condition that the name of Uppsala be maintained. At a meeting in Söderköping in September 1270, Archbishop Fulco Angelus and the cathedral chapter decided the site should be in Östra Aros. Formal authorization of the move was issued in 1271 by Bishop Carolus of Västerås whom the Pope had appointed to oversee the case.|$|E
5|$|Andrew II {{decided to}} return home, leaving the crusaders' camp with Hugh I and Bohemond IV in early 1218. Although {{military}} action was suspended after their departure, the crusaders restored fortifications at Caesarea and Atlit. After new troops arrived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Empire in April, they decided to invade Egypt. They elected John supreme commander, giving him the right to rule the land they would conquer. His leadership was primarily nominal, since he could rarely impose his authority on an army of troops from many countries.|$|E

5|$|Frederick Barbarossa {{departed}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Empire in May 1189. The defence of Antioch was {{a principal}} aim of his crusade, but he died unexpectedly near Seleucia in Asia Minor (present-day Silifke in Turkey) on 10June 1190. His son, Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia, {{took over the}} command of the army, but most crusaders {{decided to return to}} Europe. The remnants of the German crusaders reached Antioch on 21June 1190. Bohemond paid homage to Frederick of Swabia. Barbarossa's body, which had been carried to Antioch, was buried in the cathedral before the duke continued his crusade toward the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, five {{historic}} {{church bells}} {{were transferred to}} St Saviour's Church <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Cross Church in Canterbury, which had closed in 1972. Three of the bells {{date back to the}} early 17th century and one was cast in the 14th century. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the Westgate Pavilion was a bingo hall, after which it closed and became derelict. In 2001, a group of volunteers formed a charitable trust to repair the pavilion and it was eventually reopened as a theatre.|$|E
5|$|Koniecpolski led {{a spring}} 1627 {{military}} campaign, {{trying to keep}} the Swedish army in the Duchy of Prussia from moving toward Danzig, while also intending to block their reinforcements arriving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Empire. Moving quickly the Hetman recovered Puck, and then destroyed at the Battle of Czarne (Hammerstein) the forces intended for Gustavus. The Swedes themselves Koniecpolski's forces kept near Tczew, shielding the access to Danzig and preventing Gustavus Adolphus from reaching his main objective. At the Battle of Oliva the Polish ships defeated a Swedish naval squadron.|$|E

5|$|Malvern Water {{has been}} drunk by several British monarchs. Queen Elizabeth I drank it in {{public in the}} 16th century; in 1558 she accorded John Hornyold, a Catholic bishop and lord of the manor, {{the right to use}} the land under the {{condition}} that travellers and pilgrims continue to be able to draw water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Well spring. A royal warrant was granted by Princess Mary Adelaide in 1895 and by King George V in 1911. Queen Victoria refused to travel without it and Queen Elizabeth II took it with her whenever she was travelling.|$|E
5|$|Maria died {{shortly after}} giving birth to their daughter, Isabella, in late 1212. Her death {{triggered}} a legal dispute, with John of Ibelin (who administered Jerusalem before John's coronation) questioning the widowed king's right to rule. The king sent Raoul of Merencourt, Bishop of Sidon, to Rome for assistance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> See. Pope Innocent confirmed John as lawful ruler of the Holy Land in early 1213, urging the prelates to support him with ecclesiastical sanctions if needed. Most of the Jerusalemite lords remained loyal to the king, acknowledging his right to administer the kingdom {{on behalf of his}} infant daughter; John of Ibelin left the Holy Land and settled in Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stephen Báthory {{had decided}} to secure the Bishopric of Kraków for his nephew, but the Holy See did not appoint Andrew coadjutor bishop of the Kraków See, because he was still too young. The king wanted to invade Russia and sent Andrew to Rome to {{convince}} Pope Sixtus V to support his plan. Andrew left Poland on 22 March 1586. Samuel Zborowski's brothers (he had been executed on Stephen Báthory's orders), wanted to capture and murder Andrew, but their plan failed because of a flood. Andrew came to Rome on 24 July. He informed the pope about Stephen Báthory's plan, asking financial support <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> See against Russia.|$|E

Roget and his allies journey to the Mirage Castle to confront Anise, only for her to finish pulling the dark energy from the mirrors before they can stop her. The dark energy kills Inath and the Mirage Bishop, and Anise {{combines}} her form with a possessed Peddan general to create the Goddess of Doom. The allied forces fight and defeat the Goddess, ending the threat from Pedda, and return to their home countries.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Princess found herself, in 1702, in {{the middle}} of a protocolary spat between Tuscany and Spain. The Grand Duke sent an agent to the court of Philip V of Spain with the {{objective}} of procuring a license for the Grand Prince and Princess—who, hypothetically, acquired royal dignity with Cosimo III on 5 February 1691 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> Roman Emperor, Leopold I's, diploma—to use the style Royal Highness in correspondence with Spain. Philip V initially deigned only to sanction his aunt Violante Beatrice's use; however, the agent, Pucci, eventually requisitioned full recognition.|$|E
5|$|The Naradiya Purana narrates that Uttanka {{lived in}} an ashram in Ujjalaka. In his old age, he left for a pilgrimage and {{travelled}} to various temples. Once, the sage saw a hunter named Gulika stealing the golden plates of the temple of Vishnu at Sauvira. Gulika tried to kill the sage. Then Uttanka informed Gulika that the sin of murder would be to live through many births to expiate his sin. Hearing this the hunter was penitent and fell dead. Uttanka then sprinkled water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>holy</b> Ganges on the hunter's corpse, which restored Gulika who then attained Vaikuntha, the abode of Vishnu. As advised by Vishnu, Uttanka went to Badari, performed tapas and attained Vaikuntha himself.|$|E
