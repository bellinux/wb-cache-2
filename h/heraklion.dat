5|$|Samaras {{was born}} in <b>Heraklion,</b> {{the capital city of}} the Greek island of Crete. His {{favourite}} footballer growing up was Marco van Basten. Samaras was also a keen basketball fan and his father, Ioannis Samaras, often let him stay up until {{the early hours of the}} morning so he could watch his hero Michael Jordan.|$|E
5|$|On 17February 1941, the 6th Infantry Division was {{reformed}} in Egypt. It {{was initially}} {{made up of}} the 16th and the 22nd Guards Brigade, who were based in Egypt, but lacked artillery or other supporting arms. The 22nd Guards Brigade was soon withdrawn, and the division was assigned the 14th and 23rd Infantry Brigade. Here, the division trained for amphibious operations in the Dodecanese. The deteriorating situation in North Africa, which saw General Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps retake the territory lost by the Italians during Operation Compass, resulted in the 6th Infantry Division being reassigned to defend Egypt. The division had been earmarked to deploy to Crete, where the 14th Brigade had been based since November, but instead took up defensive positions at Mersa Matruh. The 14th Brigade later defended the airfield at <b>Heraklion</b> during the Battle of Crete when 2,000 German paratroopers landed in the area on 20May. The Germans were able to penetrate into <b>Heraklion,</b> before Anglo-Greek forces cleared the town following heavy fighting. Despite many losses, the paratroopers were able to dig-in on ridges around the brigade's positions. Due to the deteriorating situation on Crete, the 14th Brigade was evacuated by Royal Navy ships on 29 May. En route to Egypt, they were repeatedly bombed by the Luftwaffe, suffering 800 casualties.|$|E
5|$|Thera– A lava-based Titan, Thera is an {{original}} character {{that does not}} appear in Greek mythology. Imprisoned beneath the Methana Volcano just outside the city of Atlantis. Kratos freed the Titan, gained her power (Thera's Bane), and in addition to destroying the archimedean screws, the volcano erupted. The eruption destroyed the city and submerged it under the ocean, and caused great damage to the Island of Crete and its capital city, <b>Heraklion.</b> The character was voiced by Dee Dee Rescher in Ghost of Sparta.|$|E
5|$|Under Venetian rule, a small harbour {{was built}} in Rethymno, which became the third most {{important}} city on Crete after <b>Heraklion</b> and Chania. On 8 April 1540, a line of fortifications began to be built around the city. The walls were designed by the architect Michele Sanmicheli, and were completed in around 1570. These fortifications were {{not strong enough to}} withstand a large assault, and when Uluç Ali Reis attacked in 1571, the Ottomans captured and sacked the city.|$|E
5|$|Born in 1541, {{in either}} the village of Fodele or Candia (the Venetian name of Chandax, present day <b>Heraklion)</b> on Crete, El Greco was descended from a prosperous urban family, which had {{probably}} been driven out of Chania to Candia after an uprising against the Catholic Venetians between 1526 and 1528. El Greco's father, Geórgios Theotokópoulos (d. 1556), was a merchant and tax collector. Nothing is known about his mother or his first wife, also Greek. El Greco's older brother, Manoússos Theotokópoulos (1531– 13 December 1604), was a wealthy merchant and spent {{the last years of}} his life (1603–1604) in El Greco's Toledo home.|$|E
5|$|Marco Polo, {{named after}} the eponymous explorer, was laid down on 1 July 1890 at the Royal Shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia. The ship was {{launched}} on 27 October 1892 and completed on 21 July 1894. She visited <b>Heraklion,</b> Crete and Piraeus, Greece in May 1897 before departing for the Far East on 26 January 1898. In May, Marco Polo sailed up the Yangtze River to make port visits at Nanking and Hankow before returning to Shanghai in July. She visited Japan from August to November and then sailed to Shanghai where she remained until August 1899. The ship departed Shanghai on 27 August and arrived in Naples on 20 October 1899. Marco Polo departed for China in October 1901 and remained there until February 1903. A year later, she began her third tour there in March 1904 and did not leave China until 14 January 1907. En route home the ship visited Zanzibar, Mogadishu, Italian Somaliland, and Massawa, Eritrea before arriving at Taranto on 26 April. Marco Polo was rearmed in 1911 and her armament was reduced to six 152mm, four 120mm, six 57mm, and two 37mm guns. One torpedo tube was also removed during this refit.|$|E
25|$|The 1810 Crete {{earthquake}} {{occurred at}} 22:15 on 16 February. It caused great destruction in <b>Heraklion,</b> some damage from Malta to northern Egypt and was felt from central Italy to Syria. 2,000 fatalities were reported from Candia (<b>Heraklion).</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Heraklion</b> Archaeological Museum is {{a museum}} located in <b>Heraklion</b> on Crete. It {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} museums in Greece and the best in the world for Minoan art, as it contains the most notable and complete collection of artifacts of the Minoan civilization of Crete.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{collection}} of Minoan art is in the museum at <b>Heraklion,</b> near Knossos, on the northern coast of Crete. Minoan art and other remnants of material culture, especially the sequence of ceramic styles, {{have been used by}} archaeologists to define the three phases of Minoan culture (EM, MM, LM).|$|E
25|$|After visiting Cyprus, the Greek Leg of the Torch Relay resumed on July 9, 2004, {{with the}} flame {{touching}} down in Crete {{in the city}} of <b>Heraklion.</b> During the Greek Leg of the relay, the torch also made a cursory stopover in Albania when the torch was carried through a lake on the Greek-Albanian border.|$|E
25|$|Venice {{built an}} arsenal in Corfu {{as part of}} a network of Venetian arsenals, serving {{primarily}} the purpose of repair, and naval stations in Greece, including shipyards in the Aegean Sea, Epirus, the Peloponnese and the Kingdom of Candia (modern Crete). Aside from Corfu, such locations in Greece included Methoni, Koroni, Chalkis, Preveza, Chania and <b>Heraklion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite this, the fortifications {{had several}} shortcomings, mainly {{since they were}} still {{incomplete}} when they were captured by the Ottomans. The bastions have no piazza-bassa or cavaliers, and the curtain walls are quite low {{when compared to other}} contemporary city walls such as the fortifications of <b>Heraklion</b> and the fortifications of Valletta. The fortifications also lacked outworks.|$|E
25|$|In June 1942, British SAS C.O. David Stirling gave British captains George Jellicoe and Free French Georges Bergé {{a mission}} in the Greek island of Crete called Operation <b>Heraklion.</b> Bergé chose three Free French commandos Jacques Mouhot, Pierre Léostic and Jack Sibard, while Lieutenant Kostis Petrakis a local from Crete's special service joined them as civilian.|$|E
25|$|The capital, Parikia, {{situated}} on a bay on the north-west {{side of the}} island, occupies {{the site of the}} ancient capital Paros. Parikía harbour is a major hub for Aegean islands ferries and catamarans, with several sailings each day for Piraeus, the port of Athens, <b>Heraklion,</b> the capital of Crete, and other islands such as Naxos, Ios, Santorini, and Mykonos.|$|E
25|$|After the Cretan Assembly {{issued its}} {{declaration}} of independence in April 1905, the Great Powers responded on 2 May (OS): they were determined to use their naval and ground forces if necessary to maintain order. That same day, at <b>Heraklion,</b> the Greek flag flying above a government building was discreetly removed by the British Army and replaced with a Cretan flag.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Heraklion</b> Archaeological Museum is a Special Regional Service of the Ministry of Culture and {{its purpose}} is to acquire, safeguard, conserve, record, study, publish, display and promote Cretan {{artefacts}} from the Prehistoric to the Late Roman periods. The museum organizes temporary exhibitions in Greece and abroad, collaborates with scientific and scholarly institutions, and houses a variety of cultural events.|$|E
25|$|The {{earthquake}} caused {{severe damage}} in <b>Heraklion</b> and northeastern Crete. Damage was also reported from {{islands in the}} south Aegean, Cairo, Rosetta, Alexandria in northern Egypt and on Malta. Reports {{of the collapse of}} part of the Temple of Amon at Siwa Oasis in 1811 have been also been attributed to the 1810 event, rather than a separate earthquake, which is now regarded as a 'spurious event'.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Campbell, the {{commander}} at <b>Heraklion,</b> {{was forced to}} surrender his contingent. Rethymno fell and {{on the night of}} 30 May, German motorcycle troops linked up with the Italian troops who had landed on Sitia. On 1 June, the remaining 5,000 defenders at Sfakia surrendered. By the end of December, about 500 Commonwealth troops remained at large on the island. While scattered and disorganized, these men and the partisans harassed German troops for long after the withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|The Herakleion Archaeological Museum {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and most {{important}} museums in Greece, and among the most important museums in Europe. It houses representative artifacts from all the periods of Cretan prehistory and history, covering a chronological span of over 5,500 years from the Neolithic period to Roman times. The singularly important Minoan collection contains unique examples of Minoan art, many of them true masterpieces. The <b>Heraklion</b> Museum is rightly considered as the museum of Minoan culture par excellence worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The Phaistos Disc (also spelled Phaistos Disk, Phaestos Disc) is a disk of fired clay {{from the}} Minoan palace of Phaistos {{on the island}} of Crete, {{possibly}} dating to the middle or late Minoan Bronze Age (second millennium B.C.). The disk is about 15cm (5.9in) in diameter and covered on both sides with a spiral of stamped symbols. Its purpose and meaning, and even its original geographical place of manufacture, remain disputed, {{making it one of the}} most famous mysteries of archaeology. This unique object is now on display at the archaeological museum of <b>Heraklion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another bronze piece, dated c. 750 BC and {{presently}} in the <b>Heraklion</b> Museum, shows two helmeted {{but otherwise}} nude youths, one {{older than the}} other. They both display erections and stand beside each other holding hands. Yet another bronze cutout dated to the 7th century BC shows a lad, nude except for a long, decorative cape and sandals, holding a bow and quiver. These pieces document that this Cretan initiatory tradition continued over many centuries and that later offerings left by pairs of lovers at this shrine became more elaborate and erotically explicit.|$|E
25|$|Since 1645, Venice and the Ottoman Empire {{had been}} at war over the {{possession}} of the island of Crete. Ottoman forces had captured most of the island {{in the early years}} of the war, but were unable to seize its capital, the heavily fortified city of Candia (modern <b>Heraklion).</b> The Venetians had endeavoured to cut off supplies and reinforcements to the Ottoman army, and attempted several times to blockade the Straits of the Dardanelles, through which the Ottoman fleet had to sail to reach the Aegean Sea from its base around Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July, the Powers {{declared}} martial law. This measure {{seems to}} have had a minimal impact: the insurgents then controlled the entire west of the island, where order reigned, and they were ready to retreat into the White Mountains if necessary. Afterwards, the foreign troops increased their activity. The British occupied <b>Heraklion,</b> the Russians Rethymno, the Italians Kissamos and the French Agios Nikolaos, Sitia and Ierapetra. At Rethymno, the Russians declared a state of siege and the measures they took were more severe than in the island's other regions.|$|E
25|$|About 500 {{men from}} the 2/4th were {{evacuated}} by sea to Crete, arriving on 27 April. After the Germans launched an airborne invasion of the strategically important island on 20 May, the 2/4th fought around <b>Heraklion</b> airfield, being temporarily detached to the British 14th Infantry Brigade. During the initial landing, the German paratroopers attacking the airfield were repulsed, but they successfully managed to establish a strong foothold around the Allied position, and after heavy fighting the battalion was withdrawn from town, being taken off the <b>Heraklion</b> mole aboard several British destroyers as the island fell to the Germans. During the evacuation several of the warships that carried the 2/4th were subjected to heavy aerial attack, and several from the battalion were killed or wounded. After arriving in Alexandria, the battalion was rebuilt in Palestine, making up its losses from the earlier campaigns from new reinforcements in Palestine. In {{the wake of the}} Syria–Lebanon campaign, the battalion deployed to Syria as part of the Allied occupation force established there to defend against a possible German invasion through the Caucasus. They remained there until January 1942, enduring a cold and snowy winter. In the middle of the month, the 19th Brigade moved to Palestine, and from there the 2/4th embarked upon the troopship HMT Rajula at Port Tewfik, for the return to Australia, following Japan's entry into the war. Sailing via Colombo, they arrived in Fremantle in mid-March 1942, before proceeding on to Port Adelaide.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{claimed that}} the Germans must have {{suffered}} well over 15,000 casualties, while Admiral Cunningham felt that the figure was more like 22,000. Buckley, based on British intelligence assumptions of two enemies wounded for every one killed, gave an estimate of 16,800 casualties. The United States Army Center of Military History, citing {{a report of the}} Historical Branch of the British Cabinet Office, concluded that military historians accept estimates from 6,000–7,000 German casualties. The Australian Graves Commission counted about 5,000 German graves in the Maleme–Souda Bay area, at Rethymno and at <b>Heraklion,</b> that would have included deaths during the German occupation due to sickness, accidents or fighting with partisan forces.|$|E
25|$|After {{an absence}} of regular charter services, Aspro Holidays {{operated}} a series of summer charter services during the 1992–93 summer season with its in-house airline Inter European Airways to Palma (Mallorca) and Larnaca (Cyprus) using the Boeing 737, and added a service to <b>Heraklion</b> (Crete), which was often operated using their larger Boeing 757 airliner. When Aspro Holidays {{was taken over by}} the Airtours Holiday group, the flights ceased. The early 1990s also saw weekly flights to Larnaca (Cyprus) by Cypriana Holidays, with Eurocypria operating the inbound flight via Norwich as a split load. The service continued for approximately two summer seasons before Cypriana Holidays went into administration.|$|E
25|$|Greece {{is said to}} {{have welcomed}} the most {{seasonal}} tourists from Serbia than any other country. While Athens and Thessaloniki are traditionally popular destinations for Serbs on vacation, tourist charters from Belgrade often channel Serbian travelers to <b>Heraklion,</b> Kos, Zakynthos, and other less densely populated destinations. Unlike English, German, and other foreign tourists, many of whom canceled their vacations in Greece due to protests and economical crisis in the summer of 2010, Serbian tourists broke the record, visiting the country in great numbers. The Serbian President stated, in Athens in June 2010, that this is how Serbia, in a small way, is helping Greek friends during hard times for them.|$|E
