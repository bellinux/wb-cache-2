A comprehensive detailed foot model can make a significant contribution to the study of simulation and prediction for product design, e. g. footwear and orthosis, and for other medical use. In this study, a systematic and anatomically-based approach for human foot modelling based on OpenSim platform and textured 3 D surface model obtained from range-sensing scanning is proposed. Experiments for the validation of the kinematic and kinetic properties were also conducted. Microsoft Kinect sensor was adopted for the acquisition of 3 D textured foot surface model. The precision of the equipment was tested via scanning experiment, within which the output model was compared to those from a high-end optical foot scanner. The ultrasound equipment was utilized to measure the soft tissue thicknesses which were used for the modelling and validation of the integrated foot model containing the subject-specific foot surface and morphed skeleton geometry. In addition, a system for producing <b>foot</b> surface <b>anatomy,</b> allowing customized generation of surface regions projected from the internal muscle geometries, was developed using Visual C++ on the basis of VTK and CGAL library. What's more, the comprehensive foot and shank model including all the bones and muscles belonging to this body part was also built.

5000|$|A {{larger study}} of sickle-claw function, {{published}} in 2011 by Fowler and colleagues, {{concluded that the}} earlier study by Manning and colleagues was correct and that the [...] "sickle claws" [...] would have been ineffective as cutting weapons. They compared the claw and overall <b>foot</b> <b>anatomy</b> of various primitive species with modern birds {{to shed light on}} their actual function. Fowler and colleagues showed that many modern predatory birds also have enlarged claws on the second toes. In modern raptors, these claws are used to help grip and hold prey of sizes smaller than or equal to the predator, while the birds use their body weight to pin their prey to the ground and eat it alive. Fowler and colleagues suggested that this behavior is entirely consistent with the anatomy of advanced dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus, which had slightly opposing first toes and strong tendons in the toes and foot. This makes it likely that advanced dromaeosaurids also used their claws to puncture and grip their prey to aid in pinning it to the ground, while using shallow wing beats and tail movements to stabilize themselves. Other lines of evidence for this behavior include teeth which had large, hooked serrations only on the back edge (useful in pulling flesh upward rather than slicing it) and large claws on the wings (for greater maneuvering of prey while mantling it with the wings).|$|E
5000|$|The feet of {{chameleons}} {{are highly}} adapted to arboreal locomotion, and {{species such as}} Chamaeleo namaquensis that have secondarily adopted a terrestrial habit have retained the same foot morphology with little modification. On each foot, the five clearly distinguished toes are grouped into two fascicles. The toes in each fascicle are bound into a flattened group of either two or three, giving each foot a tongs-like appearance. On the front feet, the outer, lateral, group contains two toes, whereas the inner, medial, group contains three. On the rear feet, this arrangement is reversed, the medial group containing two toes, and the lateral group three. These specialized feet allow chameleons to grip tightly onto narrow or rough branches. Furthermore, each toe {{is equipped with a}} sharp claw to afford a grip on surfaces such as bark when climbing. It is common to refer to the feet of chameleons as didactyl or zygodactyl, though neither term is fully satisfactory, both being used in describing totally different feet, such as the zygodactyl feet of parrots or didactyl feet of sloths or ostriches, none of which is significantly like chameleon feet. Although [...] "zygodactyl" [...] is reasonably descriptive of chameleon <b>foot</b> <b>anatomy,</b> their foot structure does not resemble that of parrots, to which the term was first applied.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} one of the most common problems, from which the people with Down syndrome suffer flat foot. Flat foot appears along with this illness more often than with healthy population. This fact is given by the presence of excessive amount of collagen type VI, also by generalised low muscle tone (hypotonia) and hypermobility. Human foot is a very important part of the musculoskeletal system and performs statical, as well as dynamical function. The sole is capable of kindly taking to the terrain on which it moves. The foot ensures the stability of the either standing or moving body, moreover it is source of proprioceptive information from minor planta. To perform these functions, it is necessary that arch of the foot is properly created, to centre stance of joints of the foot be set and no other deformations be present. Many information about the treatment of healthy children for flat foot can be found in professional literature, but unfortunately no information about the treatment of children with such genetical burden so far. Many opinions about the flat foot treatment occur among the professional community, next to starting active exercise it is often recommended to wait with the treatment till further age or use only passive orthopaedical tools. This thesis aims to bring closer the possibilities of the flat foot treatment of children with Down syndrome. In the theoretical part, the Down syndrome is described, its cause of creation and characteristics. Attention is given to signs of the disease on the musculoskeletal system. Moreover, the theoretical part discusses the human <b>foot,</b> its <b>anatomy,</b> kinesiology, its functions and most common deformity flat foot. The diagnostics of the flat foot is described as well the Chippaux - Šmiřák method. The practical part of the thesis is carried out by casuistries with the help of qualitative research. The research set consists of three children with Down syndrome, two girls aged 11 and 8 and one boy aged 5. The therapy was carried out during 5 months. Once in 14 days the children came with their parents to Centre Arpida in České Budějovice for the therapy lead by me, and the children should then exercise daily at home with the help of their parents.

40|$|A {{profound}} {{understanding of}} the influence of trackmaker <b>anatomy,</b> <b>foot</b> movements and substrate properties is crucial for any interpretation of fossil tracks. In this case study we analyze variability of footprint shape within one large theropod (T 3), one medium-sized theropod (T 2) and one ornithopod (I 1) trackway from the Lower Cretaceous of Münchehagen (Lower Saxony, Germany) {{in order to determine the}} informativeness of individual features and measurements for ichnotaxonomy, trackmaker identification, and the discrimination between left and right footprints. Landmark analysis is employed based on interpretative outline drawings derived from photogrammetric data, allowing for the location of variability within the footprint and the assessment of covariation of separate footprint parts. Objective methods to define the margins of a footprint are tested and shown to be sufficiently accurate to reproduce the most important results. The lateral hypex and the heel are the most variable regions in the two theropod trackways. As indicated by principal component analysis, a posterior shift of the lateral hypex is correlated with an anterior shift of the margin of the heel. This pattern is less pronounced in the ornithopod trackway, indicating that variation patterns can differ in separate trackways. In all trackways, hypices vary independently from each other, suggesting that their relative position a questionable feature for ichnotaxonomic purposes. Most criteria commonly employed to differentiate between left and right footprints assigned to theropods are found to be reasonably reliable. The described ornithopod footprints are asymmetrical, again allowing for a left–right differentiation. Strikingly, 12 out of 19 measured footprints of the T 2 trackway are stepped over the trackway midline, rendering the trackway pattern a misleading left–right criterion for this trackway. Traditional measurements were unable to differentiate between the theropod and the ornithopod trackways. Geometric morphometric analysis reveals potential for improvement of existing discriminant methods...|$|R
40|$|Background: Musculoskeletal (MSK) {{disease is}} the major cause of years lived with {{disability}} in the UK. The UK is behind other comparable countries in confronting consequences of long-term diseases. One potentially effective approach is by educating people to become more health literate. Early life interventions relating to exercise and good MSK health practices may be an effective addition to traditional approaches. LifeLab is a science-based approach to improving teenagers’ health-related attitudes and behaviour. The LifeLab approach was developed at the University of Southampton and combines educationalists, scientists, clinical researchers and school children and has been effective in improving young peoples’ {{understanding of the nature}} of diseases and reasoning about health issues. However, no specific MSK health education components have previously been included in LifeLab. Methods: In 2014 the first MSK LifeLab workshop was designed with educationalists and researchers in biomechanics, occupational therapy, podiatry, and physiotherapy from the MSK Research Cluster at Southampton for year 8 (age 12 - 13) school students. The workshops aimed to promote young peoples’ health literacy in musculoskeletal health and integrated experiential learning using 3 D motion analysis, real-time ultrasound scanning of muscles contracting; radiographs of normal and osteoarthritis <b>foot</b> joints; <b>anatomy</b> models and hand and hip joint implants. The workshops covered a) the impact of osteoarthritis joint disease on daily life b) capturing and illustrating joint movement using state of the art 3 D motion analysis technology and c) an in-depth look at muscles using ultrasound imaging. Learning objectives included students being able to: 1. Identify key components of active healthy living for bones, muscles and joints 2. Observe patterns in how healthy joints can move and contrast patterns with injured joint movement 3. Discover what role muscles play in healthy joints 4. Compare healthy joint structures with arthritic joint structures Results: 58 students from 3 state secondary schools, attended a university widening participation outreach day within which the MSK LifeLab workshop was run. On the same day the students also attended workshops in Humanities and Oceanography. When asked which workshop of the outreach day was their favourite 43 % of the students identified the MSK workshops. Feedback on why the workshops were enjoyable included; “I enjoyed biomechanics because I like looking at how things work and move”; “Ostioarphritus. I'm into sports & find the body interesting”; “The bones because you got to find out about the body”. The interactive nature of the workshop with teenagers having hands on learning was also well received “My favourite was bones because they made it fun”; “The bones experiments because the technology involved was awesome. ” Conclusions: Using interactive MSK workshops as part of LifeLab presents an exciting health literacy approach to encourage young people to start to engage in understanding their MSK health. Acknowledgements: These are not included in the abstract but will appear if we get a paper accepted. LifeLab, has been developed as a joint initiative, involving, in addition to the University of Southampton and the University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust; the MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, the University of Southampton (UoS) Faculty of Medicine and Southampton Education School, the Mathematics and Science Learning Centre (MSLC), the NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre and the Garfield Weston Foundation.

Additionally a podogram was performed by an experienced podiatrist. 41 runners trained for more than 5 years, 12 between 3 - 5, 28 between 1 - 3 and I I less than one year. The mean age was 35, 4 years. The majority had weekly distances of less than 20 km (n = 43) and 20 - 40 km (n = 28), 14 40 - 60 km and only 6 runners were running more than 60 km per week. We could define two groups: one group as the sedentary runner with distances less than 20 km over a minimum period of 3 - 5 years and the competitive runner with distances above 40 per week over at least 3 years. Most of the runners run on tarred or gravel surfaces {{or a combination of}} those. The knowledge of the own <b>foot</b> <b>anatomy</b> and biomechanics was poor. Only 50 % were correct in identifying their anatomy. 30 % of all runners have been given orthotics of which only 50 % demonstrated an improvement in symptoms...|$|E
30|$|A {{number of}} reports on stature {{estimation}} from foot dimensions from Asia (Sanli et al. 2005; Krishan and Sharma 2007; Mansur et al. 2012; Dhaneria et al. 2016; Kim et al. 2018) and Middle East (Ozden et al. 2005; Atamturk and Duyar 2008) have recognized {{over the years}} the existence of community or ethnic diversity in <b>foot</b> <b>anatomy</b> and anthropometry. This has been attributed to a number of causative variables including climate, heredity, nutrition, lifestyle, and occupation. This observation necessitates population-specific stature prediction models from various anthropometric dimensions to be determined across the regional or ethnic divides (Shukla et al. 2017).|$|E
40|$|Plantar {{pressures}} during locomotion have causal {{links with}} foot pathologies e. g. osteoarthritis and foot abscesses. The causes of these pathologies are multifactorial but the foot-ground interaction {{is a major}} factor, particularly the frequencies and amplitudes of loading at foot impact, which can exacerbate pathology even if not the primary cause. <b>Foot</b> <b>anatomy</b> varies enormously amongst hoofed mammals, yet the functional consequences of foot anatomical variations are still a mystery. Elephants and rhinos respectively have five and three toes bound in a flexible pad of fibrous tissue (digital cushion), which is heavy and costly to swing, but seems to dampen vibrations when the foot hits the ground. Are the digital cushion and multi-toed foot structure thus marvellous solutions that control peak foot pressures in giant animals? How then do intermediate designs such as cows and giraffes work? We here study six species (pigs, horses, cows, rhinos, giraffes and elephants) to determine how <b>foot</b> <b>anatomy</b> and body mass influence the distribution of regional plantar pressures during walking. Our results show that peak pressure levels are maintained at near-constant relative levels across animal sizes by foot specializations, but that pressures on the distal ends of middle toes are significantly beyond those of {{other parts of the}} feet. Our study is the first attempt to measure plantar pressure distributions using spatially continuous descriptive statistical images and subsequent topological analysis, a set of techniques recently developed for human plantar pressure studies...|$|E
40|$|An isolated, fully {{articulated}} hindlimb of a basal iguanodont {{from the}} Spanish Las Hoyas Lagerstätte is described. It probably {{belonged to a}} juvenile or subadult individual. Despite some slight differences, anatomical features, {{as well as the}} late Barremian age of this specimen, would suggest that it belongs to Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis. The exquisite preservation of this specimen provides information on the <b>foot</b> <b>anatomy</b> of basal iguanodonts. This is the first report of a non-theropod dinosaur from Las Hoyas. From a palaeoecological point of view, this discovery indicates that potential prey of the carcharodontosaurian theropod Concavenator were present at Las Hoyas, thus complementing our knowledge of the trophic structure of this Early Cretaceous palaeocommunit...|$|E
40|$|We {{argue that}} the phenomenological or ‘agnostic’ {{approach}} to evolutionary systems advocated by Thomas Henry Huxley is applicable in anthropological archaeology and show how agnosticism helps defuse the tension between humanists, natural philosophers and natural historians in integrative research. We deploy problem-framing methods from policy-relevant research in a palaeoanthropological context, developing a model of complex (scale-dependent, irreversible) causality and applying it {{to the problem of}} human-landscape interaction and primate <b>foot</b> <b>anatomy.</b> We illustrate this process with a single iteration of the ‘project cycle’ focussed on human-landscape interaction. Modern humans are co-operative resilience feeders, exploiting complex causality by perturbing stable, unproductive landscapes and feeding on the fluxes of energy and resources released as they spring back. Is it possible that this resilience-feeding is older than Homo sapiens...|$|E
40|$|A deeper {{investigation}} of <b>foot</b> <b>anatomy</b> {{and a more}} accurate biomechanical model can be objects of interest to investigate daily activities, as to optimize orthopedic tools and bipedal robots. Several studies address the development of multi-segments kinematic foot models, but less to the dynamic analysis, because of instruments limitations. The aim of this work {{is the development of}} a two-segments foot model for biomechanical analysis. The model has been validated considering gait cycle of a healthy volunteer. The application of two adjacent force plates allowed the simultaneous recording of the ground reaction forces separately for the fore and hindfoot, as the pointing out of their involvement during stance. Ankle power generation at toe off in traditional model presents an overestimation around 50 % of the total value in the two-segments model...|$|E
