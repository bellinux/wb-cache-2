Boroaluminosilicate glasses form the basis of many industrial products and they exhibit complex structural behavior due to the mixed network-former effect. Based on available structural NMR data and a previously proposed approach, we here establish a temperature-dependent constraint model of indentation hardness of sodium boroaluminosilicate glasses. The model correctly predicts the trends of hardness with varying Si/Al and Na/B ratios, including local minima and maxima at intermediate compositions. This topological approach is thus proving to be a valuable tool for exploring and designing new boroaluminosilicate glass compositions with tailored hardness...|$|E

40|$|Glass can be {{considered}} to be a high-technology engineering material with a multifunctional potential for structural applications. However, the conventional approach to the use of glass is often based only on its properties of transparency and isolation.
