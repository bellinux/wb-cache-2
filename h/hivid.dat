50|$|Zalcitabine (2′-3′-dideoxycytidine, ddC), {{also called}} dideoxycytidine, is a {{nucleoside}} analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) sold under the trade name <b>Hivid.</b> Zalcitabine {{was the third}} antiretroviral {{to be approved by}} the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. It is used as part of a combination regimen.|$|E
40|$|We {{reported}} <b>HIVID</b> (high-throughput Viral Integration Detection), a novel {{experimental and}} computational method {{to detect the}} location of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) integration breakpoints in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) genome. In this method, the fragments with HBV sequence were enriched {{by a set of}} HBV probes and then processed to high-throughput sequencing. In order to evaluate the performance of <b>HIVID,</b> we compared the results of <b>HIVID</b> with that of whole genome sequencing method (WGS) in 28 HCC tumors. We detected a total of 246 HBV integration breakpoints in HCC genome, 113 out of which were within 400. bp upstream or downstream of 125 breakpoints identified by WGS method, covering 89. 3 % (125 / 140) of total breakpoints. The integration was located in the gene TERT, MLL 4, and CCNE 1. In addition, we discovered 133 novel breakpoints missed by WGS method, with 66. 7 % (10 / 15) of validation rate. Our study shows <b>HIVID</b> is a cost-effective methodology with high specificity and sensitivity to identify viral integration in human genome...|$|E
40|$|A {{specific}} and sensitive radioimmunoassay for {{the determination of}} levels of zalcitabine in human plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid has been developed. Commercially available radiolabel and antiserum (Sigma Chemicals) were used after dilution in assay buffer. Prior to the immunoassay, standard and patient samples were subjected to solid-phase extraction on silica columns {{in order to obtain}} purified samples. The lower limit of quantitation was determined to be 1 ng/ml. Intra- and interassay variations were less than 11 % for a number of quality control samples of drug in plasma and urine. Results from parallelism studies with plasma and urine demonstrated that samples outside the standard range (1 to 30 ng/ml) could be diluted by blank plasma or assay buffer, respectively. A large number of related compounds and potentially coadministered drugs were tested for cross-reactivity. Stability tests showed that heat treatment for 30 min at 60 °C or storage for 1 month at- 30 °C did not affect zalcitabine concentrations in plasma or urine. The radioimmunoassay with solid-phase extraction for sample cleanup discussed here has been successfully applied in a pharmacokinetic study of a single patient, demonstrating its applicability for clinical pharmacokinetic research with zalcitabine.
