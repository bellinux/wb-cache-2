Most importantly perhaps, the local-government law of July 1805 founded the first Dutch system of public administration.|$|E
5|$|Motion {{argues that}} {{aside from the}} {{sometimes}} facetious tone, the opinions expressed by Larkin in his Coleman persona, particularly the mild xenophobia that enters the essay, <b>foreshadow</b> his own mature prejudices. Bradford believes that the essay reads as a serious, well-researched paper on the genre of early twentieth century boarding school literature, worthy of inclusion in F. W. Bateson's Essays and Criticism had that journal existed in 1943.|$|E
40|$|We {{experiment}} with mood-expressing, procedurally gener-ated music for narrative <b>foreshadowing</b> in videogames, in-vestigating {{the relationship between}} music and the player’s experience of narrative events in a game. We designed and conducted a user study in which the game’s music expresses true <b>foreshadowing</b> in some trials (e. g. foreboding music before a negative event) and false <b>foreshadowing</b> in others (e. g. happy music that {{does not lead to}} a positive event). We observed players playing the game, recorded analytics data, and had them complete a survey upon completion of the gameplay. Thirty undergraduate and graduate students participated in the study. Statistical analyses suggest that the use of musical cues for narrative <b>foreshadowing</b> induces a better perceived consistency between music and game narra-tive. Surprisingly, false <b>foreshadowing</b> was found to enhance the player’s enjoyment...|$|R

50|$|<b>Foreshadowing</b> is a {{literary}} device by which an author hints {{what is to}} come. <b>Foreshadowing</b> is a dramatic device in which an important plot-point is mentioned early in the story, and will later return in a more significant way. It is used to avoid disappointment. It is also sometimes used to arouse the reader. <b>Foreshadowing</b> is often something which can easily go by unnoticed on the first time reading a story but will be easily noticed on the second time.|$|R
5|$|In the {{wilderness}} {{of the dance}} floor, Gaga recognizes the wolf-woman she has become and refuses to misrepresent herself any longer. She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to <b>foreshadow</b> the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E
5|$|The film's soundtrack {{consists}} {{almost entirely}} of pre-World War I 78 rpm recordings of opera arias sung by the Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. This bold use, despite Caruso's variety of musical styles, constitutes a first for Allen. Opera has been used before in his work {{as an indicator of}} social class, such as in Husbands and Wives (1992). In Match Point, the arias and opera extracts make an ironic commentary on the actions of the characters and sometimes <b>foreshadow</b> developments in the movie's narrative. Furthermore, given Wilton's status as an introvert and opera enthusiast himself, the accompaniment emphasises his detachment from his crime.|$|E
5|$|Two essays written {{during this}} time <b>foreshadow</b> Smuts's later views, both {{political}} and philosophical. The first of these, entitled South African Customs Union, was written in 1890 in competition for the JB Ebden prize offered by the University of the Cape of Good Hope. This essay, {{an examination of the}} economic relations of the colonies and states of South Africa, though 'Highly Commended' by the judges, failed to win the prize. Nevertheless, despite achieving only modest success, it is unsurpassed as a clear and authoritative statement of Smuts's political outlook at this time.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept for}} Eternal Punishment {{emerged during the}} writing for Persona 2: Innocent Sin. Halfway through writing the latter's script, Tadashi Satomi felt that the draft gave him the {{impression}} of needing an alternate point of view {{to that of the}} main hero. This concept formed the basis for Eternal Punishments plot. To <b>foreshadow</b> this, the team showed the main characters from Eternal Punishment through minor roles in Innocent Sin. Eternal Punishment began full development after the release of Innocent Sin. Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment both used the same game engine and structure. Kouji Okada, Innocent Sins producer, returned in the same role. When developing Eternal Punishment, the development team took what they learned from Innocent Sin and used it to improve the gameplay and the Rumor system. One of the biggest concerns when making Eternal Punishment was how much the development staff wanted to include, which went well beyond their original plans.|$|E
5|$|Philip Nel {{highlighted}} {{the influence of}} Jane Austen, whom Rowling has greatly admired {{since the age of}} twelve. Both novelists encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant <b>foreshadow</b> important events or characters much later in the story-line– for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some social behaviour in the Harry Potter books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirise social behaviour and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories, and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature. Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C.S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genresfantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, Bildungsroman and many others.|$|E

25|$|The band's Wooden Nickel {{recordings}} Styx (1972), Styx II (1973), The Serpent Is Rising (1973) and Man of Miracles (1974) were {{a mixture}} of straight-ahead rock with some dramatic prog-rock flourishes and art-rock aspirations. These albums showcase intricate and powerful organ, guitar, vocal and percussion solos as well.

25|$|In the meantime, anti-Spanish sentiments {{in several}} South American {{countries}} (including Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador) increased.

However, Peru and its neighbors still remained wary of any moves that might <b>foreshadow</b> an attempt to reestablish the Spanish Empire. Given the climate of suspicion, no one was surprised when the Spanish gunboat Vencedora stopped at a Chilean port for coal and President José Joaquín Pérez declared that coal was a war supply that could not be sold to a belligerent nation.|$|E
25|$|For the ED I and ED II periods, {{there are}} no {{contemporary}} documents shedding any light on warfare or diplomacy. Only {{for the end of}} the ED III period are contemporary texts available from which a political history can be reconstructed. The largest archives come from Lagash and Ebla; smaller collections of clay tablets have been found at Ur, Tell Beydar, Tell Fara, Abu Salabikh and Mari. They show that the Mesopotamian states were constantly involved in diplomatic contacts, leading to political and perhaps even religious alliances. Sometimes, one state would gain hegemony over another; a situation that would <b>foreshadow</b> the rise of the Akkadian Empire.|$|E
50|$|Aside from Danticat’s use of symbolism, <b>foreshadowing</b> is also heavily prevalent. For example, {{the doctors}} states that “many of us {{start out as}} twins in the belly and do away with each other (Ch.4, p.19).” This <b>foreshadows</b> not only the death of Rafael, but also {{the fate of the}} Haitians. The Haitians and the Dominican both hail from the same island and {{struggle}} to survive among the same resources. 1 However, it is the Dominicans who try {{to do away with the}} Haitians in the form of the killings. In addition, the twins serve as further <b>foreshadowing</b> in terms of the Rosalinda’s caul and Rafael’s death. The caul served as an omen of bad luck to come and Rafael’s unexpected death <b>foreshadowed</b> many more deaths, such as the sudden death of Kongo’s son and the unprecedented number of deaths of Haitians.|$|R
40|$|<b>Foreshadowing</b> {{in a novel}} {{would seem}} to imply that that novel {{takes place in a}} world of fate, but Charles Dickens’s Bleak House and Thomas Hardy’s A Pair of Blue Eyes complicate this assumption. Instead of {{directly}} arguing against a world of fate, however, their <b>foreshadowing</b> techniques present fate as a subjective experience, most likely shared by people who have been trained to read their own lives novelistically. While Dickens’s novel shows readers a meaningful world in which all secret plot information will be revealed eventually, Hardy’s novel stresses readers’ inability to know the whole story and teases them with withheld information all the way to its end. In this thesis, I attempt to explore <b>foreshadowing</b> in especially cryptic passages of Bleak House and A Pair of Blue Eyes.   In Bleak House, I focus on the <b>foreshadowing</b> in the scenes leading up to Krook and Tulkinghorn’s deaths.   In A Pair of Blue Eyes, my focus is less chapter-centric, although I spend considerable time examining Henry Knight’s near-death experience on the Cliff Without a Name.   Much of the critical framework for my close readings comes from Peter Brook’s Reading for the Plot and Michael André Bernstein’s Foregone Conclusions.   While Reading for the Plot supplements my commentary on repetition’s relation to resolution in a plot, Foregone Conclusions gives me the vocabulary to discuss different types of <b>foreshadowing</b> and their effects. Although these critics, and others, inform my work, I add my own perspective on the features of <b>foreshadowing,</b> by looking at how readers’ experiences of <b>foreshadowing</b> change when they re-read a text...|$|R

25|$|Forsythe(2005) {{considers}} the episode with Cornelius Cossus and Decius Mus {{to have been}} invented, in part to <b>foreshadow</b> Decius' sacrifice in 340. P.

Instead later annalists have combined the disaster at the Caudine Forks with the tale of the military tribune of 258 to produce the entirely fictitious story recorded by Livy, the difference being that while in the originals the Romans suffered defeat and death, here none of Decius' men are killed and the Romans win a great victory.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary failure}} {{condition}} in adventure games, inherited from more action-oriented games, is player death. Without the clearly identified enemies of other genres, its inclusion in adventure games is controversial, and many developers now either avoid it or take extra steps to <b>foreshadow</b> death.

Infocom's text adventure The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy {{has been criticized for}} a scenario where failing to pick up a pile of junk mail {{at the beginning of the}} game prevented the player, much later, from completing the game.
