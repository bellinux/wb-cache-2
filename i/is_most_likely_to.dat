5|$|Collybia cirrhata <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, which have a similar external appearance. C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine cones.|$|E
5|$|This {{model was}} able to explain {{observations}} of atomic behavior that previous models could not, such as certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen. Thus, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be observed.|$|E
5|$|While all of {{the contradictions}} above cannot be reconciled, the most {{probable}} dates that may be drawn from available data place Æthelberht's birth at approximately 560 and, perhaps, his marriage to Bertha at 580.

5|$|A male {{sea otter}} <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory {{in an area}} that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E
5|$|Acne scars {{are caused}} by {{inflammation}} within the dermal layer of skin and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris. The scar is created by abnormal healing following this dermal inflammation. Scarring <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take place with severe acne, but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris. Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss {{at the site of}} the acne lesion.|$|E
5|$|An {{improved}} {{mathematical analysis}} of Cassini data by astrophysicists Matthew Holman and Matthew Payne tightened the constraints on possible locations of Planet Nine. Holman and Payne developed {{a more efficient}} model {{that allowed them to}} explore a broader range of parameters than the previous analysis. The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints on Planet Nine's orbit. Holman and Payne concluded that Planet Nine <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be located within 20° of RA = 40°, Dec = −15°, in an area of the sky near the constellation Cetus.|$|E

40|$|We use {{data from}} the Labour Force Survey to show that {{employed}} and unemployed job seekers in Great Britain originate from different occupations and find jobs in different occupations. We find substantial differences in occupational mobility between job seekers: employed job seekers <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> move to occupations paying higher average wages relative to their previous occupation, while unemployed job seekers <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> move to lower paying occupations. Employed and unemployed job seekers exhibit different patterns of occupational mobility and, therefore, do not accept {{the same types of}} jobs. ...|$|R
5|$|Collybia cookei <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be {{confused}} with the two other members of Collybia, both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from the moss or debris in which the stem is embedded. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> occur if the nest is high in a tree {{and there is a}} good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that out of all dog breeds, it is the Labrador Retriever that <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be obese. In a 2016 {{published}} study it was shown that out of 310 Labradors, most were missing all or parts of the POMC gene. This gene plays a part in appetite regulation as well as indication of the amount of one's stored fat. The study concluded that the absence of that gene {{had a significant impact on}} Labrador weight and appetite. The POMC gene mutation is present in only one other breed – the Flat-coated Retriever.|$|E

5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the very}} few genera where the workers lay trophic eggs, or {{infertile}} eggs laid as food for viable offspring. Workers laying trophic eggs have only been reported in two species; these species are M. forceps and M. gulosa. Depending on the species, colonies specialise in trophallaxis; queens and larvae eat eggs that are laid by worker individuals, but the workers do not feed on eggs. Neither adults nor larvae consume food during winter, but cannibalism among larvae is known to occur throughout the year. The larvae only cannibalise each other; this <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> happen when no dead insects are available.|$|E
5|$|The Sulu bleeding-heart {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from most terrestrial doves found on Tawi-Tawi. The emerald dove <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{be confused with}} the bleeding-heart, but the emerald dove is distinguished by a larger and whiter shoulder patch, a white supercilium, and dark chestnut underparts. Two bleeding-hearts are kept as pets and may escape on Tawi-Tawi; the Sulu bleeding-heart differs from the Luzon bleeding-heart by not having the Luzon bleeding-heart's purple nape and back, and from the Mindanao bleeding-heart by lacking prominent gray wing-bars and an orange belly.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{into two}} kingdoms <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{date back to}} the sixth century; east Kent may have conquered west Kent and preserved the institutions of kingship as a subkingdom. This was a common pattern in Anglo-Saxon England, as the more powerful kingdoms absorbed their weaker neighbours. An unusual feature of the Kentish system was that only sons of kings appeared to be legitimate claimants to the throne, although this did not eliminate all strife over the succession.|$|E

5|$|The volcano {{enters the}} subaerial subphase {{once it is}} tall enough to escape the water. Now the volcano puts on 95% of its above-water height over roughly 500,000 years. Thereafter eruptions become much less explosive. The lava {{released}} in this stage often includes both pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, and the currently active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea, are in this phase. Hawaiian lava is often runny, blocky, slow, and relatively easy to predict; the USGS tracks where it <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> run, and maintains a tourist site for viewing the lava.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{military}} reforms, which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty, Augustus changed and regularized the legion, {{down to the}} hobnail pattern on the soles of army boots. A legion was organized into ten cohorts, each of which comprised six centuries, with a century further made up of ten squads (contubernia); the exact size of the Imperial legion, which <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been determined by logistics, has been estimated to range from 4,800 to 5,280.|$|E
5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E
