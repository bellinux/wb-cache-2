5|$|Reborning {{involves}} numerous {{time consuming}} steps. The most basic {{form of the}} process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers of paint, and adding other physical features to the doll. Artists can pick different brands to best suit the doll they wish to create. Reborn artists can also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes the vinyl doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase {{a wide range of}} supplies for creating their own reborn. Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit some steps in the <b>fabrication</b> <b>process</b> and begin with a blank canvas. Many supplies are needed for both external and internal modifications of reborns to make the doll seem more realistic.|$|E

25|$|A {{technical}} barrier to overcome is the fabrication of gratings with high aspect ratio and small periods. The production of these gratings {{out of a}} silicon wafer involves microfabrication techniques like photolithography, anisotropic wet etching, electroplating and molding. A very common <b>fabrication</b> <b>process</b> for X-ray gratings is LIGA, which involves several of the microfabrication techniques mentioned above and was invented in the 1980s by German scientists of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).|$|E
25|$|Originally, every {{electronic}} component had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The components' leads were then {{passed through the}} holes and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called through-hole construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 {{was assigned to the}} U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board <b>fabrication</b> <b>process</b> in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.|$|E
500|$|Germanium {{has largely}} been {{replaced}} by silicon in semiconducting devices, being cheaper, more resilient at higher operating temperatures, and easier to work during the microelectronic <b>fabrication</b> <b>process.</b> Germanium is still a constituent of semiconducting silicon-germanium [...] "alloys" [...] and these have been growing in use, particularly for wireless communication devices; such alloys exploit the higher carrier mobility of germanium. The synthesis of gram-scale quantities of semiconducting germanane was reported in 2013. This comprises one-atom thick sheets of hydrogen-terminated germanium atoms, analogous to graphane. It conducts electrons more than ten times faster than silicon and five times faster than germanium, and {{is thought to have}} potential for optoelectronic and sensing applications. The development of a germanium-wire based anode that more than doubles the capacity of lithium-ion batteries was reported in 2014. In the same year, Lee at al. reported that defect-free crystals of graphene large enough to have electronic uses could be grown on, and removed from, a germanium substrate.|$|E

The ideality factor was added to account for imperfect junctions as observed in real transistors.

2500|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the MOSFET has {{continually}} been scaled down in size; typical MOSFET channel lengths were once several micrometres, but modern integrated circuits are incorporating MOSFETs with channel lengths {{of tens of}} nanometers. Robert Dennard's work on scaling theory was pivotal in recognising that this ongoing reduction was possible. Intel began production of a process featuring a 32nm feature size (with the channel being even shorter) in late 2009. The semiconductor industry maintains a [...] "roadmap", the ITRS, [...] which sets the pace for MOSFET development. Historically, the difficulties with decreasing {{the size of the}} MOSFET have been associated with the semiconductor device <b>fabrication</b> <b>process,</b> the need to use very low voltages, and with poorer electrical performance necessitating circuit redesign and innovation (small MOSFETs exhibit higher leakage currents and lower output resistance).|$|E
