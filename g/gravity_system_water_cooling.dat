The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the potential for reducing the cooling systems’ environmental footprint with applications of alternative renewable energy source. Three types of <b>cooling</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>water</b> <b>cooled,</b> air cooled and a hybrid solar-based air-conditioning system, with a total of six scenarios were designed in this work. The scenarios accounted for the types of power supply to the air-conditioning systems with electricity from the grid and with a solar power from highly integrated building photovoltaics (BIPV). Within and between these scenarios, systems’ energy performances were compared based on energy modelling while the harvesting potential of the renewable energy source was further predicted based on building’s detailed geometrical model. The results showed that renewable energy obtained via BIPV scenario could cover building’s annual electricity consumption for cooling and reduce 140 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year.

This situation may lead to a drastic deterioration in material strength where a cooling system is important for a smooth system plant operation to prevent catastrophic failure to its equipments, parts or processes. In this study, a part of a failed closed recirculation <b>system</b> <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> pipe in a steel manufacturing plant in Malaysia has been investigated for detailed failure analysis. A steam leakage of a <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> pipe with a closed recirculation system operation made of ASTM A 106 /A (Carbon Steel Pipes for high temp service) was detected. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore the evidence related to the <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> pipe leakage and to investigate the cause of failure. Detailed investigation was carried out by visual inspection, optical microscopy and hardness testing. With the evidence obtained, due to presence of water scale and prolonged overheating, decarburization had occurred. During decarburization, it was found that carbon elements from inner surface tube had depleted through the outer tube surface. The accumulation of carbon elements on the outer tube surface appears to show significantly higher brittle zone in the outer tube and with the presence of tensile stress developed from operating thermal cycle which subsequently resulted in crack.
