40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the {{development}} of a test bench which can be used to check the behaviour of bicycle brakes (disc brakes and in the next stage of <b>extension</b> <b>rim</b> brakes) during a brake cycle under dry and wet conditions is described. Additional, there is the option to perform endurance tests. For the dimensioning of the test bench, calculations of theoretical possible brake torques, measurements with acceleration sensors, high speed camera and Fuji Prescale measuring Films have been done. A special focus was laid on usability and the reducing of the mechanical changing time during serial tests. The programmed real-time control, based on a LabView RealTime System was created to automate the test procedure as it is defined in the test protocol. The system gives information about brake hysteresis function, a function connecting the lever(hand) - and measured brake force(torque) ...|$|E

40|$|A robotic testing {{facility}} for {{the measurement of}} joint mechanics {{was used to determine}} the significance of tears in the intervertebral disc on the mechanics of the spinal joint. Ten lumbar joints of sheep were dynamically loaded and manipulated. Comparisons were made between the behaviour of the intervertebral disc in flexion/extension at two test speeds. The influence of the posterior elements and of rim lesions was assessed by testing the joint immediately before and after removal of the posterior elements and after the creation of a 4 x 10 mm rim lesion in the disc. Stiffness of the spinal joint dropped significantly upon removal of the posterior elements, from 0. 81 to 0. 23 Nm/° for flexion and from 0. 65 to 0. 40 Nm/° for extension. Maximum moments dropped 37 % for flexion and 63 % for <b>extension.</b> The <b>rim</b> lesion caused a further significant stiffness reduction to 0. 21 and 0. 31 Nm/° respectively. Maximum moments reduced a further 12 % and 16 % respectively. A higher test speed (2 instead of 0. 5 °/sec) usually did not change these results significantly. The novel six degrees-of-freedom robotic {{testing facility}} used in this study was demonstrated to be an effective system for studying the mechanics of complex biological joints...|$|R

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the long}} Neolithic Jōmon period, some pottery vessels were [...] "flame-rimmed" [...] with extravagant <b>extensions</b> to the <b>rim</b> that can only be called sculptural, and very stylized pottery dogū figures were produced, many with the {{characteristic}} [...] "snow-goggle" [...] eyes. During the Kofun period of the 3rd to 6th century CE, haniwa terracotta figures of humans and animals in a simplistic style were erected outside important tombs. The arrival of Buddhism in the 6th century brought with it sophisticated traditions in sculpture, Chinese styles mediated via Korea. The 7th century Hōryū-ji and its contents have survived more intact than any East Asian Buddhist temple of its date, with works including a Shaka Trinity of 623 in bronze, showing the historical Buddha flanked by two bodhisattvas and also the Guardian Kings of the Four Directions.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a gas shielded {{electric arc welding}} torch having a detachable gas cup extension which may be of any desired configuration or length. The gas cup extension assembly is mounted on a standard electric welding torch gas cup to enable welding in areas with limited access. The gas cup assembly has an upper tubular insert that fits within the gas cup such that its lower portion protrudes thereform and has a lower tubular extension that is screwed into the lower portion. The <b>extension</b> has a <b>rim</b> to define the outer perimeter of the seat edge about its entrance opening so a gasket may be placed to effect an airtight seal between the gas cup and extension. The tubular extension may be made of metal or cermaic material that can be machined. The novelty lies {{in the use of}} an extension assembly for a standard gas cup of an electric arc welding torch which extension assembly is detachable permitting the use of a number of extensions which may be of different configurations and materials and yet fit the standard gas cup...|$|R
40|$|We use the calcite twin {{analysis}} {{to investigate the}} relationship between fold development, stress and strain distribution. We chose for this study the Sheep Mountain Anticline (Wyoming, USA) as a natural laboratory. Because it's asymmetric and basement-cored fold, this anticline was formed during the Laramide orogeny in the Early Tertiary. The calcite twin have been measured in folded Lower Carboniferous to Permian age carbonates and sandstones. Calcite twin recorded both in the matrix and in the veins, highlight three different tectonic stages: the first phase is a pre-folding compression parallel to fold axis, a second one is also pre- folding compression but it's perpendicular to the future fold axis and the third stage is also perpendicular to the fold axis but it's a post-folding compression. Furthermore, calcite twin data provide information about the evolution of stress (Etchecopar's method) and strain (Groshong's method) through time and space. Both pre- folding and post-folding NE-directed compressional stress and/or shortening were recorded within pre-folding veins (set I) {{as well as in}} fold-related veins (sets II and III). Set III veins also recorded outer <b>rim</b> <b>extension</b> along the fold hinge line. Besides, calcite twin analysis allow us to quantify stress and strain. Our results point out both temporal and spatial evolution of stress and strain tensors. Spatially, we notice that both strain and particularly differential-stress in the backlimb are higher than in the forelimb. We are also able to show that differential-stress drops both in the backlimb and in the forelimb between pre-folding and post-folding stages. Our new dataset should putting better constrains on numerical models in order to increase our knowledge on fold mechanics. Amrouch, K.; Lacombe, O.; Daniel, J...|$|R
40|$|The retail {{companies}} {{have a very}} conservative approach concerning IT expenses and innovations. Maybe for this reason, {{it is now the}} best time for changing an IT infrastructure and a complex retail solution. Most of the companies need to optimize their processes due to the financial crisis to achieve a competitive advantage. There are many differences among the retail companies - these differences may cause that an implementation of a software solution is tricky. It is important to be aware of such aspects when implementing the software solution. The main aim of this work is to design, extend and optimize a methodology of implementation of a complex retail solution. The new methodology is quite general - it might be used for an implementation of any POS solution. The goal of new methodology is to improve top line and margin. Finally, it shall bring a bigger satisfaction to the customer. I divided this work into several main chapters. First chapter is dedicated to the specifics of retail companies - how they work, which processes they use, how much they invest into the IT. The second part contains an analysis of POS solutions available on the Czech market and {{a brief description of the}} particular software solutions with their market share. The third part is dedicated to the RIM methodology designed by Microsoft Corporation. The fourth - and the main part of my work - contains an <b>extension</b> of the <b>RIM</b> methodology. In the final part I sum up the main achievements of this work and evaluate the new extended methodology. In the appendix, I compared some examples with the real figures to the new methodology...|$|R
40|$|By {{integrating}} detailed {{structural and}} sedimentological field-work with paleomagnetic data, this thesis provides constraints for {{the reconstruction of}} the Late Tertiary tectonic history of the nner Carpathians in Northern Romania. Central for the understanding of the formation of the Carpathians is the emplacement history of crustal blocks into the so-called ‘Carpathian embayment’. This large-scale bight in the European continental margin is situated between the Bohemian and Moesian promontories. Roll - back of the (partly?) oceanic crust formerly occupying the Carpathian embayment, combined with lateral escape due to indentation in the Eastern Alps are thought to be the driving forces for this emplacement. The irregular shape of the European continental margin ultimately {{led to the formation of}} a highly bent orogen, the Carpathians. The study area is a key area for the understanding of the tectonic processes during this emplacement, since it is situated at a triple point where three of the major continental bocks (ALCAPA, Tisza and Dacia) meet. During the time interval covered by this study, the Tisza and Dacia blocks are considered firmly attached to each other, representing one single block. A large fault zone between the ALCAPA block and the Tisza-Dacia block, termed Mid-Hungarian fault zone, accommodated most of the complex deformation caused by their contemporaneous invasion into the Carpathian embayment. During emplacement corner effects at the Bohemian and Moesian promontories resulted in large differential rotations of the invading blocks. The juxtaposition of the Tisza-Dacia block and the ALCAPA block along the MidHungarian fault zone resulted in the formation of a flexural basin on the northern part of Tisza-Dacia. The filling of this basin started in Oligocene times, developing from flysch units into Burdigalian-age molasse-type deposits. The last moment of thrusting of ALCAPA related units onto Tisza-Dacia is reflected by the Early Burdigalian SE - directed emplacement of unmetamorphic flysch nappes (Pienides) onto the autochthonous cover of Tisza-Dacia. Back-arc type extension leading to the formation of the Pannonian basin is in the study area only weakly documented as SW-NE extension. Roughly perpendicular ‘soft collision’ of Tisza-Dacia with the European margin leads to transpressional deformation in the study area after 16 Ma. Due to migration of slab retreat, the convergence direction of Tisza-Dacia becomes more oblique, initiating a deformation stage characterized by transtension (NW – SE <b>extension).</b> The northern <b>rim</b> of Tisza-Dacia is ‘fitted’ to the European continental margin by E-W trending, sinistral strike slip faults coupled to SW – NE trending normal faults. This process leads to a weak (~ 20 °- 30 °) counterclockwise rotation as well as accelerated uplift of the northern part of Tisza-Dacia. After 16 Ma deformation in the study area is located within the Tisza-Dacia block, but most likely connected to the Mid-Hungarian fault zone...|$|R
