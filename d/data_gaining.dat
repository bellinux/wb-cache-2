40|$|Climate reconstructions {{from data}} {{sensitive}} to past climates provide estimates {{of what these}} climates were like. Comparing these reconstructions with simulations from climate models allows to validate the models used for future climate prediction. It {{has been shown that}} for fossil pollen <b>data,</b> <b>gaining</b> estimates by inverting a vegetation model allows inclusion of past changes in carbon dioxide values. As a new generation of dynamic vegetation model is available we have developed an inversion method for one model, LPJ-GUESS. When this novel method is used with high-resolution sediment it allows us to bypass the classic assumptions of (1) climate and pollen independence between samples and (2) equilibrium between the vegetation, represented as pollen, and climate. Our dynamic inversion method is based on a statistical model to describe the links among climate, simulated vegetation and pollen samples. The inversion is realised thanks to a particle filter algorithm. We perform a validation on 30 modern European sites and then apply the method to the sediment core of Meerfelder Maar (Germany), which covers the Holocene at a temporal resolution of approximately one sample per 30 years. We demonstrate that reconstructed temperatures are constrained. The reconstructed precipitation is less well constrained, due to the dimension considered (one precipitation by season), and the low sensitivity of LPJ-GUESS to precipitation changes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Genes {{containing}} extremely {{large or}} extremely {{small amounts of}} Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are of specific interest for evolutionary biology. The genome areas with extreme SNP density may possess specific functions, for example, may have specific gene or structural content. We have emulated the <b>data</b> <b>gaining</b> process corresponding to the Celera sequencing scheme {{and found that the}} excess of low SNP density regions in the human genome found by Celera is probably a natural phenomenon rather than an artifact of the scheme. We have performed an analysis of the publicly available databases on human genome sequences to catalogue the regions of extreme SNP densities in the human genome. Less than half of the extremely SNP-rich or SNP-poor regions have been found to retain their positions in consequent GenBank releases. Another set of regions with extremely low or high SNP density are inconsistent between releases in their positions, i. e., the regions of each type are lost or gained after database revision. The whole genome content analysis of the regions with extremely high or extremely low SNP content will become reasonable when the positions of the regions with abnormal SNP content stop to fluctuate because of the process of database revision. A subset of SNPs revealed by BLAST-based alignments of human ESTs was analyzed separately. The SNP density in human genome regions covered by ESTs (putatively expressed regions) is more than twice the average over the genome, as the EST-based SNPs represent 7 % of all SNP...|$|E
40|$|Cutting edge {{research}} problems {{require the}} use of complicated and computationally expensive computer models. I will present a practical overview of the design and analysis of computer experiments in high energy nuclear and astro phsyics. The aim of these experiments is to infer credible ranges for certain fundamental parameters of the underlying physical processes through the analysis of model output and experimental data. To be truly useful computer models must be calibrated against experimental <b>data.</b> <b>Gaining</b> an understanding of the response of expensive models across the full range of inputs can be a slow and painful process. Gaussian Process emulators can be an efficient and informative surrogate for expensive computer models and prove to be an ideal mechanism for exploring the response of these models to variations in their inputs. A sensitivity analysis can be performed on these model emulators to characterize and quantify the relationship between model input parameters and predicted observable properties. The result of this analysis provides the user with information about which parameters are most important and most likely to affect the prediction of a given observable. Sensitivity analysis allow us to identify what model parameters can be most efficiently constrained by the given observational data set. In this thesis I describe a range of techniques for the calibration and exploration of the complex and expensive computer models so common in modern physics research. These statistical methods are illustrated with examples drawn from the fields of high energy nuclear physics and galaxy formation. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this report}} is to analyse the Czech {{football}} scene using the unstructured data from ever evolving social media platform Facebook. The objectives are to identify key concepts using the Czech football social community, dis-covering the most popular club, understanding the buzz and reactions on independent sport portals and identifying the relation between social sentiment and the actual football club performance. These objectives are met using defined methods including collection, analysis and evaluation of the data, applying the key data metrics and relevant literature research, as well as graphical visualisation of the results. This report consists of five chapters split into theoretical and practical part. The first three chapters, the theoretical part, are focusing on the explanation of the social media in general, using the literature research and online analytical tools, and introduction of the Czech foot-ball scene from both commercial and marketing standpoint. The last chapter describes the methods applied and outlines the data architecture used for the analysis.

40|$|One glorious autumn afternoon, {{when the}} temptation was {{to enjoy the}} {{sunshine}} whilst digging and clearing drudgeries associated with completing our dissertations, Bisi and I decided to mulch {{away some of the}} frustrations and challenges of our learning journeys. We had been struggling desperately to finish our dissertations, both using critical ethnography as a methodological approach; so we definitely had some common ground to listen and share valued insights with each other. The marvel of those shared moments appeared when we discovered how similar our learning paths {{over the past four years}} had been and how we had often suffered separately even whilst working alongside one another. It had become a lone struggle to explain the research as we moved further away in our memories from our participants, who had initially been our collaborators and point of praxis. Were we in the dip? Were we experiencing the ‘lone ethnography' syndrome? We had both conducted our research in Western Australian public schools, had listened and transcribed many hours of our participants' narratives and had somehow managed to find almost identical themes of discussion to explain our stories. One of these themes was that of relationships and how significant they were in how students and teachers connected, not only how they influenced the identity construction of teachers in their first year of teaching but also how students interpreted policies that teachers were asked to implement in schools. Another commonality was in doing this type of research, where we applied critical social theory and post-structural theory to the "realms of field work and data interpretation" (Carspecken, 1991, p. 1) we were both experiencing some of the aftershocks of disrupting dominant discourses in the neo-liberal domain. The reinforcement and reclaiming process of validating each other's research on making a difference in the lives of first year teachers and high school students respectively provided the impetus for further investigation, analysis and action. This presentation is about our story of positioning ourselves in such a way that we could hear voices from the field that would otherwise be silent. We would like to share some of the common challenges we encountered in using critical ethnography in education research, including collecting <b>data,</b> <b>gaining</b> ethics approval, passing gatekeepers, maintaining trust and connections with participants and representing their multiple voices. Most significantly, we will outline how we were also able to meet some of those challenges, including the point of praxis and empowerment gained from collaborating for this conference, whereby we were able to re-imagine and relive our research projects, our responses to the local research sites and the knowledge and experience gained in the process. What has emerged is a revised sense of our ethnographic selves, no longer autonomous but as connected, not as detached but related in a dialect that is relational and dialogic (Brown, 2004, p. 312). Our emphasis then is not on our individual research stories, even though they are unique, but on the commonalities and relationships between them. We intend that this presentation provide dialogue and questions about "how positioning and reflexivity" (Stevens, 2004, p. 159) influence how we conduct and represent our participants and their stories in writing...|$|E
40|$|Work aim: Evaluation of {{the impact}} of stress on general {{practice}} nurses’ psychological state and work quality. Work objectives: 1. 	Evaluation of stress impact on general practice nurses’ work. 2. 	Evaluation of stress impact on general practice nurses’ psychological state. 3. 	Finding the main factors causing stress. 4. 	Finding the main factors causing stress disappearance. 5. 	Finding if it is necessary to improve nurses’ working conditions. The survey took place in Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital in 2004 - 2005. Using random selection there were chosen the following departments: Adult Psychiatry, Central Intensive Therapy, Neurosurgical Operating –Room, Skin and Venereal Diseases, Pulmonary and Allergic Diseases, Gastroenterology. 100 general practice nurses took part in the survey (all the respondents were feminine, because the percentage of men, working as nurses, is very low, in comparison with women). For the survey scientific literature has been analyzed and a questionnaire for the participants was used. The questionnaire handed to our respondents was {{made on the basis of}} the questionnaire form “Stress at Working Place”, prepared by the Finland Institute of Medicine. This form is used for evaluating psychosocial working factors and stress reactions of working people. Also we considered the questionnaire, made by Lemon and published in the book “Nursery Teaching Materials”. The survey data was analyzed using scientific literature and results of other surveys. The statistical analysis of our survey has been made using the <b>data</b> <b>gaining</b> and counting program statistical package STATISTICA, applying p = 0, 05. There were evaluated interrelations between stress impact on work and stress impact on the respondents’ psychological state in parametric and nonparametric criteria. Work results: After analyzing the data it was revealed that 57 (%) of the respondents are partly satisfied with their job, 37 (%) are satisfied and 6 (%) are not satisfied. The nurses declare, that there are hard periods in their work, when their work is strained physically and emotionally. 69 (%) of the respondents state, that because of the strained situation in their work the work quality decreases. 56 (%) of the respondents experience stress, 28 (%) of them experience stress partly and only 16 (%) of them do not experience stress. 71 (%) of the respondents experience stress because of their low salary. 28 (%) of them state that their stress disappear while being at home environment. 62 (%) of the nurses think it is necessary to improve their working conditions. In the survey we calculated statistically important difference between the stress impact on the work quality and stress impact on the nurses’ psychological state. There was found a statistically important t= 6. 08, when p= 0, 05. Also we got, that stress has greater influence on the nurses’ work quality than on their psychological state. And we were looking for statistical relations between the work shift, education, work experience, age and stress influence on the respondents’ work quality and their psychological state. After the data analysis there wasn’t got any statistically relevant difference. Conclusions: 1. 	 59 (%) of the nurses state that their job is strained physically, 71 (%) of then state, that they experience nervous strain, 79 (%) of the respondents tell that there are difficult periods in their work, but the stress experienced at work does not make negative impact on their work quality. 2. 	 56 (%) of the nurses experience stress in their work, but it does not make great influence on their psychological state. 3. 	 71 (%) of the respondents experience stress because of getting low salary. 4. 	 28 (%) of the nurses get rid of their stress while being at home environment, 20 (%) of them get rid of the stress when the working atmosphere is good, and 18 (%) of them get rid of the stress when its cause is eliminated. 5. 	 61 (%) of the nurses think that their working conditions must be improved by modernizing technical means, 37 (%) of them are sure that the reorganization is necessary and 62 (%) of the respondents think their working conditions must be improved by developing personnel cooperation...|$|E
