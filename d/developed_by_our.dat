Out of these, sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge and clairvoyance may also be erroneous knowledge.

Even though the history of STARMA Models starts from 1980 's, these models remained in the shadows because of both lack of variable sets and its estimation difficulties. When the literature is examined, it's seen that STARMA Models can be estimated by linear and non-linear estimators. It's seen that the non-linear estimators are producing more efficient results because of the variable's structure. For this reason, in this study, Kalman Filters and maximum likelihood estimator has been used. The calculation of spatial weight matrix is done with software “Kure” which is <b>developing</b> <b>by</b> <b>our</b> team. As the case study, regional deposits of commercial banks operating in Turkey were analysed. Statistically significant and robust results revealed that STARMA Model has high estimation performance...|$|R

In his dedication address, Douglass recounted the trials and tribulations of establishing the observatory, then gave the following eloquent justification for the scientific endeavor:In concluding I wish to leave with you a more general view. This installation is to be devoted to scientific research. Scientific research is business foresight on a large scale. It is knowledge obtained before it is needed. Knowledge is power, but we cannot tell which fact {{in the domain of}} knowledge is the one which is going to give the power, and we therefore develop the idea of knowledge for its own sake, confident that some one fact or training will pay for all the effort. This I believe is the essence of education wherever such education is not strictly vocational. The student learns many facts and has much training. He can only dimly see which fact and which training will be of eminent use to him, but some special part of his education will take root in him and grow and pay for all of the effort which he and his friends have put into it. So it is with the research institutions. In this Observatory I sincerely hope and expect that the boundaries of human knowledge will be advanced along astronomical lines. Astronomy was the first science <b>developed</b> <b>by</b> <b>our</b> primitive ancestors thousands of years ago because it measured time. Performing that same function, it has played a vast part in human history, and today it is telling us facts, forever wonderful, about the size of our universe; perhaps tomorrow it will give us practical help in showing us how to predict climatic conditions in the future.|$|E

40|$|Solving {{a system}} of linear {{equations}} is a key problem in engineering and science. Matrix factorization is {{a key component of}} many methods used to solve such equations. However, the factorization process is very time consuming, so these problems have often been targeted for parallel machines rather than sequential ones. Nevertheless, commercially available supercomputers are expensive and only large institutions have the resources to purchase them. Hence, efforts are on to develop more affordable alternatives. In this paper, we propose such an approach. We present an implementation of a parallel version of the Cholesky matrix factorization algorithm on a single-chip multiprocessor built inside an APEX 20 K series FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) <b>developed</b> <b>by</b> Altera. <b>Our</b> multiprocessor system uses an asymmetric, shared-memory MIMD architecture and was built using the configurable Nios processor core which was also <b>developed</b> <b>by</b> Altera. <b>Our</b> system was developed using Altera's SOPC (System-On-a-Programmable-Chip) Quartus II development environment. Our Cholesky implementation is based on an algorithm described in George, et al. [6]. This algorithm is scalable and uses a "queue of tasks" approach to ensure dynamic load-balancing among the processing elements. Our implementation assumes dense matrices in the input. We present performance results for uniprocessor and multiprocessor implementations. Our results show that the implementation of multiprocessors inside FPGAs can benefit matrix operations, such as matrix factorization. Further benefits result from good dynamic load-balancing techniques...|$|R

We emphasize the use of split forms, i. e., those bilinear forms such that the minimal polynomial of the asymmetry of their non-degenerate part splits over ground field, rather than restricting the field to be algebraically closed. In order to obtain the most explicit results, without resorting to the classification of hermitian, symmetric and quadratic forms, we merely require that the underlying field be quadratically closed...|$|R
