5|$|Because the {{receipts}} {{were initially}} insufficient {{to cover the}} six per cent dividend on the £5,697 that the Conservators <b>had</b> <b>invested,</b> they added the difference to the capital, so that the debt steadily increased. This state of affairs was challenged in 1735, when it was decreed that the original capital had been repaid, and the poor should now benefit, but the decision was overturned in 1738 on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Following The Man {{with the}} Golden Gun, {{producer}} Harry Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions' parent company, Danjaq, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems, {{brought about by}} financial constraints following a downturn in the fortunes of Technicolor, in which he <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> heavily. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E

5|$|Coal {{from the}} inland mines in {{southern}} County Durham {{was taken away}} on packhorses, and then horse and carts as the roads were improved. A canal was proposed by George Dixon in 1767 and again by John Rennie in 1815, but both schemes failed. Meanwhile, the port of Stockton-on-Tees, from which the Durham coal was transported onwards by sea, <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> considerably during the early 19th century in straightening the Tees {{in order to improve}} navigation on the river downstream of the town and was subsequently looking for ways to increase trade to recoup those costs.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{divided the}} debt into {{national}} and state, and further divided {{the national debt}} into foreign and domestic debt. While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators for as little as fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.|$|E
5|$|In his campaign, McCarthy {{attacked}} La Follette for not enlisting {{during the}} war, although La Follette had been 46 when Pearl Harbor was bombed. He also claimed La Follette had made huge profits from his investments while he, McCarthy, {{had been away}} fighting for his country. In fact, McCarthy <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> {{in the stock market}} himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943 (over $604,000 in 2017 dollars). La Follette's investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station, which earned him a profit of $47,000 over two years.|$|E

5|$|Inexperienced as a manager, Barrow had player Harry Hooper {{advise him}} on {{baseball}} game strategy. Hooper urged his manager to allow Ruth to play another position {{when he was}} not pitching, arguing to Barrow, who <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> in the club, that the crowds were larger on days when Ruth played, as they were attracted by his hitting. Barrow gave in early in May; Ruth promptly hit home runs in four consecutive games (one an exhibition), the last off of Walter Johnson. For {{the first time in his}} career (disregarding pinch-hitting appearances), Ruth was assigned a place in the batting order higher than ninth.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{arranged}} by U2 management to showcase the band's live act {{and to promote}} them to American audiences. It depicts the band's performance at Red Rocks on a rain-soaked evening. The concert was almost cancelled because of the inclement weather, but the band <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> in the filming with Island Records and concert promoter Barry Fey and wished {{to proceed with the}} gig. The rain and the torch-lit atmosphere of the surroundings made U2's performance dramatic. Segments of U2 Live at Red Rocks were shown in regular rotation on MTV, and were also broadcast on other television networks.|$|E
5|$|In December 1974, the Council bought Bridgwater Dock from British Railways. The {{concrete}} wall across the barge lock was removed, {{but there was}} no intention to restore the ship lock. By 1980, the Council <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> over £50,000 in the restoration, which included Kings and Standards locks, and the bottom gates of Newtown Lock. Some bridges had been raised, but only to , which allowed canoeing, but prevented bigger boats from using the waterway. Work on the deep cutting between West Street and Albert Street started in September 1978, jointly funded by the County Council and Sedgemoor District Council, using direct labour, while a Manpower Services Commission scheme to dredge the canal from the dock to the cutting and to widen the towpath was funded by the District Council in 1981.|$|E

5|$|Jennings {{returned}} to the U.S. {{at the end of}} 1974 to become Washington correspondent and news anchor for ABC's new morning program AM America, a predecessor to Good Morning America. ABC was hoping that the show, in which it <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> $8 million, would challenge NBC's highly popular Today. AM America debuted on January 6, 1975, with Jennings delivering regular newscasts from Washington. The show never gained ground against Today, and was canceled in just ten months. In November 1975, Jennings moved abroad, this time as ABC's chief foreign correspondent. He continued to cover the Middle East, and in 1978 he was the first Canadian or American reporter to interview the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran, then in exile in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{finished}} {{fifth in}} 1935 and seventh in 1936. Dodger management felt Stengel {{had not done}} enough with the talent he had been given, and he was fired during the 1936 World Series between the Yankees and Giants. Stengel was paid for one year left on his contract, {{and he was not}} involved in baseball during the 1937 season. Stengel <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> in oil properties, as advised by one of his players, Randy Moore, a Texan; the investment helped make the Stengels well to do, and they put the profits in California real estate. Stengel considered going in the oil business full-time, but Braves president Bob Quinn offered him the Boston managerial job in late 1937, and he accepted.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was finally {{completed}} in 1840, and in July the Preston and Wyre Railway opened. The following year St Peter's Church was finished, and Hesketh-Fleetwood appointed as vicar the Rev. St. Vincent Beechey of Hilgay in Norfolk. Also in 1841, the North Euston {{was the fourth}} hotel {{to open in the}} town. Steamer services opened to the Isle of Man, Whitehaven, Ardrossan and Belfast. Fleetwood initially flourished, but Hesketh-Fleetwood had run out of money and was compelled to take out mortgages. He lost the £75,000 he <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> in the Preston and Wyre Railway Company owing to a lack of accounts. Kemp claimed that Hesketh-Fleetwood owed him money, but Kemp refused to explain his book-keeping. In the face of enormous debts Hesketh-Fleetwood sold his estates at Blackpool, Southport, Meols Hall, and Tulketh Hall. Charles bought the Churchtown estate, where {{he and his wife had}} been living, from his brother. In 1844 Hesketh-Fleetwood auctioned off his personal possessions from Rossall Hall and left Lancashire. The Rev. St. Vincent Beechey had set up the Northern Church of England School for boys. Close to bankruptcy, Hesketh-Fleetwood leased the buildings at Rossall Hall to the school for six years, with the option to buy it after nine for £7,000. Thereafter, the school was called Rossall School.|$|E

5|$|Double Fine {{believed}} they were given the go-ahead to develop a sequel to Brütal Legend after the game's release, and <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> {{a great deal of}} development time towards this, but were later told by EA that it was cancelled. Schafer stated that the sequel would likely incorporate much of what they had to drop prior to the game's release. This game world would have been three times larger than what Brütal Legend contained. The sequel would have likely included a fourth faction that was cut from the original game which would have been the last major group the player would have to fight through, including a major boss character, before the final battles with Doviculus. Schafer further noted {{that at the end of}} the original game, Doviculus' head falls into the Sea of Black Tears, and implied that the same effect that the Sea had on Ophelia could happen to Doviculus. Schafer also had ideas for a plot using a character voiced by Ronnie James Dio, but will not likely be used due to Dio's death.|$|E
5|$|Following Temple's marriage, {{his father}} <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> in a farming venture by Edward Whalley {{who was the}} {{brother-in-law}} of Temple's stepsister - Mary Penistone. Sir Alexander apparently intended this to provide an inheritance for his grandchildren (the children of James Temple). As a younger son himself, Sir Alexander wanted to ensure suitable provision for his own younger son. This investment made by Temple's father {{for the benefit of}} his children had apparently become valueless when Edward Whalley fled to Scotland in the late 1630s. However, in the 1650s, Whalley had become a prominent and successful member of the Puritan establishment and there was a possibility of recovering some money. In the late 1650s, Temple and Whalley went to the Court of Chancery to determine what was due to Temple and his children. However, with the death of Oliver Cromwell and the subsequent restoration of Charles II, both regicides were faced with the possibility of execution and the case appears to have been unresolved.|$|E
5|$|McCain and Keating {{had become}} {{personal}} friends following their initial contacts in 1981, and McCain {{was the only}} one of the five with close social and personal ties to Keating. Like DeConcini, McCain considered Keating a constituent since Keating lived in Arizona. Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in political contributions from Keating and his associates. In addition, McCain's wife Cindy McCain and her father Jim Hensley <b>had</b> <b>invested</b> $359,100 in the Fountain Square Project, a Keating shopping center, in April 1986, a year before McCain met with the regulators. McCain, his family, and their baby-sitter had made nine trips at Keating's expense, sometimes aboard Keating's jet; three of the trips were made during vacations to Keating's Bahamas retreat at Cat Cay. McCain did not pay Keating (in the amount of $13,433) for some of the trips until years after they were taken, when he learned that Keating was in trouble over Lincoln.|$|E
