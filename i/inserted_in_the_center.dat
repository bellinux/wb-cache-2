40|$|This paper {{extends the}} design concept for {{generating}} multi-scale structures in forced convection for a finite-size flow {{system to a}} three-dimensional heat-generating plate with the objectives of maximising heat transfer rate density, or the heat transfer rate per unit volume. The heat-generating plates, arranged in a stack form channels <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> fluids are forced through by an applied pressure difference. The first stage of this work consists of numerical simulation of the flow and heat transfer in {{a large number of}} flow configurations, to determine the optimum plate spacing, and the maximum heat transfer rate density. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> subsequent stages, shorter plates are <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> at adjacent (longer) plates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entranced region were the boundary layer are thin and there is a core of unused fluid. The heat transfer density is further increased by progressively inserting another set of even shorter plates between the plates and then optimizing the whole structure. The resulting structure is an optimized multi-scale and multi channel structure with horizontal equidistant heated plates of decreasing lengths scales. Further more the effects of plate thickness and dimensionless pressure drop number on the multi-scale structure was investigated. The numerical results are found to be in good agreement with predicted analytical results...|$|R

50|$|The {{height of}} the shell varies between 20 mm and 26 mm, its {{diameter}} measures 25 mm. The solid, thick shell has a conical shape carinated with nearly straight sides and is false-umbilicate. This species is more strictly conical than usual in Clanculus. It has a reddish or yellowish-brown color, more or less dotted minutely with a slightly darker shade. The about 8 whorls are flat above The sutures are scarcely marked. The first whorls of the apex when not smooth by erosion are spirally lirate. These lirae are dotted with red. The succeeding whorls are very closely, finely granulate in spiral series. The fine granulationis nearlyuniform. Its color is minutely dotted with darker and beneath usually with white. These are characters separating Clanculus maugeri from other species in this genus. The body whorl has about 7 rows of granules above. It is carinate at the periphery and slightly deflected anteriorly. The base of the shell is nearly flat with numerous (15 to 20) close finely beaded concentric lirulae. The tetragonal aperture is very oblique. The upper lip is straightened and wrinkled within.

This form is similar in color-pattern and sculpture to Clanculus clanguloides Wood, 1828, but differs notably in the greater altitude, the more turbinate form, and its greater development of the teeth. In these characters it is like Clanculus stigmatarius A. Adams, 1853, which is, however, quite different in coloration. The spire is elevated conical. The apex is tinged with orange. The upper whorls are nearly flat, separated by a linear suture, which becomes more deeply impressed at the body whorl. The body whorl is slightly convex, rounded at the periphery, deeply deflected and flattened toward the aperture. The base of the shell is rather flattened, {{about the same as}} in Clanculus clanguloides. The sculpture consists of spiral series of closely set rounded granules, the series or cinguli a little separated on the upper surface, closer beneath. These number 17 or 18 upon the body whorl, the 7th being upon the periphery, just as in Clanculus clanguloides. The interstices between lirae are finely obliquely and spirally striate, the spiral striae often a little difficult to distinguish. This gives the interstices at times a granulate appearance under the lens. The aperture is nearly horizontal, tetragonal. The superior lip is straightened, bearing a very large subbifid squarish tubercle in the middle. The place of the periphery is marked inside by an entering lamellar fold. The basal margin is curved, slightly expanded, bearing two or three fold-like denticles inside. Its edge is minutely denticulate. The oblique columella deeply enters the narrow umbilicus and is <b>inserted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the axis, slightly dentate above, bearing a narrow tooth below the middle, and terminating in a large, heavy bi- or triplicate tooth.

40|$|Background and Aim: All ceramic, inlay-retained {{resin bonded}} fixed partial denture is a {{conservative}} method for replacement of missing teeth, because of minimal tooth reduction. The connector between the retainer and the pontic is the weak point of these bridges. Reinforcement of ceramic core will increase the clinical longevity. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of zirconia on flexural strength of IPS Empress 2 core ceramic. Materials and Methods: In this experimental in vitro study, twenty eight bar shape specimens (17 &acute; 3. 1 &acute; 3. 1 mm) were made of four different materials: (1) Slip casting in-ceram alumina core (control group) (2) Hot-pressed lithium disilicate core ceramic (IPS Empress 2) (3) IPS Empress 2 with cosmopost (zirconia post) <b>inserted</b> longitudinally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of <b>the</b> bar (4) IPS Empress 2 with cosmopost (zirconia post) <b>inserted</b> longitudinally <b>in</b> bottom of <b>the</b> bar. Specimens were subjected to three-point flexure loading with the span of 15 mm, at a cross-head speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Failure loads were recorded and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tomhane Post-hoc tests and p&lt; 0. 05 was set as the level of significance. Fractured surfaces were then observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Four additional samples were made as the third group, and zirconia-IPS interface was observed by SEM before fracture. Results: Mean values and standard deviations of three point flexural strengths of groups 1 to 4, were: 378. 4 &plusmn; 44. 6, 258. 6 &plusmn; 27. 5, 144. 3 &plusmn; 51. 7, 230 &plusmn; 22. 3 MPa respectively.

Group 3 had the lowest flexural strength. SEM analysis showed that the initiated cracks propagated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interface of zirconia post and IPS Empress 2 ceramic.

Synchronous Reluctance Motors (SynRMs) with and without permanent magnets (PMs) have a somewhat higher efficiency and nevertheless acceptable cost compared to induction machines. This paper focuses on the rotor design without magnets and with PMs and its impact on the performance (torque, power factor and efficiency) of SynRMs. Moreover, the influence of different rotors on the magnetic saturation of the motor is studied. A low cost ferrite PM amount has been added into the optimized rotor of the SynRM to obtain a PM assisted SynRM. A comparison between the motor performance for both reference, optimal and PM rotors has been employed using FEM.

40|$|A {{flattened}} gain spectrum in an erbium doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third telecommunication {{window is}} important for the future development of wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) long-haul optical fiber communication systems. ^ The bandwidth of an EDFA is typically 3 - 8 nm, but it can be increased to more than 30 nm with appropriate gain-flattening. This is done by using an optical filter to selectively couple out the peak radiation band of the erbium doped fiber, thereby reducing the peak gain. The main limitation to the performance of an EDFA without an optical filter, is the buildup of the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at the peak gain band. By introducing the optical filter within the EDFA, the ASE is reduced at the peak wavelength band and increased gain seen at longer wavelengths can be obtained. This also improves the noise figure of the EDFA. ^ This thesis reports on the experimental and theoretical studies performed to obtain a flattened gain spectrum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EDFA. A new EDFA configuration, where an optical Bragg fiber filter <b>in</b> <b>inserted</b> at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of <b>the</b> erbium doped fiber, is proposed.
