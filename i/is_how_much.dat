Unless upgraded oil fetched considerably more per barrel than the less attractive heavy oil, the upgrader would not make money on processing the stuff.|$|E

500|$|Another {{recurrent}} question <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>much,</b> if at all, Verdi {{was influenced}} by Wagner's comic opera Die Meistersinger. At {{the time of the}} premiere this was a sensitive subject; many Italians were suspicious of or hostile to Wagner's music, and were protective in a nationalistic way of Verdi's reputation. Nevertheless, Verdi's new style was markedly different from that of his popular works of the 1850s and 1860s, and it seemed to some to have Wagnerian echoes. In 1999 the critic Andrew Porter wrote, [...] "That Falstaff was Verdi's and Boito's answer to Wagner's Meistersinger seems evident now. But the Italian Falstaff moves more quickly."

He believed that with the videos for previous singles, [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Poker Face", Gaga's persona was established, but with the video for [...] "Eh, Eh" [...] she traversed her persona from the original Stefani Germanotta that she was born, to the character Lady Gaga. He explained: [...] "What's striking about it <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it feels like Lady Gaga is playacting: the video has a nostalgic, dreamlike tone. Set in a stylized pastel 1950s Little Italy, the video plays heavily with stereotypical and historical shorthand as it displays moustached chefs, macho men in wife beaters, cute Vespas, and spaghetti and meatballs."

500|$|The most {{important}} {{characteristic of a}} broach is the rise per tooth (RPT), which <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> material is removed by each tooth. The RPT varies for each section of the broach, which are the roughing section (tr), semi-finishing section (ts), and finishing section (tf). The roughing teeth remove most of the material so the number of roughing teeth required dictates how long the broach is. The semi-finishing teeth provide surface finish and the finishing teeth provide the final finishing. The finishing section's RPT (tf) is usually zero so that as the first finishing teeth wear the later ones continue the sizing function. For free-machining steels the RPT ranges from [...] For surface broaching the RPT is usually between [...] and for diameter broaching is usually between [...] The exact value depends on many factors. If the cut is too big it will impart too much stress into the teeth and the workpiece; if the cut is too small the teeth rub instead of cutting. One way to increase the RPT while keeping the stresses down is with chip breakers. They are notches in the teeth designed to break the chip and decrease the overall amount of material being removed by any given tooth (see the drawing above). For broaching to be effective, the workpiece should have [...] more material than the final dimension of the cut.|$|E
