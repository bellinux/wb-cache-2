500|$|In 1992, Madonna founded her own {{multi-media}} entertainment company, Maverick, {{consisting of}} a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The deal was {{a joint venture with}} Time Warner and paid Madonna an advance of $60million. It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, one of the highest rates in the industry, equaled at that time only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony. Madonna said that she envisioned the company as an [...] "artistic think tank" [...] and likened it to a cross between the Bauhaus, the innovative German arts institute formed in Weimar in 1919, and Andy Warhol's New York-based Factory of artists and assistants. She stated: [...] "It started as a desire to have more control. There's a group of writers, photographers, directors and editors that I've met along the way in my career who I want to take with me <b>everywhere</b> <b>I</b> <b>go.</b> I want to incorporate them into my little factory of ideas. I also come in contact with a lot of young talent that I feel entrepreneurial about." [...] The first two projects from the venture were her fifth studio album, Erotica, and a coffee table book of photographs featuring Madonna, entitled Sex.|$|E

Playwright Frank McGuinness called Heaney [...] "the {{greatest}} Irishman of my generation: he had no rivals." [...] Colm Tóibín wrote: [...] "In a time of burnings and bombings Heaney used poetry to offer an alternative world." [...] Gerald Dawe said he was [...] "like an older brother who encouraged you to do the best you could do." [...] Theo Dorgan said, [...] " [...] work will pass into permanence." [...] <b>Everywhere</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> there is real shock at this. Seamus was one of us." [...] His publisher, Faber and Faber, noted that [...] "his impact on literary culture is immeasurable." [...] Playwright Tom Stoppard said, [...] "Seamus never had a sour moment, neither in person nor on paper". Andrew Motion, a former UK Poet Laureate and friend of Heaney, called him [...] "a great poet, a wonderful writer about poetry, and a person of truly exceptional grace and intelligence." ...|$|E

Ali {{went on to win the}} 12 round non-title affair by a decision. Ali took things further in the build-up to their last fight, The Thrilla in Manila, and called Frazier [...] "the other type of negro" [...] and [...] "ugly", [...] "dumb" [...] and a [...] "gorilla" [...] At one point he sparred with a man in a gorilla suit and pounded on a rubber gorilla doll, saying [...] "This is Joe Frazier's conscience... I keep it <b>everywhere</b> <b>I</b> <b>go.</b> This is the way he looks when you hit him." [...] According to the fight's promoter Don King, this enraged Frazier, who took it as a [...] "character assassination" [...] and [...] "personal invective". One night before the fight, Ali waved around a toy pistol outside Frazier's hotel room. When Frazier came to the balcony, he pointed the gun at Frazier and yelled [...] "I am going to shoot you." [...] After the fight, Ali summoned Frazier's son Marvis into his dressing room, and told him that he had not meant what he had said about his father. When informed of this by Marvis, Frazier responded: [...] "you ain't me, son. Why isn't he apologizing to me?" ...|$|E
