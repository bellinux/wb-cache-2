2500|$|Sagan {{demonstrated}} {{good form}} {{once again in}} the World Tour classified Tour de Suisse by winning four stages and the points classification jersey.

The second stage was not suited for him since it was a mountainous affair, but he did prevail on stage 3, in a thrilling finish where the bunch caught the final two escapees inside the final kilometer.

He scraped the barriers as he came out of the corner with 's Michael Albasini on his left, and sprinted his way to victory. When asked about the seemingly close call he had in the aforementioned turn, the Slovak answered: [...] "The finishes in the Tour de Suisse are never straight so you need to invent something to find some space [...] ".|$|E
