40|$|Tibial plateau {{fracture}} {{is a rare}} {{complication of}} unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. The fracture almost always occurs during surgery, {{and it is likely}} to be the result of a technical error, usually an unnecessarily deep vertical saw cut into the proximal tibia. However, anything that weakens or overloads the proximal tibia may contribute to fracture, such as damage to the posterior cortex, excess removal of bone particularly in small patients with osteopenic bones, inadequate preparation of the <b>keel</b> <b>slot,</b> or use of excessive force with a heavy hammer. This series of eight case reports presents our experience with this complication after medial Oxford unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and outlines a treatment protocol...|$|E
40|$|Background: Controversies {{about the}} {{rational}} {{positioning of the}} tibial component in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) still exist. Previous finite element (FE) studies were rare, and the results varied. This FE study aimed to analyze {{the influence of the}} tibial component coronal alignment on knee biomechanics in mobile-bearing UKA and find a ration range of inclination angles. Methods: A three-dimensional FE model of the intact knee was constructed from image data of one normal subject. A 1000 N compressive load was applied to the intact knee model for validating. Then a set of eleven UKA FE models was developed with the coronal inclination angles of the tibial tray ranging from 10 ° valgus to 10 ° varus. Tibial bone stresses and strains, contact pressures and load distribution in all UKA models were calculated and analyzed under the unified loading and boundary conditions. Results: Load distribution, contact pressures, and contact areas in intact knee model were validated. In UKA models, von Mises stress and compressive strain at proximal medial cortical bone increased significantly as the tibial tray was in valgus inclination > 4 °, which may increase the risk of residual pain. Compressive strains at tibial <b>keel</b> <b>slot</b> were above the high threshold with varus inclination > 4 °, which may result in greater risk of component migration. Tibial bone resection corner acted as a strain-raiser regardless of the inclination angles. Compressive strains at the resected surface slightly changed with the varying inclinations and were not supposed to induce bone resorption and component loosening. Contact pressures and load percentage in lateral compartment increased with the more varus inclination, which may lead to osteoarthritis progression. Conclusions: Static knee biomechanics after UKA can be greatly affected by tibial component coronal alignment. A range from 4 ° valgus to 4 ° varus inclination of tibial component can be recommended in mobile-bearing UKA...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Objectives: Tibial {{fracture}} is {{a possible}} complication after unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) which can have severe consequences for patient recovery and outcome [1]. It appears {{that the issue is}} not product specific, as peri-prosthetic fractures have been reported in numerous designs, both mobile and fixed. However, {{it has been suggested that}} cementless components might be at greater risk than cemented [2]. The exact causes of tibial fracture are unknown, although surgical factors are most commonly proposed in the literature [1, 3]. The objectives of the study were to; (1) determine the range of positions and depths of the surgical cuts required to prepare the tibial plateau for a UKR, (2) use the measured parameters to create a representative range of finite element models, (3) statistically assess the influence of each surgical parameter on the risk of fracture. Methods: Tibial plastic Sawbones (n= 23) were prepared for mobile UKR during an instructional course. The parametersmeasured from the sawbones were: (a) the resection depth, (b) the angle between the horizontal and vertical cuts, (c) the distance between the vertical wall and the <b>keel</b> <b>slot,</b> how excessively deep the vertical cut and horizontal cuts were anteriorly (d and e, respectively), and posteriorly (f and g, respectively), and (h) the depth of the pin hole (Figure 1). A parametric finite element model was created in ABAQUS software (v 6. 12, Dassault Systèmes) with an automated python script to create the surgical cuts. One hundred models were created, where the surgical cut parameters were varied within the distributions measured from the Sawbones. A mesh element size of 2. 4 mm was used, selected as a result of a mesh convergence study. The tibia was modelled as a heterogeneous linear elastic material, with a Poisson's ratio of 0. 3. The modulus of each element was assigned based upon the corresponding position of that element in the CT scan of the tibia. The equations used for this have been previously defined and the tibial model validated [4]. Muscle and joint loading of a tibia at 15 % of the gait cycle was applied, corresponding to maximal medial contact force, and the distal portion of the tibial constrained in all degrees of freedom. The risk of fracture was quantified based upon the Maximum Principal Stress criterion equations defined by Schileo et al. [5]. The influence of each surgical parameter on the risk of fracture was assessed using linear regression with R (r-project). Results: In the tibial Sawbone measurements, the greatest surgical variation was observed in the depth of the posterior vertical cut and the pin hole, which had standard deviations of 3. 9 and 6. 8 mm respectively (Table 1). The only surgical cut parameters which were found to significantly affect the risk of fracture were the resection depth, and the posterior depth of the vertical cut (p= 0. 009, and p= 0. 000001, respectively). Some finite element models demonstrated a noticeable region at high risk of fracture, which extended diagonally from the vertical saw cut, past the base of the <b>keel</b> <b>slot</b> to the tibial cortex. This matched well with typical fracture paths observed clinically [1]. Conclusion: This study has shown accuracy in the depth of the vertical cut made to prepare the tibial plateau for UKR, has the greatest clinical variation and has the greatest influence on the risk of fracture out of all the parameters assessed in this study. It is therefore important that instrumentation be designed to improve surgical accuracy for this part of the operative technique. References: [1] Pandit, H., et al., Orthopedics, 30 : 28 - 31, 2007.
