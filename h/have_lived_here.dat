25|$|Though Frei Pedro de Poiares conjectured Barcelos was Vicente's birthplace, {{evidence}} for this is scarce. Pires de Lima, on the other hand, proposed Guimarães, which better accounts for Vicente's identification as a jeweller. The people of Guimarães have embraced this theory; a municipal school in Urgezes is named after the playwright. There's some stories about Gil Vicente's father,that was from this parish in Guimarães, so, people believe that Gil Vicente <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>here</b> too. Another conjecture places his birthplace at Lisbon. The Beira region is also a candidate because of various references to it in his plays, more exactly the location of Guimarães de Tavares, that has been mistaken with Guimarães.|$|E
500|$|... "San Diego" [...] is {{centered}} on the band's original hometown, and, on a deeper level, relationships with the group's former bandmate, Tom DeLonge. According to Feldmann, it was a song Hoppus {{did not want to}} write. [...] "There's clearly a lot of feelings involved with having a best friend who is not in your band anymore," [...] Feldmann said. For him, the song [...] "acts as a bittersweet homage, a goodbye to this city... while acknowledging the interpersonal relationships within the band." [...] Stump also collaborated in the writing process for [...] "San Diego". [...] "The Only Thing That Matters" [...] originally began as a cowpunk-infused number until Hoppus re-wrote it. [...] "California" [...] is about [...] "giving credit to how lucky we are to <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>here</b> and grown up" [...] in California. [...] "Brohemian Rhapsody"—its title a pun on Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody"—is another joke song with the sole lyric [...] "There's something about you I can't quite put my finger in." [...] Hoppus and Feldmann wrote and recorded the song in nine minutes.|$|E

500|$|Hilston House was {{for many}} years the {{principal}} estate and mansion in the parish of St. Maughans. In the 17th and 18th centuries it was the residence of the Needham family, although Henry Milbourne, an important 17th century magistrate of the county, is also reported to <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>here</b> at one time. Sebastian Needham {{is said to have}} been buried at Skenfrith, on 26 March 1723, having fathered nine children. The house remained in the family, who were Catholic, for four generations. Following this stable period of ownership, accounting for about a century, the estate then changed hands a considerable number of times within the next 70 years. [...] It was eventually sold by John Needham, a barrister of Grays Inn, to Sir William Pilkington when Needham moved to Somerset. [...] Pilkington sold it to James Jones of the Graig, who sold it to Sir Robert Brownrigg, G.C.B. a distinguished officer in the Peninsula War. [...] He died on 27 May 1833, aged 76 years and his monument may be seen on the south wall of St. Maughan's Church. [...] After his death the house was sold to Thomas Coates of Lancashire. [...] Shortly afterwards, on 12 September 1838, the house was destroyed by fire.|$|E
500|$|On June 16, 2007, 200 people {{gathered}} in a protest organized by Pro Cologne against the mosque including representatives from the Austrian Freedom Party and the Belgian Vlaams Belang. Then district deputy mayor Uckermann seconded that he thinks many residents reject the mosque {{because they believe that}} Cologne is a “Christian city”. The prominent author Ralph Giordano stated that he opposed the project as the mosque would be “an expression of the creeping Islamization of our land”, a “declaration of war”, and that he wouldn't want to see women wearing headscarfs on German streets, likening their appearance to “human penguins”. Henryk M. Broder, a journalist, disagrees with Giordano's metaphor but said that “A mosque is more than a church or a synagogue. It is a political statement.” Giordano's remarks have turned the local dispute into a national debate about the place of Islam in Germany. and other prominent Germans criticized the project as well. District mayor Uckermann stated that Giordano's comments “broke down the wall. Before if you criticised this monstrous mosque you were a Nazi. But we {{have a problem with the}} integration of Muslims. It's a question of language and culture.” Uckermann left the conservative CDU for right-wing Pro Cologne in 2008 after being voted out of office as the district's deputy mayor and reportedly facing party exclusion.The city's official for integration Marlis Bredehorst stated that [...] "it is important that the Muslims here get dignified houses of prayer" [...] and added that [...] "two hundred years ago, the Protestants had to pray secretively in Catholic Cologne [...] that is something we can't imagine anymore today." [...] The city's mayor, Fritz Schramma, who supports the project said that “For me, it is self-evident that the Muslims need to have a prestigious place of worship, but it bothers me when people <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>here</b> for 35 years and they don’t speak a single word of German.” Christian leaders have taken similarly ambivalent stances: the Catholic Church has long supported the project, though recently Cardinal Joachim Meisner, Archbishop of Cologne, has been more cautious: when asked if he was afraid of the mosque, he said, “I don't want to say I'm afraid, but I have an uneasy feeling.” He also stated that Turkey should allow its Christian minorities equivalent rights. He said the mosque would change the skyline of Cologne. Wolfgang Huber, Germany's top Protestant bishop, criticized the “male domination” he saw in Islam and said Muslims should be able to convert to Christianity without fearing reprisals and the penalty of death.|$|E

2500|$|... a tiny minority, {{from within}} the non-Iraqi British Muslim communities, reacted with {{violence}} on 7 July 2005. To interpret this simply as a [...] "nationalist struggle" [...] to remove occupation ignores the blatantly obvious fact that, first, the terrorists were not Iraqis, they were British-Pakistanis (though British Iraqis <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> <b>here</b> for a long time); second, {{the vast majority of}} the Stop the War protesters were non-Muslims, yet only a handful from among a minority of Muslims reacted to the war with terrorism. Even though occupation may have caused agitation among the 7 July bombers, these northern-born lads with thick Yorkshire accents confessed in their suicide tapes to considering themselves soldiers with a mission to kill our people (Britons) on behalf of their people (Iraqis). The prerequisite to such a disavowal of one's country of birth is a recalibration of identity; this is the undeniable role of ideological narratives.|$|E

Since the 1950s, when Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros worked there, it has attracted professional and amateur painters, sculptors and printmakers to the classes and workshops frequently held. In addition to two major art institutions (Instituto Allende and Bellas Artes), artists and art venues can be seen {{in various parts of the}} town. One notable art gallery is the Galería Manuel Chacon, which carries contemporary art. On the streets, it is not unusual to see someone sketching people on the street or selling their own work.

More recently, the town has been attracting writers, film makers, and musicians as well. The town annually hosts an important free of charge film festival, the GIFF.
