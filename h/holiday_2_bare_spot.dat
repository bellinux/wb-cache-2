Methods: Twenty-seven patients with no evidence of instability (18 males, nine females; mean age 59. 1 years) were evaluated arthroscopically to assess whether the <b>bare</b> <b>spot</b> is consistently located {{at the center of}} the inferior glenoid. Another 40 patients with glenohumeral anterior instability who underwent shoulder arthroscopy (30 males, ten females; mean age 25. 9 years) were evaluated for glenoid bone loss with preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography (3 D-CT) and arthroscopic examination. In patients without instability, the distances from the <b>bare</b> <b>spot</b> of the inferior glenoid to the anterior (Da) and posterior (Dp) glenoid rim were measured arthroscopically. In patients with instability, we compared the percentage glenoid bone loss calculated using CT versus arthroscopic measurements. Results: Among patients without instability, the <b>bare</b> <b>spot</b> could not be identified in three of 27 patients. Da (9. 5 ± 1. 2 mm) was smaller than Dp (10. 1 ± 1. 5 mm), but it was not significantly different. However, only 55 % of glenoids showed less than 1 mm of difference between Da and Dp, and 18 % showed more than 2 mm difference in length. The <b>bare</b> <b>spot</b> could not be identified in five of 40 patients with instability. Pearson&# 39;s correlation coefficient showed significant (P< 0. 001) and strong (R 2 = 0. 63) correlation in percentage glenoid bone loss between the 3 D-CT and arthroscopy method measurements. However, in ten shoulders (29 %), the difference in percentage glenoid bone loss between 3 D-CT and arthroscopic measurements was greater than 5 %. Conclusion: The <b>bare</b> <b>spot</b> was not consistently located {{at the center of the}} inferior glenoid, and the arthroscopic measurement of glenoid bone loss using the <b>bare</b> <b>spot</b> as a landmark was inaccurate in some patients with anterior glenohumeral instability.

Greater than sixty percent of the topographic changes in the marsh channel are the result of erosional processes. Cellular statistics across the marsh platform revealed less change than the channel. Depositional hotspots occur in areas of sudden wetland dieback, while erosion occurs in small depressions adjacent to the tidal channel.

40|$|Abstract: Focusing on {{improving}} the galvanizability {{of the third}} generation automotive steel, the effect of surface oxides morphologies on the galvanizability was studied. The {{results show that the}} surface oxide types of sample steels by XPS analysis after annealing in different conditions are the same, only MnO and Cr 2 O 3 were detected and no complex oxides exist on the surface. Morphologies of surface oxides can greatly influence the galvanizability of the third generation automotive steel, nodule-like oxides surface can contribute to better wettability and inhibition layer than vitreous film-like oxides surface. Galvanizing panels of nodule-like oxides surface steels only show pinhole-sized <b>bare</b> <b>spots,</b> while panels galvanized from vitreous film-like oxide surface steels reveal larger areas of <b>bare</b> <b>spots</b> and uncoated areas. Inhibition layer observed in galvanizing panels of nodule-like oxides surface steels are compact but not homogeneous, some inhibition layer grains are fine, and others are coarse. While the inhibition layer grains of panels galvanized from vitreous film-like oxide surface steels have a non-compact morphology with some particularly fine equiaxed crystals which developed deficiently...|$|R
