Mongol pressure pushed nomadic Turkish tribes to migrate westward, into the now poorly-defended Byzantine territory. From the 1260s onward Anatolia increasingly began to slip from Byzantine control, as Turkish Anatolian beyliks were established both in formerly Byzantine lands and in the territory of the fragmenting Seljuk Sultanate.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{kinetics}} of hydriding/dehydriding {{of magnesium}} has been significantly improved {{during the recent}} years {{by the introduction of}} new methods of fabrication of nanocrystalline magnesium-catalyst composites. However, the equilibrium hydrogen pressure for decomposition of nanocrystalline MgH 2 was found to be somewhat lower than for conventional magnesium hydride. Moreover, the essential difference in equilibrium hydrogen pressure for absorption and for desorption of hydrogen by nanocrystalline magnesium was reported by many authors. This difference called “hysteresis” is a common phenomenon for hydrides, but it is not observed for magnesium powders with an ordinary particle size (larger than 1 μm). The aim of the present work was to elucidate why the hysteresis arises in magnesium–hydrogen system with a decrease in particle size. It is shown that the “hysteresis” observed for nanocrystalline magnesium is an apparent phenomenon which is due to a hindered nucleation during hydriding at a pressure close to equilibrium. The pressures measured for desorption represent the real <b>equilibrium.</b> The <b>plateau</b> pressure of Mg + H 2 ↔ MgH 2 equilibrium is lower for nanocrystalline magnesium than that for conventional magnesium. This result is explained in terms of smaller surface energy of magnesium hydride in comparison with magnesium...|$|R

The self-diffusion coefficients calculated from the Stejskal-Tanner equation, D-obs, for all of the hydrated polymers were found to be dependent on the NMR storage time, as a result of spin exchange between the proton reservoirs of the water and the polymers, reaching an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>plateau</b> value at long storage times. The true values of the diffusion coefficients were calculated from the values of D-obs, in the plateau regions by applying a correction for the fraction of water protons present, obtained from the equilibrium water contents of the gels. The true self-diffusion coefficient for water in polyHEMA obtained at 310 K by this method was 5. 5 x 10 (- 10) m(2) s(- 1). For the copolymers containing 20 % HEMA or more a single value of the self-diffusion coefficient was found, which was somewhat larger than the corresponding values obtained for the macroscopic diffusion coefficient from sorption measurements. For polyTHFMA and copolymers containing less than 20 % HEMA, the PFG-NMR stimulated echo attenuation decay curves and the log-attenuation plots were characteristic of the presence of two diffusing water species.

To ensure the success of total body water analysis by the deuterium dilution method, it is fundamental to determine the <b>equilibrium</b> tune (<b>plateau)</b> of deuterium in the body fluid studied. Objectives: We report here the equilibration time of deuterium oxide in the saliva of newborns after oral intake of the isotope. Methods: Twenty healthy term newborn infants, 10 males and 10 females, were analyzed. Saliva was collected from each newborn before the oral administration of a 100 mg/kg dose of deuterium oxide (baseline sample) and then at 1 -hour intervals for 5 hours after administration. Deuterium enrichment of saliva was determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry according to the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Results: The plateau time of deuterium in saliva occurred 3 hours after oral administration of the stable isotope.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{developmental}} {{history of}} the chondrocyte results in a cell whose biosynthetic activities are optimized to maintain the concentration and organization of a mechanically functional cartilaginous extracellular matrix. While useful for cartilage tissue engineering studies, the limited supply of healthy autologous chondrocytes may preclude their clinical use. Consequently, multipotential mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proposed as an alternative cell source. ObjectiveWhile MSCs undergo chondrogenesis, few studies have assessed the mechanical integrity of their forming matrix. Furthermore, efficiency of matrix formation must be determined in comparison to healthy chondrocytes from the same donor. Given the scarcity of healthy human tissue, this study determined the feasibility of isolating bovine chondrocytes and MSCs, and examined their long-term maturation in three-dimensional agarose culture. Experimental designBovine MSCs were seeded in agarose and induced to undergo chondrogenesis. Mechanical and biochemical properties of MSC-laden constructs were monitored over a 10 -week period and compared to those of chondrocytes derived from {{the same group of}} animals maintained similarly. ResultsOur results show that while chondrogenesis does occur in MSC-laden hydrogels, the amount of the forming matrix and measures of its mechanical properties are lower than that produced by chondrocytes under the same conditions. Furthermore, some important properties, particularly glycosaminoglycan content and <b>equilibrium</b> modulus, <b>plateau</b> with time in MSC-laden constructs, suggesting that diminished capacity is not the result of delayed differentiation.

40|$|We analyse {{observations}} of the quiet-Sun far ultraviolet (FUV) continuum at various wavelengths near 1430 Å obtained by the SUMER instrument on SOHO. According to semi-empirical atmospheric models this continuum originates from the layers in the chromosphere where the temperature rises from low values at near-radiative <b>equilibrium</b> to a <b>plateau</b> of about 6000 K. We study raster images and intensity distribution histograms and find that a single log-normal distribution matches these observations very well, and that the spatial structure observed corresponds to a mixture of features at supergranular and smaller scales that probably correspond to granular clusters. Also, a log-normal distribution {{was found in the}} literature to correspond to other chromospheric features and we compare here with histograms obtained from a H i Ly-α quiet-Sun image. Because the continuum around 1430 Å is mainly produced by Si i recombination it is expected to respond well to deep chromospheric heating and not be directly affected by velocities. The data suggest that chromospheric heating originates through dissipation of magnetic free-energy fields of small size and magnitude in underlying photospheric intergranular lanes. It has been suggested that such fields can be produced by photospheric dynamos at the intergranular scale and/or by complex fields emerging in a “magnetic carpet”. Such fields are expected to have sufficient free-energy to power the chromospheric heating. Plasma instabilities, such as the Farley-Buneman instability, would allow this free-energy to be dissipated in the chromosphere. Key words. Sun: chromosphere – Sun: magnetic fields 1...|$|R

In an isoosmolar medium, the net uptake of [2 -(3) H]glycerol displayed an exponential time course reaching an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>plateau</b> value close to its extracellular concentration. Within 2 min of incubation in a hypotonic medium (caused by a 50 mM decrease in NaCl concentration), the [2 -(3) H]glycerol uptake averaged 143. 2 +/- 3. 8 % (n = 24; P < 0. 001) of its control value in isotonic medium, declining thereafter consistently with previously demonstrated volume regulatory decrease. When isoosmolarity was restored {{by the addition of}} 100 mM urea to the hypotonic medium, [2 -(3) H]glycerol uptake remained higher (112. 1 +/- 2. 8 %, n = 24; P < 0. 001) than its matched control under isotonic conditions, indicating rapid entry of urea and water. Insulin release by BRIN-BD 11 cells was 3 times higher in hypotonic than in isotonic medium.

40|$|The dose-time {{dependence}} of early radiotherapy reactions {{impacts on the}} design of accelerated fractionation schedules [...] oral mucositis, for example, can be dose limiting for short treatments designed to avoid tumor repopulation. In this paper a framework for modeling early reaction dose-time dependence is developed. Variation of stem cell number with time after the start of a radiation schedule is modeled using a first-order delay differential equation (DDE), motivated by experimental observations linking the speed of compensatory proliferation in early reacting tissues to the degree of tissue damage. The modeling suggests that two types of early reaction radiation response are possible, stem cell numbers either monotonically approaching <b>equilibrium</b> <b>plateau</b> levels or overshooting before returning to equilibrium. Several formulas have been derived from the delay differential equation, predicting changes in isoeffective total radiation dose with schedule duration for different types of fractionation scheme. The formulas have been fitted {{to a wide range of}} published animal early reaction data, the fits all implying a degree of overshoot. Results are presented illustrating the scope of the delay differential model: most of the data are fitted well, although the model struggles with a few datasets measured for schedules with distinctive dose-time patterns. Ways of extending the current model to cope with these particular dose-time patterns are briefly discussed. The DDE approach is conceptually more complex than earlier descriptive dose-time models but potentially more powerful. It can be used to study issues not addressed by simpler models, such as the likely effects of increasing or decreasing the dose-per-day over time, or of splitting radiation courses into intense segments separated by gaps.

40|$|Esterification of all-trans-retinol {{is a key}} {{reaction}} of the vertebrate visual cycle, since it produces an insoluble, relatively non-toxic, form of the vitamin for storage and supplies substrate for the isomerization reaction. CoA-dependent and -independent pathways have been described for retinol esterification in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The CoA-independent reaction, catalysed by lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) was examined in more detail in this study. Addition of retinol to RPE microsomes results {{in a burst of}} retinyl ester synthesis, followed by a rapid apparent cessation of the reaction. However, [3 H]retinol, added when retinyl ester synthesis has apparently ceased, is rapidly incorporated into retinyl ester without a net increase in the amount of ester. The specific radioactivities of [3 H]retinol and [3 H]retinyl ester reach the same value. [14 C]Palmitate from palmitoyl-CoA is incorporated into preexisting retinyl ester in the absence of net ester synthesis, too. These exchange reactions suggest that the reaction has reached <b>equilibrium</b> at the <b>plateau</b> of the progress curve and that only the accumulation of retinyl ester, and not its synthesis, has stopped during this phase of the reaction. Studies with geometrical isomers of retinol revealed that the rate of exchange of all-trans-retinol with all-trans-retinyl esters was about 6 times more rapid than exchange of 11 -cis-retinol with 11 -cis-retinyl ester. This is the first demonstration of the reversibility of LRAT and the first example of stereospecificity of retinyl ester synthesis in the visual system. Reversal of the LRAT reaction could contribute to the mobilization of 11 -cis-retinol from 11 -cis-retinyl ester pools...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} kinetics of a diblock copolymer poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) -b-poly(glycidyl methacrylate sodium sulfonate) on hydrophobic substrate from aqueous solution under different added monovalent salt (NaCl) concentrations was investigated using an ellipsometric technique. The effect of monovalent counterion size on {{adsorption kinetics}} {{of the same}} copolymer on hydrophobic surfaces was {{also part of the}} investigation. The results, in general, indicate that the adsorption process on solid surfaces occurs through the anchoring of hydrophobic chains due to the short-ranged hydrophobic interactions. The kinetic data reveal three distinct stages in the adsorption process: an incubation period, a subsequent fast growth process of the polymer layer, and a <b>plateau</b> (<b>equilibrium)</b> region. These three stages are found to be influenced by salt concentration as well as counterion size. The equilibrium adsorption density increases as a function of salt concentration, and the dependence is found to be different from the theoretical predictions. The incubation time increases with salt concentration according to a power law dependence, and a simple bound ionic layer formation on the substrate is proposed as a possible explanation for this observation. An attempt has been made to explain the growth process in terms of an Avrami type ordering process. The Avrami analysis indicates that the buildup of polyelectrolyte layer structure depends on added salt conditions. Our kinetic data suggest that the diffusion of the chains to the surface is not the rate-controlling process for adsorption.

They have also concluded that ZrMnNi is the most promising hydride with the hydrogen filling of ~ 3.5 hydrogen atoms per formula unit under near ambient conditions. Kim et al. [16] have studied several Zr–Mn–Ni–V alloys and observed that the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>plateau</b> pressure gets significantly enhanced with the concentration of Ni content. However, there was significant reduction in the hydrogen capacity {{and the rate of}} reaction. The authors attributed the effect to the amount of reactive surfaces, since the presence of more Ni limits the amount of reactive surfaces while offering excellent catalytic activity. We have studied a series of Zr based systems, namely ZrMn 2 −xNi x, where x =  0 to 2. XRD analysis revealed that the Mn rich compositions possess C 14 hcp structure, whereas the Ni rich compositions exhibit C 15 cubic structure. Hence, at a particular concentration of Zr–Mn–Ni the C 14 structure transforms to C 15 structure. We observed that except ZrNi 2 all the other composition studied in the present investigation absorbs above 3  H/F.U. under room temperature. The dehydrogenation from ZrMn 2 is found to be possible only above 250  °C, but Mn-Ni coexisting system exhibits very interesting desorption characteristics.

40|$|The surface {{chemistry}} of inorganic materials {{is of great}} significance {{in a number of}} industrially important processes such as separation of ore by flotation, catalysis, water purification, paper coating and pharmaceutical industry. The purpose of this study has been firsly to develop a method for optimal synthesis of magnetite nanoparticles and secondly to utilize these particles as adsorbent in order to investigate their adsorption/desorption properties. The magnetite nanoparticles were synthesized by coprecipitation of FeCl 2 and FeCl 3 in alkaline media. The precipitated magnetite was analysed with XRD, TEM and FTIR spectroscopy. For evaluation of the mechanism of magnetite formation via coprecipitation method, iron isotopic measurement was applied and compared with magnetite produced from oxidation of ferrous hydroxide (paper 1). No fractionation of iron isotopes was observed for the magnetite synthesized by coprecipitation, whilst the magnetite formed from ferrous hydroxide showed higher abundance of 54 Fe compared to 56 Fe {{in the beginning of the}} reaction. The synthesized magnetite was coated with a primary layer of oleate and subjected to high temperature in air and argon atmosphere (paper 2). Oleate was selected as a model for Atrac which is a collector used for separation of apatite from magnetite. A combination of thermal analysis and infrared spectroscopy method were used in this study. It was found that calcination of the magnetite-oleate system in air involves oxidation of the double bond of oleate and formation of intermediate oxygen-rich molecules. Thermal decomposition of magnetite coated with a primary layer of oleate under argon atmosphere exhibits two steps weight loss. The first step at ~ 330 oC is associated with oleate desorption/decomposition and an enthalpy change of ÄH = 49. 86 J/g. Another weight loss occurs at elevated temperature (740 oC) leading to partial reduction of magnetite to wustite and iron. In another work, the synthesized magnetite was deposited over an ATR internal reflection element to study adsorption of carbonate and sulphate anions in-situ. It was concluded from the IR spectra that there are two carbonate species on the surface at pH= 8, one tightly bond carbonate as inner sphere complex with monodentate binuclear geometry and the other one is a loosely bond outer-sphere hydrogen bonded carbonate. Adsorption of sulphate was also studied using in-situ ATR spectroscopy (paper 3). Three maxima at 1115, 1044 and 979 cm- 1 were observed, based on second derivative spectral method analysis.
