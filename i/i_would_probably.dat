[...] King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying [...] "Had President Kennedy lived, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have endorsed him in 1964." ...|$|E

[...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head.

If I never {{ran in the}} Indy 500 again or an IndyCar Series race <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> say I would be disappointed about that." [...] He received offers to return after his departure, and in late 2008 was rumored to be returning to replace Hélio Castroneves the next season due to Castroneves' IRS problems. Castroneves was eventually cleared, missing only the season opener with Will Power driving for Penske during his absence. In November 2013, Hornish declined an offer to drive for Chip Ganassi Racing in the upcoming season after Dario Franchitti's career-ending injuries at the 2013 Shell-Pennzoil Grand Prix of Houston.|$|E
500|$|In a 1975 interview, Dufek noted {{his love}} of both sports: [...] "There are times when I've thought of {{dropping}} one or the other, but heck, I've been doing this since high school {{and it would be}} pretty tough to quit them both now." [...] Dufek added: [...] "Hockey is a more relaxed thing. [...] It's a smaller atmosphere and {{you have to deal with}} only one or two coaches. [...] You can be more individual and flashy. [...] Football has certain assignments and you can't really express yourself." [...] In the end, however, Dufek chose the NFL over the NHL. [...] He explained: [...] "I've decided to pursue professional football because <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have an extensive tour in the hockey minor leagues and I don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|Derek Heemsbergen of RPGFan {{gave it a}} mixed review stating, [...] "I'm {{grateful}} that the game was released in English, and while it isn't everything I hoped it would be, Final Fantasy: Dimensions does enough right to be worth playing." [...] Nathan Mustafa of Touchgen however, criticized the dialogue structure, the lack of animation, and sound of the game stating, [...] "In the end, I cannot reconcile these cheapened portions of the game. I understand it is a port of a 'mobile' game from Japan, but {{the quality of the}} port could have been much better. Had my three key issues with how the game presents itself not been present, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have walked away feeling quite positive about Final Fantasy Dimensions.

500|$|Achebe's {{criticism}} {{has become a}} mainstream perspective on Conrad's work. The essay {{was included in the}} 1988 Norton critical edition of Conrad's novel. Editor Robert Kimbrough called it one of [...] "the three most important events in Heart of Darkness criticism since the second edition of his book..." [...] Critic Nicolas Tredell divides Conrad criticism [...] "into two epochal phases: before and after Achebe." [...] Asked frequently about his essay, Achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned: [...] "It's not in my nature to talk about banning books. I am saying, read it– with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge I talk about. And read it beside African works." [...] Interviewed on National Public Radio with Robert Siegel, in October 2009, Achebe remains consistent, although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled [...] "'Heart of Darkness' is inappropriate": [...] "Conrad was a seductive writer. He could pull his reader into the fray. And {{if it were not for}} what he said about me and my people, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be thinking only of that seduction." ...|$|E
500|$|Back in Nigeria, Achebe {{set to work}} {{revising}} {{and editing}} his novel (now titled Things Fall Apart, after {{a line in the}} poem [...] "The Second Coming" [...] by W. B. Yeats). He cut away the second and third sections of the book, leaving only the story of a yam farmer named Okonkwo who lives during the colonization of Nigeria. He added sections, improved various chapters, and restructured the prose. By 1957, he had sculpted it to his liking, and took advantage of an advertisement offering a typing service. He sent his only copy of his handwritten manuscript (along with the ₤22 fee) to the London company. After he waited several months without receiving any communication from the typing service, Achebe began to worry. His boss at the NBS, Angela Beattie, was going to London for her annual leave; he asked her to visit the company. She did, and angrily demanded to know why the manuscript was lying ignored {{in the corner of the}} office. The company quickly sent a typed copy to Achebe. Beattie's intervention was crucial for his ability to continue as a writer. Had the novel been lost, he later said, [...] "I would have been so discouraged that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have given up altogether." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1999, the Democratic polling firm Schroth and Associates {{conducted}} {{a poll of}} 400 Reform Party leaders and found Trump tied for third place for the Reform Party presidential nomination. [...] Both the Reform Party and Trump denied having commissioned the poll. Days later, Newsweek raised speculation when it cited an unnamed [...] "close friend" [...] of Trump who said Trump was [...] "toying" [...] {{with the idea of}} a presidential campaign, allegedly in response to rumors of Ventura's courting of Weicker for a run. [...] Trump purportedly held a grudge against Weicker for blocking his plans to build a casino in Bridgeport in 1994. [...] The two had an exchange of insults in which Weicker labeled Trump a [...] "dirt bag" [...] and Trump referred to Weicker as [...] "a fat slob who couldn't get elected dog catcher." [...] In response to the Newsweek report, Trump sent out a press release in which he criticized the two party system, praised the Reform Party, and stated [...] "If the Reform Party nominated me, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> run and probably win." [...] However, he added that if the party nominated him, he would ask for [...] "an immediate recount." [...] In an interview, he told The New York Times, [...] "I'm honored and I'm flattered , but the fact is I've never had more fun than I'm having right now, building the most spectacular buildings in New York." [...] Chairman Verney denied that the Reform Party had any interest in Trump, explaining that party members had [...] "never spent one second thinking about him." [...] A CNN-Time poll conducted later in July showed Trump with seven percent support nationally in a match up against Republican candidate George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.|$|E

I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care.

Although the team struggled, Cotton averaged a team-leading 15.5 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, and he earned second-team all-conference honors in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Playing out of position as an undersized power forward, he did not help to address critics of his perimeter skills. Forgoing his remaining {{two years of college}} eligibility, he hired an agent and declared early for the NBA. In 2010, he expressed disappointment in his college experience.

[...] This area has to do with nurturing and relating information to one's natural surroundings. Examples include classifying natural forms such as animal and plant species and rocks and mountain types. This ability was clearly of value in our evolutionary past as hunters, gatherers, and farmers; it continues to be central in such roles as botanist or chef.|$|E
