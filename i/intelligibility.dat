5|$|Differences in {{pronunciation}} between Ottawa {{and other}} dialects of Ojibwe, {{resulting in a}} lower degree of mutual <b>intelligibility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Languages {{spoken in}} a series of dialects occupying {{adjacent}} territory form a dialect continuum or language complex, with some of the dialects being mutually intelligible while others are not. Adjacent dialects typically have relatively high degrees of mutual <b>intelligibility,</b> but the degree of mutual <b>intelligibility</b> between nonadjacent dialects varies considerably. In some cases speakers of nonadjacent dialects may not understand each other's speech.|$|E
5|$|The Mangalorean Catholic dialect {{is largely}} {{derived from the}} Bardeskaar (North Goan) dialect and bears a good degree of <b>intelligibility</b> with the modern Bardeskaar dialect (spoken by North Goan Christians, North Goan Hindus, and South Goan Hindus) and to a {{slightly}} lesser extent with the standard Konkani dialect. It consequently differs from the dialect spoken by the Goud Saraswat Brahmins in South Canara, which is copiously derived and bears a good degree of <b>intelligibility</b> with the modern Sashtikaar (South Goan) dialect spoken by South Goan Christians and North Canara Konkani Hindus. It is {{much closer to the}} dialects of the Goan Hindus than to that of the Goan Catholics.|$|E
5|$|In Finland {{a special}} {{branch of the}} Research Institute for the Languages of Finland has {{official}} status as the regulatory body for Swedish in Finland. Among its highest priorities is to maintain <b>intelligibility</b> with the language spoken in Sweden. It has published Finlandssvensk ordbok, a dictionary {{about the differences between}} Swedish in Finland and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Scores are {{calculated}} for individual translated segments—generally sentences—by comparing {{them with a}} set of good quality reference translations. Those scores are then averaged over the whole corpus to reach an estimate of the translation's overall quality. <b>Intelligibility</b> or grammatical correctness are not taken into account.|$|E
5|$|Dysarthria is {{the most}} common {{communication}} problem in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), however, significant difficulties with speech and <b>intelligibility</b> are uncommon. Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity and the presence of intention tremor, and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly. Visual impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning systems, large-print text, or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and letters as they are typed.|$|E
5|$|Mutual <b>intelligibility</b> {{among these}} ASL {{varieties}} is high, and the variation is primarily lexical. For example, {{there are three}} different words for English about in Canadian ASL; the standard way, and two regional variations (Atlantic and Ontario), {{as shown in the}} videos on the right. Variation may also be phonological, meaning that the same sign may be signed in a different way depending on the region. For example, an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.|$|E
5|$|Swedish is an Indo-European {{language}} {{belonging to}} the North Germanic branch of the Germanic languages. In the established classification, {{it belongs to the}} East Scandinavian languages together with Danish, separating it from the West Scandinavian languages, consisting of Faroese, Icelandic and Norwegian. However, more recent analyses divide the North Germanic languages into two groups: Insular Scandinavian (Faroese and Icelandic), and Continental Scandinavian (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), based on mutual <b>intelligibility</b> due to heavy influence of East Scandinavian (particularly Danish) on Norwegian during the last millennium and divergence from both Faroese and Icelandic.|$|E
5|$|By many general {{criteria}} of mutual <b>intelligibility,</b> the Continental Scandinavian languages {{could very well}} be considered dialects of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden, including a long series of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Scania, could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.|$|E
5|$|Four major Chinese-speech {{groups are}} {{represented}} in Indonesia: Hokkien, Mandarin, Hakka and Cantonese. In addition to these, the Teochew people speak their own dialect that has some degree of mutual <b>intelligibility</b> with Hokkien. Distinctions between the two, however, are accentuated outside of their regions of origin. There were an estimated 2.2 million native speakers of various Chinese varieties in Indonesia in 1982: 1,300,000 speakers of Southern Min varieties (including Hokkien and Teochew); 640,000 Hakka speakers; 460,000 Mandarin speakers; 180,000 Cantonese speakers; and 20,000 speakers of the Eastern Min varieties (including Fuzhou dialect). Additionally, an estimated 20,000 spoke different dialects of the Indonesian language.|$|E
5|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurological condition in which dysarthria may develop later in the progression of the disease. Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech. AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech. A portable amplifier, for example, {{may be used to}} increase the volume of speech and thus its <b>intelligibility.</b> The individual may be taught to point to the first letter of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary. In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred. High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease. Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.|$|E
25|$|Speech <b>intelligibility</b> enhancement, James M. Kates of Signatron (1984). This {{system uses}} Dugan's {{automatic}} mixing algorithm to reconstitute several spectral regions of {{a signal that}} has been divided into frequency bands for short-time spectral analysis {{in order to achieve}} greater <b>intelligibility</b> of spoken consonants.|$|E
25|$|The dialects spoken vary in <b>intelligibility</b> in {{different}} areas.|$|E
25|$|Santa Catarina Albarradas Zapotec was not listed, {{and presumably}} subsumed under Albarradas Zapotec, but <b>intelligibility</b> is one-way.|$|E
25|$|People with Parkinson's {{disease can}} also develop {{dysarthria}} which {{is characterized by}} reduced speech <b>intelligibility.</b> Prosodically-based treatments may help.|$|E
25|$|Ukrainian has {{varying degrees}} of mutual <b>intelligibility</b> with other Slavic {{languages}} and {{is considered to be}} most closely related to Belarusian.|$|E
25|$|Eastern Slovak dialects {{have the}} {{greatest}} degree of mutual <b>intelligibility</b> with Polish of all the Slovak dialects followed by Rusyn, but both lack technical terminology and upper register expressions. Polish and Sorbian also differ quite considerably from Czech and Slovak in upper registers, but non-technical and lower register speech is readily intelligible. Some mutual <b>intelligibility</b> occurs with spoken Rusyn, Ukrainian, and even Russian (in this order), although their orthographies {{are based on the}} Cyrillic script.|$|E
25|$|There is no <b>intelligibility</b> between Luxembourgish and French {{or any of}} the Romance dialects {{spoken in}} the {{adjacent}} parts of Belgium and France.|$|E
25|$|Classification of Franco-Provençal dialect {{divisions}} is challenging. Each canton and valley {{uses its}} own vernacular without standardization. Difficult <b>intelligibility</b> among dialects was noted {{as early as}} 1807 by Grillet.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{breathing}} {{gases under pressure}} or containing helium causes problems in <b>intelligibility</b> of diver speech due to distortion caused by the different speed of sound in the gas and different density of the gas compared to air at surface pressure. These parameters induce changes in the vocal tract formants, which affect the timbre, and a slight change of pitch. Several studies indicate that the loss in <b>intelligibility</b> is mainly due to {{the change in the}} formants. Change of the speed of sound is relatively large in relation to depth increase at shallower depths, but this effect reduces as the pressure increases, and at greater depths a change in depth makes a smaller difference.|$|E
25|$|Ethnologue still {{uses the}} earlier pre-Wichmann classification, based on surveys of Mutual <b>intelligibility</b> and {{comparative}} work by William Wonderly, {{as a basis}} for their work. This classification is not used by historical linguists, and Lyle Campbell's authoritative 1997 presentation uses Wichmann's classification.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{vocabulary}} and pronunciation differences, there is mutual <b>intelligibility</b> among Burmese dialects, {{as for the}} most part, they share the same four tones, consonant clusters {{and the use of}} the Burmese script. However, several dialects substantially differ in Burmese with respect to vocabulary, lexical particles, and rhymes.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} Ukrainian {{language is}} {{regulated by the}} National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NANU), particularly by its Institute for the Ukrainian Language, Ukrainian language-information fund, and Potebnya Institute of Language Studies. The Ukrainian language retains a degree of mutual <b>intelligibility</b> with Belarusian and Russian.|$|E
25|$|The dialects of the Catalan {{language}} {{feature a}} relative uniformity, especially {{when compared to}} other Romance languages; both in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology. Mutual <b>intelligibility</b> between dialects is very high, estimates ranging from 90% to 95%. The only exception is the isolated idiosyncratic Alguerese dialect.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} main Breton dialects: Gwenedeg (Vannes), Kerneveg (Cornouaille), Leoneg (Leon) and Tregerieg (Trégor), which have {{varying degrees of}} mutual <b>intelligibility.</b> In 1908, a {{standard}} orthography was devised. The fourth dialect, Gwenedeg, {{was not included in}} this reform, but was included in the later orthographic reform of 1941.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} main dialects, {{two of which}} are on {{probably}} the verge of extinction, one (Kaiwaligau Ya) through convergence to the neighbouring Kalaw Lagaw Ya. Within the dialects there are two or more subdialects. The average mutual <b>intelligibility</b> rate, based on a Swadesh count, is around 97%.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimated}} 90 to 95% of Afrikaans vocabulary {{is ultimately}} of Dutch origin, {{and there are}} few lexical {{differences between the two}} languages. Afrikaans has a considerably more regular morphology, grammar, and spelling. There is a degree of mutual <b>intelligibility</b> between the two languages, particularly in written form.|$|E
25|$|Swedish is the {{official}} language of Sweden and is spoken by {{the vast majority of}} the 10 million inhabitants of the country. It is a North Germanic language and quite similar to its sister Scandinavian languages, Danish and Norwegian, with which it maintains partial mutual <b>intelligibility</b> and forming a dialect continuum.|$|E
25|$|The {{phonology}} of Portuguese {{can vary}} between dialects, {{in extreme cases}} leading to some difficulties in <b>intelligibility.</b> This article focuses on the pronunciations that are generally regarded as standard. Since Portuguese is a pluricentric language, and differences between European Portuguese (EP) and Brazilian Portuguese (BP) can be considerable, both varieties are distinguished whenever necessary.|$|E
25|$|An Austronesian language, it {{is related}} to such {{languages}} as Malay (Indonesian and Malaysian), Tetum, Chamorro, Fijian, Maori, Hawaiian, Samoan, Tahitian, Paiwan and Malagasy. It {{is closely related to}} some of the other Austronesian languages of Northern Luzon, and has slight mutual <b>intelligibility</b> with the Balangao language and the eastern dialects of the Bontoc language.|$|E
25|$|In general, mutual <b>intelligibility</b> between Dutch and Afrikaans {{is better}} than between Dutch and Frisian or between Danish and Swedish. The South African poet writer Breyten Breytenbach, {{attempting}} to visualize the language distance for anglophones once remarked that the differences between (Standard) Dutch and Afrikaans are comparable to those between the Received Pronunciation and Southern American English.|$|E
25|$|Slovene is {{a highly}} diverse Slavic {{language}} in terms of dialects, with different degrees of mutual <b>intelligibility.</b> Accounts {{of the number of}} dialects range from as few as seven dialects, often considered dialect groups or dialect bases that are further subdivided into as many as 50 dialects. Other sources characterize the number of dialects as nine or as eight.|$|E
25|$|This stage {{began with}} the {{separation}} of a distinct speech, perhaps {{while it was still}} forming part of the Proto-Indo-European dialect continuum. It contained many innovations that were shared with other Indo-European branches to various degrees, probably through areal contacts, and mutual <b>intelligibility</b> with other dialects would have remained for some time. It was nevertheless on its own path, whether dialect or language.|$|E
25|$|Although Quebec French {{constitutes}} a coherent and standard system, {{it has no}} objective norm since the very organization mandated to establish it, the Office québécois de la langue française, believes that objectively standardizing Quebec French would lead to reduced mutual <b>intelligibility</b> with other French communities around the world, linguistically isolating Quebecers and possibly causing the extinction of the French language in the Americas.|$|E
25|$|But, {{those were}} not the only trials of Tunisian Arabic in {{education}}. A project to teach basic education for the elderly people using Tunisian Arabic was proposed in 1977 by Tunisian linguist Mohamed Maamouri. It aimed to ameliorate the quality and <b>intelligibility</b> of basic courses for elderly people who could not understand Standard Arabic as they did not learn it. However, the project was not implemented.|$|E
25|$|Indic {{scholars}} distinguish 42 dialects of spoken Marathi. Dialects bordering {{other major}} language areas have many properties {{in common with}} those languages, further differentiating them from standard spoken Marathi. The bulk of the variation within these dialects is primarily lexical and phonological (e.g. accent placement and pronunciation). Although the number of dialects is considerable, the degree of <b>intelligibility</b> within these dialects is relatively high.|$|E
