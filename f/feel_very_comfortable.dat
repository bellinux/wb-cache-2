2500|$|After {{two years}} without {{releasing}} new music, Luis Fonsi {{wanted to create}} [...] "a fun track that had that Latin feel with a melody that I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> singing and that will make people just dance." [...] The lyrics were born in late 2015 in Fonsi's house after he expressed his desire to record a [...] "swinging song" [...] for his new album.

She is instead put {{under the care of}} two of her father’s elderly cousins. The narrator is very upset to leave her mother, but is {{satisfied}} when she meets cousin Agnes, with whom she will be staying. The narrator <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> and safe with Agnes, and Agnes welcomes {{her as if she were}} her own child. Agnes mentions Lady Ferry, and elderly woman who resides with her and has no family left. Ferry is gentle, but she is not used to children, and her mind wanders. In their first meeting, Lady Ferry welcomes the narrator, and Ferry's age shows during their conversation. She has traveled the world extensively, and is surprised to hear of some very notable deaths, many of which had occurred many years prior. The narrator speaks with Martha, a young servant, who provides more information about Lady Ferry. It is rumored that Ferry will never die, and no one is quite sure from where she came. The narrator becomes more attached to Agnes’ home, and is saddened to leave. “Although I wished to see my father and mother, I cried as if my heart would break because I had to leave the ferry. The time spent there had been the happiest time of all my life.” After years of living abroad, the narrator returns to America with her father, and she decides to visit Agnes’ house. She discovers a very old grave - one of Lady Ferry - in the family burial ground, and is reassured by the fact that death is certain.|$|R

6000|$|To these Saxon gentlemen, being Bastard-Royal and {{important}} to conciliate, Friedrich has in a high-flown way assigned the Schloss of Budischau for quarters, an excellent superbly magnificent mansion {{in the neighborhood}} of Trebitsch, [...] "nothing like it to be seen except in theatres, on the Drop-scene of The Enchanted Island;" [...] [Stille, Campaigns, p. 14.] where they make themselves so comfortable, says Friedrich, there is no getting them roused to do anything for three days to come. And yet the work is urgent, and plenty of it. [...] "Iglau, first of all," [...] urges Friedrich, [...] "where the Austrians, 10,000 or so, under Prince Lobkowitz, have posted themselves [right flank of that long straggle of Winter Cantonments, which goes leftwards to Budweis and farther], and made Magazines: possession of Iglau is the foundation-stone of our affairs. And if we would have Iglau WITH the Magazines and not without, surely there is not a moment to be wasted!" [...] In vain; the Saxon Bastard Princes <b>feel</b> themselves <b>very</b> <b>comfortable.</b> It was Sunday the 11th of February, when our junction with them was completed: and, instead of next morning early, it is Wednesday afternoon before Prince Dietrich of Anhalt-Dessau, with the Saxon and French party roused to join his Prussians and him, can at last take the road for Iglau. Prince Dietrich makes now the reverse of delay; marches all night, [...] "bivouacs in woods near Iglau," [...] warming himself at stick-fires till the day break; takes Iglau by merely marching into it and scattering 2,000 Pandours, so soon as day has broken; but finds the Magazines not there. Lobkowitz carted off what he could, then burnt [...] "Seventeen Barns yesterday;" [...] and is himself off towards Budweis Head-quarters and the Bohemian bogs again. This comes of lodging Saxon royal gentlemen too well.|$|R

60|$|How suggestive it is, {{swinging}} {{there through}} sunlight and shadow {{from the long}} drooping tips of the old elm boughs! And what a delightful cradle for the young orioles, swayed all day long by every breath of the summer breeze, peeping through chinks as the world sweeps by, watching with bright eyes the boy below who looks up in vain, or the mountain of hay that brushes them in passing, and whistling cheerily, blow high or low, with never a fear of falling! The mother bird must <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>comfortable</b> about it as she goes off caterpillar hunting, for no bird enemy can trouble the little ones while she is gone. The black snake, that horror of all low-nesting birds, will never climb so high. The red squirrel--little wretch that he is, to eat young birds when he has still a bushel of corn and nuts in his old wall--cannot find a footing on those delicate branches. Neither can the crow find a resting place from which to steal the young; and the hawk's legs are not long enough to reach down and grasp them, should he perchance venture near the house and hover an instant over the nest.|$|E

5000|$|Hsu Yun said of {{practicing}} Hua Tou: [...] The {{important thing is}} to stick to Hua Tou at all times, when walking, lying, or standing. From morning to night observing Hua Tou vividly and clearly, until it appears in your mind like the autumn moon reflected limpidly in quiet water. If you practice this way, you can be assured of reaching the state of Enlightenment.In meditation, if you feel sleepy, you may open your eyes widely and straighten your back; you will then feel fresher and more alert than before.When working on the Hua Tou, you should be neither too subtle nor too loose. If you are too subtle you may <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> serene and <b>comfortable,</b> but you are apt to lose the Hua Tou. The consequence will then be that you will fall into the ‘dead emptiness’. Right in the state of serenity, if you do not lose the Hua Tou, you may then be able to progress further than the top of the hundred-foot pole you have already ascended. If you are too loose, too many errant thoughts will attack you. You will then find it difficult to subdue them. In short, the Zen practitioner should be well adjusted, neither too tight nor too loose; in the looseness there should be tightness, and in the tightness there should be looseness.|$|R

It so happened, however, that Miss Silence {{was one of those who}} have so little economy in {{disposing}} of a fit of anger, that it was all used up before the time of execution arrived. It followed of consequence, that, having unburdened her mind freely both to Deacon Enos and to Susan, she began to <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> much more <b>comfortable</b> and good-natured; and consequent upon that came divers reflections upon the many gossiping opportunities and comforts of a quilting; and then the intrusive little reflection, [...] "What if she should go, after all; what harm would be done?"
