50|$|A {{year later}} in March 1981, the investigative report {{concluded}} that the rig collapsed owing to a fatigue crack {{in one of its}} six bracings (bracing D-6), which connected the collapsed D-leg {{to the rest of the}} rig. This was traced to a small 6 mm fillet weld which joined a non-load-bearing <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> to this D-6 bracing. This <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> held a sonar device used during drilling operations. The poor profile of the fillet weld contributed to a reduction in its fatigue strength. Further, the investigation found considerable amounts of lamellar tearing in the <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> and cold cracks in the butt weld. Cold cracks in the welds, increased stress concentrations due to the weakened <b>flange</b> <b>plate,</b> the poor weld profile, and cyclical stresses (which would be common in the North Sea), seemed to collectively play a role in the rig's collapse.|$|E

50|$|Built in 1950, the Patton Bridge {{spans the}} Green River {{near the city}} of Auburn in King County, Washington. The bridge is a three-span {{cantilever}} with two anchor arms, two cantilever arms and a suspended section. It includes a combination of concrete and steel box girders. The bridge was designed by Homer M. Hadley, a consulting engineer from Washington State.The anchor arms and cantilever arms are multiple box, two-cell reinforced concrete box girders. The suspended section consists of two spread, welded steel box girders with reinforced concrete deck. The concrete deck is fixed to the top <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> of the girders with steel shear developers. Utilization of this deck design allows the concrete deck and steel box girders to act in composite design; i.e., the bottom flange of the steel box resists tensile forces while the concrete deck resists compressive forces.The Patton Bridge's anchor arms are 115 ft feet long, the cantilever arms are 50 ft long, and the suspended span is 100 ft. The bridge has a total length of 430 ft. The center span of 200 ft is the longest box girder span constructed in the state during the 1940s.|$|E

40|$|Corrugated {{steel web}} with {{inherent}} high out-of-plane stiffness has a promising application in configuring large span highway bridge girders. Due to the irregularity of the configuration details, the local stress concentration poses a major fatigue {{problem for the}} welded <b>flange</b> <b>plates</b> of {{high strength low alloy}} structural steels. In this work, the methods of applying CFRP laminate and shot peening onto the surfaces of the tension flanges were employed with the purpose of improving the fatigue strength of such configuration details. The effectiveness of this method in the improvement of fatigue strength has been examined experimentally. Test results show that the shot peening significantly increases hardness and roughness in contrast to these without treatment. Also, it has beneficial effects on the fatigue strength enhancement when compared against the test data of the joints with CFRP strengthening. The stiffness degradation during the loading progress is compared with each treatment. Incorporating the stress acting on the constituent parts of the CFRP laminates, a discussion is made regarding the mechanism of the retrofit and related influencing factors such as corrosion and economic cost. This work could enhance the understanding of the CFRP and shot peening in repairing such welded details and shed light on the reinforcement design of welded joints between corrugated steel webs and <b>flange</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R

In current study, the behavior of beam to column steel connection with <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> was studied by using component method.

40|$|During the bending of <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> {{used for}} dapped girders some highway bridge fabricators are {{experiencing}} cracking of the <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> particularly when heat {{is used in}} assisting the bending process. Due to the extreme strains experienced during the fabrication process, investigating this problem {{requires the use of}} a finite element analysis. The fabrication process was broken down into two parts, first the heating of the plate through the use of either a furnace or an acetylene torch (thermal), and the second was the bending process (structural). The five different temperatures collected during the thermal analysis were a uniform temperature of 75 oF, a 1100 oF uniform temperature as a result of furnace heating, both five and ten minutes of air-cooling after the plate had reached a uniform temperature of 1100 oF, and the temperature gradient after heating the <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> to a surface temperature of 1200 oF though the use of an acetylene torch. After the thermal analysis was completed, the resulting temperatures were imported into the structural model. The plate thicknesses analyzed were one, one and a half, and two inches, assuming both 50 and 70 ksi yield strengths. To achieve a 90 degree six-inch radius bend the plate was bent in five separate locations. The result of this analysis showed that with the introduction of temperature gradients into thefabrication process, the strains along the plate??s extreme fibers increased. The model further showed that for both a one and a half and two-inch thick plate the extreme fiber strains exceeded ten percent, which further adds to the increased risk of the <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> cracking during fabrication. The highest residual stresses through the plate??s thickness occurred during cold bending. The residual stresses through the plate??s thickness decreased when the fabrication process was carried out at elevated temperatures. When steel exceeds a strain of 10 to 16 percent during the fabrication process, the plate becomes susceptible to cracking. This strain limit was exceeded for plate thicknesses of one and a half and two inches...|$|E

A number of hybrid I-beams are modeled and analyzed {{to determine their}} shear failure mechanism characteristics, considering parameters of web slenderness (hw/tw), frame action from end-stiffeners, ratio of flange width to web depth (bf/hw) and panel numbers. The analyses conclude that, in shear resistance calculation, plate beam with inter and slender webs often fail in inelastic or elastic shear buckling while ultimate shear resistance of compact webs is given by the shear strength of the material.

Stiffening plate is welded at top of the flange while downhand welding and high strength friction grip bolts are used for the top beam flange and the beam web, respectively.

Recently, much attention {{has been focused on}} potential crack propagation along welds using large heat input. This paper examines the application of a T-joint to the strength deck structure of container ships to enhance crack arrestability. The crack arrest toughness, Kca, for crack arrest was varied. The ESSO test of T-joint components showed that brittle crack was arrested at the T-joint if the steel plate used for the flange had a high Kca value in the range from 4900 to 7300 N/mm 3 / 2. FE-analysis of the stress intensity factor K indicated that brittle crack propagation was arrested under the condition that the K-value at the running crack tip was less than the Kca of the material. In the T-joint, it was noted that the K-value around the area of the deepest point of the crack decreased and was finally less than the Kca of the <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> when the brittle crack penetrated suddenly into the <b>flange</b> <b>plate</b> to a 10 mm depth.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using reduced <b>flange</b> <b>plates</b> (RFPs) or rib plates for seismic response of steel moment connections was investigated through cyclic testing of six full-scale specimens. The first scheme utilized RFPs {{to connect the}} beam flanges to the column, without any direct connection of the beam flange to the column. Plastic hinges were forced to form in the RFPs instead of the steel beam due to strong beam-weak RFPs, so the weakened moment connection eliminated buckling of the beam and reduced cost of repairing after earthquakes. The second scheme was to strengthen a connection, which was removed from an existing 33 -story steel building, by welding rib plates between the column face and inner side of the beam flanges. Test results of the weakened connections showed that (1) the connections developed beam plastic moment and reach more than an interstory drift of 4 % without strength degradation, (2) the RFP was effective in dissipating energy before buckling, and (3) no buckling of the beam was observed.
