500|$|Moore {{began writing}} the series very early on, hoping to avoid {{publication}} delays {{such as those}} faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue, Moore said he realized, [...] "I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!" [...] His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that [...] "he script for {{the first issue of}} Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescript—single-spaced—with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages." [...] Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page [...] "in case I drop them on the floor, because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> two days to put them back in the right order", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, [...] "It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper." [...] Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note [...] "If that doesn't work for you, do what works best"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script: a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach, as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons {{had a great deal of}} autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen, and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reaching}} young adulthood, Purim mixed jazz with radical protest {{songs to}} defy the repressive Brazilian government of that time. A 1964 military coup in Brazil led to censorship of song lyrics, and she later commented on this period of her life as follows: [...] "I wanted to leave Brazil. There's a river there called the San Francisco River. I used to sing to the river, that, as it flowed out to the ocean, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to America." ...|$|E
2500|$|Camelot 3000 had lengthy delays {{between its}} final issues. Bolland {{recalled}} {{that he and}} DC [...] "talked {{quite a bit about}} how long <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to do the series," [...] and because the series was inked by other artists, he started off [...] "churning the pages out with great enthusiasm." [...] As the series continued, however, Bolland became increasingly meticulous, [...] "trying to make the pages look better and better". The added details he introduced into his artwork caused significant delays in the final issues of the limited series, causing issues #8–11 to be released on a quarterly rather than monthly status, and the final issue to be cover dated nine months later than the penultimate issue.|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>took</b> <b>me</b> so," [...] Mat said, walking quickly up the street; [...] "and it wouldn't if I'd {{heard it}} {{anywhere}} else. But I'm {{not the man}} I was, now I'm in the old place again. Over twenty year of hardening, don't seem to have hardened me yet!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Sain {{considered}} Atrocious Virgin to {{be among}} his best work, referring to it on the Trance to the Sun Bandcamp website as their [...] "gothic-psychedelia magnum opus". In 2002, he commented on the experience: [...] "In the studio, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> typically 3 weeks to finish a Trance To The Sun song; and in that 3 week period I would spend anywhere from 80 to 180 hours. I kind of logged my studio time. To {{do that kind of}} studio work by yourself, you have to take careful notes. And on the last Trance To The Sun album there's a song called [...] "Map of the Lost" [...] which set the all time record at 180 hours. [...] "Map of The Lost" [...] {{is one of the greatest}} pieces I've ever come up with. The reason it took so long is because it went through several mutilations before reaching a final stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornell was a {{close friend}} of late singer Andrew Wood, who was his roommate in Seattle. While living together, Cornell and Wood {{recorded}} the song [...] "Island of Summer", which was written by Cornell and is the only existing recording from the two of them singing together. The song was released in 2011 in the album [...] "Melodies & Dreams", a solo album from Andrew Wood featuring unreleased songs he recorded throughout his life. Wood's sudden death in 1990 led Cornell to make a tribute album for him with the band Temple of the Dog. In a 2016 interview with The Guardian promoting the first tour of Temple of the Dog, Cornell said about Wood's death: [...] "I've always had a really difficult time with loss. I didn't deal well with Andy's death. After he died, numerous times I'd be driving and I would look out the window and I thought I saw him. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> five minutes to update to the moment and realize, 'no, he's actually dead.' This tour, in a sense, is the dealing. It's facing the reality." [...] When asked if it is legitimate to read a songwriter's demise into his lyrics after the fact during a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone reflecting on Kurt Cobain's suicide, Cornell said; [...] "When Andy died, I couldn't listen to his songs for about two years after that, and it was for that reason— his lyrics often seem as though they can tell that story. But then again, my lyrics often could tell the same one. In terms of seeing everything as {{a matter of life and}} death— if that's what you're feeling at the time, then that's what you're going to write. It's sort of a morbid exchange when somebody who is a writer like that dies, and then everyone starts picking through all their lyrics. In Kurt's case, whatever he was thinking and whatever he was writing, there wasn't an arrow pointing at what his demise was. It's a stream of thought, it's a possibility— it's definitely something that somebody was feeling when they were writing. It doesn't mean that it's going to happen. But it doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't, either." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Had it been an {{ordinary}} stable," [...] replied the stranger, [...] "I {{should not have}} mentioned it. But this was so gigantic a task that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> all my life to perform it, if I had not luckily thought of turning the channel of a river through the stable-door. That did the business {{in a very short}} time!" ...|$|R

If you had brought up Gloria {{in the old}} way, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> eighteen months {{to get to the}} point I got to this afternoon in eighteen minutes. Yes, Mrs. Clandon: the Higher Education of Women delivered Gloria into my hands; and it was you who taught her to believe in the Higher Education of Women.|$|R

6000|$|Elmore laughed sadly. [...] "I {{have been}} here two years. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> twenty years to write such a history of Venice as I {{ought not to be}} ashamed to write; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> five years to scamp it as I thought of doing. Oh, I dare say I had better go back. I have neither the time nor the money to give to a work I never was fit for,--of whose {{magnitude}} even I was unable to conceive." ...|$|E

6000|$|Helen smiled. [...] "I didn't {{see much}} use in doing so. You knew when your letter would arrive {{and how long}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to come. It's {{significant}} that you came to meet the train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How long <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to get {{together}} that number of the things?" [...] Mr. Peters inquired, when, having looked his fill on the dullest assortment of objects he remembered ever to have seen, he was preparing to take his leave.|$|R
60|$|There's {{a certain}} type of chap who takes a {{pleasure}} in positively chivvying trouble. Old Bill's like that. If I had been alone, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> about three seconds to persuade myself that I hadn't really heard anything after all. I'm a peaceful sort of cove, and believe in living and letting live, and so forth. To old Bill, however, a visit from burglars was pure jam. He was out of his chair in one jump.|$|R
6000|$|... "The boss," [...] {{said that}} gentleman, [...] "can size {{a man in}} and out, and all through, in about the time <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> you and <b>me</b> to tell {{the color of his}} hair. HE don't make mistakes, you bet; but old Dingy--the dep--you settled with your clothes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I daresay; {{but just}} now I feel that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> {{a long time}} to get tired of it, if it were all as charming as today. Everything loves June. Davy-boy, why this melancholy November face in blossom-time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only {{wait till}} to-morrow,' said the shepherd, 'and I {{will give you}} the biggest sheep you ever saw. But he always feeds at some {{distance}} {{from the rest of the}} flock, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> a long time to catch him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but, Sam, what am I {{going to}} do if that money isn't gotten back? The Sandersons can't afford to lose it, and even if I went to work right away, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> a long, long time to earn four {{thousand}} dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} is for that," [...] Charlie replied, [...] "though I {{think it is very}} absurd. Count Piper said the king <b>would</b> have given <b>it</b> to me at once, only <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> over the heads of so many men older than myself; but he {{considered}} that, now I am going on a sort of staff work, away from the regiment, I could be promoted, and he thought, too, that the title of Captain would assist me in my mission." ...|$|R
40|$|When I {{began as}} an {{assistant}} professor, I {{had a pretty good}} sense of how much time <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> for <b>me</b> to prepare for each class. After a few conversations with my new colleagues, I even had a good sense of how much time I should devote to tasks like office hours and committee work. Somewhere in the middle of grading my first exam, though, it became painfully clear that I had underestimated the amount of time I would need to grade exams...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} teacher, [...] "but here are {{fifteen or twenty}} boys tardy this morning; now how long <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to hear their excuses, and {{understand}} each case thoroughly, so that I could really tell whether they were tardy from good reasons or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "John Cumnor is sure, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> long to {{tell you}} how his conviction, or his very strong presumption--strong enough to stand against the old lady's not unnatural fib--has built itself up. Besides, he makes much of the {{internal}} evidence of the niece's letter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am sure I {{should be}} delighted,” Captain Crosbie went on, “for Morales is of very little use; and with Mr. Embleton to aid me I {{should be able}} to get the crew into {{something}} like shape in half the time that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to do it single-handed.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because," [...] said Rollo, [...] "I {{can call}} out for him, in a moment, in the yard, {{and then if}} he is any where within hearing, he answers; and so I know where he is. But <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> some {{time to go to}} all the places that are within hearing." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found it}} less by Degrees than Our Terrestial Globe, but more Land and less Water; and as I was {{particularly}} concern'd {{to see something}} {{in or near the}} same Climate with Our selves, I observ'd a large extended Country to the North, about the Latitude of 50 to 56 Northern Distance; and enquiring of that Country, he told me {{it was one of the}} best Countries in all their World: That it was his Native Climate, and he was just a going to <b>it,</b> and <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You forget one thing; I hadn't time. At the best, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> {{three or}} four years to get straight, and as you haven't much imagination, I suppose you don't realize what Helen's trials {{would have been in the}} meanwhile. An engaged girl's {{situation}} isn't easy when her lover is away. She stands apart, forbidden much others may enjoy, and Helen would have had to bear her friends' contemptuous pity for being bound to a man who had turned out a failure or worse." ...|$|R
60|$|Florence {{had talked}} in an airy {{sort of way}} about {{destroying}} the manuscript; but when one came down to it, how the deuce can a chap destroy a great chunky mass of paper in somebody else's house {{in the middle of}} summer? I couldn't ask to have a fire in my bedroom, with the thermometer in the eighties. And if I didn't burn the thing, how else could I get rid of it? Fellows on the battle-field eat dispatches to keep them from falling {{into the hands of the}} enemy, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> a year to eat Uncle Willoughby's Recollections.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you all about it fully, later on," [...] Jack said, [...] "but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> till night to give you the full yarn now. But first you must tell me what has {{happened}} here. You know I have heard nothing, and only know that Sebastopol is not yet taken." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this the}} boy laughed, and the laugh {{was full of}} mischief. [...] "If I could tell you what Zog is like, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> a year," [...] was the reply. [...] "But I can't tell you. Every one has a {{different}} idea of what he's like, and soon you will see him yourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas! Tolly, I {{have not}} even scissors; besides, if I had, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> at least two minutes with all the {{strength}} of my fingers to cut the thongs that bind you with scissors, and I don't think the Redskins would stand quietly by and look on while I did it. But what say you to me trying it by myself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are but few {{with life}} in them, I reckon," [...] Osgod said. [...] "A Norse sword and an English axe let out the life quickly when they strike fair. This blow fell {{on my arm}} as my axe was raised to strike, and it were well it did so, or <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>me</b> in the neck, and then neither monk nor leech could have brought me back to life. Had it been my right arm I would as lief have been killed at once, for what good is a man without his right arm?" ...|$|R
500|$|... "Today" [...] {{is written}} in the key of E-flat major (E) and played in {{standard}} tuning. While Corgan briefly considered simply tuning the guitar down a half-step and playing the song {{as if it were}} in the key of E, he said, [...] "There was something about the E voicing that I liked. So it's absolutely, intentionally in E, not E." [...] "Today" [...] is one of the Siamese Dream songs on which Corgan took over Iha and D'arcy's duties on guitar and bass to ensure quality; Wretzky later stated that Corgan [...] "can do something in three <b>takes</b> where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> maybe <b>take</b> <b>me</b> 20." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, I had {{the right}} to blow his brains out; but as I didn't, we can't let him starve. He has lost his pension and he is utterly {{incapable}} of doing anything in the world for himself. We must take care of him, secretly, {{to the end of his}} days. Don't I owe him the most ecstatic moment of my life? [...] . Ha! ha! ha! Over the fields, two miles, running all the way! I couldn't believe my ears! [...] .
