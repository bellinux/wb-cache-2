40|$|Background: The {{number of}} pathologically <b>examined</b> {{axillary}} nodes {{has been associated}} with breast cancer survival, and examination of >= 10 nodes has been advocated for reliable axillary staging. The considerable variation observed in axillary staging prompted this population-based study, which evaluated the prognostic effect of a variable number of pathologically <b>examined</b> nodes. Methods: In total, 5314 consecutive breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery and axillary dissection between 1994 and 1999 were included. The prognostic effect of the <b>examined</b> number of nodes was assessed with crude and relative survival analysis. Results: A median number of 12 (range, 1 - 43) nodes were histologically <b>examined,</b> and 59 % of the patients had no nodal tumor involvement. The number of <b>examined</b> nodes decreased with age (P = 10 <b>examined</b> nodes (P <. 001), whereas the relative survival did not differ. After adjusting for age, tumor size, number of positive nodes, and detection by screening in a multivariate analysis, the number of <b>examined</b> nodes was not associated with relative survival. Conclusions: This study shows that the association between the number of pathologically <b>examined</b> axillary nodes and overall survival in node-negative and node-positive patients results from stage migration. The absence of an association between the number of <b>examined</b> nodes and relative survival further indicates that the association between the number of <b>examined</b> nodes and crude survival is confounded by age...|$|R
