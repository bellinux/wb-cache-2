6000|$|Milder thoughts, we say; and {{consented to}} a meeting next autumn, at some half-way station, where their great {{business}} might be brought to a happy settlement and betrothment. Both Olaf Tryggveson and the high dowager {{appear to have been}} tolerably of willing mind at this meeting; but Olaf interposed, what was always one condition with him, [...] "Thou must consent to baptism, and give up thy idol-gods." [...] "They are the gods of all my forefathers," [...] answered the lady, [...] "choose thou what gods thou pleasest, but leave me mine." [...] Whereupon an altercation; and Tryggveson, as was his wont, towered up into shining wrath, and exclaimed at last, [...] "Why should I care about thee then, old faded heathen creature?" [...] And impatiently wagging his glove, hit her, or slightly switched her, on the face with it, and contemptuously turning away, walked out of the adventure. [...] "This is a feat that may cost thee dear one day," [...] said Sigrid. And in the end <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, little as the magnificent Olaf deigned to think of it at the moment.|$|E
5000|$|Heading into 1975, {{the group}} headlined their first major tour, with Khan {{attracting}} attention in concert reviews for her powerhouse vocals and sexy attire — {{so much so}} that when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> photo sets, Khan was often the only artist chosen to be featured on covers, mainly on magazines such as Jet, which Khan would be heavily featured on throughout her long career. Also due to her off-stage antics that added to her on-stage persona, the media billed Khan as [...] "the wild child". Due to Khan's vocal power and sex appeal, she was often compared to Tina Turner, with some rock and soul press labeling her a [...] "pint-sized Tina", and also to Aretha Franklin (her friends called her [...] "little Aretha"). Attention to Khan began to make things difficult for some of the group's members as they felt Khan's presence had overshadowed the entire band's output. The group's fourth release, and the third major release where Khan was dominant lead singer, Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan, was released in 1975. The major hit off the album was a composition by Khan and Tony Maiden titled [...] "Sweet Thing" [...] which reached the top five of the charts and became their fourth record to reach gold.|$|E
5000|$|Whilst {{discussing}} storylines for Harry in 2017, producer Maxine Fleming encouraged {{writers to}} storyline a {{coming of age}} plot where he lost his virginity. It was decided to incorporate in sexting so as to appear [...] "contemporary". Galvin was pleased {{to be given the}} storyline, [...] "I couldn't wait. It was fantastic. We live for these kinds of things. I was so excited about the scene, when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it I didn't want to ruin it." [...] The storyline unfolded with Harry photographing his genitalia for his girlfriend Lily only for it to be synced with the family tablet and for Chris to find it. The cliffhanger of the episode then revolved around Chris confronting Harry with the line [...] "Please tell me that is not your penis!" [...] Due to the hilarity of the dialogue, the filming of the scene took 3 takes. Fleming explained the decision to include the 'dick pic', [...] "It is a comedy story, but like all good comedy there's a truth at the core of it, and it is social commentary, that story. Many teens are doing stuff like this, and many parents are worried about it." [...] The cliffhanger went viral and Fleming expressed apologies to Galvin for the dialogue, [...] "I think Michael now is going to have that line shouted at him across the street. ... So I'm sorry about that Michael!" ...|$|E

5000|$|An {{attraction}} forms between Gaby and Wayne Duncan (Jonathon Sammy-Lee) and Monroe {{said there}} was a real chemistry between them. The author said that while the couple were mismatched from the start, they could not get each other out of their minds and often came together for [...] "sparring sessions". One night, Gaby believes Wayne has been groping her and she tips her drink over him. Blakely said things get worse from there and explained that when she received a script containing a scene in which Gaby slaps Wayne, Blakely taunted Sammy-Lee. She revealed [...] "When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the scene I slapped him so hard I really hurt him! I think I got a little too worked up for it!" [...] Despite the rough start, Gaby and Wayne do get together, but a writer for Inside Soap said Wayne [...] "turns out to be yet another loser on Gaby's list of unsuitable men." [...] Blakely explained that while Gaby cares for Wayne, she decides the relationship is not right. The couple break up when they realise how destructive their relationship is. The actress thought the breakup was Gaby's fault and said there were some aspects of her character she did not respect. Blakely cited Gaby's fiery nature and her tendency to take gossip too seriously as the aspects she did not like, while calling for her character to grow up. Blakely added [...] "People her age aren't so irresponsible in real life, so hopefully she'll grow up soon." ...|$|E

During his exile, he contemplates all the choices he had made as the Duke, and regrets the pain he had caused. Along his journey, he {{encounters}} four men carrying an artifact of dark power. As soon as he sees it, he is caught in its power and led by a will not his own along with his new companions to where the artifact, a set of black armor, wished. They take it to the temple of the Gods, and are directed to take it to the Gods themselves upon the highest mountains of the world. As they travel, the former Duke Kaspar's companions are killed off one at a time, until he is alone in carrying the armor to the Gods. There he is shown visions of great evil that await if the armor is not sent back to the world from which <b>it</b> <b>came.</b> <b>To</b> <b>do</b> so, Kaspar is instructed to find his old enemy, Talwin Hawkins, and contact the order he works for, the Conclave of Shadows. Kaspar takes the advice and sails the armor back to his home and does as he is bid, only to find that the Conclave know of no means to destroy the armor. Hoping to gain more information, the head of the Conclave, Pug, transports them to the elf lands of Elvandar where they seek the wisdom of the elves. Even the elves prove to be of no help, and just as the sorcerer Pug and Kaspar are to return, a reincarnated Leso Varen attacks the elven land with his hordes of undead. After saving the elf lands, they return only to find that Pug's stronghold had been breached by none other than Leso Varen himself. After a battle in which Varen is killed again, Pug and his son are able to send the armor to an Assembly of the most powerful magicians in their plane. As the story concludes, Pug and an ally of his, Nakor, travel to where the armor was first uncovered, only to find that thousands more like it were hidden only under the surface.|$|E

40|$|Allocation {{of people}} is a crucial point {{in the success of}} {{software}} projects. Several techniques have been proposed to manage them in an optimal way, yet, when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the actual allocation, several constraints occur. The constraints regard the limited human resources and skills available in a firm and the possibly large number of projects that must be handled at the same time. The paper presents a technique to make allocation of people automatic at project level allowing all the constraints that may occur. Allocation takes into consideration skills: activities and roles require skills; people have actual skills. The technique to find a good assignment is based on flexible matching of skills between people and roles. Sub-optimal allocations are supported as required by real situations. ...|$|R
