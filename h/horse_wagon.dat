500|$|Fire Station No. 23 {{remained}} an active firehouse from 1910-1960. [...] When it opened, it was manned by fifteen firefighters and ten horses. [...] The original equipment included a <b>horse</b> <b>wagon,</b> chief's buggy, and a pumper that used a vertical tube boiler. [...] The company's first major call {{was a fire}} in the old Byrne Building that took ten hours to extinguish.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the castle}} {{is open to the}} public, except for the areas used by Count Michael and Countess Caroline Ahlefeldt-Laurvig-Bille. [...] The museum of {{agriculture}} and the <b>horse</b> <b>wagon</b> collection is located in the building Ladegård mentioned previously.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will give}} twenty-five {{dollars in cash}} {{for the return of}} our <b>horse,</b> <b>wagon</b> and goods," [...] said Matt, in a voice loud enough for all to hear.|$|E
50|$|With <b>horses,</b> <b>wagons</b> {{were also}} used to {{transport}} equipment as well.|$|R
50|$|The traffic had mostly {{evaporated}} by the 1940s, so {{the remaining}} <b>horse</b> <b>wagons</b> were altered to OH and HD vans for general maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Laborde also {{opened up}} mines, roads, and bridges {{in various parts}} of the island. He built ox and <b>horse</b> <b>wagons</b> and a short horse-drawn stretch of railway.|$|R
60|$|It was {{no wonder}} that Matt's heart was filled with dismay {{when he saw the}} stable which {{contained}} the auction outfit being thus rapidly devoured by the flames. Almost every cent he possessed was invested in the <b>horse,</b> <b>wagon</b> and stock, and if they were consumed he would be left in New York City next to penniless.|$|E
50|$|The train ran {{onto the}} siding {{and onto the}} staithes. Six empty coal wagons, which were {{standing}} there, were struck and driven off the track. The stone pillars of the staithes that supported the track gave way, and the engine fell about eight feet, destroying the whole framework of the staithes. The tender followed. Next to the locomotive was an open <b>horse</b> <b>wagon</b> laden with corn that fell but landed upright. The <b>horse</b> <b>wagon</b> {{was followed by a}} laden freight wagon that fell upon the <b>horse</b> <b>wagon.</b>|$|E

50|$|Mervine's {{march was}} poorly planned with little {{knowledge}} of the enemy. His troops were armed {{with an assortment of}} muskets, cutlasses and pikes; they brought no <b>horses,</b> <b>wagons</b> or cannons.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the park began in 1950 and the opening ceremony was held in May 1954. The seedlings were transported by the <b>horse</b> <b>wagons</b> from the nursery gardens in Krnjača and from Zagreb's Forestry Faculty.|$|R
50|$|From Smolensk to Moshaisk the war {{displayed}} its horrible work of destruction: all the roads, fields, {{and woods}} lay as though sown with people, <b>horses,</b> <b>wagons,</b> burned villages and cities; everything {{looked like the}} complete ruin of all that lived.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} '70s, as {{the age of}} the {{automobile}} (replacing steam train and <b>horse</b> <b>wagon)</b> began in Sumatra, this town slowly lost its strategic position as a transit point.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Goebel-Shop in New York, Grand Street. Probably {{this photo}} {{was taken in}} the year 1893 to support the Goebel-Story. The telescop which Göbel used in the 1850s on a <b>horse</b> <b>wagon</b> was much larger.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the castle}} {{is open to the}} public, except for the areas used by Count Michael and Countess Caroline Ahlefeldt-Laurvig-Bille. The museum of {{agriculture}} and the <b>horse</b> <b>wagon</b> collection is located in the building Ladegård mentioned previously.|$|E
50|$|In 1889 {{the first}} of six bogie <b>horse</b> <b>wagons</b> entered service, classed FF. Between 1894 and 1897 a larger four-wheel F wagon (F52) was relettered to FF, and so the bogie {{vehicles}} were relettered to FFF. This was reversed in the 1910 recodings.|$|R
50|$|As an old tradition, graduating {{high school}} {{students}} from the Copenhagen area, when they graduate in June, come to Kongens Nytorv in buses, trucks or <b>horse</b> <b>wagons</b> to dance and run around Krinsen, throwing their graduation caps into the air, celebrating their graduation.|$|R
50|$|The house {{served as}} Washington's {{headquarters}} from August 20 to 25, 1781. The American and French armies were {{then on the}} march to Yorktown, Virginia, and it took four days to ferry the troops, <b>horses,</b> <b>wagons</b> and cannons across the Hudson River.|$|R
50|$|Of note, {{the toll}} for a round trip across the Mid-Hudson Bridge {{for a car}} with 3 {{passengers}} in 1933 was $2.20, more than the $1.50 charged today. The 1933 $1 toll for a one <b>horse</b> <b>wagon</b> is no longer charged.|$|E
50|$|To {{earn more}} money, Göbel {{constructed}} a telescope. Frequently in the 1850s and 1860s {{he moved with}} his large telescope on a <b>horse</b> <b>wagon</b> to Union Square {{in the evening and}} by payment of a fee people could use his telescope to observe the stars. In litigations of the year 1893 many persons remembered the telescope-man.|$|E

500|$|In many {{particulars}} the Federal soldiers acted very cleverly. Gen. [...] Wilson {{turned over}} to Gen. Ira Foster the Confederate mules, <b>horses,</b> <b>wagons,</b> and harness, for distribution to the poor, and Col. J.H.R. Washington of Macon, was associated with Gen. Foster {{to aid in the}} distribution.|$|R
50|$|During construction, {{teams of}} <b>horses</b> and <b>wagons</b> would bog down in {{quicksand}} that lay along the creek bed. To fix this, small herds of cattle were led {{back and forth}} across these areas to pack the sand down and make it firm enough to support the <b>horses</b> and <b>wagons.</b>|$|R

50|$|Flooding {{occurred}} at the station in 1882 following heavy rains for 6 days with 6 in falling at nearby properties. The Wilson river rose leaving Nockatunga surrounded by water and parts being swept away. Many outbuildings constructed of mudbrick were washed away. The main buildings had the mortar dislodged from between the stones with flooding reaching a depth of 4 ft, making the buildings unstable. At {{the peak of the}} floods a <b>horse</b> <b>wagon</b> was caulked up and used as a raft to take supplies to higher ground.|$|E
50|$|Traffic {{across the}} Delaware River at Riegelsville, Pennsylvania, was handled by Wendel and Anthony Shenk's oar powered ferries until December 15, 1837, when a three-span, wooden covered bridge was opened to <b>horse,</b> <b>wagon,</b> and {{pedestrian}} use. The Pennsylvania and New Jersey legislatures had approved {{the formation of}} the private Riegelsville Delaware Bridge Corporation in 1835 and the company engaged Solon Chapin and James Madison Porter of Easton, Pennsylvania as the contractors. A major flood struck the Delaware Valley on January 8, 1841, just three years after the bridge opened, and the span nearest the Jersey shore was destroyed. The bridge was repaired and survived another flood in June 1862.|$|E
50|$|Threshing barn — {{built with}} a {{threshing}} floor for the processing and storage of cereals, {{to keep them}} in dry conditions. Characterised by large double doors in the centre of one side, a smaller one on the other, and storage for cereal harvest or unprocessed on either side. In England the grain was beaten from the crop by flails and then separated from the husks by winnowing between these doors. The design of these typically remained unchanged between the 12th and 19th centuries. The large doors allow for a <b>horse</b> <b>wagon</b> to be driven through; the smaller ones allow for the sorting of sheep and other stock in the spring and summer.|$|E
50|$|Oil was {{discovered}} west of Okotoks on October 7, 1913. Okotoks became the supply centre. In its heyday, from 1913 to the 1960s, Okotoks {{was busy with}} <b>horses,</b> <b>wagons,</b> and transports hauling all types of equipment to the oil fields, and crude oil back through town to refineries in Calgary.|$|R
50|$|When the run {{began at}} noon, men on {{thousands}} of <b>horses,</b> <b>wagons,</b> buggies, carts, and vehicles rushed across to Oklahoma. The law-abiders fought with the Sooners on several instances. A legal pioneer shot and wounded William Couch, a Sooner. He died on April 21, 1890, {{as a result of}} his wounds.|$|R

50|$|The {{passenger}} coach service began {{to operate on}} a regular basis from Dunedin to Waikouaiti. Passengers who travelled on this line for Oamaru and beyond, were transferred to a light two <b>horse</b> <b>wagon</b> for the final part of their journey, where they were met by private contractors to take them to the Ferry Service at Waitaki.By April 1862, Hoyt decided to put a four horse coach team on the run, with a service of three times a week at a fare of £3 each way. The route lay through Palmerston and over the Horse Range where stops were made at the Hampden Hotel and the Otepopo Inn, before the leg to the Northern Hotel, Oamaru or on to the Waitaki River Ferry Service.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{one of the}} {{passenger}} carriages was badly damaged, all the carriages stopped just before falling and stayed upon the tracks. All {{the passenger}}s escaped without injury except one, who had his hand jammed between broken timbers. Unfortunately, a man named Henry Johnston, a dyer from Warwick on Eden, was on the staithes, {{and did not have}} time {{to get out of the}} way. He was fatally injured and died the next morning. Two boys, named Matthew Potts and John Kelsay, aged 14 and 16, had apparently stowed away in the <b>horse</b> <b>wagon</b> and were found crushed to death underneath the wagon that had fallen upon it. It was reported that the head of John Kelsay, [...] "...was crushed quite flat, and presented a frightful spectacle".|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1860s the St. Paul and Sioux City Railroad laid a track along Minneopa Creek. At {{this time the}} {{property}} around the falls was owned by D.C. Evans, also owner of the biggest interest in South Bend. The railroad opted not to build a train station in South Bend due to its proximity to Mankato, so Evans convinced them to build a station at the falls. Evans built bridges and stairs into the gorge. The agent at the train depot, J.B. Hodge, made great efforts to promote Minneopa Falls. He convinced the railroad company to advertise the destination and to offer four trains daily from Mankato in summer at a discount rate. Group excursions as large as 5,000 people came from Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Winona, along with closer towns. Visitors arrived by <b>horse,</b> <b>wagon,</b> and paddle steamer as well as train.|$|E
50|$|The New York and Harlem Railroad {{built their}} main line through Amenia between 1848 and 1852. When {{the station was}} built, it {{contained}} a freight platform, a telegraph office, Railway Express Agency office, and various spurs used for loading and unloading <b>horse</b> <b>wagons</b> in the 19th century, and later trucks in the 20th century.|$|R
