5|$|In Lillesand, the {{right-of-way}} {{has been}} converted to a road around the city center, although parts have been converted to a pedestrian path. Other parts have been reverted to agricultural land. From Storemyr, the route went through a forest, and has become an overgrown <b>forestry</b> <b>road.</b> From Eikeland to Tveite, the line {{has been converted}} to a hiking trail. At Birkleland, there are few remains of the line, although when leaving the village, part of the line {{is used as a}} pathway. Further along, the route is disused, but fenced in. The station buildings at Tveite and Flaksvand have been kept, the building at Lillesand has been preserved, while the station at Birkeland was dismounted because it was {{in the way of a}} new road.|$|E
5|$|SR40 was {{assigned}} to the highway from Folkston to St. Marys via Kingsland by 1920. However, the route from Folkston to what became US17/SR25 in Kingsland was not marked on maps between 1921 and January 1932. The highway that was to become SR40 followed most of its present alignment from Folkston to the Charlton–Camden county line in 1919 but had a significantly different route in western Camden County, following what are now Colerain Road, <b>Forestry</b> <b>Road,</b> Marr Cemetery Road, Oakhill Church Road, Willies Loop, Old Folkston Road, Arizona Avenue, and several sections of abandoned highway. East of Kingsland, the highway followed most of its present alignment but crossed the parallel railroad several times.|$|E
25|$|The route {{recommended}} {{was similar}} to the 1985 proposal. The line would have traveled across the Kaingaroa Plains and followed the route more or less presently taken by the private <b>forestry</b> <b>road,</b> High Level Road. Stage one of the proposal would terminate at the junction between the two private forestry roads, High Level Road and the Off-Highway road leading from the Taupo Mill, near the State Highway 5 Napier-Taupo road. A recommendation was made that a log-processing yard be built at the junction of these two roads in conjunction with the rail line extension from Murupara.|$|E

25|$|More {{recently}} {{two locations}} in mid Wales {{have been selected}} to globally define stages of the Silurian period. Cefn-cerig Road near Cefn-cerig Farm, Llandovery, is {{the location of the}} Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) which marks the boundary between the Aeronian and Telychian stages of the Silurian period on the geologic time scale. Similarly Trefawr Track, a <b>forestry</b> <b>road</b> north of Cwm-coed-aeron Farm, Llandovery, is the location of the GSSP marking the boundary between the Rhuddanian and Aeronian stages. Both GSSPs were ratified in 1984. :See main articles on Cefn-cerig Road and Trefawr Track.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} terminus of {{the statutory}} railway was Abergynolwyn, beyond which the railway continued as a [...] long mineral extension, now converted for passenger use. The extension was originally sharply curved, as the line turns south east into the steeply sided Nant Gwernol gorge but these curves were eased when conversion for passenger use {{took place in}} 1976. The whole section is within woods, now owned by the Forestry Commission. Shortly after crossing over the <b>forestry</b> <b>road</b> the line reaches Ty Dwr, where the original locomotive shed stood from 1865 until it was demolished after Pendre works opened in 1867, although the slate water tower continued in use into the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|The route {{begins at}} Olsen Mine Road and travels east-northeast through thick boreal forest. It meets a <b>forestry</b> <b>road</b> and Main Street towards Madsen. The highway passes north of Faulkenham Lake and travels {{parallel}} to a high-tension power line. Continuing northeast, Highway618 zig-zags through the forest, then enters Red Lake, {{where it is}} also known as Howey Street. The route shares its eastern terminus with the northern terminus of Highway105 ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{ecological}} concern {{affecting the}} island is the illegal felling of timber by local inhabitants.

50|$|In Holmestrand, the {{locomotive}} shed {{is still in}} use, although urban growth has removed all other remains of the line. The right-of-way out of town {{is used as a}} suburban street. The tunnel has fallen into disuse, but from there the right-of-way is used as a trail. Towards Hillestad the railway ran in agricultural land, which has been reclaimed. The last few kilometers towards Hillestad, the route is used as a <b>forestry</b> <b>road.</b> From Hof, the right-of-way is gone, but along the last section down to Hvittingfoss, the right-of-way remains as a <b>forestry</b> <b>road.</b> The station and freight house have been preserved.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{environmental impacts}} of tourism and recreation activities in the world heritage listed rainforests of northeast Australia and presents management strategies for sustainable visitor use of the protected area. Tropical rainforests are characterised by their low resistance and moderate to high resilience to impacts associated with human visitation. Visitor use in the World Heritage Area is mostly associated with walking tracks, camping areas, day use areas and off-road vehicle use of old <b>forestry</b> <b>roads</b> and tracks. Adverse environmental impacts range from vegetation trampling, soil compaction, water contamination and soil erosion at the local scale through to spread of weeds, feral animals and soil pathogens along extensive networks of old <b>forestry</b> <b>roads</b> and tracks at the regional scale. Concentration of visitor use is the most desirable management strategy for controlling adverse impacts at most World Heritage Area visitor nodes and sites, and includes methods such as site hardening and shielding to contain impacts. For dispersed visitor activities, such as off-road vehicle driving and long-distance walking, application of best practice methods by the tourist industry and recreational users such as removal of mud and soils from vehicle tyres and hiking boots before entering pathogen-free catchments, together with seasonal closure of roads and tracks, are the preferred management strategies. Retention of canopy cover at camping areas and day use areas, as well as along walking tracks and <b>forestry</b> <b>roads</b> is a simple, yet effective, management strategy for reduction {{of a range of}} adverse impacts, including dispersal of weeds and feral animals, edge effects, soil erosion and nutrient loss, road kill and linear barrier effects on rainforest fauna...|$|R
