Current is driven through a Au <b>heater</b> <b>layer</b> electrically isolated from a bilayer consisting of Fe$_ 3 $O$_ 4 $ (insulating ferrimagnet) and a spin detector layer. It is shown that through this method {{it is possible}} to measure the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (SSE) for small area magnetic devices, equivalent to traditional macroscopic SSE experiments. Using a lock-in detection technique {{it is possible to}} more sensitively characterize both the SSE and the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), as well as the inverse spin Hall effect in various spin detector materials. By using the spin detector layer as a thermometer, we can obtain a value for the temperature gradient across the device. These results are well matched to values obtained through electromagnetic/thermal modeling of the device structure and with large area spin Seebeck measurements...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a concept for the wafer-scale manufacturing of microactuators {{based on the}} adhesive bonding of bulk shape-memory-alloy (SMA) sheets to silicon microstructures. Wafer-scale integration of a cold-state deformation mechanism {{is provided by the}} deposition of stressed films onto the SMA sheet. A concept for heating of the SMA by Joule heating through a resistive <b>heater</b> <b>layer</b> is presented. Critical fabrication issues were investigated, including the cold-state deformation, the bonding scheme and related stresses, and the titanium-nickel (TiNi) sheet patterning. Novel methods for the transfer stamping of adhesive and for the handling of the thin TiNi sheets were developed, based on the use of standard dicing blue tape. First demonstrator TiNi cantilevers, wafer-level adhesively bonded on a microstructured silicon substrate, were successfully fabricated and evaluated. Intrinsically stressed silicon dioxide and silicon nitride were deposited using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition to deform the cantilevers in the cold state. Tip deflections for 2. 5 -mm-long cantilevers in cold/hot state of 250 / 70 and 125 / 28 mu m were obtained using silicon dioxide and silicon nitride, respectively. The bond strength proved to be stronger than the force created by the 2. 5 -mm-long TiNi cantilever and showed no degradation after more than 700 temperature cycles. The shape-memory behavior of the TiNi is maintained during the integration process. QC 20100727 </p...|$|E
30|$|Micro gas sensors with micro-platforms, which {{consist of}} micro heaters and sensing {{electrodes}} on the membranes, have been actively researched, {{due to the}} possibility to miniaturize sensors and reduce power consumptions [1 – 4]. Micro heaters are necessary for elevated temperatures to operate micro gas sensors [5], because most of gas sensors need thermal energy to react gases [6, 7]. However, usually, {{it is hard to}} measure and control accurate temperatures of micro gas sensors with input powers to increase temperatures of micro heaters. In general, {{there are two kinds of}} measurement methods of temperature of micro heaters. One is contact type method such as thermocouples, negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors and Pt resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), and so on. The other is non-contact type method such as IR cameras. Even though many researchers have measured the temperatures of micro gas sensors by IR cameras, there are some still problems in terms of measurement errors by setting the incorrect emissivity and not enough precision due to the resolution of the cameras [8]. For instance, temperature measurement of the same device is remarkably changed with variations of emissivity. The measured temperature is highly dependent on emissivity of materials. The reason why it is difficult to determine the exact emissivity of IR camera is that other materials exist surrounding micro <b>heater</b> <b>layer</b> in the micro gas sensor as reported in [8, 9] and the emissivity is affected by not only the kinds of materials but also morphologies of surfaces and shapes of materials [10]. Also, it is not possible to measure the operating temperature of packaged micro gas sensors using by IR cameras. In the case of the contact type of temperature sensors, it is also hard to measure the operating temperature of micro gas sensors with membranes due to the fracture problem from fragile structures of membranes and thermal conductivity problem between the micro heaters and contact type temperature sensors. So, special micro temperature sensors are needed.|$|E
30|$|The {{raw data}} {{collected}} with the Point Grey camera are 12  bit 1920 [*]×[*] 1200  pixel images. The first correction {{that must be}} applied to such images is for dark current and flat field. Dark current is the signal recorded {{in the absence of}} X-rays. We typically take multiple 5  s exposures to obtain an average dark current. The flat field is the image that is measured with the X-rays on, but without a sample in the beam. The non-uniformity in the flat field includes effects of non-uniformities in the incident X-ray beam and non-uniform responses of the scintillator and the imaging detector. In ambient tomography, the sample is surrounded by nothing except for air. In HPXMT, the sample is surrounded by a capsule, a <b>heater,</b> and <b>layers</b> of pressure medium, plus the containment ring. In order to maximize pixel coverage on the sample for better spatial resolution, we use the pressure medium as the intensity background instead of air. Flat field images are taken through a dummy cell assembly, which has identical pressure medium to the true sample assembly, but with the sample removed. In practice, the dummy is mounted ~ 20  mm away from the high-pressure assembly; flat field images are taken by driving the hydraulic press so that the dummy is in the X-ray path.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} micro gas sensor for {{measuring}} H 2 S gas. This {{is based on}} a SnO 2 -CuO multi-layer thin film. Thesensor has a silicon diaphragm, micro <b>heater,</b> and sensing <b>layers.</b> The micro <b>heater</b> is embedded in the sensing layerin order to increase the temperature to an operating temperature. The SnO 2 -CuO multi layer film is prepared by thealternating deposition method and thermal oxidation which uses an electron beam evaporator and a thermal furnace. To determine the effect of the number of layers, five sets of films are prepared, each with different number of layers. The sensitivities are measured by applying H 2 S gas. It has a concentration of 1 ppm at an operating temperature of 270 ℃. At the same total thickness, the sensitivity of the sensor with multi sensing layers was improved, compared to thesensor with one sensing layer.

30|$|Boiling with nanofluids enables certain {{properties}} {{to be adjusted}} by varying the nanoparticle concentration or nanoparticle material, such as the thermal conductivity of the working fluid and the surface wettability of the heater surface. The benefit of less pumping power required for the same heat transfer, compared to just using the base liquid, is also applicable. Nanofluid boiling also results in a build-up of a porous layer of nanoparticles on the <b>heater</b> surface. This <b>layer</b> {{has been shown to}} significantly improve the surface wettability; see Figure 6 where the measured changes in the static contact angle on the nanofluid-boiled surfaces compared with the pure-water-boiled surfaces are shown. It is hypothesised that this surface wettability improvement may be responsible for the CHF enhancement observed by almost all of the researchers so far. However, this nanoparticle layer is also considered by some researchers to be also responsible for the deterioration found in the BHT coefficient. Since the nanoparticle deposit creates a resistance in the heat transfer from the heater surface to the fluid, caused by a decrease in the contact angle, and/or produces a reduction in the nucleation site density. The heat transfer mechanisms responsible for the CHF and BHT enhancements and/or deteriorations have not been fully comprehended.|$|R
40|$|Compressive hold-time {{low-cycle fatigue}} {{is one of}} the {{important}} damage modes in Ni-based superalloy hot-gas path components. In strain controlled LCF, the compressive hold typically degrades fatigue life significantly due to creep relaxation and the resultant generation of tensile stress upon returning to zero strain. Crack initiation typically occurs on the surface, and therefore, the cracks are covered with layers of oxides. Recent finite element modeling based on experimental observations has indicated that the in-plane compressive stress in the alumina layer formed {{on the surface of the}} bond coat assists rumpling and, eventually, leads to initiation of cracks. The stress in the oxide layer continues to assist crack extension by pushing the alumina layer along the crack front during the compressive hold. In-situ measurements of the growth strains of alumina were performed using high energy synchrotron X-rays at Argonne National Lab. Specimens of single-crystal superalloys with and without aluminide coatings were statically pre-oxidized to form a layer of alumina at 1093 and 982 [*]∘C. For the in-situ synchrotron measurements, the specimens were heated up to the pre-oxidation temperatures with a <b>heater.</b> The alumina <b>layers</b> on both bare and coated specimens show compressive in-plane strains at both temperatures. The oxide strains on the superalloys showed dependency on temperature; on the other hand, the oxide strains in the aluminide coatings were insensitive to temperature. The magnitude of the compressive strains was larger on the superalloys than the ones on the aluminide coatings...|$|R
40|$|A new microfluidic-based {{approach}} to measuring liquid thermal conductivity is developed {{to address the}} requirement in many practical applications for measurements using small (microlitre) sample size and integration into a compact device. The approach also gives the possibility of high throughput testing. A resistance heater and temperature sensor are incorporated into a glass microfluidic chip to allow transmission and detection of a planar thermal wave crossing {{a thin layer of}} the sample. The device is designed so that heat transfer is locally one-dimensional during a short initial time period. This allows the detected temperature transient to be separated into two distinct components: a short-time, purely one-dimensional part from which sample thermal conductivity can be determined and a remaining long-time part containing the effects of three-dimensionality and of the finite size of surrounding thermal reservoirs. Identification of the one-dimensional component yields a steady temperature difference from which sample thermal conductivity can be determined. Calibration is required to give correct representation of changing <b>heater</b> resistance, system <b>layer</b> thicknesses and solid material thermal conductivities with temperature. In this preliminary study, methanol/water mixtures are measured at atmospheric pressure over the temperature range 30 to 50 °C. The results show that the device has produced a measurement accuracy of within 2. 5 % over the range of thermal conductivity and temperature of the tests. A relation between measurement uncertainty and the geometric and thermal properties of the system is derived and this is used to identify ways that error could be further reduced...|$|R
40|$|A smart fabric with {{increased}} insulating properties Marina Michalak and Izabella Krucińska A new textile fabric prototype providing more heat insulation composed of shape-memory elements was investigated. The shape-memory {{elements in the}} form of spirals characterized by two-way action were made of nitinol (NiTi) one-way wires with the inner state transition temperature of 35 C. The fabric prototype developed was made of three layers of nonwovens manufactured from the blends of flax and steel fibers and the two interlayers included spirals, made from NiTi or a reference copper (Cu) wire. The inner <b>layer</b> (<b>heater)</b> was heated by electrical current. The external prototype layers imitated the fabric. Mirrors and an infrared camera were used to measure the thermal properties. The tempera-ture of the external surfaces was analyzed as a function of heating time. At approximately 35 C, a change in the curve of the dependence of temperature on the heating time of the prototype with NiTi elements could be observed; the rate of the temperature increase began to decrease. The width of the interlayer with air and NiTi elements increases by approximately 2. 5 mm during heating. The observed phenomenon is caused by the expansion of the NiTi spirals and did not occur with the prototype composed of non-active reference Cu elements. In the final second of heating, the temperature on the external surface of the prototype with NiTi elements was lower by 2 – 3 C than that on the prototype with Cu elements. A theoretical model of the system was developed and a satisfactory agreement between the experimental and theoretical results was obtained. Keyword...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{employment}} of monocrystalline silicon in microsystems as an active material for different thermal functions, such as heat generation and heat transfer by conduction. In chapter 1 applications that need thermal micro devices, micro heaters and micro heat exchangers, are briefly introduced. The shortcomings of commonly used materials are listed, and monocrystalline silicon is identified as an appropriate choice for several thermal micro devices. Chapter 2 briefly presents the basic theory on resistive heating and heat transfer (by conduction, convection and radiation) and how {{they relate to the}} devices and structures presented in the following chapters. Chapter 3 summarizes the temperature dependence of the electrical and thermal properties of monocrystalline silicon in a wide temperature range. Thermal conductivity of silicon places silicon among good thermal conductors at room temperature and even better at cryogenic temperatures. In spite of the declining value of thermal conductivity at higher temperatures, silicon is still among the better thermal conductors compared to other materials typically employed in microsystem fabrication. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity is in chapter 3 both derived theoretically and confirmed experimentally on specially prepared samples that used differently-doped silicon layers of the same thickness. Electrical resistivity of silicon first increases with temperature, and after reaching the peak value (at so-called intrinsic temperature) it decreases with further temperature increase. This intrinsic temperature is also dependent on the doping level. Such doped silicon layers can be employed in sensors and specifically in heaters with sensing capability. Chapter 4 introduces a micro-hotplate heater capable of reaching temperatures up to 800 °C. The used materials are epitaxial Si for the <b>heater</b> and TiSi/TiN <b>layer</b> stack for the interconnects, which provides compatibility with CMOS technology. Differently doped silicon layers of different thicknesses were released by bulk micromachining to fabricate free-standing structures. The temperature dependent resistance of silicon was used for temperature monitoring. A silicon-based micro-evaporator is introduced in chapter 5. This is a cooling device intended for dealing with high heat fluxes caused by intensive local heating (e. g. by electrical power dissipation or exothermal chemical reaction). The aim of this micro-evaporator is to achieve a maximum cooling capacity and operation stability at very small liquid flow rates (in the order of 1 - 5 ml/h). Four different proposed fin-channel structures, with high aspect ratio channels (10 µm and 20 µm wide, 100 µm deep) are sealed with silicon or glass by wafer bonding and tested with de-ionized water as coolant. Silicon fins enhance the heat transfer to the coolant. The embedded bulk silicon heater mimics external heat sources and, at the same time, acts as temperature sensor. Measured absorbed power fluxes were up to 3 W (which corresponds to 40 W/cm 2 for a heater footprint of 2. 7 mm × 2. 7 mm), for a fluid flow of 5 ml/h. Optimizations of the fin-channel structure and removing material by etching a cavity for thermal insulation led to a more stable operation in a broader range of set-point conditions. Chapter 6 presents a miniaturized resistojet thruster device with an integrated thin-film heater, capable of delivering thrusts in the micronewton–millinewton range. Such devices can be applied for fine attitude control of nano-satellites. Miniaturized resistojet comprises a microchannel (width: 50 µm, height: 150 µm, length: 2 cm) and a nozzle throat narrowed to 10 µm. Both channel and the nozzle were etched in silicon and sealed by anodic bonding to glass. In this device, silicon acts as a heat spreader from the integrated aluminum heater to the propellant flow inside the etched microchannel, to reduce propellant consumption. Based on the pressure measurements, calculated thrust is in 20 - 960 µN range, which complies with the desired range, and a 30 % reduction of propellant consumption is observed when propellant flow is heated from room temperature to 350 °C. Reducing the propellant consumption is essential as the propellant storage mass and volume are very limited on-board. Finally, concluding remarks are given in chapter 7, together with recommendations for further research.
