25|$|The coke must {{be strong}} enough to resist the weight of {{overburden}} in the blast furnace, which is why coking coal is so important in making steel using the conventional route. However, the alternative route is <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>iron,</b> where any carbonaceous fuel {{can be used to make}} sponge or pelletised iron. Coke from coal is grey, hard, and porous and has a heating value of 24.8 million Btu/ton (29.6 MJ/kg). Some cokemaking processes produce valuable byproducts, including coal tar, ammonia, light oils, and coal gas.|$|E

5000|$|Electric {{arc furnace}} {{steelmaking}} is {{the manufacture of}} steel from scrap or <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> melted by electric arcs. In an electric arc furnace, a batch of steel ("heat") may be started by loading scrap or <b>direct</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> into the furnace, sometimes with a [...] "hot heel" [...] (molten steel from a previous heat). Gas burners {{may be used to}} assist with the melt down of the scrap pile in the furnace. As in basic oxygen steelmaking, fluxes are also added to protect the lining of the vessel and help improve the removal of impurities. Electric arc furnace steelmaking typically uses furnaces of capacity around 100 tonnes that produce steel every 40 to 50 minutes for further processing.|$|E

40|$|Sodium iron ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (NaFeEDTA) {{has been}} {{recommended}} for food fortification programmes to improve iron status but its performance in commercial products {{has not been}} evaluated. The effect of EDTA on iron absorption from fortified cornflakes, given {{as part of a}} typical Western breakfast, was determined in a double-blind randomised study with 20 non-anaemic female volunteers, using experimentally prepared iron compounds, enriched with 58 Fe, and faecal monitoring. Five meals were compared: hydrogen <b>reduced</b> <b>iron,</b> hydrogen <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> plus Na 2 EDTA (molar ratio EDTA:Fe 1 : 2), hydrogen <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> plus NaFe(III) EDTA at two different molar ratios (EDTA:total Fe 1 : 3 and 1 : 2), and hydrogen <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> plus 15 mg ascorbic acid (ascorbic acid:Fe 1. 3 : 1). The iron and EDTA compounds were accurately weighed into gelatine capsules and taken with unfortified cornflakes, semi-skimmed milk and tea on two consecutive days; the iron dose per meal was 3. 75 mg. Iron absorption from all five test meals was measured in each volunteer with a minimum wash-out period of 2 weeks between tests. Geometric mean iron absorption (%) from the 5 tests was 14. 1, 17. 6, 20. 6, 24. 4 and 17. 5 respectively (equivalent to 0. 5 – 0. 9 mg absorbed iron). There was a significantly higher iron absorption from the mixture of <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> and NaFe(III) EDTA (EDTA:Fe 1 : 2) than from <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> alone (p = 0. 014). It is not known whether the higher absorption was from <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> or NaFeEDTA or both. Absorption was not increased significantly with NaFe(III) EDTA (EDTA:Fe 1 : 3), Na 2 EDTA (EDTA:Fe 1 : 2) or ascorbic acid (15 mg) ...|$|R

40|$|Coal-based {{reduction}} {{followed by}} magnetic separation {{is an effective}} way to recover iron from high phosphorus-containing oolitic hematite ore. Given that high quantities of dephosphorization agent are needed to obtain low phosphorus <b>reduced</b> <b>iron,</b> a novel approach is proposed by the authors. Without prior phosphorus removal, the phosphorus was enriched in the <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> during a reduction process, then high-phosphorus <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> was refined to low phosphorus molten iron and high phosphorus dephosphorization slag {{to be used as a}} phosphate fertilizer. The influences of various parameters, including the reduction temperature, the reduction time, and the C/O molar ratio, on the reaction behavior of phosphorus during reduction process were studied. Experimental results indicate that a higher reduction temperature, a longer reduction time, or a higher C/O molar ratio was favorable for the reduction of apatite to phosphorus and the enrichment of phosphorus in <b>reduced</b> <b>iron.</b> X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis demonstrated that the apatite was reduced to phosphorus and Ca 2 SiO 4 (or Ca(Al 2 Si 2 O 8)) in the presence of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3, whilst the phosphorus enriched in <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> formed Fe 3 P. The migration behavior of phosphorus was investigated using line scanning analysis of reduction products at different reduction times. The results show that the phosphorus primarily existed in the slag phase 10 min before reduction, and a large amount of phosphorus migrated into iron phase from slag phase with a reduction time of 40 min. The phosphorus content in the iron phase only slightly changed after 50 min. The pre-dephosphorization of <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> was performed at 1873 K, indicating a higher basicity or FetO content of CaO-based slag was beneficial to dephosphorization of the <b>reduced</b> <b>iron...</b>|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThe aim {{of my work}} is to {{elucidate}} the interactions between microbes and minerals. The work I present here describes studies I have done investigating factors that can influence the identity of <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> oxide minerals.; There {{is no doubt that}} microbes {{play an important role in}} the redox cycling of iron oxides in soils and sediments. The microbially mediated reduction of iron oxides can lead to the remobilization of iron as well as the formation of <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> minerals. Beyond acting as a source of Fe 2 +, the bacteria themselves are thought not to play a role with respect to the nature of the resulting <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> minerals. Several factors, such as the carbon substrate used for energy, the strain of bacteria used in experiments and the rates at which the bacteria <b>reduced</b> <b>iron,</b> were investigated under laboratory conditions to determine their importance in iron mineral formation.; Shewanella putrefaciens CN 32, Shewanella putrefaciens W 3 - 18 - 1 and Shewanella oneidensis MR- 4 all produced magnetite when given lactate as the carbon source. However, they differed in the amount of magnetite each produced. Strain W 3 - 18 - 1 also produced a mixture of magnetite and iron carbonate hydroxide, although most of the <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> remained in an amorphous phase. When strain W 3 - 18 - 1 was given pyruvate, the major biomineral was siderite, while incubations with uridine produced pure iron carbonate hydroxide. Although the bacteria <b>reduced</b> <b>iron</b> at comparable rates, the products of this reduction were all quite different, suggesting that rate, while important, is not the primary determinant in what phases of iron minerals will be produced in laboratory studies.; The results presented here suggest that chemistry appears to be the important factor in determining the identity of the resultant iron minerals. However, the chemistry itself was extensively altered by the metabolic activity of the bacteria, making them much instrumental to iron mineral formation than merely acting as a source of <b>reduced</b> <b>iron...</b>|$|R
