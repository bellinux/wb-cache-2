40|$|The report {{begins by}} {{describing}} the decision-making culture {{and traditions of}} public consultation and public involvement in Norway, which have traditionally been stronger at the municipal level. It also {{provides an overview of}} the legislative framework and institutions for public involvement in policy-making. Norway’s long-established “Ombudsman ” institution is described as an important means for citizens seeking ex post redress – but as having limited impact on the degree of citizen involvement in the decision-making process. The potential role of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) is reviewed in the light of Norway’s “Electronic Government Action Plan ” and high levels of public access to Internet in homes, at work, in schools and public libraries. The report goes on to review the introduction and evolution of the use of consensus conferences in Norway, as well as their evaluation. The specific case of the 1996 consensus conference on genetically modified food is described in terms of its organisation, process and results. The key findings of the <b>independent</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>report</b> on the consensus conference, issued in 1997, are presented and the evaluation criteria reviewed.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS) [...] which consists of two kinds of motorized vehicles, a 120 -mm mortar, an ammunition trailer, and fire direction equipment [...] is being developed to meet the United States Marine Corps' need for a weapon system that can be carried inside the MV- 22 Osprey to support assault operations. The Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA), the independent test agency for the Marines, conducted initial operational testing and evaluation of the EFSS from May to July 2007, and reported in September 2007, among other things, that it experienced several safety, performance, reliability, and mechanical problems. We briefed Congress on these and other {{issues related to the}} EFSS in September 2007. Subsequently, at congressional request, the Marine Corps delayed full-rate production of the EFSS until after GAO reported on the system. In December 2007, we issued our report, which described the system's safety, performance, reliability, and mechanical problems. MCOTEA retested the system in February and March 2008, focusing on determining whether the problems identified in 2007 were resolved. It reported its analysis of the test results in May 2008. In October 2008, Congress asked us to provide Congress with a brief assessment of the Marine Corps' conclusions regarding whether the concerns we reported have been addressed. To do so, we reviewed MCOTEA's May 2008 <b>Independent</b> <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Report</b> from the EFSS' Follow-on Operational Test and Evaluation as well as documentation of the system's insensitive munition certification, and compared the results with the concerns we reported in 2007.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the key findings {{from three different}} perspectives of a unique child and young people -centred initiative – aimed at empowering {{children and young people}} living in Dublin’s North East Inner City, using a restorative practice approach. This initiative has been funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and delivered through the Early Learning Initiative, at the National College of Ireland. Adopting children’s rights perspectives, with particular emphasis on children and young people’s right to have a voice in decision-making in their community, the Brighter Futures Initiative aims to encourage the children and young people in the North East Inner City, to voice their opinions about their community, to devise effective policies relating to the future of their community, and to become active and responsible citizens (Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014, p. 31). The report, ‘Building Hope for Brighter Futures’, is divided into three sections. The first segment contains a report written by the participating children and young people. It contains their views on what is working well for them in their communities, some of the real difficulties and problems they face, and what their hopes are for the future, {{in order to make the}} North East Inner City not only a safe place to live, but one of the best places to grow up in. The second segment contains an <b>independent</b> <b>evaluation</b> <b>report</b> undertaken by Dr. Derick Wilson, Emeritus Reader in Education (Community Relations & Restorative Practices) at the University of Ulster. Dr. Wilson has experience in both restorative practice and community relations research, and has developed action research programmes promoting public policy and learning organisation cultures supportive of a more shared society. The third segment contains the Early Learning Initiative’s (ELI) own findings. This portion is evaluated by means of assessing programme implementation and through a study of the programme’s impact on participants’ lives – in terms of emotional literacy, self-efficacy, self-esteem, sense of community and conflict resolution capacity development. In respect of the children and young people, this report clearly demonstrates that they want their voices to be heard by adults, both locally and at policy level, in particular they want the ‘important people’ to hear their story. Their story contains their unique perspectives, expertise and knowledge related to their community. Highlighted within are the positives in the community, especially the community spirit and mutual respect among community members. Also mentioned are their concerns about drug problems, homelessness and recent violent incidences in the area. Young people also acknowledged the impact of restorative practices and restortive approaches on their lives. Furthermore, young people have articulated that through restorative practice education and training they are acquiring the skills and aptitude to manage and resolve conflicts, alongside improving their self-efficacy, self-esteem and sense of community...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{computational}} microRNA target prediction {{tools are}} focused on several key features, including complementarity to 5 'seed of miRNAs and evolutionary conservation. While these features allow for successful target identification, not all miRNA target sites are conserved and adhere to canonical seed complementarity. Several studies have propagated the use of energy features of mRNA:miRNA duplexes as an alternative feature. However, different <b>independent</b> <b>evaluations</b> <b>reported</b> conflicting results on the reliability of energy-based predictions. Here, we reassess the usefulness of energy features for mammalian target prediction, aiming to relax or {{eliminate the need for}} perfect seed matches and conservation requirement. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We detect significant differences of energy features at experimentally supported human miRNA target sites and at genome-wide sites of AGO protein interaction. This trend is confirmed on datasets that assay the effect of miRNAs on mRNA and protein expression changes, and a simple linear regression model leads to significant correlation of predicted versus observed expression change. Compared to 6 -mer seed matches as baseline, application of our energy-based model leads to ∼ 3 - 5 -fold enrichment on highly down-regulated targets, and allows for prediction of strictly imperfect targets with enrichment above baseline. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, our results indicate significant promise for energy-based miRNA target prediction that includes a broader range of targets without having to use conservation or impose stringent seed match rules...|$|R

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{are small}} RNAs that have {{important}} roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation {{in a wide range}} of species. This regulation is controlled by having miRNAs directly bind to a target messenger RNA (mRNA), causing it to be destabilized and degraded, or translationally repressed. Identifying miRNA targets has been a large area of focus for study; however, a lack of generally high-throughput experiments to validate direct miRNA targeting has been a limiting factor. To overcome these limitations, computational methods have become crucial for understanding and predicting miRNA-gene target interactions. While a variety of computational tools exist for predicting miRNA targets, many of them are focused on a similar feature set for their prediction. These commonly used features are complementarity to 5 'seed of miRNAs and evolutionary conservation. Unfortunately, not all miRNA target sites are conserved or adhere to canonical seed complementarity. Seeking to address these limitations, several studies have included energy features of mRNA:miRNA duplex formation as alternative features. However, different <b>independent</b> <b>evaluations</b> <b>reported</b> conflicting results on the reliability of energy-based predictions. Here, we reassess the usefulness of energy features for mammalian target prediction, aiming to relax or eliminate the need for perfect seed matches and conservation requirement. We detect significant differences of energy features at experimentally supported human miRNA target sites and at genome-wide interaction sites to Argonaute (AGO) protein family members, which are essential parts of the miRNA machinery complex. This trend is confirmed on data sets that assay the effect of miRNAs on mRNA and protein expression changes, where a statistically significant change in expression is noted when compared to the control. Furthermore, our method also allows for prediction of strictly imperfect sites, as well as non-conserved targets. Recently, new methods for identifying direct miRNA binding have been developed, which provides us with additional sources of information for miRNA target prediction. While some computational target predictions tools have begun to incorporate this information, they still rely on the presence of a seed match in the AGO-bound windows without accounting for the possibility of variations. We investigate the usefulness of the site level direct binding evidence in miRNA target identification and propose a model that incorporates multiple different features along with the AGO-interaction data. Our method outperforms both an ad hoc strategy of seed match searches as well as an existing target prediction tool, while still allowing for predictions of sites other than a long perfect seed match. Additionally, we show supporting evidence for a class of non-canonical sites as bound targets. Our model can be extended to predict additional types of imperfect sites, and can also be readily modified to include additional features that may produce additional improvements. Dissertatio...|$|R
