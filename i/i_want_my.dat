25|$|I guess I {{just wanted}} this album to {{be a lot}} about me and all the {{different}} styles of music that I like – not just one sort of style or genre. I really {{want to be able to}} tell real stories through my music, rather than talking about stuff that doesn’t really matter which is what a lot of people seem to end up doing these days. I don’t want it to be just glossy and disposable; <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>my</b> songs to deal with real issues.|$|E

The first verse {{of the song}} begins with Beyoncé reminiscing about the times she and her father/manager, Mathew Knowles shared {{as a child and}} through her adolescence. She sings about wanting to be with a man and a child who has similar qualities as her father.

[...] According to Marc Anthony Neal of the PopMatters, Beyoncé also confidently embraces her womanhood in the song. In a way, Beyoncé pays tribute to her father through this song.|$|E

500|$|Rundgren {{points out}} that [...] "the themes of the songs were darker." [...] The second track, [...] "Life is a Lemon and <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>My</b> Money Back", {{demonstrates}} this pessimism. Several things are identified as [...] "defective", including love, sex, gods, childhood and the future. AllMusic labels it [...] "a stomping rocker that wraps serious feelings in a cryptically witty metaphor." [...] Despite the pessimism, both AllMusic and Meat Loaf point out that [...] "it is a funny song." ...|$|E

[...] Prior to the Fragility tour in 2000, Reznor reflected that [...] "I’ve adopted {{a philosophy of}} the way to present Nine Inch Nails live that incorporates a theatrical element. I want it to be drama. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>my</b> rock stars to be larger than life, you know? The Kurt Cobains of the world, I’m sick of that shit. I don’t want a gas station attendant being my hero. I grew up with Gene Simmons. I grew up with Ziggy Stardust." ...|$|E

500|$|The comic's story also {{received}} positive reactions. Following the Nerds Bowling called it [...] "extremely well-written", commending {{its ability to}} attract readers and make them empathize with the characters. Paltridge of PopGeeks declared the story [...] "even better" [...] than Druckmann's work on The Last of Us (2013). Ellner of The Pullbox praised the story, noting a particular connection with the character of Johnny early in the story. Lopez of Fanboy Comics found that the [...] "character complexity is a bit lacking", but felt that the pacing {{of the story is}} helpful in understanding plot points. Doreen Sheridan, writing for <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>My</b> Two Dollars!, felt that the [...] "dialogue is a little clunky, but it's a satisfying read nonetheless".

500|$|Lyrically, André 3000 and Big Boi {{abandon the}} [...] "hard-partying playa characters" [...] of their debut album {{in favor of}} more spacey, funky, and futuristic personas on ATLiens.

[...] Many songs on ATLiens feature more unconventional subject matter for hip hop. [...] The lyrical content ranges from addressing urban life as hustlers and pimps to extraterrestrial life and space travel. The title track's chorus expresses Southern pride, while its verses feature André 3000 explaining his newly adopted drug-free lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|Dean Piper for the Daily Mirror {{called the}} song [...] "fantastic" [...] {{claiming}} that Roberts [...] "means business with her debut solo material", and saying {{he could not}} [...] "get enough of the single", calling it [...] "classic pop, fresh and fantastic." [...] Michael Cragg for The Guardian compared the chanting chorus to that of Justice vs. Simian's track, [...] "We Are Your Friends". He called it both [...] "ridiculously cool and a bit naff". In response to the general acclaim from critics, Roberts wished that the track would be well received amongst her peers, saying [...] "I haven't seen one bad review from the single or album samplers – it seems {{too good to be}} true. The response from critics has been amazing. It's like being at school and being told ‘well done’ by the teachers but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>my</b> classmates to like it too. I want the people at home to get something from the record. Then I'll be doubly happy." ...|$|E

500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer. Among some officers' later recounting of the speech, bullshit would be replaced by baloney and fucking by fornicating. At least one account replaced [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the balls" [...] with [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the nose." [...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known {{that the two men}} were polar opposites in personality, and there is considerable evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>my</b> men to remember something important, to really make it stick, I give it to them double dirty. It may not sound nice to a bunch of little old ladies, at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You can't run an army without profanity, {{and it has to be}} eloquent profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight its way out of a piss-soaked paper bag." ...|$|E
