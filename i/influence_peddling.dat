5|$|Bernier {{went on to}} win his {{election}} in Beauce with 62% of the vote. Harper won re-election as prime-minister; he did not appoint Bernier to a cabinet position. Bernier would eventually return to the cabinet following the 2011 election, in which the Conservatives won a majority government, as Minister of State for Small Business and Tourism. Bernier continues to sit as an MP, and is currently a candidate for the Conservative Party leadership. Stemming from Couillard's actions during the entire affair, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) launched investigations on how she obtained the secret documents; on whether Couillard's mother was offered a patronage appointment by a Conservative Party official to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada; and on whether there was <b>influence</b> <b>peddling</b> during the land sale between the Kevlar Group and Public Works.|$|E
5|$|Democratic Montana Senator Burton K. Wheeler {{was on the}} {{investigating}} {{committee and}} {{assumed the role of}} prosecutor when hearings began on March 12, 1924. Jess Smith had engaged in <b>influence</b> <b>peddling</b> before his suicide, conspiring with two other Ohioans, Howard Mannington and Fred A. Caskey, to accept payoffs from alcohol bootleggers to secure either immunity from prosecution or the release of liquor from government warehouses. Mannington and Caskey's residence became infamous as the Little Green House on K Street. Some witnesses, such as Smith's divorced wife Roxy Stinson, and corrupt former FBI agent Gaston Means, alleged that Daugherty was personally involved. Coolidge requested Daugherty's resignation when the Attorney General indicated that he would not allow Wheeler's committee access to Justice Department records, and Daugherty complied on March 28, 1924.|$|E
5|$|As Attorney General, Dosanjh {{oversaw the}} {{resolution}} of the Gustafsen Lake Standoff involving the Secwepemc Nation, set up a database for registering violent offenders, established a hate crime division in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and lobbied for more police officers, probation officers, and judiciary. At the same time his office drew criticism for reducing legal aid and closing courthouses. As the Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, Human Rights and Immigration he successfully lobbied for laws giving same-sex couples the equal rights and responsibilities for child support, custody and access. In early 1999, a special prosecutor under the RCMP opened an investigation into possible <b>influence</b> <b>peddling</b> by Premier Glen Clark concerning casino licensing. On March 4, after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) raided the Premier's house, they briefed Attorney General Dosanjh, whose office had to assist, and placed him under a gag order. The order was lifted on August 13, he informed Clark, and called a press conference, after which Clark resigned as Premier. Dosanjh's actions were variously criticized for not informing his party caucus and not going public sooner, and applauded for avoiding perceptions of conflict of interest despite his power to intervene.|$|E

25|$|As {{the vast}} {{majority}} of Raytheon's revenues have been obtained from defense contracts, there has been a tight relationship of cooperation between itself and the U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. government departments and agencies (e.g. in the Fiscal Year 2007 the National Science Foundation awarded Raytheon $152 million in grants, more than to any other institution and organization in the country, for managing NSF South Pole Station). This, along with heavy lobbying, has led to perennial charges of <b>influence</b> <b>peddling.</b> Raytheon, for instance, contributed nearly a million dollars to various defense-related political campaigns in the presidential election year of 2004, spending much more than that on lobbying expenses. And there are many tight ties between the company and all levels of government.

500|$|On 7 April 1651, barely {{two months}} after he seized the reins of government, the Shunzhi Emperor issued an edict announcing that he would purge {{corruption}} from officialdom. This edict triggered factional conflicts among literati that would frustrate him until his death. One of his first gestures was to dismiss grand academician Feng Quan (馮銓; 1595–1672), a northern Chinese who had been impeached in 1645 but was allowed to remain in his post by Prince Regent Dorgon. The Shunzhi Emperor replaced Feng with Chen Mingxia (ca. 1601–1654), an influential southern Chinese with good connections in Jiangnan literary societies. Though later in 1651 Chen was also dismissed on charges of <b>influence</b> <b>peddling,</b> he was reinstated in his post in 1653 and soon became a close personal advisor to the sovereign. He was even allowed to draft imperial edicts just as Ming Grand Secretaries used to. Still in 1653, the Shunzhi Emperor decided to recall the disgraced Feng Quan, but instead of balancing the influence of northern and southern Chinese officials at court as the emperor had intended, Feng Quan's return only intensified factional strife. In several controversies at court in 1653 and 1654, the southerners formed one bloc opposed to the northerners and the Manchus. In April 1654, when Chen Mingxia spoke to northern official Ning Wanwo ( [...] ; d. 1665) about restoring the style of dress of the Ming court, Ning immediately denounced Chen to the emperor and accused him of various crimes including bribe-taking, nepotism, factionalism, and usurping imperial prerogatives.

40|$|The various {{independent}} chiefdoms {{that make}} up present day Malawi had a new constitution imposed over all of them by the British government without their consent. This new superimposed constitution was never really embraced by the various tribal groups. Its tenets were never internalised by the people and this lack of internalisation has continued to this day. The elite of the day decided which principles would govern the country. Successive elite groups in different periods of Malawi’s history have imposed their brand of constitutionalism on a hapless people. They have dutifully put in writing the constitutional principles without intending to apply them. Malawi is a nation that embraced constitutionalism with one reason only, that is, to gain acceptance from its peers in the international community. Throughout its history from pre-colonial times to the present, the general population has never been involved in framing the principles which govern and shape the destiny of the nation. A {{small group of people}} has always decided what the constitution should contain. The dominant man of the moment (the big man) and his political party decide what constitutionalism is to be. They govern the country through patronage. The president and a small group around him use state resources to promote their agenda often {{at the expense of the}} constitution they swore to uphold. The political leaders do not differentiate between resources of the state, the private sector and their ruling party and they often use them to <b>peddle</b> <b>influence</b> to promote their programs that are sometimes in violation of the constitution. When the president “donates” state resources to the poor communities, he tells them that he used his own money to buy the item he is donating, for example an ambulance, and nobody dares to contradict him. Only in financial matters has the nation demonstrated some marked commitment to the rule of law. The incentive for the government to comply with the law is much higher because about 80 percent of its capital budget is financed from external sources through donations, loans and grants from western nations. Government tends to take action against public officers who do not follow constitutionally laid down principles. Its commitment to the rule of law on social and political governance issues is not consistent. It appears to pick and choose which constitutional principles it will adhere to. In conclusion, it is difficult for Malawi to experience a government that adheres to the principles of constitutionalism because its widespread poverty helps entrench a system of patronage. This system has created a nation that tolerates serious abuses of its constitution. Transformative constitutionalism appears to offer the best hope for Malawi’s future. The nation needs a judiciary that is more innovative and bold in interpreting, upholding and enforcing its own constitutional tenets. Only then will the nation be on a sound footing to realise the benefits of constitutionalism for its people. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. JurisprudenceLLMUnrestricte...|$|R
