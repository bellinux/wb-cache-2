5|$|The {{classification}} of archaea into species is also controversial. Biology defines a species {{as a group}} of related organisms. The familiar exclusive breeding criterion (organisms that can breed with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>but</b> not with others) is of no help here because archaea reproduce asexually.|$|E
5|$|Three {{long-lived}} anticyclonic features termed white ovals {{were observed}} in 1938. For several decades they remained as separate features in the atmosphere, sometimes approaching <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>but</b> never merging. Finally, two of the ovals merged in 1998, then absorbed the third in 2000, becoming Oval BA.|$|E

5|$|In either 549 or 550, the Gepids and Lombards again marched against <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>but,</b> {{according}} to Procopius, both armies panicked and no battle took place. As a result, a new war was avoided and Thurisind accepted Audoin's {{request for a}} two-year truce. According to István Boná, the panic {{may be linked to}} a natural phenomenon: a lunar eclipse took place on June 25/26, 549.|$|E
5|$|More generally, in {{a closed}} system of particles, all {{internal}} forces are balanced. The particles may accelerate with respect to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>but</b> the center of mass of the system will not accelerate. If an external force acts on the system, it will make the center of mass accelerate {{in proportion to the}} magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.|$|E

5|$|Aerith was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with influence from director and scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase and Hironobu Sakaguchi, whilst Yoshitaka Amano created conceptual artwork which also helped to influence her design. She has green eyes and long brown hair tied in a braid with a pink ribbon. She wears a long pink dress, a bolero jacket, and brown hiking boots. The long dress {{was designed}} to appear ladylike and as a contrast to Tifa Lockhart's miniskirt. During development, Aerith {{was supposed to be}} Sephiroth's sister as both designs resembled <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>but</b> they were made former lovers with Aerith remembering Sephiroth when meeting Cloud as both are ex-SOLDIERS. Late during development, Aerith's first love was changed to Zack Fair.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} social of rodents are the ground squirrels, which {{typically}} form colonies based on female kinship, with males dispersing after weaning and becoming nomadic as adults. Cooperation in ground squirrels varies between species and typically includes making alarm calls, defending territories, sharing food, protecting nesting areas, and preventing infanticide. The {{black-tailed prairie dog}} forms large towns that may cover many hectares. The burrows do not interconnect, but are excavated and occupied by territorial family groups known as coteries. A coterie often consists of an adult male, three or four adult females, several nonbreeding yearlings, and the current year's offspring. Individuals within coteries are friendly with <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>but</b> hostile towards outsiders.|$|E
5|$|By 1:00 pm, the two fleets were roughly facing <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>but</b> sailing on {{opposite}} tacks. In order to engage, {{and to avoid}} some shoals (known as the Middle Ground) {{near the mouth of}} the bay, Graves around 2:00 pm ordered his whole fleet to wear, a manoeuvre that reversed his line of battle, but enabled it to line up with the French fleet as its ships exited the bay. This placed the squadron of Hood, his most aggressive commander, {{at the rear of the}} line, and that of Admiral Francis Samuel Drake in the van.|$|E

25|$|The western {{population}} {{extends from}} Dampier, south to Albany, with no {{records of the}} species between Albany and Spencer Gulf further west. The southern population occurs in Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent, extending eastward to the Fleurieu Peninsula.

5|$|Clark's {{relationships}} with the other characters evolved {{over the course of}} the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>but</b> knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh were {{financially and}} {{socially}} ruined by {{their attempts to}} outcompete and disgrace <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>but</b> they made important contributions to science and the field of paleontology, and provided substantial material for further work—both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths. The efforts {{of the two men}} led to more than 136 new species of dinosaurs being discovered and described. The products of the Bone Wars resulted in an increase in knowledge of prehistoric life, and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs, leading to continued fossil excavation in North America in the decades to follow. Many historical books and fictional adaptations have been published about this period of intense fossil-hunting activity.|$|E
5|$|Ellen rides back to {{town and}} accosts Cort. During sex, they promise {{to help each other}} {{overcome}} Herod. Ellen directly challenges Herod but is sickened to hear that he has already accepted a fight against The Kid. Ellen and Cort are the only other fighters left and are ordered by Herod to face off. They both proclaim they won't fight <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>but</b> Herod tells them he will have them gunned down by his men if they refuse. Herod takes The Kid aside and asks him to withdraw from the contest, telling him his time will come. The Kid refuses and they fight, with The Kid wounding Herod in the neck while Herod delivers a fatal bullet to The Kid who dies in Ellen's arms. Ellen and Cort then face <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>but</b> both refuse to draw their weapons. Herod begins a countdown from ten, declaring that if neither draws by the time he gets to zero he will have them both killed. Cort begs Ellen to kill him but she still refuses. When Herod reaches one Cort draws and fires. Doc Wallace declares Ellen dead, and Cort angrily storms up to Herod and demands they fight immediately. Herod refuses, telling Cort they will meet at dawn. Later that night, one of Herod's men, Ratsy, chains Cort to a table and beats him severely before smashing Cort's gunfighting hand and breaking it.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{collision}} at least 31 lawsuits seeking damages were brought against United Airlines, the U.S. Government, or both. On September 24, 1958, United Airlines filed for damagesbased on the Federal Tort Claims Actagainst the United States in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The airline {{alleged that the}} United States through its agents in the United States Air Force negligently operated the F-100F, and sought damages of US$3,576,698. The court found neither crew was negligent for a failure to see and avoid <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>but</b> held the United States was liable because of other negligence. The case was settled on December17, 1962, with the United States agreeing to pay the airline $1.45million.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Ramírez Treviño {{was a close}} {{associate}} of Jaime González Durán (El Hummer), a founder and top leader of Los Zetas drug cartel. In 2008, González Durán was arrested and sentenced to 35 years in prison; by 2010, Los Zetas, who were working as the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel, separated from the organization to operate independently. Both criminal organizations went to war with <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>but</b> Ramírez Treviño remained in the Gulf Cartel. Under the tutelage of Samuel Flores Borrego (El Metro 3), he worked as the second-in-command for the criminal organization in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. In an apparent power struggle within the Gulf Cartel, however, El Metro 3 was killed, and he became the regional kingpin in September 2011.|$|E

The games add many new features, such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests, along with addition of 107 new Pokémon. The games are independent of <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>but</b> feature largely the same plot and while both can be played separately, {{it is necessary to}} trade between them in order to complete the games' Pokédexes.|$|E

5|$|Similar to {{previous}} installments of the series, the two games follow {{the journey of}} a young Pokémon trainer through the region of Unova, as they train Pokémon used to compete against other trainers, while thwarting the schemes of the criminal organization Team Plasma. Black and White introduced 157 new Pokémon to the franchise, 6 more than the previous record holder Red and Blue, {{as well as many}} new features, including a seasonal cycle, rotation battles, fully animated Pokémon sprites and triple battles. Both titles are independent of <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>but</b> feature largely the same plot, and while both can be played separately, trading Pokémon between both of the games is necessary in order to complete the games' Pokédex.|$|E
