5|$|Felix Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in <b>E</b> <b>minor,</b> Op. 64, is {{his last}} large orchestral work. It forms an {{important}} part of the violin repertoire and is one of the most popular and most frequently performed violin concertos in history. A typical performance lasts just under half an hour.|$|E
5|$|The hymn tune in <b>E</b> <b>minor</b> {{follows the}} {{structure}} of the bar form. It culminates in the long phrase of line 8 and repeats line 1 in line 9, framing the stanza.|$|E
5|$|At (1:18), the song's main melody is introduced, {{played by}} a guitar, the bass guitar and a glockenspiel, with a chord {{progression}} of <b>E</b> <b>minor,</b> C major seventh, G major, and D major. This is repeated until (3:28), when the guitars fade out into the background, and the drumbeat ends, leaving only the ride cymbal to keep the beat, and the main melody, which is repeated until it gradually fades out, leaving ambient guitar noise.|$|E

5|$|Chopin's {{influence}} is marked {{in the first}} two pieces. Orledge observes that the right-hand figuration at the end of No 1 is remarkably similar to {{that at the end of}} Chopin's Waltz in <b>E</b> <b>minor.</b> In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (Au bord d'une source) in the opening bars. In the closing bars of No 2, Orledge finds a resemblance to the end of Chopin's Grande Valse Brillante, Op, 18.|$|E
5|$|The Violin Concerto in <b>E</b> <b>minor,</b> Op. 64 (1844), {{was written}} for Ferdinand David. David, who had worked closely with Mendelssohn during the piece's preparation, gave the premiere of the concerto on his Guarneri violin. Joseph Joachim called {{it one of the}} four great violin concerti along with those of Beethoven, Brahms, and Bruch.|$|E
5|$|The long orchestral prelude (166 bars) is in <b>E</b> <b>minor</b> and, in {{the manner}} of an operatic overture, anticipates several of the themes which will be heard later in the movement. The {{exposition}} begins in near-silence; the scene depicted is that of a rocky, wooded mountainside, the dwelling place of anchorites whose utterances are heard in an atmospheric chorus complete with whispers and echoes.|$|E

5|$|Instead of an orchestral tutti, the concerto {{opens with}} the almost {{immediate}} entry of the solo violin, playing the very tune in <b>E</b> <b>minor</b> that gave Mendelssohn no peace. Following a bravura of rapidly ascending notes, the opening theme is then restated by the orchestra. There is then a frenetic chromatic transition passage {{as the music}} subsides and modulates into a tranquil second subject theme in G major. The melody is initially played by the woodwinds with the soloist providing a pedal note on an open G string. The tune is played by the solo violin itself before a short codetta ends the exposition section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the development section, where the music builds up to the innovative cadenza, which Mendelssohn wrote out in full rather than allowing the soloist to improvise. The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from quavers to quaver-triplets and finally to semiquavers, which require ricochet bowing from the soloist. This serves as {{a link to the}} recapitulation, where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the recapitulation, the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played in the E major before returning to <b>E</b> <b>minor</b> for the closing of the movement. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked 'Presto', before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.|$|E
5|$|Mozart's Requiem was sung {{at the funeral}}; the soloists {{were the}} soprano Jeanne-Anaïs Castellan, the {{mezzo-soprano}} Pauline Viardot, the tenor Alexis Dupont, and the bass Luigi Lablache; Chopin's Preludes No.4 in <b>E</b> <b>minor</b> and No.6 in B minor were also played. The organist at the funeral was Louis Lefébure-Wély. The funeral procession to Père Lachaise Cemetery, which included Chopin's sister Ludwika, was led by the aged Prince Adam Czartoryski. The pallbearers included Delacroix, Franchomme, and Camille Pleyel. At the graveside, the Funeral March from Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 was played, in Reber's instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|Over the bridges, the new key is set {{fully in}} the minor mode, {{avoiding}} the Dorian inflections present in previous Harrison songs. These sections begin on an <b>E</b> <b>minor</b> chord, which, in Roman numeral analysis, represents a v minor in the tonic of A and an iv minor in the new key. At {{the end of each}} bridge, the return to the home key is effected via an E major chord, marking the only use of the expected G note in the A major scale.|$|E

5|$|The Latin text of Locus iste is {{the gradual}} , {{part of the}} proper of the mass for Kirchweih, the anniversary of a church's dedication. While some sources claim that the motet was first {{performed}} on the dedication day, 29 September 1869, together with the first performance of Bruckner's Mass in <b>E</b> <b>minor,</b> it was actually performed four weeks later, on 29 October, at the same location. Bruckner dedicated the work to Oddo Loidol, one of his students at the Vienna Conservatory. It was Bruckner's first motet composed in Vienna.|$|E
5|$|The bassoon sustains its B {{from the}} final chord of the first {{movement}} before moving up a semitone to middle C. This serves as a key change from the <b>E</b> <b>minor</b> opening movement into the lyrical C major slow movement. The movement is in ternary form and is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's own Songs Without Words. The theme to the darker, middle section in A minor is first introduced by the orchestra before the violin then takes up both the melody and the accompaniment simultaneously. The tremulous accompaniment requires nimble dexterity from the soloist before the music returns to the main lyrical C major theme, this time leading towards a serene conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The song {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} {{consisting of a}} sustained measure of electronic effects followed by two lines from the chorus. In each two-measure line {{during the first half}} of the verses, Stefani descends the scale while the keyboard plays the off-beats of the first measure and the electric bass opens the line with a two-note bassline. During the second half of the verses, Stefani's vocals are overdubbed, and the instrumentation becomes more frequent. Each of the two verses is followed by the chorus, where overdubbing is used on Stefani's vocals to produce first inversion and normal form <b>E</b> <b>minor</b> chords. Bounty Killer then toasts the bridge, and after a brief section sung by Stefani, the song closes by repeating the chorus twice.|$|E

5|$|In {{worsening}} health, Smetana {{continued to}} compose. In June 1876 he, Bettina {{and their two}} daughters left Prague for Jabkenice, {{the home of his}} eldest daughter Žofie where, in tranquil surroundings, Smetana was able to work undisturbed. Before leaving Prague he had begun a cycle of six symphonic poems, called Má vlast ("My Fatherland"), and had completed the first two, Vyšehrad and Vltava, which had both been performed in Prague during 1875. In Jabkenice Smetana composed four more movements, the complete cycle being first performed on 5November 1882 under the baton of Adolf Čech. Other major works composed in these years were the <b>E</b> <b>minor</b> String Quartet, From My Life, a series of Czech dances for piano, several choral pieces and three more operas: The Kiss, The Secret and The Devil's Wall, all of which received their first performances between 1876 and 1882.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} movement, {{there is a}} brief fourteen-bar {{transitional}} passage in <b>E</b> <b>minor</b> for solo violin and strings only. This leads into the lively and effervescent finale, the whole of which is in E major and whose opening {{is marked by a}} trumpet fanfare. This movement is in sonata rondo form with an opening theme requiring fast passage work from the soloist. The opening exposition leads into a brief second B major theme which is played by the soloist and builds to a series of rapidly ascending and descending arpeggios, reminiscent of the cadenza from the first movement. The orchestra then plays a variation of the opening melody, after which the music moves into a short development section in G major. The recapitulation is essentially similar to the exposition, apart from the addition of a counter-melody in the strings. The second theme is repeated, this time in the home key of E Major. There is almost a small cadenza {{near the end of the}} movement when the woodwinds play the main tune against prolonged trills from the solo violin. The concerto then concludes with a frenetic coda.|$|E
