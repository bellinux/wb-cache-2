40|$|Background: The {{relative}} frequency {{of wind and}} animal pollinated plants is non-randomly distributed across the globe and numerous hypotheses have been raised for the greater occurrence of wind pollination in some habitats and towards higher latitudes. To date, however, {{there has been no}} comprehensive global investigation of these hypotheses. Aims: Investigating a range of hypotheses for the role of biotic and abiotic factors as determinants of the global variation in animal versus wind pollination. Methods: We analysed 67 plant communities ranging from 70 º North to 34 º South. For these we determined <b>habitat</b> <b>type,</b> <b>species</b> richness, insularity, topographic heterogeneity, current climate and Late-Quaternary climate change. The predictive effects of these factors on the proportion of wind- and animal-pollinated plants were tested using correlations, ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression analyses with information-theoretic model selection. Results: The proportion of animal-pollinated plant species was positively associated with plant species richness and current temperature. Furthermore, in forest, animal pollination was positively related to precipitation. Historical climate was only weakly and idiosyncratically correlated with animal pollination. Conclusion: Results were consistent with the hypothesised reduced chance for wind-transported pollen reaching conspecific flowers in species-rich communities, fewer constraints on nectar production in warm and wet habitats, and reduced relative effectiveness of wind dispersal in humid areas. There was little evidence of a legacy of historical climate change affecting these patterns...|$|E

40|$|Rivers are dynamic {{ecosystems}} {{with considerable}} heterogeneity across multiple spatial scales. Environmental factors, such as depth, physical structure, flow regime and habitat connectivity influence species distributions across a floodplain, and subsequently {{there is a}} large body of work focused on understanding how these factors influence the structure of fish communities. There has also been increasing interest in understanding how environmental variation influences the community structure of another major aquatic vertebrate group, the turtles. I sampled fish and turtles at Gus Engeling Wildlife Management Area (WMA) and used ordination analyses to visualize environmental gradients that may influence community structure for these two vertebrate groups. Distributions of aquatic turtles and fishes at Gus Engeling WMA were associated with environmental gradients defined by flow regimes and substrate composition. When just turtles were considered, flow regimes were particularly important in describing habitat partitioning among species, particularly confamilial groups. A second study site, Keechi Creek WMA, was sampled for turtles in 2009. Keechi Creek WMA exhibited less habitat heterogeneity than Gus Engeling WMA, and as heterogeneity decreased between the two study sites, turtle species richness decreased, whereas habitat overlap between species increased. I analyzed the capture efficiency of 7 trap types used throughout the course of this project and found that effectiveness of each trap type varied by <b>habitat</b> <b>type,</b> <b>species,</b> and shell size.

40|$|Background and purpose. Species traits {{have been}} {{extensively}} used by botanists to describe, group and rank species {{according to their}} functions. Recently, the multi-trait approach has been extended also to the animal assemblages. There is now growing evidence that interspecific traits-variability can have significant effects on community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. The aim of our study was to describe how the carabid species traits change in relation to an altitudinal sequence of habitat types.   Materials and methods. In this paper we weighted the species traits (dispersal power, diet, reproductive rhythm, chorology) of the Carabid beetles assemblages in nineteen sites in the Dolomites along an altitudinal sequence of habitat types (1000 - 2250 m a. s. l.). Carabids have been sampled by means of pitfall traps.   Results. Species richness, activity density and species traits were not, or weakly, correlated with elevation, while they showed {{to be linked to}} the <b>habitat</b> <b>type.</b> <b>Species</b> traits, as taxa, showed to be not uniformly distributed along the sequence, with brachypterous species concentrated in high-altitude or climax environments mainly, and regional endemic species prevailing in high-altitude environments. Macropterous species with zoospermophagous species were found to increase with anthropogenic environmental disturbance.   Conclusions. The species traits analysis enabled us to shift the research focus from the taxonomic level to a biological more comprehensive level, opening the way for drawing more general ecologic models. Moreover it was possible to make inferences about the most successful carabid strategies in order to advance hypotheses on the historical colonization processes in the Alps. </p...|$|E

40|$|Birds are {{vulnerable}} to collisions with human-made fixed structures. Despite ongoing development and increases in infrastructure, we have few estimates {{of the magnitude of}} collision mortality. We reviewed the existing literature on avian mortality associated with transmission lines and derived an initial estimate for Canada. Estimating mortality from collisions with power lines is challenging {{due to the lack of}} studies, especially from sites within Canada, and due to uncertainty about the magnitude of detection biases. Detection of bird collisions with transmission lines varies due to <b>habitat</b> <b>type,</b> <b>species</b> size, and scavenging rates. In addition, birds can be crippled by the impact and subsequently die, although crippling rates are poorly known and rarely incorporated into estimates. We used existing data to derive a range of estimates of avian mortality associated with collisions with transmission lines in Canada by incorporating detection, scavenging, and crippling biases. There are 231, 966 km of transmission lines across Canada, mostly in the boreal forest. Mortality estimates ranged from 1 million to 229. 5 million birds per year, depending on the bias corrections applied. We consider our most realistic estimate, taking into account variation in risk across Canada, to range from 2. 5 million to 25. 6 million birds killed per year. Data from multiple studies across Canada and the northern U. S. indicate that the most vulnerable bird groups are (1) waterfowl, (2) grebes, (3) shorebirds, and (4) cranes, which is consistent with other studies. Populations of several groups that {{are vulnerable}} to collisions are increasing across Canada (e. g., waterfowl, raptors), which suggests that collision mortality, at current levels, is not limiting population growth. However, there may be impacts on other declining species, such as shorebirds and some species at risk, including Alberta's Trumpeter Swans (Cygnus buccinator) and western Canada's endangered Whooping Cranes (Grus americana). Collisions may be more common during migration, which underscores the need to understand impacts across the annual cycle. We emphasize that these estimates are preliminary, especially considering the absence of Canadian studies...|$|E

Zugrunde liegen {{qualitative}} und quantitative floristische Angaben zur Artenzusammensetzung insgesamt und teilweise auch im Vergleich einzelner Standorte. Ausgewertet werden weiter Lebensformenspektren, der Anteil der Anthropophyten und mittlere Zeigerwerte nach ELLENBERG. Insgesamt ergeben sich deutliche Unterschiede, teilweise in Übereinstimmung mit Untersuchungen aus anderen Gebieten. A comparison {{in western}} Bohemia of village ruderal flora {{with that of}} an industrial town is presented. The floristic differences between the town of Plzen and 19 village settlements {{make it possible to}} specify many species which typically occur on one or another <b>habitat</b> <b>type.</b> <b>Species</b> obviously concentrated either in villages or in the town can be found even among the common ones. Enrichment of village ruderal flora is mostly due to the occurence of species growing in moist, steppe and forest sites. On the other side, better possibilities of immigration in towns results in increased numbers of anthropophytes. Regarding the percentage share of families in the composition of the flora, considerable differences were found between villages and the town (see table 3). Analysis of similarity indices showed that differences among floras of strongly human-influenced areas are most of all due to differences among the most dynamic groups of plants (neophytes, ergasiophygophytes). The percentage of therophytes was higher in Plzen, whereas an increase in geophytes and phanerophytes was recorded in rural habitats (Table 5). In the town of Plzen, the spectrum of life forms remains relatively stable regardless of the habitat type, with the percentage of therophytes slightly increasing from the periphery towards the center of the town. On the contrary, major differences in the composition of life-form spectra {{can be seen in the}} village flora according to the habitat type. The considerably higher proportion of anthropophytes recorded in the flora of Plzen (see Table 6) is due to greater environmental pressure by humans and more suitable temperature conditions. An increase in the percentage of anthropophytes was observed along the gradient from rural to urban localities. Among anthropophytes, archaeophytes occur more frequently than neophytes. This trend can be better discovered when quantitative data on species occurence are taken into account. In general, archaeophytes are the group better established in local floras, often being important components of prevailing ruderal communities. Application of ELLENBERG's indicator values showed a higher concentration of nitrophilous and thermophilous species in the flora of Plzen, whereas the hygrophilous and heliophilous species are more typical of village sites...|$|E

Additionally, comparisons of the effect of <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> and <b>species</b> are largely missing. Methodology and Principal Findings: We estimated the importance of the <b>habitat</b> <b>type</b> and <b>species</b> for population dynamics of plants. Specifically, we compared the dynamics of two closely related species, the allotetraploid species Anthericum liliago and the diploid species Anthericum ramosum, occurring in the same <b>habitat</b> <b>type.</b> We also compared the dynamics of A. ramosum in two contrasting habitats. We examined three populations per <b>species</b> and <b>habitat</b> <b>type.</b> The results showed that single life history traits as well as the mean population dynamics of A. liliago and A. ramosum from the same <b>habitat</b> <b>type</b> were more similar than the population dynamics of A. ramosum from the two contrasting habitats. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that when transferring knowledge regarding population dynamics between populations, we need to take habitat conditions into account, as these conditions appear to be more important than the species involved (ploidy level). However, the two species differ significantly in their overall population growth rates, indicating that the ploidy level has an effect on species performance. In contrast to what has been suggested by previous studies, we observed a higher population growth rate in the diploid species.

We investigated whether species pools in contemporary <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> represent different levels of diversification of angiosperms and, if so, whether these differences correlate with particular environmental factors. We tested these relationships in a region of recent geological origin possessing a comparatively young flora, and compared the result with standard analyses of species diversity. Location The Netherlands. Methods We studied angiosperms across the full range of <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> present in the Netherlands. We characterized levels of diversification represented in species pools within each of these <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> with respect to (1) taxonomic diversification, i. e. the rate of increase of richness across taxonomic ranks (relative to a null expectation for a given species richness), and (2) cladogenic diversification, i. e. the average cladogenic distance of species from the root of a phylogenetic tree of the species pool within a given region. Results Species pools of different <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> represented different levels of taxonomic and cladogenic diversification. These differences were strongly correlated with the environmental characteristics of the <b>habitat</b> <b>type.</b> Greater levels of taxonomic diversification were represented in the species pools of relatively dry and open <b>habitat</b> <b>types.</b> Greater levels of cladogenic diversification were represented in habitats with both dry and weakly acidic soils.

We used a mark-recapture experi-ment to explore the effects of two different matrix habitats (grass vs shrub) on the ability of two species of Aphthona (Chrysomelidae: Coleoptera) flea beetle to immigrate to patches of the invasive weed, leafy spurge. Using general-ized linear models, we compared effects of the matrix <b>habitat</b> <b>types,</b> <b>species</b> and sex on observed immigration probabilities. Our analyses demonstrated that one species (A. nigriscutis) had a much higher immigration probability when moving through a grass-dominated matrix than a shrub-dominated matrix whereas immigration probabili-ties for the second species (A. lacertosa) were similar in both matrix habitats but significantly lower overall than for A. nigriscutis. Furthermore, A. nigriscutis females were more likely to immigrate to spurge patches embed-ded in a grass matrix than in shrub, whereas the opposite occurred for males. Our results suggest that metapopula-tion dynamics may be strongly affected by the <b>type(s)</b> of matrix <b>habitat</b> present on a landscape.

In this study, a survey was undertaken to describe and zone the reef and its benthic communities in terms of topography, <b>habitat</b> <b>types,</b> <b>species</b> diversity, species richness and benthic cover. Data were collected using underwater photography and analysed by point intercept analysis. Three distinct benthic communities were identified using multivariate non-metric statistics. Benthic communities appeared {{to be influenced by}} topography, sediment cover and wave energy. The highest abundance of zooxanthellate hard corals and the encrusting zooxanthellate sponge, Suberites kelleri were found on the large shallow areas of the shoal. This suggested that light penetration to the elevated areas on the reef was adequate for photosynthesis and {{played a role in the}} distribution of its biota. The encrusting morphology of the sponge   Suberites kelleri, and the branching morphology of the hard corals Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora spp., appeared to be tolerant of the high-energy environment near the surface. A second community was found only on steep edges of the Shoal and was characterized by a large abundance of Polychaeta and the soft coral Eleutherobia aurea, while a third community was found deeper on the offshore side of the shoal and consisted primarily of coralline and red foliose algae. </strong...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 714 small mammals {{representing}} 15 species was captured, identified and released (11, 000 trap nights at 110 different trap sites in six different <b>habitat</b> <b>types)</b> at the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, Osage Co., Oklahoma. More species of small mammals {{were trapped in}} the prairie-grass habitat (13 species) than in disturbed areas (9 species), grassy streamsides (7 species), wooded streamsides (6 species), rock outcrops (6 species), or upland woods (6 species) habitats. Species diversity and evenness indices (Shannon's Index) of small mammals were determined for six <b>habitat</b> <b>types.</b> Mean <b>species</b> diversity values ranged from a high value in the prairie-grass habitat, to low values in the upland woods and wooded streamsides habitats. High community similarity (Horn's Index) was found in upland woods and wooded streamsides habitats. Community similarity also was high among prairie-grass, rock outcrops, grassy streamsides, and disturbed habitats. © 1999 Oklahoma Academy of Scienc...|$|R
