5|$|The Menominee Indian Tribe {{had entered}} {{into a series of}} {{treaties}} with the United States that did not specifically state that they had <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> rights. In 1961, Congress terminated the tribe's federal recognition, ending its right to govern itself, federal support of health care and education programs, police and fire protection, and tribal rights to land. In 1963, three members of the tribe were charged with violating Wisconsin's <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> laws on land which had been a reservation for over 100 years. The tribe members were acquitted, but when the state appealed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the Menominee tribe no longer had <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> rights because of the termination action by Congress.|$|E

50|$|The {{issue in}} this case is that the Klamath Tribal members were asserting that they had the right to <b>hunt</b> <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> outside the {{boundaries}} of the reservation established in the 1901 Agreement including the lands ceded in the agreement. The tribes agreed that they had no rights to <b>hunt</b> <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> on the ceded lands that were currently privately owned. The question the court was considering was whether or not the Tribe reserved a special right to <b>hunt</b> <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> on the ceded lands and were free of state regulation through the 1901 Agreement. The Court pointed out that the language in the 1864 Treaty indicated that the Tribe's right to <b>hunt</b> <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> was restricted to the reservation and not on any of their additional ceded lands. In addition, the language in the 1901 Agreement did not evidence any intent to preserve special off-reservation hunting or fishing rights for the Tribe.|$|R
5|$|The tribe {{sued the}} United States for {{compensation}} in the US Court of Claims, which ruled that tribal members still had <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> rights and that Congress had not abrogated the rights. The opposite rulings {{by the state}} and federal courts brought the issue to the Supreme Court. In 1968, the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> rights under the treaties involved and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the Menominee Indian Termination Act without a clear and unequivocal statement by Congress removing the rights.|$|E
5|$|The tribe was {{represented}} by Charles A. Hobbs of Washington, D.C. The tribe argued that the Menominee Termination Act did not extinguish treaty rights, but instead had two purposes; to terminate federal supervision of the tribe and to transfer to the state general criminal and civil jurisdictionwhich had already been accomplished by Public Law 280 and that law expressly preserved <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> rights. In {{the event that the}} court would decide that the <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> rights were extinguished, then the tribe should receive compensation for the loss of the rights.|$|E

5|$|Big Wapwallopen Creek {{is named}} after a Native American village on the Susquehanna River near the creek. The Delaware and Shawnee tribes {{historically}} had camps and wigwams on the creek.

5|$|Justice Potter Stewart, {{joined by}} Justice Hugo Black, dissented. Stewart {{acknowledged}} that the Wolf River Treaty unquestionably conferred <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> rights on the tribe and its members. He stated that the Termination Act subjected {{the members of the}} tribe to the same laws that all other citizens of Wisconsin were held to, including <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> regulations. In Stewart's opinion, Public Law 280 had no bearing on the case and the rights were not protected by the Termination Act, so they were lost. Stewart did note that this would have also made the claim for compensation valid under Shoshone Tribe v. United States, regardless of whether Congress intended it or not. He would have reversed the decision of the Court of Claims.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally {{most of the}} Chiquitos tribes practiced swidden agriculture, growing maize and yuca on a small scale. After {{contact with}} the Spanish, cocoa and rice also were cultivated. <b>Hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> {{provided}} additional nutrition in the dry season.

5|$|Humans employ {{nature for}} both leisure and {{economic}} activities. The acquisition {{of natural resources}} for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.Some activities, such as <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing,</b> are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. Agriculture was first adopted around the 9th millennium BCE. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.|$|E

5|$|The papery bark of {{the white}} birch tree (Betula papyrifera) was used {{extensively}} by Native Americans. Wigwams were covered by it and canoes were constructed from it. Other uses included food containers, <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> equipment, musical instruments, toys and sledges. Nowadays, bark chips, a by-product of the timber industry, are used as a mulch and as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that need a soil-free compost.|$|E
5|$|While both <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing</b> were common, {{the peasants}} mostly hunted {{to protect their}} herds and crops. Apiculture, the keeping of bees, was as highly {{developed}} in Byzantium {{as it had been}} in Ancient Greece. Aside from agriculture, the peasants also laboured in the crafts, fiscal inventories mentioning smiths (Greek: χαλκεύς, chalkeus), tailors (Greek: ράπτης, rhaptes), and cobblers (Greek: τζαγγάριος, tzangarios).|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated by humans both as pets and for {{practical}} purposes. Colourful birds, such as parrots and mynas, are bred in captivity or kept as pets, {{a practice that}} has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species. Falcons and cormorants have long been used for <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> <b>fishing,</b> respectively. Messenger pigeons, used since at least 1 AD, remained important as recently as World War II. Today, such activities are more common either as hobbies, for entertainment and tourism, or for sports such as pigeon racing.|$|E
