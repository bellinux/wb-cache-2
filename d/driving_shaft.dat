50|$|A {{quill drive}} is a {{mechanism}} {{that allows a}} drive shaft to shift its position (either axially, ly, or both) relative to its <b>driving</b> <b>shaft.</b> It consists of a hollow <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> (the quill) with a driven shaft inside it. The two are connected in some fashion which permits the required motion.|$|E
50|$|The FSA type {{lubricator}} differs by each pump {{having two}} separate pistons {{to control the}} pumping & distribution of oil. The pistons are driven by cams on the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft.</b> The <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> is driven via a means of a roller ratchet assembly which converts the reciprocating motion of the operating linkage to rotary motion.|$|E

50|$|The hammer {{equipment}} {{has been}} kept fully operational. From the hammer mill pond above the mill a hammer mill channel or ditch leads {{water to the}} wooden overshot wheel with a diameter of almost four metres. The octagonal <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> is made of oak; it has a weight of about 7 tonnes and a length of 9.5 metres. Three tilt hammers with heads weighing 250, 200 und 100 kg are operated by iron tappets on the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|The loom {{is powered}} by a leather steam-belt which drives the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft.</b> Here there is a {{flywheel}} to smooth the motion and a crank mechanism to drive the battens (swords) and a toothed wheel. This engages a second shaft known as the tappet shaft or wiper shaft whose job is to lower the treadles and throw the shuttle. This turns half the speed of the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft,</b> so its toothed wheel is twice the size.|$|E

50|$|The Schaum was an American {{automobile}} manufactured from 1901 until 1905. Designed by W.A. Schaum, {{the first}} engines had twin cylinders with separate cranks geared {{up to one}} central <b>driving</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{configuration}} {{known as}} a double Cardan joint drive shaft partially overcomes the problem of jerky rotation. This configuration uses two U-joints joined by an intermediate shaft, with the second U-joint phased {{in relation to the}} first U-joint to cancel the changing angular velocity. In this configuration, the angular velocity of the driven shaft will match that of the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft,</b> provided that both the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> and the driven shaft are at equal angles with respect to the intermediate shaft (but not necessarily in the same plane) and that the two universal joints are 90 degrees out of phase. This assembly is commonly employed in rear wheel drive vehicles, where it is {{known as a}} drive shaft or propeller (prop) shaft.|$|E

50|$|The <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> {{carries the}} input power into the gearbox. The driven shaft is the output shaft from the gearbox. In car {{gearboxes}} with layshafts, these two shafts emerge from {{opposite ends of}} the gearbox, which is convenient for RWD cars but may be a disadvantage for other layouts.|$|E
50|$|A drive shaft, driveshaft, <b>driving</b> <b>shaft,</b> {{propeller}} shaft (prop shaft), or Cardan shaft is a mechanical component for transmitting torque and rotation, usually used to connect other {{components of a}} drive train that cannot be connected directly because of distance or the need to allow for relative movement between them.|$|E

50|$|With the {{popularity}} of front-wheel drive from the 1960s, the all-indirect gearbox has become common. These {{have been used for}} both transverse engine layouts, where the offset of two shafts is more convenient than the in-line arrangement of a layshaft gearbox, and for longitudinal transaxle designs, such as many Renaults, where the requirement was to have both driven and <b>driving</b> <b>shafts</b> at the same end of the gearbox.|$|R
30|$|Combination of {{the driving}} system and chassis is shown in Figure  6 (f) and 6 (g). To avoid the {{transmission}} confliction between the fixed electric motor/differential unit and two vibrating wheels, straight rotation transmissions are adjusted as two-universal-joint transmissions. Two mounting brackets are used. The two-universal-joint transmissions are implemented using two <b>driving</b> <b>shafts</b> and universal joints. The electrical motor and differential unit are fixed on the chassis to transmit power to wheels.|$|R
50|$|A jackshaft, {{also called}} a countershaft, {{is a common}} {{mechanical}} design component used to transfer or synchronize rotational force in a machine. A jackshaft is often just a short stub with supporting bearings on the ends and two pulleys, gears, or cranks attached to it. In general, a jackshaft is any shaft that is used as an intermediary transmitting power from a <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> to a driven shaft.|$|E

The main <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> of iron, with its cylindrical necks supported on iron crescent-shaped bearings, ended in a pinion which engaged a gear wheel {{at the lower end}} of the main vertical transmission shaft.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} a slip clutch or safety clutch, this device allows a {{rotating}} shaft to slip when higher than normal resistance is encountered on a machine. An example of a safety clutch is the one mounted on the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> of a large grass mower. The clutch yields if the blades hit a rock, stump, or other immobile object, thus avoiding a potentially damaging torque transfer to the engine, possibly twisting or fracturing the crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|Throughout 1899 {{the company}} {{employed}} about 150 men in sinking and <b>driving</b> <b>shafts</b> to test ore reserves. Six shafts aggregating 440 feet were sunk, and nearly 1200 feet of tunnels and drives were completed. By early 1900, an ore lode 96 feet wide but of uncertain depth had been found. Assays were encouraging {{and it was}} estimated that reserves totalled over 200,000 tons of ore averaging between three and twenty-five percent copper, with fifteen ounces of silver to the ton.|$|R

50|$|In {{the typical}} manual gearbox for a RWD car, the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> (input) is in-line with the driven shaft (output), but not {{permanently}} connected to it. A reduction gear on the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> drives the layshaft. In car transmissions, the term countershaft is also used. A {{number of gears}} on the layshaft may then be connected, one at a time, to the driven shaft. Selecting each of these gears in turn gives the various ratios of the gearbox. All of these gear ratios are reduction gears, the engine speed being higher than the input speed to the final drive of the rear axle. Early gearboxes used sliding gears to engage and disengage the drive. These were difficult to operate and also wore on the main working surfaces of the gears. An early improvement was to use separate dog clutches instead to engage gears, leaving the gears themselves in 'constant mesh'. A later, and more gradual development, was the introduction of synchromesh. This is an all-metal friction clutch {{in addition to the}} positive dog clutch, that gradually engages the gears and matches their speed before the dog clutch engages.|$|E
50|$|Its {{construction}} {{differs from}} that of the Rzeppa in that the balls are a tight fit between two halves of the coupling and that no cage is used. The center ball rotates on a pin inserted in the outer race and serves as a locking medium for the four other balls. When both shafts are in line, that is, at an angle of 180 degrees, the balls lie in a plane that is 90 degrees to the shafts. If the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> remains in the original position, any movement of the driven shaft will cause the balls to move one half of the angular distance. For example, when the driven shaft moves through an angle of 20 degrees, the angle between the two shafts is reduced to 160 degrees. The balls will move 10 degrees in the same direction, and the angle between the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> and the plane in which the balls lie will be reduced to 80 degrees. This action fulfills the requirement that the balls lie in the plane that bisects the angle of drive. This type of Weiss joint is known as the Bendix-Weiss joint.|$|E
5000|$|A robot {{apparatus}} that {{is able to}} perform jumping. In a leg structure 110 of the robot apparatus, connecting bars 113, 114 and pivots 112a to 112d constitute a four-point link mechanism. A rod 117 is inserted into an opening formed in the distal end of a leg part 116. A coil spring 118 as an elastic member is provided between {{one end of the}} rod 117 and the distal end of the leg part 116. A bar member 120 is connected and secured to a preset point of a connecting member 115 as a knee joint. The coil spring 118 is extended/contracted by the stretching/contraction of the connecting member 115. By the operation of the four-point link mechanism, the trajectory of the distal end of the leg part is linear. The coil spring 118 is mounted at a position such that the distance between a <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> 101 and the distal end of the bar member 120 has a substantially linear relationship with respect to the force virtually operating between a <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> 101 and the distal end of the bar member 120.Co-inventors: Takashi Yamamoto, Martin de Lasa, Shervin Talebinejad, Darrin Jewell, Robert Playter ...|$|E
