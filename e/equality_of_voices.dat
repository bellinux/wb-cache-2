[...] Some of them have been {{attributed}} to other composers, including Adrian Willaert, Jean Mouton, and Philippe Verdelot. [...] Stylistically they are transitional between the styles of Josquin and Palestrina. [...] The later works contain more evenly spaced imitation, and more <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>voices,</b> and more smoothness of counterpoint than the earlier works. [...] Often L'Héritier varied polyphonic with homophonic passages, a technique for achieving variety which was common among many Franco-Flemish composers of the time.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between Rowan Williams and Mikhail Bakhtin, especially Bakhtin’s notion of polyphony. This thesis traces {{the presence of the}} polyphonic approach in Williams’ work to three main issues: the debate around the nature and future of the Anglican Communion, the debate around the place of Christianity in the increasingly secular modern West and the debate around the nature of faith presented in the works of Dostoevsky. Adopting Bakhtin’s polyphonic approach, Williams sees the need for an on-going conversation, one that argues for the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> <b>voices</b> within a conversation, one that resists the impulse toward closure and one that resists the impulse toward uttering a final word in a debate. This thesis also touches on the polyphonic quality of the works of Hans Urs von Balthasar, Vern S. Poythress and John Gray...|$|E

30|$|An intense {{collaborative}} process must establish priorities. Closed groups tend to create conflict zones between participants and non-participants, since {{the decisions taken}} in-group affect directly other interested sectors. If activities succeed, {{there is also a}} tendency of defining privileged levels of power over the non-participants, which can also generate a conflict zone. Openness to participation is, hence, fundamental to create dialog condition that may favor the common good. The fourth step purposes, therefore, to define a group format that permits the entrance of new members, and if there are many departments, the definition of priorities. According to the group format, the openness to new members or specific moments to the compilation of information can be constant.

Early {{analyses}} revealed that after its inaugural use {{the rate at which}} voters ranked candidates dropped dramatically, and disqualifying errors on the ballots were more common in neighborhoods where more African-American and foreign-born citizens reside (Neely and Cook 2008). We extend the inquiry over time, examine other types of elections, and refine the methodology. Are some voters more than others able to exercise the franchise in these elections and, if so, what does that imply for the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> political <b>voice?</b> We find no evidence that ranking candidates is in decline. Overvotes are more common in IRV than plurality contests, but such errors appear to be a function of complexity in general and not IRV per se. While they occur disproportionately in precincts with more African-American residents, and are often more likely where Latino, elderly, foreign-born, and less wealthy citizens reside, the pattern of overvoting is similar in both IRV and non-IRV contests. We discuss what these results imply for San Francisco and other jurisdictions using or considering similar election systems...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} hypothesis that participation can overcome trade-offs in equity and efficiency. Literature {{within the field of}} economics and sociology has argued for tradeoffs in outcomes of allocative efficiency and equity and institutional efficiency and equity, respectively. Community-based participatory institutions are expected to overcome this tension by introducing institutional accountability and local-level decision making, which serve to enhance technical and allocative efficiency while retaining mechanisms for equitable allocation and empowerment. This research draws on fieldwork from a community-managed water supply program in rural Bahia, Brazil to examine whether outcomes of efficiency and equity are mutually compatible. Findings from the field research indicate that explicit and implicit subsidies to the water supply systems led to outcomes of allocative equity in the sites visited, but that these generated tradeoffs with allocative efficiency. Findings from the research also indicated that the community organizations were relatively efficient in their administrative practices, but that this efficiency came at a cost to <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> membership and <b>voice</b> in the community organization.

40|$|The {{report on}} the {{findings}} of extensive empirical research on <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> educational opportunities carried out in the US on a very large sample of public schools by Coleman and his colleagues has had a major impact on education policy and has given rise to a large amount of research and various interpretations. However, as some interpreters have highlighted, even more important than the findings of the survey themselves has been Coleman’s redefinition <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> opportunity, abandoning the then prevailing conception <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> educational opportunities as <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> starting points and replacing it with the concept <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> educational opportunities as <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> educational outcomes.

5000|$|One {{newspaper}} account criticized {{discussion by}} politicians {{on the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> as [...] "weasely", and thought that the term was politically correct and vague. Furthermore, when comparing <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> opportunity with <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> outcome, the sense was that the latter type was [...] "worse" [...] for society. <b>Equality</b> <b>of</b> outcome may be incorporated into a philosophy that ultimately seeks <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> opportunity. Moving towards a higher <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> outcome (albeit not perfectly equal) can lead to an environment more adept at providing <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> opportunity by eliminating conditions that restrict the possibility for members of society to fulfill their potential. For example, a child born in a poor, dangerous neighborhood with poor schools and little access to healthcare may be significantly disadvantaged in his attempts to maximize use of talents, no matter how fine his work ethic.

40|$|<b>Equality</b> <b>of</b> citizens, {{irrespective}} {{to their}} nationality {{is provided by}} all constitutions of the European socialist states. Yet a different construction is put on the question in the discussed constitutions {{on account of the}} fact that the constitutions were adopted in different periods, different patterns were followed, and first of all that not all these States encouner the question <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> citizens irrespective to their nationality as an actual problem. The <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights irrespective to nationality becomes the problem in federal States and those homogenous States where numerous minorities live, i. e. in Romania and Hungary. Constitutions of Romania and Hungary formulate the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> citizens irrespective to their nationality not only as an individual right but also as the collective one. It means that they provide not only the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights of particular citizens, but they guarantee <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights to the whole national minorities. Guaranteeing the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights to particular national minorities has to be recognized as a better and more complete securing <b>of</b> the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights. A possibility of cultivating their national separateness by particular citizens does not by itself create the full <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights. It is determined by activities of educational institutions at all their levels, extensive development of education and culture — and this cannot be implemented only by individual actions of citizens. The socialist federations, i. e. the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia secure the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights irrespective to nationality in different ways. In Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia the equality is secured by guaranteeing particular nationalities the development of their separate character. In the Soviet Union, the complete <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights of particular nations and peoples is intended to be achieved by the creation of a uniform Soviet nation. These two distinct ways are reflected in the discussed constitutions. Still, in all the European socialist States the true <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> citizens irrespective to their nationality is to be achieved by the equality in the social and economic domain. Most of the constitutions clearly differentiate between the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights and obligations of citizens and the equality before the law irrespective to nationality. It has to be added though, that in those States, where the constitutions do not proclaim explicitely the <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> citizens before the law irrespective to their nationality, the respective provisions were omitted mostly for that reason that at the time of adopting the constitutions there were no differences perceived between the notions <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> citizens before the law and <b>equality</b> <b>of</b> rights of citizens.
