Reed discovers Teresa's real name is Magdalena Rojas, and she runs the cartel.

500|$|The Ramcharitmanas expands on the Agni Pariksha narrative. Since no {{one knows}} about the {{replacement}} of the real Sita by Maya Sita, Sita's chastity is in question. The text explicitly states that the Agni Pariksha destroys the Maya Sita as well as the [...] "stigma of public shame", that Sita would have had to otherwise endure. Rama is exculpated from using harsh words to [...] "Sita" [...] at the time of Agni Pariksha as he <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the false Sita he is accusing. Sita is saved from public humiliation as her chastity is proven by Agni Pariksha. The moral status of Rama as well as Sita is protected by the Maya Sita motif.|$|E
