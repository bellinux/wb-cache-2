2500|$|At {{the time}} of the murder, Davis was acting {{governor}} as Governor Pete Wilson was out of the country on a trade visit. [...] Wilson's spokesman stated that the governor did not proactively volunteer rewards but would act only after local law enforcement requested it. On February 8, Wilson rescinded the offer Davis had made, citing the Cosby family's request that no taxpayer money be used as a reward. [...] "The Cosby family has my heartfelt sympathy," [...] Wilson said in a statement. [...] "I also regret that the Cosby family has had to respond to a barrage of media attention with regards to rewards offered by the state and other entities. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> withdrawing this reward brings a close to this issue and takes a burden off the Cosby family." ...|$|E

When a road is once built, it is a strange thing how it collects traffic, how every year, as it goes on, {{more and more people}} are found to walk thereon and others are raised up to repair and perpetuate it and keep it alive; so that perhaps even this road of ours may, from reparation to reparation, continue to exist and be useful hundreds and hundreds of years after we are mingled in the dust.

60|$|Here {{is a tale}} {{which extends}} over many years and travels into many countries. By a {{peculiar}} fitness of circumstance the writer began, continued it, and concluded it among distant and diverse scenes. Above all, he was much upon the sea. The character and fortune of the fraternal enemies, the hall and shrubbery of Durrisdeer, the problem of Mackellar's homespun and how to shape it for superior flights; these were his company on deck in many star-reflecting harbours, ran often in his mind at sea {{to the tune of}} slatting canvas, and were dismissed (something of the suddenest) on the approach of squalls. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> these surroundings of its manufacture may to some degree find favour for my story with seafarers and sea-lovers like yourselves.|$|E
60|$|I {{now find}} myself {{inspired}} {{to make a}} second legend of Creative Evolution without distractions and embellishments. My sands are running out; the exuberance of 1901 has aged into the garrulity of 1930; and the war has been a stern intimation that the matter is not one to be trifled with. I abandon the legend of Don Juan with its erotic associations, {{and go back to}} the legend of the Garden of Eden. I exploit the eternal interest of the philosopher's stone which enables men to live for ever. I am not, I hope, under more illusion than is humanly inevitable as to the crudity of this my beginning of a Bible for Creative Evolution. I am doing the best I can at my age. My powers are waning; but so much the better for those who found me unbearably brilliant when I was in my prime. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> a hundred apter and more elegant parables by younger hands will soon leave mine as far behind as the religious pictures of the fifteenth century left behind the first attempts of the early Christians at iconography. In that hope I withdraw and ring up the curtain.|$|E

25|$|After {{seven years}} of pain and hard {{struggle}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>hope</b> that the court system would listen to my plea and act as an independent body from the executive branch. Unfortunately, this recent decision and decisions taken on other similar cases, prove that the court system in the United States has become {{more or less a}} tool that the executive branch can easily manipulate through unfounded allegations and fear mongering. If anything, this decision is a loss to all Americans and to the rule of law.|$|R
