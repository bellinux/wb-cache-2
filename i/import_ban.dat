25|$|In 1999, {{fears of}} a European {{regulatory}} backlash or <b>import</b> <b>ban,</b> led to an informal agreement between the Japanese and European manufacturers to govern the top speed of their motorcycles at an arbitrary limit. The media-reported value for the speed agreement in miles per hour was consistently 186mph, while in kilometers per hour it varied from 299 to 303km/h, which is typical given unit conversion rounding errors. This figure may also be affected {{by a number of}} external factors, as can the power and torque values.|$|E
25|$|In China, leopard {{cats are}} hunted mainly for their fur. Between 1984 and 1989, about 200,000 skins were {{exported}} yearly. A survey {{carried out in}} 1989 among major fur traders revealed more than 800,000 skins on stock. Since the European Union imposed an <b>import</b> <b>ban</b> in 1988, Japan has become the main buyer, and imported 50,000 skins in 1989. Although commercial trade is much reduced, the species continues to be hunted throughout most of its range for fur, for food, and as pets. They are also widely viewed as poultry pests and killed in retribution.|$|E

40|$|Despite strong {{scientific}} evidence and representations made by international scientific organizations, {{a considerable number}} of countries have imposed <b>import</b> <b>bans</b> on pork in response to the H 1 N 1 pandemic. The imposition of these barriers is contrary to WTO rules. The motivation for the imposition of these barriers {{does not appear to have}} arisen from producers’ requests or consumer lobbying – political precaution provides the motivation. There appears to be little control over political precaution in the rules of international trade. Hence, the balance between the strong rules of trade desired by firms wishing to engage in international commerce and the need, at times, for politicians to respond to requests for protection may be changing in favour of more protection.

2500|$|In October 2006, an Australian news company {{reported}} that Vegemite had been {{banned in the}} United States, and that the United States Customs Service had {{gone so far as}} to search Australians entering the country for Vegemite because it naturally contains folate, a Bvitamin approved as an additive in the United States for just a few foods, including breakfast cereals. [...] The story appears to have originated as an anecdote by a traveller who claimed to have been searched by U.S. Customs and a spokesperson for Kraft made a misinformed comment to reporters. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration later stated that there were no plans to subject Vegemite to an <b>import</b> <b>ban,</b> or withdraw it from supermarket shelves. The United States Customs and Border Protection tried to dispel the rumour, stating on its website that [...] "there is no known prohibition on the importation of Vegemite" [...] and [...] "there is no official policy within CBP targeting Vegemite for interception". The story of the [...] "ban" [...] later took on the status of urban legend. [...] While Vegemite has never been popular in the US, it can still be purchased at supermarkets that stock imported food items.|$|E

40|$|Cointegration of Canadian and U. S. {{livestock}} prices {{points to}} the existence of market integration in the period 1996 : 1 to 2004 : 12 even though the trade flows of livestock and beef products were non-existent for many months in 2003 and 2004 (suggesting market segmentation) due to livestock/beef <b>import</b> <b>bans</b> by both countries due to BSE. It was also determined that Canada's trade dependence in livestock and beef is cointegrated with Canadian and U. S. livestock prices. However, as the trade dependence variable is shocked, the effects on Canadian and U. S. prices are opposite although one would expect that in an integrated market the price responses to an exogenous shock would be similar or statistically identical. This result reinforces the case against the use of cointegration in determining presence (or absence) of market integration. Empirical results in this article raise some very difficult questions. Gains from trade are well documented. Yet, once a country is very trade dependent, the prices in it are much more vulnerable to exogenous shocks that reduce the trade flows. Canadian livestock prices plummeted and stayed low following the BSE incident and U. S. (and Japanese) <b>import</b> <b>bans</b> on Canadian livestock and beef. Given the long cycles and high sunk cost in the livestock and beef industry, immediate adjustment (reduction in production) for Canadian producers was difficult and always unlikely. Moreover, the possibility of <b>import</b> <b>bans</b> being lifted in the near future may have further shaped their expectations and prolonged the decisions on herd reduction. In the meanwhile, U. S. prices increased following Canada's trade dependence shock due to BSE and remained above the original long-run equilibrium price. Demand and Price Analysis, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
