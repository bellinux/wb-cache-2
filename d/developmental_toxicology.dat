50|$|Developmental {{toxicity}} is any structural or functional alteration, reversible or irreversible, which {{interferes with}} homeostasis, normal growth, differentiation, development or behavior, {{and which is}} caused by environmental insult (including drugs, lifestyle factors such as alcohol, diet, and environmental toxic chemicals or physical factors). It {{is the study of}} adverse effects {{on the development of the}} organism resulting from exposure to toxic agents before conception (either parent), during prenatal development, or post-natally until puberty. The substance that causes developmental toxicity from embryonic stage to birth is called teratogens. The effect of the developmental toxicants depends on the type of substance, dose and duration and time of exposure.Certain Pathogens are also included since the toxins they secrete are known to cause adverse effects on the development of the organism when the mother or fetus is infected. <b>Developmental</b> <b>toxicology</b> is a science studying adverse developmental outcomes. This term has widely replaced the early term for the study of primarily structural congenital abnormalities, teratology, to enable inclusion of a more diverse spectrum of congenital disorders. Typical factors causing developmental toxicity are radiation, infections (e.g. rubella), maternal metabolic imbalances (e.g. alcoholism, diabetes, folic acid deficiency), drugs (e.g. anticancer drugs, tetracyclines, many hormones, thalidomide), and environmental chemicals (e.g. mercury, lead, dioxins, PBDEs, HBCD, tobacco smoke). The first-trimester exposure is considered the most potential for developmental toxicity.|$|E

40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} {{of the use}} of developmental toxicity testing in the United States and international regulatory assessment of human health risks associated with exposures to pharmaceuticals (human and veterinary), chemicals (agricultural, industrial, and environmental), food additives, cosmetics, and consumer products. <b>Developmental</b> <b>toxicology</b> data are used for prioritization and screening of pharmaceuticals and chemicals, for evaluating and labeling of pharmaceuticals, and for characterizing hazards and risk of exposures to industrial and environmental chemicals. The in vivo study designs utilized in hazard characterization and dose-response assessment for developmental outcomes have not changed substantially over the past 30 years and have served the process well. Now there are opportunities to incorporate new technologies and approaches to testing into the existing assessment paradigm, or to apply innovative approaches to various aspects of risk assessment. <b>Developmental</b> <b>toxicology</b> testing can be enhanced by the refinement or replacement of traditional in vivo protocols, including through the use of in vitro assays, studies conducted in alternative nonmammalian species, the application of new technologies, and the use of in silico models. Potential benefits to the current regulatory process include the ability to screen large numbers of chemicals quickly, with the commitment of fewer resources than traditional toxicology studies, and to refine the risk assessment process through an enhanced understanding of the mechanisms of developmental toxicity and their relevance to potential human risk.

40|$|The Tox 21 program {{initiated}} {{a shift in}} toxicology toward in vitro testing {{with a focus on}} the biological mechanisms responsible for toxicological response. We discuss the applications of these initiatives to <b>developmental</b> <b>toxicology.</b> Specifically, we briefly review current approaches that are widely used in <b>developmental</b> <b>toxicology</b> to demonstrate the gap in relevance to human populations. An important aspect of human relevance is the wide variability of cellular responses to toxicants. We discuss how this gap can be addressed by using cells isolated from umbilical cord blood, an entirely non-invasive source of fetal/newborn cells. Extension of toxicological testing to collections of human fetal/newborn cells would be useful for better understanding the effect of toxicants on fetal development in human populations. By presenting this perspective, we aim to initiate a discussion about the use of cord blood donor-specific cells to capture the variability of cellular toxicological responses during this vulnerable stage of human development...|$|E

30|$|Some other {{assessment}} procedures provide special safety factors {{because of a}} lack of data, e.g. for <b>developmental</b> <b>toxicology</b> or immunotoxicology. Such factors are not conventional in the assessment procedure analogous to the German Drinking Water Ordinance, which may lead to an underestimation of the risk. With respect to the PPARα-agonistic effect of PFC, humans are less sensitive than rats and mice. Monkeys with their lower sensitivity would be a better model for humans in this respect [3]. Rodent data, in contrast, could lead to more cautious human health-based criteria following a procedure analogous to that of the German Drinking Water Ordinance.|$|E

40|$|Measurements of an object's {{fundamental}} {{physical properties}} like mass, volume, and density can offer valuable {{insights into the}} composition and state of the object. However, many important biological samples reside in a liquid environment where {{it is difficult to}} accurately measure their physical properties.

40|$|Human {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} (hPSC) such as human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} (hiPSC) are incredibly valuable tools for investigations within a number of scientific fields including <b>developmental</b> biology, <b>toxicology,</b> pharmacology and perhaps most importantly, regenerative medicine. HPSC have an unlimited capacity for self-renewal which allows the expansion of clinically relevant cell numbers from a relatively small supply of starting material. Furthermore, hPSC are pluripotent, meaning they retain the capacity to differentiate into all the somatic cell types within the human body. In order for the huge potential of hPSC to be realised, many hurdles must first be overcome. The most basic of these is the development of consistent and scalable culture systems that allow sufficient expansion of hPSC without the loss of the stem cell identity.

40|$|Harmonization of {{terminology}} in <b>developmental</b> <b>toxicology</b> {{studies has}} high priority, since regulatory decisions are currently impeded by ambiguities and inconsistencies in the terminology {{used to describe}} structural anomalies. This {{was one of the}} reasons why the DevTox project was initiated by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and was sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (Environmental Research Plan/UFO-Plan), under the auspices of the International Programme on Chemical Safety. The website is freely accessible in the internet. The DevTox project consists of three main parts. The first is DevTox information. This aspect includes information on the project itself, the publications of the Berlin workshops, and a list of project partners. The second is the DevTox nomenclature, which is a harmonized terminology for <b>developmental</b> <b>toxicology,</b> based on the International Federation of Teratology Societies (IFTS) terminology with more than 1400 images of fetuses showing examples of external observations, skeletal defects, and soft tissue anomalies. The third is the DevTox database, which is currently under development and is intended to include historical and experimental data for the evaluation and comparison of developmental toxicity studies. The project is conducted in close cooperation between the BfR Berlin, the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Charité University Medical School, Berlin, and the Fraunhofer Institute of Toxicology and Experimental Medicine, Hannover, as well as further project partners from industry and government. The project benefited from the valuable contribution of many prominent international scientists from research institutions, regulatory agencies, and industry, and the support is gratefully acknowledged. The use of a harmonized and internationally accepted nomenclature is a basic requirement for the operation of a database like DevTox. A first approach to establishing such a harmonized terminology for <b>developmental</b> <b>toxicology</b> was made in 1997 by a publication of the IFTS from the 1995 Berlin workshop. Subsequent workshops had the goal to eliminate ambiguities and inconsistencies within the IFTS terminology and to establish working definitions for the two classification categories malformation and variation. The DevTox project has emerged from developments over many years. There are more challenges in the future, primarily related to an update of the current first version of the terminology. One of the next steps will be to implement the updated terminology in the DevTox project, and the authors will also in the future highly appreciate any critical remarks and, in particular, the submission of new images to complete this tool...|$|E
