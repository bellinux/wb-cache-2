40|$|In Europe, all Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) {{finance their}} {{activities}} by charging airlines {{to use their}} airspace. These `en route charges' usually account for a signi cant {{fraction of the cost}} of a flight, and they can therefore influence the route choice: airlines may decide to fly longer routes to avoid countries with higher charges. If ANSPs want to maximize their revenues, they must choose the optimal charge to impose on their airspace. We show that this optimal charge can be identi ed through a Network Pricing Problem formulation in the form of Bilevel Programming where the leader (i. e. the ANSP) owns a set of arcs (the airways in its national airspace) and charges the commodities (i. e. the flights) passing through them. As the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> <b>charges</b> are proportional to a Unit Rate value xed by the ANSP, by exploiting the structure of the problem we propose an exact algorithm to compute the optimal Unit Rate and apply it to a preliminary case study.

5000|$|The date of {{construction}} of the castle is uncertain; ranges have been given from the early 14th to the late 15th centuries. The first Mackworth, Henry du Mackworth, appears in the Pipe Rolls of 1254, and the MackWorth lineage can be followed from {{the early part of}} the 15th century. Mackworth castle remained in the family until 1655 or 1656, when it was sold by Sir Thomas Mackworth, 3rd Baronet, who had relocated to Normanton in Rutland, to Sir John Curzon, 1st Baronet. Local legend says that the castle was destroyed during the Parliamentary Civil War by some ordnance on a nearby hill. However, Rev. Charles Kerry of the Derbyshire Archaeological Society questions whether the castle had already begun to decline before its purchase by Curzon, noting that, [...] "Had Mackworth Castle been a place suitable for the reception of the Queen of Scots, Sir Ralph Sadler would not have overlooked it when <b>en</b> <b>route</b> with his <b>charge</b> for Tutbury." [...] Sadler chose to lodge Mary, Queen of Scots, a decision which irritated Queen Elizabeth. He wrote in explanation on 5 February 1584, that he would not have done so had there been any appropriate houses anywhere near that town in which to house his charge.|$|R

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{concerns about}} the impact of aircraft noise on people have centered around the takeoff and landing operations of aircraft in the vicinity of airport terminals. The development of the advanced turboprop (propfan) engine, modifications to air corridors, and the desire to maintain a natural environment in national parks and recreation areas have now focused attention on the impact at ground level of the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise produced by aircraft at cruise conditions and altitudes. Compared to terminal area noise, <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise is characterized by relatively low noise levels, lack of high frequency spectral content, and long durations. Much research has been directed towards understanding and quantifying the annoyance caused by terminal area aircraft noise, but relatively little research has been conducted for <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise. To address this need, a laboratory experiment was conducted to quantify the annoyance of people on the ground to <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise generated by aircraft at cruise conditions. The objectives of the experiment are to determine the annoyance prediction ability of noise measurement procedures and corrections when applied to <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise; to determine differences in annoyance response to <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise and takeoff/landing noise; and to determine differences in annoyance response to advanced turboprop <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise and conventional jet <b>en</b> <b>route</b> noise...|$|R

5000|$|Traffic {{management}} advisor (TMA), a CTAS tool, is an <b>en</b> <b>route</b> {{decision support}} tool that automates time based metering solutions {{to provide an}} upper limit of aircraft to a TRACON from the center over a set period of time. Schedules are determined that will not exceed the specified arrival rate and controllers use the scheduled times to provide the appropriate delay to arrivals while in the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> domain. This results in an overall reduction in <b>en</b> <b>route</b> delays and also moves the delays to more efficient airspace (higher altitudes) than occur if holding near the TRACON boundary, which is {{required in order to}} prevent overloading the TRACON controllers. TMA is operational at most <b>en</b> <b>route</b> air route traffic control centers (ARTCCs) and continues to be enhanced to address more complex traffic situations (e.g. adjacent center metering (ACM) and <b>en</b> <b>route</b> departure capability (EDC)) ...|$|R
40|$|While airport {{congestion}} {{has long}} been viewed as a major air traffic management problem in the United States, congestion in the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace is drawing an increasing amount of attention. Sources of <b>en</b> <b>route</b> congestion, such as severe weather, often cause the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to delay and reroute aircraft {{in order to ensure}} safety. Most current research into methods for managing <b>en</b> <b>route</b> congestion seeks to reduce delay or aid in aircraft rerouting. However, there has been less attention paid to delay and reroute allocation methods  an area in which {{there appears to be a}} pressing, practical need. Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) is a movement within the air traffic management community that has combined the interests of the FAA and industry to develop a universally-accepted resource rationing process for congested airports. There is high expectation that CDM can achieve similar success in developing a parallel rationing process for the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace. The CDM-inspired research underlying this thesis led to the development of a software tool, the <b>En</b> <b>Route</b> Resource Allocation Prototype (ERAP), that supports the analysis of alternative <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace rationing methods. In this thesis, we define a basic <b>en</b> <b>route</b> traffic flow management scenario, conduct experiments, and derive ERAP results which provide insight into rationing resources in the <b>en</b> <b>route</b> airspace domain. It is hoped that ERAP can serve as a baseline for future comparison and help lead to final industry acceptance of an ideal rationing solution...|$|R
