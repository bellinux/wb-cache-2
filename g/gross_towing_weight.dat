50|$|Trailer Sailers are boats {{small and}} {{light enough to}} be towed by {{ordinary}} cars. Their width (beam) is constrained by road regulations. In Europe, to be towable on the road {{the width of the}} boat and trailer must not exceed 2.55m. The maximum weight is determined by the towing capacity of the towing vehicle and by the type of driving license.Folding trimarans are particularly well suited as trailer sailers because their narrow width with folded floats makes them towable on the road whilst their wide beam with floats extended makes them stable and safe on the water. Furthermore, the absence of ballast makes them considerably lighter than a keelboat of similar size (240 kg for the Astus 16.1 compared to 800 kg for a 16 ft keelboat). Heavier boats require a stronger and heavier road trailer, making the <b>towing</b> <b>weight</b> even greater.|$|R

50|$|The player {{takes on}} the role of a {{mercenary}} lander pilot, looking to make his fortune while travelling on the interplanetary cruise ship Drake's Exception while it makes a historical voyage of visiting each planet of the solar system in turn due to the rare event of all the planets aligning. As the Drakes Exception stops at each planet, the player is able to take on missions tendered by various people and organisations. These missions are delivered to the player via a series of emails. The majority of missions on offer require the player to find the entrance of an underground complex, gain entry and locate a particular object which then must be brought to the surface by the use of the ship's tractor beam. When an object is being <b>towed,</b> its <b>weight</b> and momentum directly affects the handling of the Player's ship. Coupled with the various obstacles present in most missions, such as moving machinery, defensive turrets and armed ground vehicles, making your way to safety becomes a lot more difficult especially when you factor in limited fuel and the Player's inability to drop the cargo at will and re-fuel. There is at least one occasion where is not true however, as during the 'Macbeth colony' mission there is a fuel pod in the latter stage of the level where the cargo can be placed beside it, allowing the Player to re-fuel and more importantly, bring the cargo with them {{from the beginning of the}} mission rather than leaving it and then backtracking later on.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, many {{pickup trucks}} come {{equipped}} with {{one to three}} mounting holes placed in the center area of the rear bumper to accommodate the mounting of trailer tow balls. The ones on the extreme left or right are often used by drivers in rural areas who tow wide farm equipment on two-lane roads. The far side mounting allows for the item (trailer, etc.) being towed to be further away from {{the opposite side of}} the road (oncoming traffic, etc.). Caution must be taken when using the bumper of a pickup truck for towing rather than using a frame mounted receiver hitch, as the bumper does not provide for as much strength and therefore is generally used to <b>tow</b> lighter loads. <b>Weight</b> ratings for both bumper-mounted and frame-mounted receiver hitches can be found on bumper of pickup trucks (for bumper-mounted tow balls) and on the receiver hitch (for frame-mounted receiver hitches). Many pickup trucks without frame-mounted receiver hitches often use the rear bumper, especially if the pickup truck is a light duty (not full size) pickup truck.|$|R
50|$|MOWAG {{has built}} many {{different}} types of vehicles, such as ambulances, fire trucks (like the Mowag W300), dummy tanks, electric vehicles, scooters or tracked tanks. In the civilian sector, MOWAG has been particularly active in the construction of firefighting vehicles where several generations of emergency vehicles have been built on the Dodge pickups. Many models were based on factory designed firefighting trucks. In Germany, Mowag was well known for developing a four-wheel drive armored car, that was built under licence from Thyssen and Bussing / Henschel. In 1963, vehicles for the Federal Border Guard (Bundesgrenzschutz = BGS), MOWAG's production ran for decades.

The engine was mounted under the bed between the front and the rear axles. This allowed a compact design and low center of gravity in the middle of the vehicle.|$|R
40|$|With the {{examination}} of multinet catches (63 µm mesh size), the present study analyzes the distribution of planktonic foraminifera in Polar regions: the Labrador Sea, Greenland Sea at 75 °N and Fram Strait at 80 °N. The community of the planktonic foraminifera, which {{in the study area}} mainly consists of six species: left and right-coiling N. pachyderma, T. quinqueloba, G. bulloides, G. glutinata and G. uvula, is primarily controlled by the temperature in the different water masses. Besides hydrographic parameters, the changes in the horizontal and vertical distribution of N. pachyderma (s.) and T. quinqueloba as well as their shell size distribution in the study area are primarily influenced by the synchrone reproduction, which is coupled to the lunar cycle. Detailed examinations of the isotope signal in dependency on the shell size and weight for N. pachyderma (s.) and T. quinqueloba from plankton <b>tows,</b> indicated the <b>weight</b> or degree of calcification to not be the primary factor controlling the isotope signal of encrusted specimens.

40|$|Objective: Analysis of a {{clinical}} population referred for language analysis {{in terms of}} background variables and extent of language problems. Design: Descriptive study. Materials and methods: Children referred to a speech and hearing clinic because of assumed language problems were analyzed with standardized tests for language comprehension (Dutch version of the Reynell Developmental Comprehension Scale) and language production (Schlichting test for sentence development). A language problem was defined when the language quotient score differed 1. 3 S. D. from the mean (quotient scores <= 80). Furthermore, potential risk factors for language problems were compiled (gender, prematurity, birth weight, family composition, familial aggregation, parental education and daycare/home care). Results: Two hundred forty children, aged between 2 and 5 years of age {{were included in the}} study. A reliable language comprehension quotient (LCQ) was obtained in 204 children (85 %) and a reliable sentence development quotient (SDQ) in 206 children (85 %). In 35 % of the children who were assumed to have language problems, adequate language development was found. The children with language problems differed from the children without language problems with regard to language problems in the family (more family aggregation). Also the former more frequently had parents with a tow level of education and more often did not attend daycare. The total referred group differed from the Dutch population with regard to gender (more boys), more instances of <b>tow</b> birth <b>weight,</b> more parents with middle and high educational level, more two-parent households, fewer siblings, and more frequent attendance at daycare. Conclusion: Parents with a low level of education more frequently have children with language problems. However, parents with a middle and high level of education are more often concerned about the language development of their child. As a consequence, the overestimation of language problems is a real issue in clinical practice. Normal variations in language development often are not considered. The analysis of compiled background variables indicates that language problems are genetically influenced (gender and family aggregation). Language input also is of importance (interactions with a language-competent parent or caregiver and peers) : children with language problems less often attended daycare.

40|$|Given {{forecast}} aviation growth, many {{airports are}} predicted to reach capacity and require expansion. However, pressure to meet air quality regulations emphasises {{the importance of}} efficient ground-level aircraft activities to facilitate growth. Operational strategies such as reducing engine thrust setting at takeoff can reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions; however, quantification of the benefits and consistency of its use have been limited by data restrictions. Using 3, 336 high-resolution flight data records, this paper analyses the impact of reduced thrust takeoff at London Heathrow. Results indicate that using reduced thrust takeoff reduces fuel consumption, nitrogen oxides (NOX) and black carbon (BC) emissions by 1. 0 - 23. 2 %, 10. 7 - 47. 7 %, and 49. 0 - 71. 7 % respectively, depending on aircraft-engine combinations relative to 100 % thrust takeoff. Variability in thrust settings for the same aircraft-engine combination and dependence on takeoff <b>weight</b> (<b>TOW)</b> is quantified. Consequently, aircraft-engine specific optimum takeoff thrust settings that minimise fuel consumption and pollutant emissions for different aircraft TOWs are presented. Further reductions of 1. 9 %, 5. 8 % and 6. 5 % for fuel consumption, NOX and BC emissions could be achieved, equating to reductions of approximately 0. 4 %, 3. 5 % and 3. 3 % in total ground level fuel consumption, NOX and BC emissions. These results quantify the contribution that reduced thrust operations offer towards achieving industry environmental targets and air quality compliance, and imply that the current implementation of reduced thrust takeoff at Heathrow is near optimal, considering operational and safety constraints...|$|R
