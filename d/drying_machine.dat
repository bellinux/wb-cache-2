40|$|Titanium and its alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) {{are widely}} used in {{aerospace}} industries because of their light weight, high specific strength, and corrosion resistance. This study conducted a comparative experimental analysis of the machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V for conventional flood coolant <b>machining</b> and sustainable <b>dry</b> <b>machining.</b> The effect of cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut on machining performance has been evaluated for both conditions. The machining time and surface roughness {{were found to be}} lower in <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> compared to flood coolant machining. The tool wear was found to be unpredictable, and no significant difference was observed for <b>dry</b> and coolant <b>machining.</b> In a comparison of all the parameters, sustainable <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> was found to provide better performance in machining Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. This study also investigated the machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V using coated and uncoated tungsten carbide tools under dry conditions. Tool wear is a serious problem in the machining of titanium alloys in dry conditions. Heat dissipation from the toolworkpiece interface a difficult challenge in <b>dry</b> <b>machining,</b> resulting in the alloying of the workpiece to the tool surface. <b>Dry</b> <b>machining</b> with the coated tool was comparatively faster, and resulted in less tool wear than uncoated tools. Using the Titanium aluminum nitride TiAlN coated carbide tool during <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> provided a smoother surface finish with lower average surface roughness. The conclusion, therefore, is that the tool coating was found to be effective for the <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> of titanium alloys...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: These Super alloys sustain its {{strength}} at high temperature and pressure conditions. Such materials have great demand in aerospace industry, marine industry, {{and nuclear power}} plants. It is particularly used in the hot sections like engines, because of their high strength and corrosion resistance at high temperature and pressure but they are the most difficult to machine materials. Their high strength possesses large amount of heat generation while machining, which reduce life of tool. Strain rate sensitivity, work hardening and precipitation hardening of material leads to more tool wear. Surface integrity obtain while machining of superalloys is poor. Poor surface finish and high residual stresses are the main causes of failure of these material components. Cutting fluid apply at high pressure in chip forming zone. It affects environment and create problem of disposal of cutting fluid. So <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> should be employed.

Once the shoots began [...] "jointing," [...] their nutritional value began to dissipate as the plant reserved all of its food value to send into forming the seed kernels. Schnabel continued to explain {{that he was looking}} for a way to preserve the nutritional value of the young grasses to increase their shelf life. In 1935 Schnabel, then an employee of American Dairies approached Lynwood Smith to request the use of an unused <b>drying</b> <b>machine.</b> When Smith asked Schnabel why he wanted to use the machine Schnabel answered [...] "…to dry grasses." [...] His answer led to a three-hour discussion in Smith's office. His experiments had indicated that the young grass shoots had to be dried quickly, which was the reason behind his request for the unused <b>drying</b> <b>machine.</b> This is the key finding that separates wheat grass grown and harvested at the jointing stage from cereal grasses grown in trays indoors or harvested at any other time in the growing process. The jointing process is why Schnabel’s wheat grass was superior in terms of total nutritional value. This still holds true today. Through his research and experiments, Dr. Schnabel found that in nearly every case, cereal grass contained a higher level of vitamins than other foods. With all the discoveries, people were clamoring for a way to increase the vitamins in their diets. Schnabel's Cerophyl was the answer. With the recommended 20 tablets per day, people could receive their minimum daily requirements of most of the known vitamins.|$|E

40|$|A new cooling {{approach}} with cryogenic compressed air {{has been developed}} in order to cool the cutting tool edge during turning of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The cutting forces, chip morphology and chip temperature were measured and compared with those measured during machining with compressed air cooling and dry cutting conditions. The chip temperature is lower with cryogenic compressed air cooling than those with compressed air cooling and <b>dry</b> <b>machining.</b> The combined effects of reduced friction and chip bending away from the cutting zone {{as a result of}} the high-speed air produce a thinner chip with cryogenic compressed air cooling and a thicker chip with compressed air cooling compared to <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> alone. The marginally higher cutting force associated with the application of cryogenic compressed air compared with <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> is the result of lower chip temperatures and a higher shear plane angle. The tendency to form a segmented chip is higher when machining with cryogenic compressed air than that with compressed air and <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> only within the ranges of cutting speed and feed when chip transitions from continuous to the segmented. The effect of cryogenic compressed air on the cutting force and chip formation diminishes with increase in cutting speed and feed rate. The application of both compressed air and cryogenic compressed air reduced flank wear and the tendency to form the chip built-up edge. This resulted in a smaller increase in cutting forces (more significantly in the feed force) after cutting long distance compared with that observed in <b>dry</b> <b>machining...</b>|$|R

50|$|An {{increasingly}} popular trend is to freeze dry the animal. For {{all intents and}} purposes, a freeze-dried mount is a mummified animal that still has fur on it. The internal organs are removed during preparation; however, all other tissue remains in the body. (The skeleton and all accompanying musculature is still {{beneath the surface of}} the fur.) The animal is positioned into the desired pose, then placed into the chamber of a special freeze <b>drying</b> <b>machine</b> designed specifically for this application. The machine freezes the animal and also creates a vacuum in the chamber. Pressure in the chamber helps vaporize moisture in the animal's body, allowing it to dry out. The rate of drying depends on vapor pressure. (The higher the pressure, the faster the specimen dries.) Vapor pressure is determined by temperature of the chamber; the higher the temperature, the higher the vapor pressure is at a given vacuum. The length of the dry-time is important because rapid freezing creates less tissue distortion (i.e.; shrinkage, warping, and wrinkling) The process can be done with reptiles, birds, and small mammals such as cats, rodents, and some dogs. Large specimens may require up to six months in the freeze dryer before they are completely dry. Freeze drying is the most popular type of pet preservation. This is because it is the least invasive in terms of what is done to the animal's body after death, which is a concern of owners (Most owners do not opt for a traditional skin mount).In the case of large pets, such as dogs and cats, freeze dying is also the best way to capture the animal's expression as it looked in life (another important concern of owners). Freeze drying equipment is costly and requires much upkeep. The process is also time-consuming; therefore, freeze drying is generally an expensive method to preserve an animal. The drawback to this method is that freeze-dried mounts are extremely susceptible to insect damage. This is because they contain large areas of dried tissue (meat and fat) for insects to feed upon. Traditional mounts are far less susceptible because they contain virtually no residual tissues (or none at all). Regardless of how well a taxidermy mount is prepared, all taxidermy is susceptible to insect damage. Taxidermy mounts are targeted by the same beetles and fabric moths that destroy wool sweaters and fur coats and that infest grains and flour in pantries.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringThe {{metal cutting}} process, known as {{conventional}} machining process, utilizes cutting fluids to provide lubrication, cooling and easy chip removal. The {{long-term effects of}} cutting fluids disposal into the environment are becoming increasingly evident. Research has also proven the health hazards on manufacturing workers who come {{in direct contact with}} cutting fluids. The formulation of stringent rules and restrictions on use and disposal of cutting fluids has increased the cost associated with cutting fluids use to between 7 % and 17 % of total manufacturing cost. The <b>dry</b> <b>machining</b> process considered in this thesis, using diamond-coated tools for the machining of aluminum eliminates cutting fluids from the cutting process.
