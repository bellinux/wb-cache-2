The recent growth in the availability of on-line financial news sources such as internet news and social media sources provides instantaneous access to financial news. Various commercial agencies have started developing their own filtered financial news feeds which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. Thomson Reuters News Analytics (TRNA) 2 is one such data set. In this study we use the TRNA data set to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock index component companies. We use these daily DJIA market sentiment scores to study the relationship between financial news sentiment scores and the stock prices of these companies using entropy measures. The entropy and Mutual Information (MI) statistics permit {{an analysis of the}} amount of information within the sentiment series, its relationship to the DJIA and an indication of how the relationship changes over time...|$|R

The DJIA fell 3.81 percent on October 14, followed by another 4.60 percent drop on Friday, October 16. On Black Monday, the <b>Dow</b> <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrials</b> Average plummeted 508 points, losing 22.6% of its value in one day. The S&P 500 dropped 20.4%, falling from 282.7 to 225.06. The NASDAQ Composite lost only 11.3%, not because of restraint on the part of sellers, but because the NASDAQ market system failed. Deluged with sell orders, many stocks on the NYSE faced trading halts and delays. Of the 2,257 NYSE-listed stocks, there were 195 trading delays and halts during the day. The NASDAQ market fared much worse. Because of its reliance on a [...] "market making" [...] system that allowed market makers to withdraw from trading, liquidity in NASDAQ stocks dried up.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model for the {{estimation}} of time series returns of illiquid asset portfolios. The model has four major advantages. First, the estimators are arithmetic averages of individual asset returns (or their proxies), so they strictly correspond to the portfolio returns.

Third, the model is very general and accommodates methods proposed in previous research. Fourth, the model is able to use both price data and data of asset characteristics to improve efficiency of estimators. It is also able to correct for the sample bias problem that transactions may take place more likely on over-valued assets.

Both nominal and real stockprices then go through a catch-up phase during the subsequent disinflation period. The history for this century is consistent with this pattern. Regression analysis between real and nominal stock prices as the dependent variables and inflation as the independent variable shows statistically significant evidence that (a) nominal stock returns are positively related to inflation while real stock returns are not; and (b) both nominal and real stock returns are negatively related to accelerations of inflation and positively related to decelerations...|$|E
