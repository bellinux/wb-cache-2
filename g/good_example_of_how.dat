25|$|Until the 1960s, {{there was}} little focus on long-distance freight between the major centres. Instead, the Main South Line was used to feed its many branch lines, with the {{majority}} of goods trains being local services between regional areas and major centres or harbours in Christchurch (Lyttelton), Timaru, Oamaru, Dunedin (Port Chalmers), and Invercargill (Bluff). A <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> regionalised this traffic was comes from the Dunedin-Invercargill portion of the line. North of Clinton were five branches whose traffic essentially ran to and from Dunedin/Port Chalmers, while south of Clinton were four branches whose traffic essentially ran to or from Invercargill/Bluff. As this short-distance local traffic declined in the 1950s and 1960s and branch lines closed, long-distance freight increased, with through services between the major centres rising to prominence. The concentration of exports on fewer ports and the development of containerisation spurred on long-distance freight, and the first freight train from Christchurch to Invercargill was introduced in December 1970 on a 16-hour schedule.|$|E

Technology Tell writer, Jenni Lada described Mini Metro as [...] "aesthetically pleasing" [...] and found {{playing the game}} an oddly relaxing experience, despite the game's attempt to put the player under pressure. Lena LeRay, of IndieGames.com, also felt that Mini Metro had a relaxing tone and complimented its intuitive interface. LeRay appreciated changes that were made during the early access phase, noting that audio and the Daily Challenge mode were welcome additions, and the interface improvements had diminished her initial complaints about the game. Reviewing the PC version, GamesTM thought that the depth of Mini Metros gameplay along with the difficulty scaling kept the game interesting. However, they did question why the game hadn't been released for smartphones yet, pointing out that such devices would be suited for the game's simple interface. Kill Screen editor, Ethan Gach commended the game for its simplicity and elegance, having combined interactive aesthetics with a robust simulation. Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun praised the game for being a [...] "mesmerising challenge of logic and aesthetics". He particularly enjoyed how beautifully the gameplay descended into chaos as the difficulty gradually increased, calling it [...] "elegant even in disaster". He also thought that Mini Metro was a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to release game in early access. Reviewing the mobile version, Gamezebo writer Rob Rich commended the visual design and intuitive touch controls. He thought {{that the use of}} geometric shapes to represent commuters and stations helped simplify the complicated tasks, resulting in an accessible game. Pocket Gamer reviewer Christian Valentin remarked that the game felt confusing early on but became [...] "surprisingly engaging".|$|E

She ultimately gave the episode a 7.8/10, concluding that it was a [...] "good" [...] episode. Michael Tedder of New York gave a positive review and praised the scene featuring Jim and Dwight {{on the roof of the}} bus, and praised their dynamic for maturing over the years. Tedder also complimented Cranston's direction in the episode, commenting that the [...] "cramped quality of 'Work Bus' was well matched with Cranston's talents".

He suggested that the writers could tell jokes, but could not successfully [...] "break a story anymore". He also called the subplot a mixed bag for featuring Dwight as a caricature of his former self, but complimented the character development for Darryl which started in [...] "Lotto". He gave the episodes a C+. Hannah Lawrence of Hollywood.com called the episode a large improvement over [...] "Gettysburg" [...] and also called it possibly her [...] "favorite episode of the season so far". Chris Plante of New York called Robert California the worst part of The Office and said that he kept Andy from being more of a lead character for the series. TV Guide writer Bruce Fretts criticized the episode for under using guest star Maura Tierney. He also said that the episode suffered without former series star Steve Carell to serve as the comic foil. IGN writer Cindy White said the episode did not feel like The Office and called it [...] "the exact opposite". Despite this, she went on to compliment Susan asking Andy on a date and the pairing of Darryl and Val as a couple, saying that the latter had possibilities. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5/10. Joseph Kratzer from What Culture? gave the episode three out of five stars and wrote, [...] "I'm going {{to go out on a}} bit of a limb here and say that while 'Mrs. California' was of course not a return to form for The Office, it was a <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the series might define itself in this new Michael-less era."

[...] After viewing [...] "Mrs. California," [...] Washington Post writer Hank Stuever named The Office one of the ten best TV shows of 2011 and said that the episode proved the series could still deliver cringe humor without Carell.
