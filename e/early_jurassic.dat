50|$|A {{fragment}} {{of a lower}} jaw from a longirostrine archosaur has been described from early Hettangian strata {{in the town of}} Watchet in Somerset, England. While teleosaurid thalattosuchians had similar longirostrine jaws to phytosaurs and were common in the Jurassic, they do not appear in <b>earliest</b> <b>Jurassic</b> rocks. The mandible is more similar to those of known phytosaurs than to thalattosuchians, and likely belongs to a phytosaur closely related to the genus Mystriosuchus. The presence of phytosaurs in the <b>earliest</b> <b>Jurassic</b> may have prevented thalattosuchians from occupying similar ecological niches at that time. However, more recent work suggests that the jaw fragment came from a pre-Hettangian rock unit, and is therefore Late Triassic in age.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known eodoceroceratoidean is the eoderoceratid genus Microderoceras. Although {{its origin}} is uncertain, {{it is likely}} that it is derived from the Psiloceratoidea. It has also been proposed, with some imagination, that Microderoceas has its origin some <b>earlier</b> <b>Jurassic</b> lytoceratid such as Analytoceras.|$|R
5|$|The crocodylomorphs are {{the only}} pseudosuchians to have survived the Triassic–Jurassic {{extinction}} event, 201.3 million years ago. During the <b>early</b> <b>Jurassic</b> period, the dinosaurs became dominant on land, and the crocodylomorphs underwent major adaptive diversications to fill ecological niches vacated by recently extinguished groups. Unfolding fossil evidence shows that Mesozoic crocodylomorphs had a much greater diversity of forms than modern crocodilians. Some became small fast-moving insectivores, others specialist fish-eaters, still others marine and terrestrial carnivores, and a few became herbivores. The earliest stage of crocodilian evolution was the protosuchians, which evolved in the late Triassic and <b>early</b> <b>Jurassic.</b> They were followed by the mesosuchians, which diversified widely during the Jurassic and the Tertiary. Another group, the eusuchians, appeared in the late Cretaceous 80 million years ago and includes all the crocodilians living today.|$|E
5|$|The faunas and floras of the <b>Early</b> <b>Jurassic</b> {{were similar}} worldwide, with {{conifers}} adapted for hot weather becoming the common plants; basal sauropodomorphs and theropods {{were the main}} constituents of a worldwide dinosaur fauna. The environment of <b>early</b> <b>Jurassic</b> southern Africa {{has been described as}} a desert. African Massospondylus was a contemporary of temnospondyli; turtles; a sphenodontia; rauisuchids; early crocodylomorphs; tritylodontid and trithelodontid therapsids; morganucodontid mammals; and dinosaurs including the small theropod Coelophysis rhodesiensis and several genera of early ornithischians, such as Lesothosaurus and the heterodontosaurids Abrictosaurus, Heterodontosaurus, Lycorhinus and Pegomastax. Until recently, Massospondylus was regarded as the only known sauropodomorph from the Upper Elliot Formation. However, newer finds revealed a diverse contemporary sauropodomorph fauna with six additional species, including Ignavusaurus,Arcusaurus and two unnamed taxa as well as two unnamed sauropods.|$|E
5|$|Cryolophosaurus {{originally}} was {{collected during the}} 1990–91 austral summer on Mount Kirkpatrick in the Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains.

5|$|While the {{traprock}} cliffs {{remain the}} most obvious evidence of the prehistoric geologic processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life {{in the form of}} Triassic and Jurassic fossils; in particular, dinosaur tracks. At a state park in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, more than 2,000 well preserved <b>early</b> <b>Jurassic</b> prints have been excavated. Other sites in Holyoke and Greenfield have likewise produced significant finds.|$|E
5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the <b>Early</b> <b>Jurassic.</b> Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs to browse on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E
50|$|Rhomaleosauridae is {{a family}} of pliosauroid plesiosaurs from the <b>Earliest</b> <b>Jurassic</b> to the latest Middle Jurassic (Hettangian to Callovian stages) of Europe, North America, South America and {{possibly}} Asia. Most rhomaleosaurids are known from England, many specifically from lower Blue Lias deposits that {{date back to the}} <b>earliest</b> <b>Jurassic,</b> just at the boundary with the Triassic. In fact, to date only two undisputed rhomaleosaurid low life Europe - the closely related Borealonectes russelli and Maresaurus coccai from Canada and Argentina, respectively. These two species are also the only Middle Jurassic representatives of the family. Rhomaleosauridae was formally named by Kuhn in 1961, originally proposed to include Rhomaleosaurus cramptoni and its relatives, which have short necks and large heads relatively to plesiosauroids like Elasmosaurus and Plesiosaurus, but longer necks and smaller heads relatively to advanced pliosaurids like Pliosaurus and Kronosaurus.|$|R
40|$|The Newark basin {{contains}} a 7 -km-thick sedimentary section, which spans approximately 25 m. y. of the Late Triassic and <b>earliest</b> <b>Jurassic</b> (middle Carnian to Hettangian). Previously paleomagnetic {{study of the}} Newark red beds has demonstrated that complete progressive thermal demagnetization can effectively isolate a high-temperature characteristic magnetization. In the lower Newark strata (middle Carnian to early Norian in age), this magnetization yielded a pole position at 54 °N, 102 °E, and in the upper Newark strata (Hettangian in age) a pole position at 55 °N, 95 °E. Results from 23 new sites {{in the middle and}} upper Norian red beds of the Passaic Formation, including 15 sites from the Jacksonwald region that yield a positive fold test, fill the temporal gap between our two prior studies and yield a pole position at 56 °N, 95 °E (A 95 = 4. 4 °). These results from the middle Newark confirm that North American apparent polar wander was very slow (~ 0. 2 °/m. y.) during the Late Triassic through <b>earliest</b> <b>Jurassic.</b> These new sites define reversed and normal polarity magnetozones that are stratigraphically consistent with and extend our previous results. The Newark reversed and normal polarity characteristic magnetizations form a correlatable pattern of 12 magnetozones that are stratigraphically coherent throughout the basin with respect to independent lithostratigraphic marker units that reflect synchronous, basinwide variations in water depth. Temporal calibration of the Newark magnetostratigraphy on the basis of biostratigraphy, radiometric age determinations, and Milankovich-driven cyclostratigraphy indicates that geomagnetic polarity was reversed 70 % of the time and that the mean polarity duration was 2 m. y. or less during the Late Triassic and <b>earliest</b> <b>Jurassic...</b>|$|R

5|$|It is {{not clear}} which {{carnivores}} may have preyed on Massospondylus. Most of the theropods that have been discovered in rocks of <b>Early</b> <b>Jurassic</b> age in southern Africa, such as Coelophysis, were smaller than mid-sized sauropodomorphs like Massospondylus. These smaller predators have been postulated as using fast slashing attacks to wear down sauropodomorphs, which could have defended themselves with their large hand and foot claws. The 6-metre-(20ft-) long carnivorous theropod Dracovenator lived {{during the same period}} (Hettangian to Sinemurian stages) as Massospondylus and has also been found in the Elliot Formation of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|One aetosaur, Typothorax coccinarum, {{has been}} used to define the Revueltian land {{vertebrate}} faunachron. A land vertebrate faunachron (LVF) is a time interval that is defined by the first appearance datum (FAD), or first occurrence, of a tetrapod index fossil and is commonly used to date Late Triassic and <b>Early</b> <b>Jurassic</b> terrestrial strata. Since the FAD of T. coccinarum is {{at the beginning of the}} Norian stage, the Revueltian LVF starts at the beginning of the Norian around 216 million years ago. The Revueltian ends with the next FAD, which happens to be that of the phytosaur Redondasaurus and the start of the Apachean LVF.|$|E
5|$|The {{earlier and}} more basal genus Huayangosaurus from the Middle Jurassic of China (some 165 {{million years ago}} – Mya) antedates Stegosaurus by 20 million years {{and is the only}} genus in the family Huayangosauridae.

Emausaurus from Germany was another small quadruped, while Scutellosaurus from Arizona was an even earlier genus and was facultatively bipedal. These small, lightly armored dinosaurs were closely related to the direct ancestor of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. A trackway of a possible early armored dinosaur, from around 195 Mya, has been found in France.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} Paleozoic, the crinoids and blastoids were the {{predominant}} echinoderms, and some limestones {{from this period}} are made almost entirely from fragments from these groups. In the two major extinction events {{that occurred during the}} late Devonian and late Permian, the blastoids were wiped out and only a few species of crinoids survived. Many starfish species also became extinct in these events, but afterwards the surviving few species diversified rapidly within about sixty million years during the <b>Early</b> <b>Jurassic</b> {{and the beginning of the}} Middle Jurassic. A 2012 study found that speciation in starfish can occur rapidly. During the last 6,000 years, divergence in the larval development of Cryptasterina hystera and Cryptasterina pentagona has taken place, the former adopting internal fertilization and brooding and the latter remaining a broadcast spawner.|$|E
5|$|Heterodontosaurids {{are named}} for their {{strongly}} heterodont dentition. There were three premaxillary teeth. In the <b>Early</b> <b>Jurassic</b> Abrictosaurus, Heterodontosaurus, and Lycorhinus, {{the first two}} premaxillary teeth were small and conical, while the much larger third tooth resembled the canines of carnivoran mammals and is often called the caniniform or 'tusk'. A lower caniniform, larger than the upper, took the first position in the dentary and was accommodated by the arched diastema of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. These caniniforms were serrated on both the anterior and posterior edges in Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus, while those of Abrictosaurus bore serrations only on the anterior edge. In the Early Cretaceous Echinodon, {{there may have been}} two upper caniniforms, which were on the maxilla rather than the premaxilla, and Fruitadens from the Late Jurassic may have had two lower caniniforms on each dentary.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, the {{estimated}} number of dinosaur species {{that existed in}} the Mesozoic era was estimated to be 1,543–2,468. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous, including seed-eaters, fish-eaters, insectivores, and omnivores. While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some prehistoric species were quadrupeds, and others, such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon, could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the <b>early</b> <b>Jurassic</b> period. Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as Microraptor) could fly or at least glide, and others, such as spinosaurids, had semi-aquatic habits.|$|E

5|$|In {{evolutionary}} terms, {{the split}} between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the Permo-Triassic boundary; the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups {{are found in the}} <b>early</b> <b>Jurassic.</b> Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, especially those of the male.

5|$|Quarries of {{the local}} blue lias stone were worked from {{as early as the}} 12th century {{to the end of the}} 19th century.

The Blue Lias consists of a sequence of limestone and shale layers, laid down in latest Triassic and <b>early</b> <b>Jurassic</b> times, between 195 and 200 million years ago. Its age corresponds to the Rhaetian to lower Sinemurian stages of the geologic timescale, thus fully including the Hettangian stage. It is the lowest of the three divisions of the Lower Jurassic period and, as such, is also given the name Lower Lias. It consists of thin blue argillaceous, or clay-like, limestone. The Blue Lias contains many fossils, especially ammonites. Fossils discovered in the lias include many ichthyosaurs, one of which has been adopted as the badge of Street. There is a display of Street fossils in the Natural History Museum in London.|$|E
