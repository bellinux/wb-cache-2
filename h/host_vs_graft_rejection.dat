30|$|The {{second major}} type of CAR is allogeneic, or universal. An “off-the-shelf” cell line is constructed, {{typically}} devoid of MHC class I molecules (Ren et al., 2017 a) and endogenous T cell receptors (MacLeod et al., 2017; Ren et al., 2017 a) {{to decrease the}} risk of <b>host</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>graft</b> (<b>rejection)</b> and graft vs. host disease (GvHD), respectively. This universal T cell line also would express CARs for treatment of cancer or possibly viral infections. Thus far, the barriers to generate truly off the-shelf allogeneic cell lines are still quite high, with control of proliferation, continued activation of the cells once they are engrafted, and incorporation of kill switches for safety purposes as critical issues still to be worked out. Nevertheless, significant {{progress has been made}} in just the past year suggesting that fully modified allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy is quickly becoming a reality (Ren et al., 2017 a, b). To date, there are four generations of autologous CAR-T cell constructs. The first generation typically consisted of the extracellular, cancer cell-targeting scFv fused to the CD 8 stalk and transmembrane domain followed by CD 247 (aka CD 3 ζ), which provided the activation signal (Park and Brentjens, 2010; Figueroa et al., 2015; Lim and June, 2017). The first generation CARs possessed ample cytotoxicity but lacked proliferative and survival signals. The second-generation CARs typically linked the exodomain scFv to the transmembrane domain of CD 28, TNFRSF 9 (CD 137, 4 - 1 BB), or TNFRSF 4 (OX 40) to provide a proliferation signal, followed by CD 247 (CD 3 ζ) to provide the cytolytic activation signal. The third generation CARs have typically linked the targeting scFv to the CD 28 transmembrane domain, followed by either the TNFRSF 9 (CD 137, 4 - 1 BB), or TNFRSF 4 (OX 40) activation domains, and then CD 247 (CD 3 ζ) (Park and Brentjens, 2010; Figueroa et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2016; Lim and June, 2017). These CARs combined cytolytic activity with both proliferation and survival signals to enhance both their activity and their persistence in the patient’s serum. Fourth generation CARs add new activities such as a suicide mechanism to kill off the CARs in case they become over-proliferative, or utilize T cells that have been conditioned to recognize viral antigens which can be used as “vaccines” to increase the persistence of the CAR-T construct (Chmielewski et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2016; Lim and June, 2017).|$|E
40|$|Objective:to {{study the}} histopathological {{characteristics}} of prosthetic vascular graft infection. Design:prospective clinical study over 2 years. Setting:University Hospital. Materials: 36 infected and 29 uninfected (control) chronically implanted vascular prostheses (half aortic) were removed and 352 sections prepared. Chief outcome measures:light microscopy (multiple stains), {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), and multiple culture techniques to identify characteristics of healing, infection, and microorganisms. Main results:Acute inflammation (AI) (neurophils, granulocytes and necrosis) were seen in 75 % of infected grafts, were most prominent in the perigraft tissue and rarely seen on the luminal surface. These were usually well localised, leaving the remainder of a graft well incorporated with no signs of infection. In 25 % of clinically infected, culture-positive grafts {{there was no significant}} acute inflammation. Chronic inflammation (CI) (macrophages, lymphocytes, monocytes, giant cells) was seen in 70 % of both control and infected grafts. In 50 % of both groups a significant lymphocytic population was composed exclusively of T-lymphocytes suggesting a true <b>host</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>graft</b> response. Unincorporated chronically implanted grafts (> 1 yr) were seen with equal frequency in the two groups although more diffusely unincorporated grafts were infected. Microorganisms were cultured from 23 infected grafts (64 %) and were, at microscopy, mostly found outside the graft and nerves on the luminal side. Conclusions:This data cast doubt on criteria commonly used to distinguish <b>graft</b> infections and <b>host</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>graft</b> reactions from normal graft healing. Acute and chronic inflammation are not predictive of infection...|$|R
40|$|A marked {{suppression}} of the thymusderived (T) -lymphocyte response to concanavalin A has been demonstrated in vitro during renal infection. Suppression of the T-lymphocyte response in vitro was seen as early as 2 h after the induction of renal infection, but maximum suppression was found 24 - 72 h later. A population of suppressor cells in the splenic lymphocyte population, generated during the host's response to infection, contributed to the depressed lymphocyte response. Removal of suppressor cells restored the mitogenic responsiveness of the remaining splenic lymphocytes. Conversely, in co-culture experiments, a suppressor cell present in the splenic lymphocyte population of pyelonephritic animals was shown {{to be capable of}} suppressing the mitogenic responsiveness of normal splenic lymphocytes.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{model of}} stable uraemia {{has been used}} to determine the effect of uraemia on cell-mediated immune mechanisms in the rat. Controlled resection of renal tissue allowed the establishment of a 'moderate' (blood urea 100 - 200 mg/ 100 ml) and 'severe' grade of uraemia (BU > 200 mg/ 100 ml). The immune responsiveness of isolated lymphocyte suspensions from uraemic animals was similar to that of sham-operated animals but lymphocyte function in both groups was suppressed compared with control non-manipulated animals. This was particularly evident in the <b>graft</b> <b>vs</b> <b>host</b> reaction. The <b>host</b> <b>vs</b> <b>graft</b> which assumes the cell-mediated immune status in the live animals, was also depressed in the uraemic animals but in contrast to the previous results sham-operated animals exhibited normal responses.

This not only {{leads to a}} loss of sensor signal over time, but can also result in undesired <b>host</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>graft</b> reactions. Within this study we evaluated the hemocompatibility of isocyanate conjugated star shaped polytheylene oxide—polypropylene oxide co-polymers NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) when applied to gold surfaces as an auspicious coating material for gold sputtered blood contacting sensors. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors were coated with ultrathin NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) films and compared with uncoated gold sensors. Protein resistance was assessed by QCM measurements with fibrinogen solution and platelet poor plasma (PPP), followed by quantification of fibrinogen adsorption. Hemocompatibility was tested by incubation with human platelet rich plasma (PRP). Thrombin antithrombin-III complex (TAT), β-thromboglobulin (β-TG) and platelet factor 4 (PF 4) were used as coagulation activation markers. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize platelet adhesion to the sensor surfaces. Compared to uncoated gold sensors, NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) coated sensors revealed significant better resistance against protein adsorption, lower TAT generation and a lower amount of adherent platelets. Moreover, coating with ultrathin NCO-sP(EO-stat-PO) films creates a cell resistant hemocompatible surface on gold that increases the chance of prolonged sensor functionality and can easily be modified with specific receptor molecules...|$|R
40|$|Killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs) {{are major}} human NK receptors {{displaying}} either inhibitory or activating functions which recognize allotypic determinants of HLA-class I molecules. Surprisingly, NK cell treatment with CpG-ODN (TLR 9 ligands) results in selective down-modulation of KIR 3 DL 2, its co-internalization with CpG-ODN and its translocation to TLR 9 -rich early endosomes. This novel KIR-associated function may offer clues {{to better understand}} the possible role of certain KIRs and also emphasizes the involvement of NK cells in the course of microbial infections. NK cells are involved not only in innate immune responses against viruses and tumors but also participate in the complex network of cell-to cell interaction that leads to the development of adaptive immune responses. In this context the interaction of NK cells with DC appears to {{play a crucial role in}} the acquisition of CCR 7, a chemokine receptor that enables NK cells to migrate towards lymph nodes in response to CCL 19 and/or CCL 21. Analysis of NK cell clones revealed that KIR-mismatched but not KIR-matched NK cells acquire CCR 7. These data have important implications in haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), in which KIR-mismatched NK cells may acquire the ability to migrate to secondary lymphoid compartments (SLCs), where they can kill recipient's antigen presenting cells (APCs) and T cells thus preventing graft versus <b>host</b> (and <b>host</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>graft)</b> reactions. © 2011 Springer Science+Businees Media, LLC...|$|R
40|$|The {{bidirectional}} {{paradigm of}} tolerance involving reciprocal <b>host</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>graft</b> and <b>graft</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>host</b> reactions was examined after Lewis (LEW) → Brown Norway (BN) transplantation of different whole organs (liver, intestine, heart, and kidney) or of 2. 5 × l 0 8 LEW leukocytes obtained from bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus. The experiments were performed without immunosuppression or under 14 daily doses of postoperative tacrolimus, which were continued in weekly doses to 100 {{days in a}} “continuous treatment” subgroup, and to 27 days in a short treatment group. Without immunosuppression, all organs and cell suspensions failed to engraft or were acutely rejected. GVHD (usually fatal) was always caused when either the long or short treatment was used for recipients of intestinal grafts and cell suspensions of spleen and lymph nodes. In contrast, both immunosuppressive protocols allowed engraftment of bone marrow cells, liver, heart, and kidney without clinical GVHD, whereas thymus cell suspensions and small doses of whole blood neither engrafted nor caused GVHD. At 100 days, now drug-free for 73 days, the liver, bone marrow, and heart recipients were tolerant in that they accepted all challenge LEW heart and/or liver grafts for 100 more days despite in vitro evidence of donor-specific reactivity (split tolerance). At 200 days, histopathologic studies of the challenge livers were normal {{no matter what the}} priming graft. However, the still-beating challenge hearts had a spectrum from normal to severe chronic rejection that defined the tolerogenicity of the original primary grafts: liver best → bone marrow next → heart least. Both the GVHD propensity and tolerogenicity in these experiments were closely associated with recipient tissue chimer-ism 30 and 100 days after the experiments began. The tissue chimerism was invariably multilineage, but the GVHD outcome was associated with T cell over-repre-sentation. These observations provide guidelines that should be considered in devising leukocyte augmentation protocols for human whole organ recipients. The results are discussed in relation to the historical tolerance studies of Billingham, Brent, and Medawar; Good; Monaco; and Caine. © 1995 by Williams and Wilkins...|$|R

In this study, a non-targeted metabonomics approach based on ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MS) is used to investigate the effect of acute <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> in rat renal transplantation on metabolism. To collect more metabolite information both hydrophilic interaction chromatography and reversed-phase liquid chromatography were used.

40|$|Transplantation is an {{established}} and successful treatment for critically ill patients. For {{many of the}} organ transplant recipients (OTR) {{it is the only}} option for survival. When OTRs are asked about what they fear the most, the most common answer is <b>graft</b> <b>rejection.</b> <b>Graft</b> <b>rejection</b> is a real threat against an OTR since it is the body’s natural way, through its immunological defence, to protect itself against foreign bodies or unknown substances. Aim: The primary aim of this thesis was to explore the risk of <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> from the perspective of OTRs by describing the characteristics of the threat experience. A secondary aim was to investigate the relationships between the perceived threat of the risk of <b>graft</b> <b>rejection,</b> by means of a domain specific questionnaire, and selected associated factors such as coping strategies and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). Methods: The efforts to acquire scientific knowledge included seeking the unique in each individual case as well as group correlations. For this reason, the data collection methods were both inductive and deductive and included interviews and questionnaires. The study group consisted of 1) 16 adult OTR, 2) 8 adolescent OTR, 3) 185 adult OTR, 4) 185 adult OTR. The instruments used to collect data were SF- 36, General Coping Questionnaire (GCQ) and the Perceived Threat of the risk of <b>Graft</b> <b>Rejection</b> (PTGR) which was developed for the purpose in this thesis. Data analysis was performed mainly by descriptive and parametric statistical methods {{as well as by the}} use of phenomenography. Results: Adult OTRs perceived <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> in various ways involving five domains; abstract threat to life, concrete threat to health, trust in the body, striving to control the threat and one’s identity. There were also various ways of learning about <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> involving three domains; experience of <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> that was accompanied by symptoms and personal observations, experience of <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> in the absence of physical symptoms and personal observations and no experience of <b>graft</b> <b>rejection.</b> The adolescents’ perceptions were grouped into seven domains: tests and examinations, transplantation, medication, <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> as a condition, <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> and its consequences, friends and oneself as an organ transplant recipient. It was possible to develop an instrument for measuring the perceived threat of <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> and three homogenous and psychometrically sound factors were identified. These were labelled intrusive anxiety, graftrelated threat and lack of control. A majority (74 %) reported a low level of intrusive anxiety. The kidney transplant recipients reported more graft related threat than other OTRs. The differences between the transplanted organ groups in their use of coping strategies were small. Likewise, coping related very weakly with sex, age, time since transplantation and whether they had experienced <b>graft</b> <b>rejections</b> or not. The respondents tended in general to use more of ‘positive’ coping strategies (strategies related to positive well-being).

It was possible to measure the perceived threat of <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> among OTRs with an instrument comprising twelve items.

40|$|Studies so far {{indicate}} that reduced intensity transplantation (RIT) {{may have an}} important role in treating patients with primary immunodeficiency disease (PID). Unlike more standard approaches, such regimens can be used without severe toxicity in patients with severe pulmonary or hepatic disease. RIT also offers the advantage that long-term sequelae such as infertility or growth retardation may be avoided or reduced. RIT appears to be most appropriate for those patients with significant co-morbidities (eg T cell deficiencies) and those undergoing unrelated donor haematopoietic cell transplantation. More studies are required using pharmacokinetic monitoring (eg busulphan, treosulfan and alemtuzumab) and varying stem cell sources to optimise <b>graft</b> <b>vs</b> marrow reactions and minimise <b>graft</b> <b>vs</b> <b>host</b> disease. In certain PID patients RIT will be the “first step” towards establishing donor cell engraftment; second infusions of donor stem cells, donor lymphocyte infusions, or a second myeloablative HCT, which appears to be well tolerated, may be required in some patients with low level donor chimerism or <b>graft</b> <b>rejection...</b>|$|R
30|$|Evidence from {{observational}} {{studies of}} transplant recipients provides significant {{evidence for the}} increased risk of malignancy associated with IS therapy. The emergence of effective systemic IS therapy for allograft recipients has seen a reduction in immunologic and non-immunologic <b>graft</b> <b>rejection.</b> However, the major contributor to mortality following solid organ transplantation is not <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> but malignancies and cardiovascular disease associated with IS therapy [1, 34].|$|R
40|$|The unrelenting tide of {{biomedical}} innovation {{has influenced}} kidney transplant care in profound ways, causing major overall improvement. The incidence of acute <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> has dropped precipitously, there-by changing the “natural history ” of a renal allograft. As acute <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> rates continue to decrease, many had expected that long-term graft survival would subsequently increase; however, {{this has not}} been the case. Although researchers have amassed a growing body of literature over the last decade exam-ining immunosuppressive regimens, histologic diag-noses, and ever more sensitive biochemical markers of impending rejection, the problem persists.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the cells {{required}} for first-set <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> in vivo was examined by using an adoptive transfer system to restore heart- <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> in irradiated rats. Highly purified inocula of peripheral T lymphocytes were shown to quantitatively account for the restorative ability of adoptively transferred cells. These T cells were shown to be long-lived small lymphocytes which are not recently derived from the thymus during adult life. They belong to the pool of T cells which constantly recirculate from blood to lymph as shown by their rapid appearance in the lymph of iradiated syngeneic rats after intravenous injection. Neither B lymphocytes nor antibodies in the circulation or in the graft itself are required for first-set <b>graft</b> <b>rejection...</b>|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Early {{presentation}} of rejection facilitates early initiation of treatment which can favor a reversible rejection and better outcome. We analyzed the incidence, clinical features including rejection-treatment period and outcomes following <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> {{in our series}} of pediatric corneal graft. Materials and Methods: Case records of pediatric penetrating keratoplasty (PK) were reviewed retrospectively, and parameters noted demographic profile, indication of surgery, surgery-rejection period, rejection-treatment interval, graft outcome, and complications. Results: PK was performed in 66 eyes of 66 children < 12 years, with an average follow-up of 21. 12 ± 11. 36 months (range 4 - 48 month). The median age {{at the time of}} surgery was 4. 0 years (range 2 months to 12 years). Most of the children belonged to rural background. Scarring after keratitis (22, 33. 4 %) was the most common indication. <b>Graft</b> <b>rejection</b> occurred in eight eyes (12. 12 %) (acquired nontraumatic - 3, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy [CHED] - 2, nonCHED - 1, congenital glaucoma - 1, regraft - 1). The mean surgery-rejection period was 10. 5 ± 7. 3 months and mean rejection-treatment interval was 10. 9 ± 7. 02 days. Conclusion: This study showed irreversible <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> was the leading cause of graft failure of pediatric PK. Though, the incidence (12. 1 %) of <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> in current study was not high, but the percentage of reversal (25 %) was one of the lowest in literature because of delayed presentation and longer interval between corneal <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> and treatment. In addition, categorization of the type of <b>graft</b> <b>rejection</b> was very difficult and cumbersome in pediatric patients...|$|R
