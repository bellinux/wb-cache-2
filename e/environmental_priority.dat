50|$|The {{discipline}} of conservation biology {{has traditionally been}} concerned with the preservation of biodiversity and the habitats that organisms are dependent upon. However, soundscape ecology encourages biologists to consider natural soundscapes as resources worthy of conservation efforts. Soundscapes that come from relatively untrammeled habitats have value for wildlife {{as demonstrated by the}} numerous negative effects of anthropogenic noise on various species. Organisms that use acoustic cues generated by their prey may be particularly impacted by human-altered soundscapes. In this situation, the (unintentional) senders of the acoustic signals will have no incentive to compensate for masking imposed by anthropogenic sound. In addition, natural soundscapes can have benefits for human wellbeing and may help generate a distinct sense of place, connecting people to the environment and providing unique aesthetic experiences. Because of the various values inherent in natural soundscapes, they may be considered ecosystem services that are provisioned by intact, functioning ecosystems. Targets for soundscape conservation may include soundscapes necessary for the persistence of threatened wildlife, soundscapes that are themselves being severely altered by anthrophony, and soundscapes that represent unique places or cultural values. Some governments and management agencies have begun to consider preservation of natural soundscapes as an <b>environmental</b> <b>priority.</b> In the United States, the National Park Service's Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division is working to protect natural and cultural soundscapes.|$|E

40|$|The {{elimination}} of asbestos-containing materials like cement-asbestos, is an <b>environmental</b> <b>priority.</b> An industrial {{process for the}} safe recovery of cement-asbestos slates was recently developed and permits the thermal transformation of asbestos fibres into non-fibrous crystalline phases in a tunnel kiln. Optimisation of the process requires knowledge of the reaction dynamics. Here, time-resolved synchrotron powder diffraction was used to follow the thermal transformation of cement-asbestos. The use of a closed capillary as sample holder allowed to closely resemble the atmospheric conditions found in the industrial reactor. In this preliminary work, we describe the reaction sequence which undergoes cement-asbestos during its thermal decomposition.

40|$|Product {{developers}} choose tolerances to {{go along}} with every geometric dimension, and they typically do so based on how the tolerances influence variation in so-called “critical” dimensions of the final assembled product. A common decision-making approach is to minimize costs given some acceptable critical dimensional variation, but this strategy often conflicts with ecological sustainability objectives. This paper introduces a new approach to simultaneously considering the ecological and economic consequences of tolerances through a software tool that combines Robust Design and Tolerancing (RD&T) with <b>Environmental</b> <b>Priority</b> Strategies in product development (EPS). This allows designers to simultaneously assess the economic and ecological sustainability outcomes associated with geometry, material, and tolerance choices, and it is demonstrated through design optimization of an automotive part.
