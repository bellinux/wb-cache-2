5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E

25|$|After the break-up, most of {{the past}} and present members of Deep Purple went on to have {{considerable}} success {{in a number of other}} bands, including Gillan, Whitesnake and Rainbow. There were, however, a number of promoter-led attempts to get the band to reform, especially with the revival of the hard rock market in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1980, a touring version of the band surfaced with Rod Evans as the only member who had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Deep Purple, eventually ending in successful legal action from the legitimate Deep Purple camp over unauthorised use of the name. Evans was ordered to pay damages of US$672,000 for using the band name without permission.|$|E

25|$|The play premiered on Broadway on December 11, 1980 at the Broadhurst Theatre, with Ian McKellen as Salieri, Tim Curry as Mozart, and Jane Seymour as Constanze. It ran for 1,181 performances, closing on October 16, 1983, and was {{nominated}} for seven Tony Awards (Best Actor for both McKellen and Curry, Best Director for Peter Hall, Best Play, Best Costume Design, Lighting, and Set Design for John Bury), of which it won five (including Best Play and Best Actor for McKellen). In 2015, Curry stated {{in an interview that}} the original Broadway production was his favorite stage production that he had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in.</b> During the run of the play McKellen was replaced by John Wood, Frank Langella, David Dukes, David Birney, John Horton, and Daniel Davis. Curry was replaced by Peter Firth, Peter Crook, Dennis Boutsikaris, John Pankow, Mark Hamill, and John Thomas Waite. Also playing Constanze were Amy Irving, Suzanne Lederer, Michele Farr, Caris Corfman and Maureen Moore.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of Notre Dame, it was generally extremely difficult for a non-AQ conference team to reach a BCS bowl, while it was much easier for an AQ conference team (see rules above) to do so due to the inherent bias built into {{the rules of the}} BCS system which guaranteed a spot to the winner of each of the AQ Conferences. All AQ Conference teams had to do was simply win their respective conference title and they were automatically invited to a BCS Bowl. This made becoming a BCS Buster very noteworthy. Despite the fact {{that there had been a}} number of eligible non-AQ conference teams, only eight teams (from only five schools – Utah, TCU, Boise State, Hawaii, and NIU) had succeeded in becoming BCS Busters. No team from a non-AQ conference had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the BCS Championship, while a team from the SEC had been in—and won—the Championship game every year from 2006 to 2012. This consistent selection of one conference's teams (despite their success) had been one area of intense criticism of the BCS system and its exclusionary tendencies.|$|E

He is then asked if he has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> an armed robbery. He responds, [...] "You mean a 211?" [...] The following verses tell of Eazy's exploits as a thief and thug.|$|E

500|$|A New Day Has Come {{garnered}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} the music critics, who noticed that Dion explores a [...] "broader, more adventurous" [...] range of pop music and [...] "dips its toe" [...] into modern music, particularly dance ("Sorry for Love"). However, the album also contains the usual adult contemporary songs, including power ballads like [...] "I Surrender" [...] and [...] "Have You <b>Ever</b> <b>Been</b> <b>in</b> Love", or the title track. Critics also praised [...] "Ten Days", [...] "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)", [...] "I'm Alive", [...] "When the Wrong One Loves You Right", [...] "The Greatest Reward", and two covers: [...] "Nature Boy" [...] and [...] "At Last".|$|E
500|$|The {{programme}} {{was commissioned}} in July 1995, {{with the original}} working title of Quatermass and the Ultimate Conspiracy. When Quinn discovered {{that some of the}} soundtracks of the Quatermass episodes were considered to be of too poor a quality to use, the idea for the series was re-shaped to add the new elements of Kneale's monologue and archive news reports. Kneale, however, later denied that any of the news stories which The Quatermass Memoirs suggested had inspired parts of his work had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> his mind at the time. He said that he had used a degree of creative licence when [...] "explaining" [...] these apparent inspirations in his monologue sections.|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album B−. He felt that A New Day Has Come was [...] "over-arranged" [...] by producers, which works [...] "against Dion's {{enthusiasm for the}} wonders of babies and innocence." [...] Nevertheless, he praised the [...] "jaunty disco" [...] of [...] "Sorry for Love", and [...] "Have You <b>Ever</b> <b>Been</b> <b>in</b> Love" [...] which [...] "builds in {{intensity}} to sound like [...] "a James Bond movie theme as delivered by Barbra Streisand." [...] Tucker described [...] "Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)" [...] as the most [...] "idiosyncratic" [...] and [...] "idiomatic" [...] song that Dion has ever recorded. According to the positive review from Mike Ross of Jam!, A New Day Has Come [...] "picks up where Falling into You left off." [...] Dion's album is a full of [...] "bombast, melodrama and soaring love ballads indistinguishable from anything she's ever done." [...] Attempts at modernity are [...] "spotty", though [...] "welcome". Ross noticed that ballads are the strongest tracks on the album and praised [...] "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)", with [...] "two soaring key changes" [...] in the same song, which is then launched into a [...] "high Earth orbit of melodrama by an orchestra that would make John Williams blush with envy." [...] Barnes & Noble also gave the album favorable review and wrote that the new songs reveal a more [...] "spiritual" [...] and [...] "edgier" [...] Dion. They praised the [...] "uplifting" [...] title track, [...] "heartfelt, country-tinged" [...] "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)", [...] "anthemic, gospel choir-accented ballad" [...] "Prayer", [...] "bluesy, honky-tonk rocker" [...] "Ten Days", [...] "soaring ballad" [...] "Have You <b>Ever</b> <b>Been</b> <b>in</b> Love", and [...] "solid renditions" [...] of [...] "Nature Boy" [...] and [...] "At Last".|$|E

500|$|In late November 1684, when La Salle had fully {{recovered}} from a severe illness, the three remaining ships continued their search for the Mississippi River delta. Before they left Santo Domingo, local sailors warned that strong Gulf currents flowed east and would tug the ships toward the Florida straits unless they corrected for it. On December 18, the ships reached the Gulf of Mexico and entered waters that Spain claimed as its territory. None {{of the members of}} the expedition had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Gulf of Mexico or knew how to navigate it. Due to a combination of inaccurate maps, La Salle's previous miscalculation of the latitude of the mouth of the Mississippi River, and overcorrection for the currents, the expedition failed to find the Mississippi. Instead, they landed at Matagorda Bay in early 1685, [...] west of the Mississippi.|$|E
500|$|Sony Music Entertainment {{released}} {{also two}} promotional singles in the United States: [...] "Aun Existe Amor" [...] and [...] "At Last".

[...] "At Last" [...] was sent to the adult contemporary radio stations in December 2002 and peaked at number sixteen on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks. Although not changed, [...] "Have You <b>Ever</b> <b>Been</b> <b>in</b> Love" [...] was also included on Dion's next album, One Heart and released as a single in April 2003. The song spent fourteen weeks at number two on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Victoria and Ernst proved incompatible. Victoria despaired of her husband's lack {{of affection}} towards her, while Ernst devoted {{much of his}} {{attention}} to their daughter, whom he adored. Elisabeth, who physically resembled her mother, preferred the company of her father to Victoria. Ernst and Victoria both enjoyed entertaining and frequently held house parties for young friends. Their unwritten rule was that anyone over thirty [...] "was old and out." [...] Formality was dispensed with and royal house guests were referred to by their nicknames and encouraged to do as they wished. Victoria and Ernst cultivated friends who were progressive artists and intellectuals {{as well as those}} who enjoyed fun and frolic.

500|$|Growing up in Atlanta, King {{attended}} Booker T. Washington High School. He {{became known}} for his public speaking ability and {{was part of the}} school's debate team. King became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the Atlanta Journal in 1942 when he was 13. During his junior year, he won first prize in an oratorical contest sponsored by the Negro Elks Club in Dublin, Georgia. Returning home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit down. King initially refused, but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not submit. King said that during this incident, he was [...] "the angriest I have <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> my life." [...] A precocious student, he skipped both the ninth and the twelfth grades of high school.|$|E
500|$|Public {{reaction}} varied. Some women {{admired her}} strength and poise in private matters {{that were made}} public, some sympathized with her {{as a victim of}} her husband's insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an enabler to her husband's indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence. Her public approval ratings {{in the wake of the}} revelations shot upward to around 70percent, the highest they had <b>ever</b> <b>been.</b> <b>In</b> her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to [...] "a love that has persisted for decades" [...] and add: [...] "No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does.

500|$|September 10, {{the day of}} the hurricane, is also a {{national}} holiday for British Honduras, on which many locals gather in the streets to celebrate the defeat of Spanish conquerors by the British in 1798. It is widely believed that the hurricane struck without any warning, although some recent historians have disputed this. In his column for The Belize Times on September 5, 2004, Emory King claimed that Belizean authorities withheld continuous warnings from U.S. ships in the region of a possible hurricane strike on British Honduras so the festivities would not be interrupted. King cited as evidence a letter dated September 24, 1931, from a local radio operator to the Colonial Secretary in which the warnings were discussed, adding that [...] "perhaps none of [...] had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a hurricane and didn't know exactly how bad it was going to be." [...] Additionally, there was also belief among residents of Belize City that the reefs would provide a barrier against large tidal waves.|$|E
