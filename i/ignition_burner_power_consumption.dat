40|$|Abstract—The <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> of {{presently}} available Inter-net servers {{and data}} centers is not {{proportional to the}} work they accomplish. The scientific community is attempting {{to address this problem}} in a number of ways, for example, by employing dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, selectively switching off idle or underutilized servers, and employing energy-aware task scheduling. Central to these approaches is the accurate estimation of the <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> of the various subsystems of a server, particularly, the processor. We distinguish between <b>power</b> <b>consumption</b> measurement techniques and power con-sumption estimation models.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} feasibility of a photodiode to control combustion, instead of a spectrometer (which is an expensive sensor to be used in commercial burners). For that purpose, the flame emission has been measured in a hot-water boiler fired with light fuel-oil, whose nominal output power goes up to 370 kW. The parameters investigated were: overall air excess, combustion air distribution, <b>burner</b> <b>power</b> and atmospheric conditions. High influence of air distribution on the flame emission was detected by the diode, since it modifies directly the mixing quality reducing rich-fuel regions where soot can be formed. Low influence of air excess and <b>burner</b> <b>power</b> was found. When these parameters increase, the flame emission decreases. This behavior is explained by the better mixing attained at high <b>burner</b> <b>power</b> and at high air excess. However the high emission level observed at low firing rate can be reduced with a good burner adjustment. With the photodiode, it was possible to find the optimum air excess value where NO, CO and soot are as low as possible. As the photodiode measures locally in the flame, results were compared with images obtained with a CCD camera. Finally, these results are in good agreement with those obtained previously with the spectrometer...|$|R
