40|$|AbstractIntroductionAppendicitis is {{a common}} {{surgical}} pathology with many clinical presentations. Diagnosis can be challenging {{if there is an}} alteration to the normal position of anatomical structures and their relationships. Case presentationIn this case, we report an unusual presentation of congenital intestinal malrotation in a nonagenarian presenting with generalized abdominal pain and lactic acidosis found to have perforated appendicitis. The patient was admitted to the Hospitalist service for abdominal pain and misdiagnosed with bowel obstruction secondary to previous “operation”. After further review of imaging malrotation with internal hernia was suggested. The patient was taken emergently to the operating room and found to have perforated and gangrenous appendix in the midabdomen. An appendectomy was performed and patient was ultimately discharged home in good condition on postoperative day four. DiscussionMalrotation of the intestines is a developmental variant that occurs when normal <b>fetal</b> <b>rotation</b> of the intestines around the superior mesenteric artery and their peritoneal fixation fails to occur. Presentation typically occurs during infancy and diagnosis in an elderly patient is exceedingly rare. Operative intervention is often required as it is commonly associated with lactic acidosis or peritonitis. ConclusionsMalrotation can go undiagnosed well into elderly life and can present with unusual signs and symptoms. CT is very helpful in aiding the diagnosis but itself can be misleading...|$|E
40|$|Background: The supine {{position}} {{is the most}} common birth position adopted in China, but the World Health Organization recommends non-{{supine position}}s for delivery. The hands-and-knees position shows several advantages, such as wide pelvic diameter and easy <b>fetal</b> <b>rotation</b> during delivery. Small trials conducted in China in 2011 revealed that the hands-and-knees position resulted in improved maternal and neonate outcomes than those in the supine position. However, a comprehensive study must be conducted before the hands-and-knees position can be introduced into clinical practice. Hence, we conducted this multicenter trial to comprehensively examine the benefits of the hands-and-knees position over the supine position during delivery. Methods: Our clinical study was conducted in 11 hospitals in China from May to December 2012. A total of 446 pregnant women who gave birth in the hands-and-knees position were assigned into the experimental group, and 440 women who gave birth in the supine position were classified into the control group. Episiotomy rate was evaluated as the primary outcome, and perineum laceration degree was considered the secondary outcome. Results: Women in the experimental group achieved lower rates of episiotomy and higher rates of intact perineum and first-degree perineum lacerations compared with those in the control. Postpartum bleeding amount, neonatal asphyxia, and APGAR scores at 1 and 5  min were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions: This study proves that women who delivered in the hands-and-knees position achieved low rates of episiotomy and intact perineum. Moreover, the rates of neonatal asphyxia and postpartum bleeding did not increase. Pregnant patients who prefer to adopt the hands-and-knees position should be assisted in assuming such position during delivery...|$|E
40|$|Background: Hands-and-knees {{positioning}} during {{labor has}} been recommended {{on the theory}} that gravity and buoyancy may promote <b>fetal</b> head <b>rotation</b> to the anterior position and reduce persistent back pain. A Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of this intervention during labor. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of inaternal hands-and-knees positioning on <b>fetal</b> head <b>rotation</b> from occipitoposterior to occipitonterior position, persistent back pain, and other perinatal outcomes. Methods: Thirteen labor units in university-affiliated hospitals participated in this multicenter randomized, controlled trial. Study participants were 147 women laboring with a fetus at >= 37 weeks 2 ̆ 7 gestation and confirmed by ultrasound to be in occipitoposterior position. Seventy women were randomized to the intervention group (hands-and-knees positioning for at least 30 minutes over a 1 -hour period during labor) and 77 to the control group (no hands-and-knees positioning). The primary outcome was occipitoanterior position determined by ultrasound following the 1 -hour study period and the secondary outcome was persistent back pain. Other outcomes included operative delivery, fietal head position at delivery, perineal trauma, Apgar scores, length of labor, and women 2 ̆ 7 s views with respect to positioning. Results: Women randomized to the intervention group had signficant reductions in persistent backpain. Eleven women (16...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to compare recumbent and alternative positions in terms of labour process, type of delivery, neonatal wellbeing, and intrapartum <b>fetal</b> head <b>rotation.</b> Methods. We conducted an observational cohort study on women at pregnancy term. Primiparous women with physiological pregnancies and single cephalic fetuses were eligible for the study. We considered data about maternal-general characteristics, labour process, type of delivery, and neonatal wellbeing at birth. Patients were divided into two groups: Group-A if they spent more than 50 % of labour in a recumbent position and Group-B when in alternative ones. Results. 225 women were recruited (69 in Group-A and 156 in Group-B). We found significant differences between the groups in terms of labour length, Numeric Rating Scale score and analgesia request rate, type of delivery, need of episiotomy, and <b>fetal</b> occiput <b>rotation.</b> No differences were found in terms of neonatal outcomes. Conclusion. Alternative maternal positioning may positively influence labour process reducing maternal pain, operative vaginal delivery, caesarean section, and episiotomy rate.

40|$|Intestinal malrotation is {{an anomaly}} of <b>fetal</b> {{intestinal}} <b>rotation</b> that can present with symptoms after birth or in early childhood, but is rarely diagnosed in adults. Patients who have symptomatic presentations require surgery. Other entities may mimic intestinal malrotation {{and respond to}} non-surgical management. We present 2 adult cases with the radiological diagnosis of intestinal malrotation: one with true malrotation presenting as a duodenal mass, and another with “pseudo-malrotation ” due to altered anatomy. These cases illustrate the importance of recognizing and differentiating these rare adult presentations of true malrotation from “pseudo-malrotation ” in regards to their acute management...|$|R

40|$|Subhepatically located caecum and {{appendix}} is a {{very rare}} entity. It occurs due to the anomaly in <b>fetal</b> gut <b>rotation</b> that results in an incomplete rotation and fixation of the intestine. Appendicitis, which is a common surgical emergency, {{in combination with the}} abnormal subhepatic location, presents a great challenge in its diagnosis and management. Here, we describe a 42 -year-old male with chronic dyspepsia who presented with sepsis and severe pain at his right hypochondriac and epigastric region. The final diagnosis was acute appendicitis of the subhepatic appendix. Our discussion focuses on the diagnostic approach and clinical and surgical management. We hope that our report will increase the awareness among the clinicians and hasten the management of such rare condition to avoid complications...|$|R

After 7 - 15 days in vitro, the mesencephalic tissue cultures were transplanted into the striatum of adult rats that had received unilateral injections of 6 -hydroxydopamine into the nigrostriatal bundle 3 - 5 {{weeks prior to}} transplantation. Graft survival was assessed in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -immunostained serial sections of the grafted brains up to post-transplantation week 4 for the human fetal xenografts and post-transplantation week 11 for the rat <b>fetal</b> allografts. D-amphetamine-induced <b>rotation</b> was monitored up to 10 weeks after transplantation in the allografted animals and {{compared with that of}} lesioned-only control animals. All transplanted animals showed large, viable grafts containing TH-immunoreactive (ir) neurons. The density of TH-ir neurons in the human fetal xenografts and in rat fetal allografts was similar. A significant amelioration of the amphetamine-induced rotation was observed in the animals that received cultured tissue allografts. These results promote the feasibility of in vitro maintenance of fetal human and rat nigral tissue prior to transplantation using the free-floating roller tube technique...|$|R
40|$|Background & Aim: Skeletal muscle contraction, {{secondary}} to pain and fear, may cause a {{reaction in the}} pelvic floor muscle contraction and may result in atypical labor progress, <b>fetal</b> descent and <b>rotation</b> of head. The object {{of this study was}} to compare the effect of acupressure at two GB- 21 and SP- 6 points on the severity of labor pain. Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 150 primiparous women were randomly divided into three groups of 1 -Acupressure at GB- 21 point, 2 -Acupressure at SP- 6 point and 3 -control group (contact at two points). The intervention was carried out for 20 minutes at 3 - 4 cm dilatation of cervix. The pain severity prior to, immediately and 3 and 60 minutes after intervention were measured by Visual Analog Scale. Collected data were analysed using repeated measures analysis of variances. Results: The pain severity before intervention among three groups was not statistically significant. Nevertheless, the pain severity was reduced immediately, 30 and 60 minutes after intervention in two intervention groups at 3 - 4 cm dilatation as compared with the control group (P< 0. 001). No significant statistical difference was observed between the two case groups (P= 0. 93). Conclusion: Current study showed that the application of acupressure at two GB- 21 and SP- 6 points was effective on the reduction of the severity of labor pain. Hence, it is recommended to conduct further studies regarding the application of acupressure along with non-medicinal methods...|$|R
40|$|OBSTETRICAL BRACHIAL PLEXUS PALSY Margareta Mollberg Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Institute for Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, Göteborg University, Göteborg, Sweden Background: Obstetric {{brachial plexus}} palsy (OBPP) at birth is one {{important}} cause of neurological disability {{in children and}} adults; the incidence has increased substantially in Sweden over the past decade. Several risk factors for OBPP have been identified, e. g. high birth weight and shoulder dystocia, but it remains difficult to predict based on antenatally available information. Despite extensive research on OBPP, there is no generally accepted strategy for prevention. The overall objective of this thesis is to study predisposing risk factors for OBPP in vaginally delivered infants and to identify specific obstetric procedures that are strongly associated with OBPP. Based on this knowledge, our ultimate aim {{is to develop a}} prevention strategy with respect to manual assistance in the second stage of labour. Methods: Paper I reports on a retrospective case-control study aimed at investigation of the incidence and risk factors for OBPP in a large population studied in 1987 - 1997. All deliveries recorded in the Swedish Medical Birth Register during the period were investigated. Cases of OBPP were compared with all cases without OBPP. Paper II describes a retrospective case-control study, the purpose of which was to identify risk factors for OBPP, specifically in women delivered by vacuum extraction. The groups with and without OBPP were compared with regard to possible risk factors, including those linked to the vacuum extraction procedure. The aim of the prospective population-based case-control study presented in Paper III was to evaluate the association between OBPP and obstetric manoeuvres during the second stage of delivery. Obstetric management in OBPP cases was compared to management in a randomly selected control group. Paper IV and Paper III are based on the same cases. The aims of the study presented in Paper IV were a) to describe neurological deficits in children with remaining OBPP at 18 months of age; b) to compare maternal, infant and obstetric data in infants with and without OBPP at 18 months of age and c) to evaluate if differences in force applied in downward traction of the head (ranked on a 100 -point visual analogue scale) correlated to the number of affected nerve roots (C 5 -C 6, C 5 -C 7, C 5 -Th 1). Results: The incidence of OBPP in Sweden increased from 0. 17 % to 0. 27 % between 1987 and 1997. Infants with high birth weight, especially > 4500 g, were at increased risk of shoulder dystocia and OBPP. However, high birth weight was not or only weakly over- represented among children with persistent OBPP, compared with those who recovered, suggesting that other factors are important. Hence, many factors related to prolonged second stage and difficulties in delivering the shoulders were overrepresented in the OBPP group, compared to controls. In particular, forceful downward traction applied to the head after the <b>fetal</b> third <b>rotation</b> represented an important risk factor for OBPP in cephalic-presentation vaginal deliveries. Downward traction of the head had been applied more often and with greater force in the group with persistent damage and there was a significant correlation between the force used and the number of affected nerve roots. Conclusion: We have confirmed that well known factors such as birth weight and shoulder dystocia are indeed important risk factors for OBPP. Furthermore, obstetric procedures, especially forceful downward traction of the head, conferred additional risk of OBPP at birth, as well as at follow-up at age 18 months. Our data suggest that forceful downward traction of the head should be avoided and indicate that other measures should be taken to release the impacted shoulder, e g. maximal flexion of the maternal hips, rotation of the shoulders and/ or extraction of the posterior arm...|$|R
