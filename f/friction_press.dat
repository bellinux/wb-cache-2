40|$|AbstractStructural {{lightweight}} construction is increasingly utilized in the aerospace and automotive industry. Hybrid structures have great potential, {{especially with regard}} to load-specific component layouts. Usually, a surface pre-treatment is applied prior to joining dissimilar materials to improve bonding mechanisms such as form closure. In previous studies pulsed wave (pw) lasers were used for structuring metals. This paper presents the results of aluminum pre-treatment via a continuous wave (cw) single-mode fiber laser: macroscopic and microscopic structures were generated on the aluminum surface; the samples were joined with glass fiber reinforced polyamide using <b>Friction</b> <b>Press</b> Joining (FPJ), a method for joining metals and thermoplastic polymers in lap joint configuration. Using these new methods for surface structuring, shear strength was increased by 40 % compared to previous studies with pw lasers...|$|E

The investigation has been undertaken to develop and study the characteristics of hot forged AISI 4140 High Strength Low Alloy Steels by using elemental powders through powder metallurgical techniques. 1 MN Capacity hydraulic Universal Testing Machine has been used to prepare the four different aspect ratios namely 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75 and 0. 90.

5000|$|There are {{multiple}} designs of vehicle clutch, {{but most are}} based on one or more <b>friction</b> discs <b>pressed</b> tightly together or against a flywheel using springs. The friction material varies in composition depending on many considerations such as whether the clutch is [...] "dry" [...] or [...] "wet". Friction discs once contained asbestos, but this has been largely discontinued. Clutches found in heavy duty applications such as trucks and competition cars use ceramic plates that have a greatly increased friction coefficient. However, these have a [...] "grabby" [...] action generally considered unsuitable for passenger cars. The spring pressure is released when the clutch pedal is depressed thus either pushing or pulling the diaphragm of the pressure plate, depending on type. Raising the engine speed too high while engaging the clutch causes excessive clutch plate wear. Engaging the clutch abruptly when the engine is turning at high speed causes a harsh, jerky start. This kind of start is necessary and desirable in drag racing and other competitions, where speed {{is more important than}} comfort.|$|R
50|$|Expeller {{pressing}} (also called oil pressing) is {{a mechanical}} method for extracting oil from raw materials trademarked by Anderson International Corp. Mr. Valerius D. Anderson founded the V. D. Anderson Company in Cleveland, Ohio in 1888. In 1900, Mr. V. D. Anderson {{created the first}} successful continuously operated Expeller press. The raw materials are squeezed under high pressure in a single step. When used for the extraction of food oils, typical raw materials are nuts, seeds and algae, which are supplied to the press in a continuous feed. As the raw material is <b>pressed,</b> <b>friction</b> causes it to heat up; {{in the case of}} harder nuts (which require higher pressures) the material can exceed temperatures of 120 F.|$|R
40|$|A compact {{laminated}} board {{can be obtained}} by pressing layers of veneers with no other material or substance placed between them. The process does not require the use of steam pretreatment, surface activation methods, a gastight <b>press,</b> <b>friction</b> or adhesives.

The levels of temperature, pressure and time leading to the highest bending-strength values when material factors are held constant are investigated. The objective of optimizing the process is reached using response surface methodology for modelling and analysis. The parameter interactions are found to be significant.

5000|$|He {{gave me a}} long memorandum, {{historical}} in character, on {{the past}} Irish story, {{which seemed to be}} somewhat one-sided, leaving out of view the important minority and the views and feelings of the Protestant and loyal portion of the people. He explained much of his policy as to a Dublin Parliament, and as to Land purchase. I objected to the Land policy as unnecessary—the Act of 1881 had done all that was reasonable for the tenants—why adopt the policy of the rebel party, and get rid of landholders, and thus evict the English garrison as the rebels call them? I denied the value of the security for repayment. Mr G. argued that his finance arrangements would be better than present system of purchase, and that we were bound in honour to succour the landlords, which I contested. Why not go to the help of other interests in Belfast and Dublin? As to Dublin Parliament, I argued that he was making a surrender all along the line—a Dublin Parliament would work with constant <b>friction,</b> and would <b>press</b> against any barrier he might create to keep up the unity of the three Kingdoms. What of a volunteer force, and what of import duties and protection as against British goods? ... I thought he placed far too much confidence in the leaders of the rebel party. I could place none in them, and the general feeling was and is that any terms made with them would not be kept, and that through them I could not hope for reconciliation with discontented and disloyal Ireland.|$|R
40|$|Ants {{are able}} to climb {{effortlessly}} on vertical and inverted smooth surfaces. When climbing, their feet touch the substrate not only with their pretarsal adhesive pads but also with dense arrays of fine hairs on the ventral side of the 3 rd and 4 th tarsal segments. To understand what role these different attachment structures play during locomotion, we analysed leg kinematics and recorded single-leg ground reaction forces in Weaver ants (Oecophylla smaragdina) climbing vertically on a smooth glass substrate. We found that the ants engaged different attachment structures depending on whether their feet were above or below their Centre of Mass (CoM). Legs above the CoM pulled and engaged the arolia ('toes'), whereas legs below the CoM pushed with the 3 rd and 4 th tarsomeres ('heels') in surface contact. Legs above the CoM carried a significantly larger proportion of the body weight than legs below the CoM. Force measurements on individual ant tarsi showed that friction increased with normal load {{as a result of}} the bending and increasing side contact of the tarsal hairs. On a rough sandpaper substrate, the tarsal hairs generated higher friction forces in the pushing than in the pulling direction, whereas the reverse effect was found on the smooth substrate. When the tarsal hairs were pushed, buckling was observed for forces exceeding the shear forces found in climbing ants. Adhesion forces were small but not negligible, and higher on the smooth substrate. Our results indicate that the dense tarsal hair arrays produce <b>friction</b> forces when <b>pressed</b> against the substrate, and help the ants to push outwards during horizontal and vertical walking...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This research continues the earlier researches on wear friction and lubrication and its application to the powder metallurgy industries. A detailed study of the parameters involved in wear and friction has been made by using the "Pin and Disc" machine with cross cylinders technique. One iron powder was chosen and compacted over a range of densities {{with a series of}} metallic stearates as admixed lubricants for the purpose of examinations. These compacts were used as the "pins" for the wear and friction apparatus, the "disc" was made from high carbon high chromium steel {{which is one of the}} steels normally used in punches and dies in the powder metallurgy industries. The wear behaviour of these compacts was studied in relation to the following parameters: applied load between compact (or pin) and disc, sliding speed, travelled distance, density and hardness of compact. These were examined for a range of stearate lubricants and the wear rates determined, these data were then related to the possible industrial life for punches and dies in powder metallurgy presses. Besides wear rate, friction forces between the compact (or pin) and disc were measured and these forces of friction were translated into coefficients of friction for each type of lubricant. The thesis presents the results of these investigations with a survey of current theories on wear and friction of metallic systems relevant to powder metallurgy. Conclusions have been drawn and suggestions made on the most useful solid lubricant necessary in the pressing of metallic powders to reduce wear and <b>friction</b> in production <b>presses.</b> Calculations have been carried out using the data collected to estimate the possible press tool wear and accordingly a possible tool life was determined for pressing with each type of tearate lubricant.

40|$|The {{object of}} this work is to obtain a fundamentalunderstanding of the {{principal}} issues concerning the handlingof an aqueous WC-Co powder suspension. The WO 3 surface layer on the oxidised tungsten carbidepowder dissolves at pH> 3 with the tungsten concentrationincreasing linearly with time. Adding cobalt powder to thetungsten carbide suspension resulted in a significant reductionof the dissolution rate at pH< 10. Electrokinetic studiesindicated that the reduced dissolution rate may be related tothe formation of surface complexes; the experiments showed thatCo species in solution adsorb on the oxidised tungsten carbidepowder. The surface forces of oxidised tungsten and cobalt surfaceswere investigated using the atomic force microscope (AFM) colloidal probe technique. The interactions at various ionicstrengths and pH values are well described by DLVO theory. Theadsorption of cobalt ions to tungsten oxide surfaces resultedin an additional non-DLVO force and a reduced absolute value ofthe surface potential. It was shown that the adsorption ofpoly(ethylene imine) (PEI) to the WO 3 surfaces induces anelectrosteric repulsion. The properties of spray-dried WC-Co granules were related tothe WC primary particle size, and the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) binder and PEI dispersant content in aqueous WC-Cosuspensions. The granule characterisation includes a new methodfor measuring the density of single granules. The increase inthe fracture strength of granules produced from suspensionsthat were stabilised with PEI was related to a more densepacking of the WC-Co particles. The AFM was used to study the friction and adhesion ofsingle spray-dried WC-Co granules containing various amounts ofPEG binder. The adhesion and friction force between two singlegranules (intergranular friction) and between a granule and ahard metal substrate (die-wall friction) have been determinedas a function of relative humidity. The granule-wall frictionincreases with binder content and relative humidity, whereasthe granule-granule friction is essentially independent of therelative humidity and substantially lower than the granule-wallfriction at all PEG contents.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{multi-stage}} forming process of a sling shackle, investigated {{with the use of}} finite element simulation. Used as a lifting connector during Floating Production Unit assembly and provision of supplies for petroleum platforms, Wide Body (WB) shackles endure severe working conditions in hostile environment. Providing high level of strength and toughness as well as outstanding fatigue behavior, hot forming {{is one of the main}} production method of shackles. Aiming towards process improvement and stronger shackles development, the main purpose of this study is, with the help of numerical simulation, to understand, predict and control all aspects that can be involved in the manufacturing of a WB 125 tons shackle. In close collaboration with forging industry Le Béon Manufacturing in Lorient area, forging experiments were carried out on a 0. 3 MJ <b>friction</b> drive screw <b>press</b> and at temperatures higher than 900 °C. In order to form both jaws, two successive sequences of closed-die forging and deflashing are performed. It follows an open-die forging stage to form the body. Finally, the crown is obtained using a ram bending process. The numerical model presented herein is developed using a fully coupled 3 D thermomechanical analysis and is conducted on Abaqus software. Tools are made of AISI H 13 with constant thermophysical properties. Mechanical properties of the 34 CrNiMo 6 used for the workpiece at temperatures ranging from 900 to 1200 °C and strain rates ranging from 0. 1 to 1 /s were extracted from the literature. To describe the compression behavior, the Johnson-Cook flow stress model has been used. Temperatures, duration and kinematic movements have been recorded over the production of 80 shackles, and forging loads were evaluated by instrumenting strain gauges directly on the mechanical press. A particular methodology has been developed to perform successively the numerical simulation of the various forming operations with a unique workpiece. It combines a sequence of Abaqus/Implicit-HT, Abaqus/Dynamic-Explicit and Abaqus/Static-Implicit. In all simulations, convective and radiative cooling is taken into account and heat transfer between the tools and the workpiece is considered. As in the industrial process, workpiece stability and forging accuracy are obtained with the use of a manipulator modeled as an analytical rigid surface and a combination of springs to account for the recoil and shock absorption.

40|$|Within the {{technical}} oil-production the lipids are released by compression and extraction with hexan. Characteristical for rapeseed is the enormous hexan-retention in meal and the delayed release of hexan {{in the surrounding}} area. Cause: the lipids, which are locked in the very compact hulls. - The environmental protection integrated {{in the process of}} production requires a reduction/avoidance of hexan-emission. The solution: partial detachment of the hulls as an head-end-operation. A process to dehull rapeseed is known since 1979. In the opinion of oil millers dehulled rapeseed is not continuously pressable {{due to the lack of}} stability of compressed solid. The aim of the project is to furnish proof of the possibility to press rapeseed. Therefore two experimental ways are necessary: To find out the characteristics of the material under an axial compression and the variation of material- end compression-parameter, research of the screw-press process with a constant stream of compressed material and an ejection of a stable expeller with a variation of the geometric-, process- and material-parameter. Results: (A) dehulled rapeseed (hulls reduced to 1 / 4) can be pressed in a screw-press (40 kg/h) continuously; after upscaling the press to a semitechnical press an emission-reduced rapeseed-technology is possible. (B) When rapeseed is <b>pressed,</b> <b>friction</b> and therefore a heat-up is clearly reduced; the oil leaves the press with 40 C; a gentle production of oil is possible; user: Teutoburger Oelmuehle, Ibbenbueren.

40|$|More {{deaths are}} caused every year by indoor air {{pollution}} than malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis combined. Cooking with traditional fuels such as charcoal and fuelwood with poor ventilation causes {{the single most important}} environmental health risk factor worldwide. It also contributes to environmental issues such as deforestation as traditional biomass fuels and cooking stoves are inefficient and requires large quantities of wood. This is especially critical in Africa where the largest regional population growth in the world is expected to occur. A solution to these issues was realized through fuel pellets and modern cooking stoves by Emerging Cooking Solutions, a company started by two Swedes and based in Zambia. The production of fuel pellets in Zambia is dependent on pine sawdust from small sawmills and is a declining source of raw material. However, other sources of biomass are available in Zambia such as pigeon pea stalk, an agricultural waste product, and sicklebush, an invasive tree species. If these species are viable for pelletization, the production of pellets can increase while reducing issues with sicklebush and promoting cultivation of pigeon pea. The aim of this work is to evaluate if pigeon pea stalk and sicklebush are viable to pelletize in Zambia and how the press is affected by the different raw materials. A pilot study is done at Karlstad University with a single unit press, hardness tester and soxhlet extractor to evaluate how the material constituents correlate to <b>friction</b> in the <b>press</b> channel and hardness of the pellets. The results of the pilot study provide support for full scale tests done in a pellet plant in Zambia. The normal production of pellets from pine sawdust is used as quality and production reference for the tests with pigeon pea stalk, sicklebush, and different mixes of the raw materials. The properties used to evaluate the quality of the pellets are hardness, durability, moisture content, bulk density, and fines. The press configuration is evaluated by logging the electricity consumption by the press motor, calculating the power and specific energy consumption from the logs, and observations during the tests. The results show that sicklebush, and mixes of sicklebush with pigeon pea stalk can produce pellets with better quality than the reference pine pellets. An interesting composition is a mix of 80 % pigeon pea and 20 % sicklebush that produces pellets with the best quality of all the tests. However, pellets produced from sicklebush and pigeon pea show a larger variation in hardness as compared to the reference pellets from pine sawdust. Mixing pigeon pea with pine reduces these variations but reduces the hardness of the pellets below the reference. The press struggles to process sicklebush and pigeon pea stalk with fluctuating power consumption that causes the motor to trip. The inhomogeneity of the materials in sicklebush and pigeon pea are identified to cause the issues in the press. Production improvements are discussed to facilitate the production of pigeon pea stalk and sicklebush pellets...|$|R
40|$|State-of-the-art {{friction}} {{materials for}} applications in disc brake systems are constituted by composite materials, specifically formulated to ensure proper friction and wear performances, under the sliding contact conditions of braking events. The bases of typical friction compound formulations usually include 10 to 30 different components bonded with a polymeric binder cross-linked in situ. Main requests {{to be fulfilled}} during braking are an adequate friction efficiency and enough mechanical resistance to withstand the torque generated by forces acting on the disc brake. Generally, each component confers distinctive properties to the mixture and their primary function can be classified in the following categories: binders confer mechanical strength to friction material guaranteeing pad compactness during use, abrasives increase friction efficiency and improve compound wear resistance, solid lubricants are responsible for stabilizing friction coefficient and contrasting the build-up effect, reinforcements increase mechanical strength improving wear minimization and stabilization. Furthermore, other modifying components such as fillers and functionalizers are involved which are {{not directly related to}} friction efficiency, e. g. cheap materials, pigments, etc. Organic brake pads for disc-brake applications are based on phenolic resin binders, generally it requires three main manufacturing steps: raw material blending, where friction compound components are mixed by blenders. Hot-molding, where blended <b>friction</b> mix is <b>pressed</b> against a metallic support at controlled high pressure (> 2 kN/cm 2), temperature (150 - 200 °C) and pressing time (3 - 10 minutes). Brake pads post-curing, to complete the hardening of polymeric binder. This last step for phenolic resin is usually performed in a batch convective oven at temperature above 150 °C for 4 - 12 h, or alternatively using a continuous process, such as IR in-line tunnel ovens where the process time is 10 - 15 min, the oven heater temperature is between 500 and 700 °C and brake pad superficial temperature is easily above 300 °C. Such kind of formulations and manufacturing process reflects the generally acknowledged state of the art as regards organic friction materials for passenger cars and light trucks. In this panorama the idea of introducing a completely inorganic binder matrix would represent nowadays an extremely appealing topic in the field considering potential improvements of this alternative approach. The complete elimination of the organic binder would reduce emission of phenol-formaldehyde hazardous derivatives generated at high-temperature e. g. volatile organic compounds, highly toxic polyaromatic hydrocarbons etc… Nature and toxicity of the organic compounds released at high temperature was investigated on brake pads manufacturing and compared with preliminary studies recently published. Introducing an inorganic hydraulically bonded matrix in place of the traditional organic-based binders would lead to a substantial reduction of the total embodied energy and water of brake pads considering low-temperature manufacturing process and inorganic binders properties. Primary production embodied energy for phenolic resin is estimated in the range of 75 - 83 MJ/kg (cradle to gate), while primary production water usage (embodied water) is in the range of 94 - 282 l/kg. As a matter of comparison, examples of the embodied energy for inorganic binders typically used for concrete construction are: Portland cements 4. 9 MJ/kg, fly ash 9. 3 MJ/kg, metakaolin 1. 4 MJ/kg, silica fume 0. 036 1. 4 MJ/kg. The embodied water for these raw materials usually is less than 0. 048 l/kg. Well-known properties of such peculiar inorganic materials exploiting the hydraulic activity of binders when exposed to water or alkaline environment. The only energy demanding compound was the alkaline solution (e. g. for sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate the embodied energy is respectively of 22 MJ/kg and 16 MJ/kg). New brake pad manufacturing process allowed the substitution of commonly implied highly energy-consuming procedures with low-temperatures steps. Friction material components except binders were blended together with conventional plow-blade blender forming a dry friction-mix, then this dry friction-mix is blended with the inorganic binder and water or alkaline activators in a planetary mixer forming a wet friction-mix. Eventually wet friction mix is cold-pressed onto a metal back-plate without the need for further treatments at high temperature. It immediately emerges the energetic benefit connected to the manufacturing process of this inorganic binder-based brake pads. After brake pad production, the behavior of these inorganic materials was compared to traditional phenolic-based friction materials. Brake pads were tested on a full scale automotive brake dynamometer and on a real vehicle (in terms of performance and particle emission) following custom and international standard procedures. The aim of this work was to produce brake pad prototypes with friction material based on an inorganic hydraulic binder at performance comparable to commercial brake pads with organic-matrix based friction materials. The results obtained so far resulted particularly promising and paved the way to further developments of these novel class of friction materials. ...|$|R
