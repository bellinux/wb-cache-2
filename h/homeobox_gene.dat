2500|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} occurs due {{to chronic}} inflammation. [...] The principal {{cause of the}} chronic inflammation is gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD (UK: GORD). [...] In this disease, acidic stomach, bile, and small intestine and pancreatic contents cause damage to {{the cells of the}} lower esophagus. Recently, bile acids were shown to be able to induce intestinal differentiation, in gastroesophageal junction cells, through inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [...] and the protein kinase enzyme Akt. This results in the eventual up-regulation of the p50 subunit of protein complex NF-κB (NFKB1), and ultimately activation of the <b>homeobox</b> <b>gene</b> CDX2, which is responsible for the expression of intestinal enzymes such as guanylate cyclase 2C. This mechanism also explains the selection of HER2/neu (also called ERBB2) and the overexpressing (lineage-addicted) cancer cells during the process of carcinogenesis, and the efficacy of targeted therapy against the Her-2 receptor with trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of adenocarcinomas at the gastroesophageal junction.|$|E

The ancestral six genes diverged even before the divergence of groups Bilateralia and Cnidaria. ln freshwater jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbyi we distinguished both HD and SD regions for five SIX proteins.

40|$|Smooth {{muscle cell}} {{plasticity}} {{is considered a}} prerequisite for atherosclerosis and restenosis following angioplasty and bypass surgery. Identification of transcription factors that specify one smooth muscle cell phenotype over another therefore may be of major importance in understanding the molecular basis of these vascular disorders. <b>Homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> exemplify one class of transcription factors that could govern smooth muscle cell phenotypic diversity. Accordingly, we screened adult and fetal human smooth muscle cell cDNA libraries with a degenerate oligonucleotide corresponding to a highly conserved region of the homeodomain {{with the idea that}} <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes,</b> if present, would display a smooth muscle cell phenotype-dependent pattern of expression. No <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> were detected in the adult human smooth muscle cell library; however, five nonparalogous <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> were uncovered from the fetal library (HoxA 5, HoxA 11, HoxB 1, HoxB 7, and HoxC 9). Northern blotting of adult and fetal tissues revealed low and restricted expression of all five <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes.</b> No significant differences in transcripts of HoxA 5, HoxA 11, and HoxB 1 were detected between adult or fetal human smooth muscle cells in culture.

This phenotype-dependent expression of <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> was also noted in rat pup versus adult smooth muscle cells.

40|$|<b>Homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> are a {{group of}} genes coding for {{transcription}} factors with a DNA-bind-ing helix-turn-helix structure called a homeodomain and which {{play a crucial role}} in pat-tern formation during embryogenesis. Many <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> are located in clusters and some of these, most notably the HOX genes, are known to have antisense or oppo-site strand long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes that play a regulatory role. Because automated annotation of both gene clusters and non-coding genes is fraught with diffi-culty (over-prediction, under-prediction, inaccurate transcript structures), we set out to manually annotate all <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> in the mouse and human genomes. This includes all supported splice variants, pseudogenes and both antisense and flanking lncRNAs. One of the areas where manual annotation has a significant advantage is the annotation of duplicated gene clusters. After comprehensive annotation of all <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> and their antisense genes in human and in mouse, we found some discrepancies with the current gene set in RefSeq regarding exact gene structures and coding versus pseudogene locus biotype. We also identified previously un-annotated pseudogenes in the DUX, Rhox and Obox gene clusters, which helped us re-evaluate and update the gene nomenclature in these regions. We found that human <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> are enriched in antisense lncRNA loci, some of which are known to play a role in gene or gene cluster regulation, compared to their mouse orthologues. Of the annotated set of 241 human protein-coding <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes,</b> 98 have an antisense locus (41 %) while of the 277 orthologous mouse genes, only 62 protein coding gene have an antisense locus (22 %), based on publicly available transcriptional evidence...|$|R
40|$|Many of {{the genes}} {{controlling}} segmentation and pattern formation in Drosophila contain a conserved 183 bp sequence known as the homeobox. Homeobox sequences {{have been found in}} a range of metazoan species, including the vertebrates mouse and man. This striking conservation suggests that <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> may play a fundamental role in developmental processes. If this is the case then it might be expected that vertebrate <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> will be differentially expressed during embryogenesis and that the timing of their expression will coincide with major morphogenetic events. Here the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of murine <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> will be explored, concentrating on the Hox 1. 1 gene as an example. Using in situ hybridization to localize RNA transcripts, it has been found that Hox 1. 1 is expressed in a region-specific manner during the formation and differentiation of the embryonic anteroposterior axis. Although striking patterns of expression of Hox 1. 1 and other <b>homeobox</b> <b>genes</b> are seen in overtly segmented structures of the embryo (i. e. somites, prevertebral elements, neural tube and dorsal spinal ganglia) expression is also seen in tissues with no obvious segmental origin.
