5|$|Although the {{military}} {{victory of the}} absolutist city authorities was complete, the war had also shown them that they depended very much on their rural subjects. Soon after the war, the ruling aristocrats instituted a series of reforms and even lowered some taxes, thus fulfilling some of the peasants' original fiscal <b>demands.</b> <b>In</b> the long term, the peasant war of 1653 prevented Switzerland from an excessive implementation of absolutism as occurred in France {{during the reign of}} Louis XIV.|$|E

5|$|Another {{strike in}} Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. In a risky move, Gierek went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day. He met the workers personally, apologizing for the {{mistakes}} of the past and saying that as a former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Workers striking in Szczecin formulated <b>demands</b> <b>in</b> the area of freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek agreed, but the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing structures and their places of employment. The February 1971 Łódź strikes followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases were announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised.|$|E
5|$|Casterman {{felt that}} the {{black-and-white}} volumes of The Adventures of Tintin were not selling as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour.

Hergé was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their <b>demands</b> <b>in</b> February 1942. For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Hergé insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, {{and that it would}} not be used for shading.|$|E

5|$|With {{the opening}} of the Platine rivers, Paraguay now found it {{possible}} to contract with European technicians and Brazilian specialists to aid in its development. Unhindered access to the outside world also enabled it to import more advanced military technology. During the greater part of the 1850s, the dictator Carlos López harassed Brazilian vessels attempting to freely navigate the Paraguay River. López feared that the province of Mato Grosso might become a base from which an invasion from Brazil could be launched. This dispute was also leverage with the Imperial government for acceptance of his territorial <b>demands</b> <b>in</b> the region. The nation also experienced difficulties in delimiting its borders with Argentina which wanted the whole Gran Chaco region: a demand which Paraguay could not accept, as this would entail surrendering more than half of its national territory.|$|E

5|$|In 1827, {{the church}} erected a {{building}} dedicated as a Sunday school. This {{was also used}} as a day school from 1838. In 1906, around 250 children attended the Sunday school and the church had numerous affiliated groups, such as a Penny Bank and a Choral Society. The day school accommodation {{was at that time}} condemned by the Board of Education as unfit for purpose and it was operating under a stay issued by the board. In the same year, Hannah Mitchell, a suffragette, was arrested at the day school for protesting during an election campaign speech by Winston Churchill. The building was closed in 1908 and a new school building opened on Gartside Street in 1910 at a cost of £4000. This new facility was used only as Sunday school because, said the local clergy, the Board of Education put too many administrative obstacles and <b>demands</b> <b>in</b> their way, such as stipulating such a small attendance roll as to render any day school uneconomic and insisting on a dedicated playground despite there being a large open space next door that was traditionally used for that purpose. According to the foundation stone of the new school building, the church had operated the first Sunday school in Manchester, although Shaw attributes that distinction to a Mr Fildes, a Methodist whose establishment began operating from a Travis Street cellar in 1782. Shaw says that several other schools preceded that of St John's.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, 1653, {{the peasants}} {{delivered}} ultimatums to Bern and Lucerne and raised 16,000 troops. When {{the city of}} Bern replied with a protest note, the peasants marched to Bern {{under the leadership of}} Leuenberger, arriving on May 22, 1653. A second army led by Emmenegger laid siege to Lucerne. The city authorities were unprepared for an armed conflict and immediately engaged in negotiations. Within days, peace agreements were concluded. In the peace on the Murifeld (Murifeldfrieden, named after the field just outside Bern where the peasant army's camp lay) signed by Leuenberger and the mayor of Bern, Niklaus Dachselhofer, the city council of Bern promised on May 28, 1653, to fulfill the peasants' fiscal <b>demands</b> <b>in</b> return for the dissolution of the Huttwil League. In view of this development, the city of Lucerne and the besieging peasants agreed on a truce. Leuenberger's army lifted the siege of Bern and retreated, but the people refused to follow their leaders and objected to dissolving the Huttwil League.|$|E
5|$|The Glorious Revolution {{settled the}} {{dominance}} of the Presbyterians in the Church of Scotland and of the Whigs in politics. The Whig dominance continued (in both Scotland and England) well into the mid-eighteenth century,. In both countries, the Revolution marked the triumph of Parliamentary say in determining the legal monarch and succession. Furthermore, the Revolution decisively determined the future structure of the kirk. In the short term the removal of so many Episcopalian ministers probably made the impact of the famines of the seven ill years more severe, as they were not able to operate the system of parish poor relief. The revolution also provided a political and dynastic dimension to cultural and religious divisions, particularly between the largely Episcopalian Highlands and the more Presbyterian Lowlands. This helped to make the Scottish Highlands the main focus of Jacobite resistance to the Williamite regime, resulting in a series of military adventures, of which the most threatening were those of 1715 and 1745. The revolution also led to Scotland's involvement in large scale European wars from 1689–96 and 1702–13, resulting in heavy <b>demands</b> <b>in</b> men and taxation. It led ultimately to the Acts of Union that created the Kingdom of Great Britain, as the danger of a divided succession between Scotland and England drove the need for a lasting resolution.|$|E

5|$|While Marlborough {{fought in}} the Low Countries a series of {{personal}} and party rivalries instigated a general reversal of fortune. The Whigs, who were the main prop of the war, had been laying siege to Godolphin. As a price for supporting {{the government in the}} next parliamentary session, the Whigs demanded a share of public office with the appointment of a leading member of their Junto, the Earl of Sunderland (Marlborough's son-in-law), to the post of Secretary of State. The Queen, who loathed Sunderland and the Junto, and who refused to be dominated by any single party, bitterly opposed the move; but Godolphin, increasingly dependent on Whig support, had little room for manoeuvre. With Sarah's tactless, unsubtle backing, Godolphin relentlessly pressed the Queen to submit to Whig <b>demands.</b> <b>In</b> despair, Anne finally relented and Sunderland received the seals of office; but the special relationship between Godolphin, Sarah, and the Queen had taken a severe blow and she began to turn increasingly to a new favourite – Sarah's cousin, Abigail Masham. Anne also became ever more reliant on the advice of Harley, who, convinced that the duumvirate's policy of appeasing the Whig Junto was unnecessary, had set himself up as alternative source of advice to a sympathetic Queen.|$|E
5|$|The crowd's {{agitation}} increased, {{and they}} overran the chapter house. Leiva and Lezica requested {{that someone who}} could act as spokesman for the people should join them inside the hall and explain the people's desires. Beruti, Chiclana, French and Grela were allowed to pass. Leiva attempted to discourage the rioter Pancho Planes, but he entered the hall as well. The Cabildo argued that Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} break the political system of the viceroyalty without discussing it with the other provinces; French and Chiclana replied that the call for a Congress had already been considered. The Cabildo called the commanders to deliberate with them. As had happened several times in the last few days, Romero explained that the soldiers would mutiny if forced to fight against the rioters on behalf of Cisneros. The Cabildo still refused to give up, until the noise of the demonstration was heard in the hall. They feared that the demonstrators could overrun the building and reach them. Martín Rodríguez pointed out {{that the only way to}} calm the demonstrators was to accept Cisneros' resignation. Leiva agreed, convinced the other members, and the people returned to the Plaza. Rodríguez headed to Azcuenaga's house to meet the other revolutionaries to plan the final stages of the revolution. The demonstration overran the Cabildo again, and reached the hall of deliberations. Beruti spoke on behalf of the people, and said that the new Junta should be elected by the people and not by the Cabildo. He said that, besides the nearly 400people already gathered, the barracks were full of people who supported them, and he threatened that they would take control, by force if necessary. The Cabildo replied by requesting their <b>demands</b> <b>in</b> writing.|$|E
