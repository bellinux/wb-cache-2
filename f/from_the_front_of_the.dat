5|$|Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg {{entered the}} round with an eleven-point lead over {{teammate}} Lewis Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship. Mercedes held a 103-points advantage over Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship. During Saturday's qualifying session, Hamilton achieved the 55th pole position {{of his career}} to start <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grid, ahead of Rosberg and Max Verstappen.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve arises {{as a number}} of small rootlets <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medulla, the bottom part of the brainstem, in the preolivary sulcus, which separates the olive and the pyramid. The nerve passes through the subarachnoid space and pierces the dura mater near the hypoglossal canal, an opening in the occipital bone of the skull.|$|E

5|$|Dominating the {{appearance}} of the house from the street is a large verandah-style porch, supported by large stone columns, on the southern-facing front of the house; an enclosed porch, smaller but two stories high and supported by wooden pillars, is located on the rear portion of the house's east side. Projecting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, above the porch, is a small wing with a gable, semicircular window, and elaborate cornice. The house is built in a combination of styles; it includes many Italianate details, but its design appears to have been influenced by the architecture of the Sears Modern Homes.|$|E
5|$|In regular service, the Pioneer Zephyr had {{its share}} of accidents. In 1939 it was {{involved}} in a head-on collision with a freight train that completely destroyed the cab. The train was rebuilt and re-entered revenue service soon afterward, but the accident strengthened the desire of locomotive designers to move the cab back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> locomotive to above a large nose, as on EMD F-unit and EMD E-unit locomotives.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Apatosaurus was {{confused}} {{with that of}} Camarasaurus and Brachiosaurus until 1909, when the holotype of A. louisae was found, and a complete skull just a few meters away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck. Henry Fairfield Osborn disagreed with this association, {{and went on to}} mount a skeleton of Apatosaurus with a Camarasaurus skull cast. Until 1970, Apatosaurus skeletons were mounted with speculative skull casts, when McIntosh showed that more robust skulls assigned to Diplodocus were more likely from Apatosaurus.|$|E

5|$|An {{inclined}} tramway, the ramp, {{was built}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terrace, on {{the axis of}} the gatehouse, down towards the port area of Fremantle. The ramp, constructed between 1852 and 1853, is of limestone rubble from the cut and fill activities required to create the prison site and the terrace. The ramp {{is an integral part}} of the original design of the prison complex and is of exceptional heritage significance. It is now cut at its western end by a modern road which severs the historic visual link with Fremantle. On each side of the alignment of the ramp, where it intersects with Henderson Street, are three terrace houses for the accommodation of prison warders. These were erected between 1851 and 1858 and mark the boundary of the Convict Establishment at this point. The limestone used for the early prison and its associated housing was quarried on the site.|$|E
5|$|For Super Street Fighter IV, a third outfit {{intended}} {{to resemble the}} Chinese jiangshi was included, consisting of a long Chinese robe, black hat with his ponytail extruding from the top, yellow and black striped pants, and a yellow strip of paper meant to represent a sealing charm extending <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hat and over his face. The developers considered to have the charm able to be knocked off by an opponent's attacks, {{and as a result}} alter his attack patterns and power; however, they felt this overcomplicated the character, and instead abandoned the idea. Assistant producer Natsuki Shiozawa cited the outfit as one of her five favorites in the game, feeling that design suited his body well.|$|E
5|$|Nico Rosberg {{was again}} fastest in Q3, denying {{teammate}} Hamilton his fiftieth career pole {{position in the}} process. His time of 1m37.113 was more than three-tenths of a second quicker than Hamilton's, ensuring he started <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grid for the second race running. Valtteri Bottas confirmed his strong pace and qualified third, marginally ahead of Sebastian Vettel. The second Ferrari of Kimi Räikkönen was almost half a second behind in fifth, having made a mistake at turn 13, followed by the two Force India cars of Nico Hülkenberg and Sergio Pérez. Hamilton had also gone off at turn 13 on his second fast lap, preventing him from challenging Rosberg for pole position.|$|E

5|$|The Guests' Hall and its {{adjoining}} Porch Room {{occupy the}} space above {{the entrance to}} the courtyard and the Gatehouse. They can be accessed either through a doorway from the adjacent Prayer Room or via a staircase {{at the south end of}} the courtyard leading to the Long Gallery on the floor above. The first-floor landing leads to a passageway between the Guests' Hall and the Guests' Parlour, and to the garderobe tower visible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. A doorway near {{the entrance to the}} Guests' Parlour allows access to the Brew-house Chamber, which is above the Brew-house. The Brew-house Chamber was probably built as servants' quarters, and originally accessed via a hatch in the ceiling of the Brew-house below.|$|E
5|$|The game tasks {{the player}} with {{navigating}} a bus through roads filled with alien potato beings. The player's bus holds female {{members of the}} alien race, and the player can shoot the females <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bus in order to clear the alien potatoes. The aliens come in two colors: red and blue. Aliens are cleared from the road when two like-colored potatoes touch each other, but aliens begin to pile up in the road if two aliens hit each other that are not of the same color. The road is continuously scrolling downwards, forcing the player to make holes in the road wide enough to fit the bus through. The game can end prematurely if the player runs into too many aliens and loses all their lives.|$|E

25|$|Other {{enclosure}} types {{alter the}} rear sound radiation {{so it can}} add constructively to the output <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cone.

25|$|Unusually, two {{different}} steering systems {{were used for}} the E39, depending on the engine.

25|$|While they do {{not have}} the biggest impact on the drag {{coefficient}} due to their small size, radio antennas commonly found protruding <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle can be relocated and changed in design to rid the car of this added drag. The most common replacement for the standard car antenna is the shark fin antenna found in most high efficiency vehicles.|$|E
