They soon run into trouble, with Scotty nearly colliding with a truck, then barely getting the group to safety when the bridge leading to the cabin starts to collapse.

Lead writer Jesse Stern noted that despite the grim subject matter, people instinctively {{want to know what}} it is like to experience these attacks, and cited documentaries about the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Columbine High School massacre as evidence. According to Stern: [...] "These are human beings who perpetrate these acts, so you don't really want to turn a blind eye to it. You want to take it apart and figure out how that <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> <b>what,</b> if anything, can be done to prevent it.

The lawsuit, filed at a United States district court in Meridian, Mississippi, asked for $8 million in damages. Rainey, who was the county sheriff {{at the time of the}} 1964 murders, alleged that the filmmakers of Mississippi Burning had portrayed him in an unfavorable light with the fictional character of Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gailard Sartain). [...] "Everybody all over the South knows the one they have playing the sheriff in that movie is referring to me," [...] he stated. [...] "What they said <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they did to me certainly wasn't right and something ought to be done about it." [...] Rainey's lawsuit was unsuccessful; he dropped the suit after Orion's team of lawyers threatened to prove that the film was based on fact, and that Rainey was indeed suspected in the 1964 murders.|$|E

The film crew received a startling 100 responses, including 60 people filmed (30 in Detroit and 30 in St. Louis). Twenty-two are seen in the film.

[...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important.

They married in Mauritius in 1982 and shared a home {{together}} in Linksfield Ridge, an upscale Jewish area in Johannesburg's northern suburbs. Their two-year marriage ended in divorce in 1984. Allan attributed her burgeoning career as a factor: [...] "I was obsessed with my column. I was intent on becoming the best journalist in the country." [...] They remained friends and Schachat supported Allan's testimony in the 1992 libel suit she brought against Channel 4 in London. Allan told a London court that eight years after their marriage breakup, Schachat was her closest friend and described their union as [...] "the right people at the wrong time." [...] Allan writes about the marriage to Schachat in her 2015 memoir, Jani Confidential: [...] "I keep thinking about what <b>happened</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> I would have done differently. Pretty much everything I suppose. Gordon had to live through the weekly angst about the column. It was like reinventing the wheel every week. My validity as a partner hinged - or so I thought - on my success as a columnist. I couldn't have got it more wrong.
