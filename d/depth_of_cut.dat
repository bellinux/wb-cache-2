25|$|Machinability can {{be based}} on the measure of how long a tool lasts. This can be useful when {{comparing}} materials that have similar properties and power consumptions, but one is more abrasive and thus decreases the tool life. The major downfall with this approach is that tool life is dependent on more than just the material it is machining; other factors include cutting tool material, cutting tool geometry, machine condition, cutting tool clamping, cutting speed, feed, and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b> Also, the machinability for one tool type cannot be compared to another tool type (i.e. HSS tool to a carbide tool).|$|E
50|$|Blades {{for cutting}} wood are almost universally {{tungsten}} carbide tipped (TCT), but {{high speed steel}} (HSS) blades are also available. The saw base can be adjusted for <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> and can tilt up to 45° and sometimes 50° {{in relation to the}} blade. Adjusting the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> helps minimize kickback. Different diameter blades are matched to each saw and are available ranging from 14 cm to 61 cm.|$|E
40|$|According to {{previous}} research of dynamic end milling models, the instantaneous dynamic radii on every cutting position affects the cutting forces directly since the simulated forces are {{proportional to the}} chip thickness, and the chip thickness {{is a function of}} dynamic radii and feedrate. With the concept of flute engagement introduced, it is important to discuss it with respect to radial and axial <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> because the length of the engaged flutes is affected by factors in the axial feed and rotational directions. Radial and axial <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> affect the “contact area”, which is the area that a cutter contacts with the workpiece. When radial and axial <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> increase, the cutting forces also increase since the engaged flute lengths are increased. Therefore, {{in order to have a}} clearer idea of the milling forces, the influences of dynamic radii, cutting feedrate, and radial and axial <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> are discussed in this paper. Key Words: simulated forces, milling forces, dynamic radii, cutting feedrate, flute engagement, radial and axial <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut,</b> rake angle 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Cryogenic cooling is an {{environmental}} friendly and effective cooling technology. The present work investigates {{the role of}} cryogenic cooling on tool wear at various cutting conditions. An indigenous method of applying cryogenic coolant was developed. Different methods of circulating the liquid nitrogen and vaporizing it inside the tool holder were tried {{with the objective of}} lowering down the temperature at the cutting zone. This was achieved through more efficient heat transfer. As-rolled AISI 4340 steel shafts were turned using coated cemented carbide inserts. Results of tool wear show improvement of tool life during cryo-machining as compared to dry machining especially when heavy <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut,</b> high feed values and high cutting speeds are employed. The effect of cryogenic cooling was not pronounced at low speeds, small feed and <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Relative {{motion is}} {{required}} between the tool {{and work to}} perform a machining operation. The primary motion is accomplished at a certain cutting speed. In addition, the tool must be moved laterally across the work. This is a much slower motion, called the feed. The remaining dimension of the cut is the penetration of the cutting tool below the original work surface, called the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b> Collectively, speed, feed, and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> are called the cutting conditions.

5000|$|The {{cutting speed}} may be {{corrected}} with {{the temperature in}} the borehole, temperature of the working fluid, concentration, flow and pressure. (these components are enough to completely control the depth and length of the cut and thus forming the slots), to instantly cut through the steel casing, through the cement to delve into the productive formation and keep the jets in this state while moving along the borehole, keeping the same <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b> At the end of the cutting continuous slot process the engine is set up to the initial position and ready for the next cutting interval.

40|$|Abstract. An {{experimental}} study is {{reported on the}} grinding of a nickel-based alloy using vitrified CBN wheels. This work was motivated by switching the grinding of fir-tree root forms of jet engine blades from creep-feed grinding with conventional abrasive wheels to vitrified CBN wheels. The objective is to explore process limits and practical grinding parameters for judging the switch in terms of overall costs and productivity. Straight surface grinding experiments were conducted with water-based fluid on rectangular blocks at a fixed wheel speed vs = 45 m/s, various <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> a = 0. 05 - 1. 0 mm, and workspeeds vw = 2 - 40 mm/s. Grinding power, forces, surface roughness, and radial wheel wear were measured. Specific material removal rate of 8 mm 3 /(mm. s) was reached in rough grinding using a wheel dressed for achieving surface roughness Ra = 0. 8 µm in finish grinding. It was found that shallow <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> combined with fast workspeeds, or less creep-feed modes, {{are more suitable for}} achieving high material removal rates with vitrified CBN grinding.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of tests conducted at three different <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut</b> an 6 a velocity of 3. 1 m/min on a work-hardening lead-alloy workpiece with a 10 -degree-rake photoelastic tool. In addition to examining the behaviow: of the chip-tool contact stresses, the paper considers the forces acting on the tool and distinguishes three areas: rake, nose, and flank. I t evaluates the rake forces from the photoelastic results directly, estimates the nose forces by making certain assumptions {{with regard to the}} distribution of stresses, and neglects the stresses on the flank. The sum of the forces so obtained is then compared with the measured resultant cutting force; there is good agreement. There is a particularly significant observation which, contrary to previously published results, shows that the frictional stresses vary linearly in the so-called sticking zone and tend towards a constant only at relatively high <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cut.</b> This is discussed in relation to the general concept of plastic friction and the variation of the coefficienrof friction on the rake face. The significance of the measured resultant coefficient of friction is also considered...|$|R
