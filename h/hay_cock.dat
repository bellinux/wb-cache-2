60|$|Miriam had one {{beautiful}} {{evening with}} him in the hay. He had been on the horse-rake, and having finished, came to help her to put the <b>hay</b> in <b>cocks.</b> Then he talked to her of his hopes and despairs, and his whole soul seemed to lie bare before her. She felt as if she watched the very quivering stuff of life in him. The moon came out: they walked home together: he seemed to have come to her because he needed her so badly, and she listened to him, gave him all her love and her faith. It seemed to her he brought her the best of himself to keep, and that she would guard it all her life. Nay, the sky did not cherish the stars more surely and eternally than she would guard the good in the soul of Paul Morel. She went on home alone, feeling exalted, glad in her faith.|$|R
50|$|One {{loose hay}} {{stacking}} technique {{seen in the}} British isles is to initially stack freshly cut hay into smaller mounds called foot <b>cocks,</b> <b>hay</b> coles, kyles, hayshocks or haycocks, to facilitate initial curing. These are sometimes built atop platforms or tripods formed of three poles, used to keep hay {{off the ground and}} let air into the center for better drying. The shape causes dew and rain water roll down the sides, allowing the hay within to cure. People who handle the hay may use hayforks or pitchforks to move or pitch the hay in building haycocks and haystacks. Construction of tall haystacks is sometimes aided with a ramp, ranging from simple poles to a device for building large loose stacks called a beaverslide.|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulty}} {{in determining the}} stage of the curing process at any given time was largely overcome in these studies by the perfection of a weighing device which enabled the operator to determine the moisture content of the hay as it was being cured in the field. The presence of living cells in the stems and leaves of field-cured hay plants was shown. The evidence and theories on heating of hay indicate that heating is due largely to chemical oxidation processes. These processes may be helped along by the respiration of the living cells in the plant up to 40 - 45 °C. and by the work of microorganisms from air temperatures to 70 ° C. in producing unstable, unsaturated compounds. It is believed that beyond this point the heating is due entirely to chemical processes. Alfalfa hay was found to cure more rapidly in the swath than in the windrow and more rapidly in the windrow than when <b>cocked.</b> <b>Hay</b> that was one-fourth, one-half or three-fourths cured in the swath prior to windrowing cured more rapidly than the hay windrowed at once, and the longer the hay was allowed to remain in the swath, the less time was required for curing. <b>Cocking</b> <b>hay,</b> either at once or after partial swath Or windrow-curing, delayed the curing process. Green <b>hay</b> in large <b>cocks</b> heated and lost its color. Good quality hay was made by cocking after partial swath or windrow-curing. Turning average sized windrows with the rake in good curing weather was found to be slightly detrimental as no appreciable time was gained {{and the quality of the}} hay was slightly lowered. Turning large windrows or windrows wet by rain caused them to cure more rapidly and gave a better quality of hay. Tedding hay was not found to be advantageous in any way in these experiments and was detrimental to the quality of the hay. The tedder may be valuable in curing extremely heavy swaths of hay. Complete swath-curing resulted in the greatest loss of leaves; three-fourth and one-half swath-curing were next in amount of leaves lost. Windrowing at once and one-fourth swath-curing followed by windrowing resulted in the least loss of leaves. The leaf-loss in swath-curing hay was increased by the use of the tedder. The turning of the windrow with the rake caused an additional leaf-loss in windrow-cured hay. DurIng these experiments hay was placed in the mow with as low as 20 percent and as high as 58. 7 percent of moisture. The degree of heating was not found to be directly proportional to the moisture content of the hay. Hay with below 30 percent of moisture ordinarily may be considered safe from heating to a destructive or dangerous degree. Hay with less than 27 percent of moisture may be expected to retain its green color. The hay generally heats immediately on being mowed, then cools; this is followed by a second heating period in which the highest temperature is usually reached in 8 to 10 days after mowing, after which the hay cools gradually. The amount of carbon dioxide present in the mow, is a fair indication of the degree of heating of the hay.. The accumulation of carbon dioxide in the presence of moist, hot material results in a transformation of the chlorophyll, accompanied by a change in color from green to brown. The green color of hay was usually destroyed when the heating exceeded 50 °C. Clean, brown hay is formed at temperatures above 55 °C. and below 70 °C. In general, moldy, grayish-brown hay results when hay heats to between 40 and 50 °C. during the storage period. Clean, brown hay is formed by heating quickly to 55 ° C., while if the heating is prolonged at 50 ° C. or less and later heats to above 55 °C., the hay is 2 ̆ 2 dusty. 2 ̆ 2 The value of salting hay in the mow was tested eight times, with a distinctly beneficial effect once, slightly beneficial once and apparently no benefit in six trials. When hay baled from the field with 23 percent of moisture was carefully stored, there was no detrimental heating...|$|R
6000|$|He traversed the shrubbery, glanced {{into the}} walled garden--no Jon! Nor where the peaches and the {{apricots}} {{were beginning to}} swell and colour. He passed the Cupressus trees, dark and spiral, into the meadow. Where had the boy got to? Had he rushed down to the coppice--his old hunting-ground? Jolyon crossed the rows of <b>hay.</b> They would <b>cock</b> it on Monday and be carrying the day after, if rain held off. Often they had crossed this field together--hand in hand, when Jon was a little chap. Dash it! The golden age was over by the time one was ten! He came to the pond, where flies and gnats were dancing over a bright reedy surface; and on into the coppice. It was cool there, fragrant of larches. Still no Jon! He called. No answer! On the log seat he sat down, nervous, anxious, forgetting his own physical sensations. He had been wrong to let the boy {{get away with that}} letter; he ought to have kept him under his eye from the start! Greatly troubled, he got up to retrace his steps. At the farm-buildings he called again, and looked into the dark cow-house. There in the cool, and the scent of vanilla and ammonia, away from flies, the three Alderneys were chewing the quiet cud; just milked, waiting for evening, to be turned out again into the lower field. One turned a lazy head, a lustrous eye; Jolyon could see the slobber on its grey lower lip. He saw everything with passionate clearness, in the agitation of his nerves--all that in his time he had adored and tried to paint--wonder of light and shade and colour. No wonder the legend put Christ into a manger--what more devotional than the eyes and moon-white horns of a chewing cow in the warm dusk! He called again. No answer! And he hurried away out of the coppice, past the pond, up the hill. Oddly ironical--now he came to think of it--if Jon had taken the gruel of his discovery down in the coppice where his mother and Bosinney in those old days had made the plunge of acknowledging their love. Where he himself, on the log seat the Sunday morning he came back from Paris, had realised to the full that Irene had become the world to him. That would have been the place for Irony to tear the veil from before the eyes of Irene's boy! But he was not here! Where had he got to? One must find the poor chap! ...|$|R
