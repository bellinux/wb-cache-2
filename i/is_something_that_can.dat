25|$|Body image {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} {{psychological}} effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely difficult for people {{to live up to the}} standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is. There are many factors that lead to a person’s body image, some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for obesity or malnutrition, and cultural expectations (e.g., media and politics). People who are both underweight and overweight can have poor body image. However, because people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. This <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> lead to a change in a person's body image. Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by dieting or undergoing cosmetic surgery.|$|E
25|$|Aside from a {{contract}} that creates a security interest to back repayment of a debt, creditors to a company, and particularly trade creditors may deploy two main equivalents security. The effect is to produce proprietary rights which place them ahead of the general body of creditors. First, a trade creditor who sells goods to a company (which may go into insolvency) can contract for a retention of title clause. This means {{that even though the}} seller of goods may have passed possession to a buyer, until the price of sale is paid, the seller has never passed property. The company and creditor agree that title to the property is retained by the seller until the date of payment. In the leading case, Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd a Dutch company making aluminium foil stipulated in its contract with Romalpa Aluminium Ltd that when it supplied the foil, ownership would only passed once the price had been paid, and that any products made by Romalpa would be held by them as bailees. When Romalpa went insolvent, another creditor claimed that its floating charge covered the foil and products. The Court of Appeal held, however, that property in the foil had never become part of Romalpa's estate, and so could not be covered by the charge. Furthermore, the clause was not void for want to registration because only assets belonging to the company and then charged needed to be registered. In later cases, the courts have held that if property is mixed during a manufacturing process so that it is no longer identifiable, or if it is sold onto a buyer, then the retention of title clause ceases to have effect. If the property <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be mixed (such as oil) and the clause prohibits this, then the seller may retain a percentage share of the mixture as a tenant in common. But if the clause purports to retain title over no more than a part of the property, Re Bond Worth Ltd held that the clause must take effect in equity, and so requires registration. The present requirements in the Companies Act 2006 section 860 continue not to explicitly cover retention of title clauses, in contrast to the registration requirements in the US Uniform Commercial Code article 9. This requires that anything with the same effect as a security interest requires registration, and so covers retention of title provision.|$|E

Martin compares {{the philosophy of}} Nietzsche to the philosophy of Nāgārjuna, aiming to illuminate the relationship between their respective attempts to develop [...] "spiritual break-throughs", by considering each thinker in turn. First he looks at Nietzsche's distinct rejection of traditional values, and, subsequently, considers Nietzsche's answer to the problem. Second, Martin looks to Nāgārjuna, tracing his line of thought to the [...] "emptiness" [...] and [...] "ultimate truth", and then to his conception of [...] "liberation". Martin then compares Nietzsche and Nāgārjuna's thought directly, with reference to Nishitani, and concludes that Nietzsche's articulation of nihilism means that the [...] "emptiness" [...] spoken of by Nāgārjuna <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> now be seen by a great many people.|$|E

60|$|That was {{the last}} I saw of him for weary days. I hit the high places across those {{hundreds}} of miles of Nevada desert, riding the overlands at night, for speed, and in the day-time riding in box-cars and getting my sleep. It was early in the year, and it was cold in those upland pastures. Snow lay here and there on the level, all the mountains were shrouded in white, and at night the most miserable wind imaginable blew off from them. It was not a land in which to linger. And remember, gentle reader, the hobo goes through such a land, without shelter, without money, begging his way and sleeping at night without blankets. This last <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be realized only by experience.|$|E
60|$|In fairyland {{there had}} been a real law; a law that could be broken, for the {{definition}} of a law <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be broken. But the machinery of this cosmic prison was something that could not be broken; for we ourselves were only a part of its machinery. We were either unable to do things or we were destined to do them. The idea of the mystical condition quite disappeared; one can neither have the firmness of keeping laws nor the fun of breaking them. The largeness of this universe had nothing of that freshness and airy outbreak which we have praised in the universe of the poet. This modern universe is literally an empire; that is, it was vast, but it is not free. One went into larger and larger windowless rooms, rooms big with Babylonian perspective; but one never found the smallest window or a whisper of outer air.|$|E
60|$|I {{say with}} a stick, not with sticks, for that is the whole {{argument}} about democracy. A people is a soul; {{and if you want}} to know what a soul is, I can only answer that it <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> sin and that can sacrifice itself. A people can commit theft; a people can confess theft; a people can repent of theft. That is the idea of the republic. Now, most modern people have got into their heads the idea that democracies are dull, drifting things, a mere black swarm or slide of clerks to their accustomed doom. In most modern novels and essays it is insisted (by way of contrast) that a walking gentleman may have ad-ventures as he walks. It is insisted that an aristocrat can commit crimes, because an aristocrat always cultivates liberty. But, in truth, a people can have adventures, as Israel did crawling through the desert to the promised land. A people can do heroic deeds; a people can commit crimes; the French people did both in the Revolution; the Irish people have done both in their much purer and more honourable progress.|$|E
50|$|Black {{conservatism}} {{is particularly}} {{difficult to define}} because it will either not be representative of all black conservatives or it will <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> said of other conservatives outside of the black community. One of the main characteristics of black conservatism is its emphasis on personal responsibility and traditionalism. Black conservatives may find common ground with Black Nationalists through their common belief in black empowerment and the theory that black people have been duped by the Welfare state. For many black conservatives, the singular objective is to bring social redemption and economic success to the black community.|$|R

60|$|Those {{who make}} merry over the landlady {{who has seen}} better days, of whom {{something}} has been said already, commonly speak, in the same jovial journalese, about her household goods as her household gods. They would be much startled if they discovered how right they are. Exactly what is lacking to the modern materialist <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be what the household gods were to the ancient heathen. The household gods of the heathen were not only wood and stone; at least there is always more than that in the stone of the hearth-stone and the wood of the roof-tree. So long as Christianity continued the tradition of patron saints and portable relics, this idea of a blessing on the household could continue. If men had not domestic divinities, at least they had divine domesticities. When Christianity was chilled with Puritanism and rationalism, this inner warmth or secret fire in the house faded on the hearth. But some of the embers still glow or at least glimmer; {{and there is still}} a memory among the poor that their material possessions are something sacred. I know poor men for whom it is the romance of their lives to refuse big sums of money for an old copper warming-pan. They do not want it, in any sense of base utility. They do not use it as a warming-pan; but it warms them for all that. It is indeed, as Sergeant Buzfuz humorously observed, a cover for hidden fire. And the fire is that which burned before the strange and uncouth wooden gods, like giant dolls, in the huts of ancient Italy. It is a household god. And I can imagine some such neglected and unlucky English man dying with his eyes on the red gleam of that piece of copper, as happier men have died with their eyes on the golden gleam of a chalice or a cross.|$|E
