40|$|Measurements of the curvatures and warpages of {{a printed}} circuit board (PCB) <b>during</b> a thermal <b>solder</b> reflow process using strain gauges are {{proposed}} in this study. In the experiments, a shadow moiré is used for measuring the out-of-plane deformations (or warpage) of a bi-material plate and a PCB with dual in-line memory module (DIMM) sockets <b>during</b> <b>solder</b> reflow heating, while the finite element method (FEM) is used to analyze the thermally-induced deformation of the PCB specimen for ensuring the validity of the measurement. Conventional strain gauges are employed to measure the strains (albeit as in-plane strain data) in both specimens <b>during</b> the <b>solder</b> reflow process. The results indicate that the strain gauge-measured strain data from the top and bottom surfaces of both specimens <b>during</b> the <b>solder</b> reflow can be converted into curvature data with specific equations, and even into global out-of-plane deformations or warpages with a proposed simple beam model. Such results are also consistent with those from the shadow moiré and FEM. Therefore, it has been proved that the strain gauge measurement associated with the simple beam model can provide a method for the real-time monitoring of PCB deformations or warpages with different temperatures <b>during</b> the <b>solder</b> reflow process...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in microdroplet generation and deposition processes {{have made it}} possible to directly form solder bumps on integrated circuits using micron-sized molten metal droplets. The direct droplet deposition bumping process can potentially produce uniform-sized bumps more economically than the existing processes such as plating and stencil printing. However, the development of this new bumping method is still in its infancy, particularly {{because of a lack of}} understanding about the post-impact deposition behavior of molten droplets on solid targets. A deposited molten on the deposition efficiency, as well as on the final bump size and shape. The present study investigates the effects of wetting and surface roughness on droplet bouncing <b>during</b> <b>solder</b> bump formation. The potential for droplet bouncing is modeled based on the energy difference between the maximum spreading and equilibrium sessile stages of a deposited droplet. Validated by experimental results, the model shows that strong droplet-surface wetting can significantly reduce the tendency for a deposited droplet to bounce. The effect of surface droplet can sometimes recoil violently after the initial spreading and rebound off the target surface. Such behavior, known as bouncing, has a strong influence roughness on the bouncing potential is represented by the roughness-induced incomplete wetting during droplet deposition, a phenomenon quantified by a change in the effective contact area under the deposited droplet. An idealized surface model is used to represent the real surface and to describe the relationship between various roughness parameters to changes in the effective contact area. The theoretical analysis, validated by empirical data, shows that surface effective(cont.) contact area. The theoretical analysis, validated by empirical data, shows that surface roughness promotes bouncing <b>during</b> <b>solder</b> bump formation. The results from this study suggest that droplet bouncing <b>during</b> <b>solder</b> bump formation may be effectively controlled by improving the surface wetting and minimizing the substrate surface roughness. The knowledge gained is also relevant to other droplet-based manufacturing processes such as spray forming, coating, and rapid prototyping. by Wen-Kai Hsiao. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Plastic {{encapsulated}} components contain organics which {{turn into}} volatiles during heat exposures such as <b>during</b> <b>solder</b> reflow or <b>during</b> environmental testing. Moisture turning to steam {{is not the}} only vapor released from plastics <b>during</b> <b>solder</b> reflow. With the push towards lead-free and higher reflow temperatures, the identity and the understanding of these volatiles would be of interest so as to improve manufacturing yields. Some of the vapors evolved during eutectic and lead-free solder reflow profiles of mold compounds are identified in this paper. At eutectic reflow peak temperatures of 220 °C, Epoxy Novolac mold compounds will release gases like carbon dioxide, moisture, methyl alcohol, benzene, isobutyl methyl ketone as the residue solvent, triphenyl phosphine and N,N-dimethyl benzenemethanamine from the catalyst, and sometimes siloxanes from stress releasing agent. Some of the more dominant vapors include triphenyl phosphine(TPP) and triphenyl phosphine oxide(TPPO), water and methyl alcohol. Also, it was found that temperature ramping rates affected the rate of gases released. There was not a substantial difference in the composition of gases released for mold compounds between eutectic solder reflow temperatures and for the higher temperature of 260 °C for lead-free reflow. As expected, much less gas was released if the mold compounds were postmold cured for 4 hours. Gas evolution from polymer during heat exposure is inevitable, however, understanding evolved gas behavior can help reduce the amount evolved such as through proper material selection, post-curing and slower ramp-up, consequently this will improve adhesion variability and pop-corn susceptibility...|$|R
40|$|Encapsulants and underfills are {{polymeric}} materials containing some levels of low molecular mass chemicals which turn into volatiles during heat exposures.

It would be of interest to know what and when the volatiles undergo thermal desorption and are released during high temperature exposures such as <b>during</b> <b>solder</b> reflow or <b>during</b> environmental testing, Moisture turning to steam is not the only vapor present <b>during</b> <b>solder</b> reflow. With the push towards lead-free and higher reflow temperatures, this outgassing behavior is of particular significance to assist in the improvement of manufacturing yields. Using evolved gas analysis with gas chromatograph and mass spectrometer, vapors found from epoxy mold compounds are carbon dioxide, moisture, methyl alcohol, benzene, isobutyl methyl ketone, triphenyl phosphine and occasionally, siloxanes from stress releasing agents. Gases reflecting curing byproducts or unreacted products are observed. For underfills, these gases are either absent of much reduced. Both underfills, and encapsulants show some signs of the polymer chain decomposition at higher temperatures for lead-free applications. Gas evolution rate increased directly with temperature increase for both encapsulants and underfills. Gas evolution is lower at 220 °C than at 260 °C. However, this level represents only a small degree of degradation and its effect on polymer performance is not part of this study...|$|R
50|$|A {{eutectic}} formulation has advantages {{when applied}} to soldering: the liquidus and solidus temperatures are the same, {{so there is no}} plastic phase, and it has the lowest possible melting point. Having the lowest possible melting point minimizes heat stress on electronic components <b>during</b> <b>soldering.</b> And, having no plastic phase allows for quicker wetting as the solder heats up, and quicker setup as the solder cools. A non-eutectic formulation must remain still as the temperature drops through the liquidus and solidus temperatures.

Many types are not perfectly sealed, with contaminants and moisture entering the part; an especially common contaminant is the solder flux.
