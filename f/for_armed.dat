40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence {{continues}} to accumulate that oxidative stress is etiologically {{important in the}} pathogenesis of age-related maculopathy (ARM) and that appropriate antioxidants of dietary origin may protect against this condition. OBJECTIVE: Risk factors <b>for</b> <b>ARM</b> may be classed as established or putative. We report a study designed to investigate whether such risk factors {{are associated with a}} dietary lack of antioxidants relevant to retinal health. DESIGN: Dietary, anthropometric, and sociodemographic details relating to 828 healthy Irish subjects aged 20 - 60 y were recorded in a cross-sectional fashion and analyzed for associations between risk factors <b>for</b> <b>ARM</b> and dietary intake of relevant nutrients. RESULTS: Of the established risk factors <b>for</b> <b>ARM,</b> increasing age was associated with a relative lack of dietary zeaxanthin (P < 0. 05) and tobacco use with a relative lack of dietary vitamin C (P < 0. 05). Of the putative risk factors <b>for</b> <b>ARM,</b> alcohol consumption was associated with a relative lack of dietary alpha-linoleic acid (P < 0. 05), and female sex was associated with a relative lack of dietary zinc (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: We showed that several variables related to risk <b>for</b> <b>ARM</b> are associated with a relative dietary lack of key nutrients. Our finding that age, the most important and universal risk factor <b>for</b> <b>ARM,</b> is associated with a relative lack of dietary zeaxanthin, is an important finding that warrants further investigation...|$|R

In this open-label, 24 -week, prospective study, 48 treatment-naive patients were randomized to lopinavir/ritonavir 400 / 100 mg+saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily (arm A), lopinavir/ritonavir 400 / 100 mg+saquinavir 600 mg twice daily (arm B), lopinavir/ritonavir 266 / 66 mg+saquinavir 1000 mg twice daily (arm C), or lopinavir/ritonavir 266 / 66 mg+saquinavir 600 mg twice daily (arm D). A 12 h. pharmacokinetic profile in all patients was performed. Plasma concentrations of saquinavir and lopinavir were determined using an HPLC technique. HIV- 1 RNA was measured over 24 weeks. Forty-three subjects {{were included in the}} pharmacokinetic analysis.

5|$|By December 1, 1864, all {{soldiers}} {{had left the}} county to search <b>for</b> <b>armed</b> resistance {{in other parts of}} Pennsylvania. Though widespread draft evasion was evidenced in Columbia County, there was never serious armed resistance. At the end of Columbia County's occupation, the county's Democrats were deeply embittered by the arrests. It is likely that the rumor of the fort originated from sightings of large piles of shingles gathered by draft-evading shingle makers. Wooden tubs for gathering sap from sugar maples seen from a distance were likely mistaken for the fort's cannons. A deserters' hideout on North Mountain, a cabin 20 feet (6 meters) square and two stories high, may {{have been the subject of}} exaggerated claims by Republicans that the cabin was a fort.

5|$|Following the French Revolution in 1789, a {{political}} organisation {{was formed in}} Ireland named the Society of United Irishmen. Crossing social and religious boundaries, this organisation embraced republican principles with the stated goal of removing British government control from Ireland. When Britain went to war with the French Republic in 1793, the organisation was declared illegal and driven under cover, many of its senior members going into exile in Europe or America. These men continued to call <b>for</b> <b>armed</b> resistance to the British government, and in 1796 persuaded the French Directory to launch the Expédition d'Irlande, a large scale invasion of Ireland. The expedition was a disaster, with thousands of French soldiers drowned without a single man successfully landed. Subsequently, the French-controlled government of the Batavian Republic, formerly the Dutch Republic, was persuaded to make an attempt on Ireland in October 1797, but their fleet was intercepted and defeated by Admiral Adam Duncan at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the political unrest in Saigon, the Communist leadership in North Vietnam were far {{more concerned about the}} best strategy to fight the South Vietnamese government and their American supporters. While all leaders in Hanoi shared the same goal of eventual reunification of their homeland, different factions within the Communist Party disagreed on the best method to achieve their desired goal. Members of North Vietnam's Politburo were divided by the issues surrounding the Soviet strategy of peaceful co-existence versus the Chinese strategy of supporting national liberation movements in emerging countries. Despite their differences of opinion, the Communist Party leadership ultimately made preparations <b>for</b> <b>armed</b> struggle in South Vietnam. From Hanoi's perspective, the military regime in Saigon was able to hold out because the Communist main forces were still not ready to fight a conventional war, so North Vietnam must focus on the development of its military force in the shortest period of time. In the meantime, however, the war must be kept at its current level in order to prevent the full involvement of the United States military.|$|E
5|$|The first Jewish-Roman War, {{sometimes}} called The Great Revolt, {{was the first}} of three major rebellions by the Jews of Judaea Province against the Roman Empire. Judea was already a troubled region with bitter violence among several competing Jewish sects and a long history of rebellion The Jews' anger turned on Rome following robberies from their temples and Roman insensitivity– Tacitus says disgust and repulsion– towards their religion. The Jews began to prepare <b>for</b> <b>armed</b> revolt. Early successes, including the repulse of the First Siege of Jerusalem and the Battle of Beth-Horon, only attracted greater attention from Rome and Emperor Nero appointed general Vespasian to crush the rebellion. Vespasian led his forces in a methodical clearance of the areas in revolt. By the year 68 AD, Jewish resistance in the North had been crushed. A few towns and cities held out for a few years before falling to the Romans, leading to the Siege of Masada in 73 AD and the Second Siege of Jerusalem.|$|E

He claimed that Francis had offered him 100,000 francs for carrying out the attack and 50,000 more for each person killed.

The fragility of the South Vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield, where its military experienced great setbacks against the Viet Cong.

5|$|This {{demand was}} {{far-reaching}} and required {{transformation of the}} empire into a federal state, placing Lithuania {{on a par with}} the Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian constitutional system. Heated discussions continued on the means to achieve this transformation. Some argued <b>for</b> <b>armed</b> resistance, but were reminded that the previous uprisings in November 1831 and January 1863 had failed. Others suggested peaceful and passive resistance: refusing to pay taxes, boycotting products from monopolistic companies (mostly those selling alcoholic beverages), not allowing children to attend Russian schools, evading drafts into the Russian army, and organizing factory worker strikes. The delegates, who were mostly small farmers, also discussed land reform, demanding that all land would be confiscated from large landlords and distributed to those who actually cultivated it. However, no conclusions in that area were reached as there was a perception that any resolution on land reform would encourage the peasants to rise against their landlords as it was happening in other parts of the Russian Empire.|$|E
