The work focused on examining: the impact of protected areas, logistics and security for the kayak activity, visible evidences from the last glacial period (Weichsel), isostatic uplift and coastal processes, and also time- and site specific environmental effects of kayaking. Three destinations were selected as the main investigation sites.   In a protected area there are regulations that limits activities that may be carried out. Protected areas also promote outdoor recreation as a main goal. Logistics and security risks were documented for possible starting locations and routes. The results showed that evidences of glacial processes, isostatic uplift and coastal processes were visible at all three destinations. Trysunda showed the greatest presence of traces/kilometer. However, Trysunda was surveyed by hiking which may have affected the results. Trysunda showed the largest number of evidences of coastal processes, which may depend on the high exposure of this island to wave energy. At all three destinations environmental effects were found as abrasion on the vegetation as well as the <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds.</b>   The conclusion is that all three destinations represent good sites for the experience of distinct educational traces of glacial and postglacial processes.

40|$|Low {{hatching}} success {{may limit}} progress towards reaching productivity goals for Atlantic Coast piping plover (Charadrius melodus) recovery, despite management strategies to protect eggs from predators and decrease human <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> on nests. We measured piping plover hatching success on Eastern Long Island beaches and identified the major causes of egg failure {{to better understand}} why eggs that were otherwise intact (not depredated or destroyed by tidal flooding) failed to hatch. We documented egg and nest fates, dissected contents of unhatched eggs to determine viability, and recorded human and predator activity near a subset of plover nests on Suffolk County Parks properties. The low hatching success we recorded (0. 60) in 2006 and 2007 would require higher chick survival rates than are typically observed for piping plovers to meet recovery targets for productivity. Few eggs showed signs of poor viability and overall egg hatchability was comparable to other ground nesting birds. Most egg failure was due to either depredation at unexclosed nests or nest abandonment by adults. The best predictor of nest abandonment was {{the maximum number of}} red fox tracks (Vulpes vulpes) counted on nearby transects (β[*]=[*]− 1. 16, 95 % CI: − 2. 0 to − 0. 3) and we found evidence that plovers abandoned eggs in response to predation risk (e. g., a fox circling a nest exclosure). Adults from abandoned nests may have deserted eggs or been depredated. In either case, intact and viable eggs were abandoned. Nest abandonment was not related to human activity near nests, which were buffered from human disturbance by symbolic string fencing. Our results suggest that depredation and nest abandonment (e. g., desertion or death of adults) due to predator disturbance, not human disturbance or poor egg viability, contributed to the low hatching success we recorded. Active predator removal in addition to modification of predator exclosure use and design may be necessary to prevent direct (egg depredation) and indirect (nest abandonment) negative effects of predators on hatching success...|$|E

Here the species nests, forms flying and pre-migrating concentrations, and participates in migration. The number of demoiselle cranes in April-June is about 600 - 700 individuals (200 - 250 nesting pairs), and {{toward the end of}} the year the population can reach 900 - 1000 individuals. Of cranes observed during 2000 - 2008 in the Crimea, 42. 3 % of pairs (n = 151) nested on agricultural fields: 21. 5 % on virgin land, 16. 1 % on cropland, and 3. 4 % on fallow lands. Principal characteristics of the demoiselle crane nesting locations were wavy relief, scarce herbage, low background herbage, and proximity and accessibility of water (usually 3 - 5 km distant or farther), absence of danger, or minimal likelihood of disturbance. The height of herbage around the observed nests averaged 1. 35 cm (range 0 - 75 cm, n = 95), and the density of soil cover by herbage averaged 37. 2 % (range 0 - 90 %, n = 97). The species of grassy vegetation was not important to the cranes for nest placement. In agricultural fields, as in the natural steppe biotopes, the determining factor for them is the presence of herbage, its height and its density; most frequently from complete lack of it to low and rarefied. The capture of insects by the demoiselle crane during the nesting period showed that the food base in the agricultural fields is no worse than on the steppe. The major threats are the expansion of agricultural areas that are not suitable for nesting (i. e., water saturated earth, perennial grasses, and crops in need of frequent cultivation); <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> by humans during mass hay harvesting, picnics, disorganized tourism (a disturbance to the daily rhythm of the birds, which disrupts social interaction between them and leads to the loss of abandoned eggs and nestlings); destruction of eggs and death of chicks from the onslaught of agricultural technology during cultivation of the fields; the collection of eggs and chicks for trade and for exchange between bird collectors; and an increase in the number of predators, especially domestic (stray dogs) and synanthropic Corvidae...|$|E

Protected area managers may seek to introduce novel activities {{in order to}} generate revenue. However, disturbance effects brought about through encounters between humans and wildlife can have negative consequences, which conflict with conservation goals. De Hoop Vlei is a large coastal lake within the De Hoop Nature Reserve. It is a Ramsar site {{as well as a}} key feature of a BirdLife Important Bird Area (IBA). Proposals for motorized boat tours and kayak tours on the vlei have been made, for which this study provides an impact assessment. Repeated counts were performed in order to characterize the waterbirds present during the high water level conditions required for boating. Birds were concentrated in areas with aquatic vegetation and shallow water, mainly along the vlei's western shoreline and southern and northern ends. Two routes were designed for boat tours that would minimize disturbance by avoiding these areas as well as breeding sites. Count data were also used to revise the Ramsar and IBA assessments, which underestimated the site's conservation value. Boat tours were monitored to estimate the number of birds disturbed, and to measure agitation distances (ADs) and flight initiation distances (FIDs) in response to the boat as well as a kayak. Post-disturbance recovery was investigated, as was the likelihood of habituation using a space-for-time substitution at a site with regular boat traffic. Boat tours did not typically disturb more than 10 % of birds present at the vlei, and largely avoided disturbing species of conservation concern. Responses to the kayak were more severe than to the boat, which is most likely due to the similar speeds of the two boats are similar and the kayak is more easily perceived as a threat due to its shape and stealth, the presence of a paddler, and the consistent paddling motion. Post-disturbance recovery of species was slow and incomplete after an hour, meaning that there are likely costs for foraging opportunities and breeding if important areas are disturbed. Most species did allow a closer approach at the site with regular boating, but AD did not differ between them for most species. From these results it would be dangerous to assume that habituation will mitigate against disturbance impacts. Recommendations made included that kayak tours should not be permitted. Boat tours, with correct management, can be conducted in a manner that will not be too disruptive to birds. This study is the first to document such a large difference in responses of birds to two differing boat types, and is a rare example of <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> being studied in an African context...|$|E

40|$|Game {{shooting}} is free in national territorial waters to any Danish citizen with a valid hunting license. In areas {{of importance for}} migrating water birds {{this has led to}} a high level <b>of</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Therefore, a number of locations free of shooting and other activities disturbing the water birds were implemented in Denmark in the period 1993 - 2001. The problem <b>of</b> water <b>bird</b> <b>disturbances</b> has a number of similarities with the 'tragedy of the commons', which is well known from resource economics, particularly the open access to use the resource. In this paper we apply the 'tragedy of the commons' framework to describe the management aspects <b>of</b> water <b>bird</b> shooting and we report from an empirical survey on the use of voluntary agreements among hunters for co-ordinating the shooting in local areas. Based on a questionnaire survey, we show that voluntary agreement among hunters has improved the local shooting in a number of cases.

30|$|Human activity, {{including}} dogs, horses, and vehicles, can disturb {{birds on}} beaches, and some species appear {{more sensitive to}} disturbance than others (Lafferty 2001; Glover et al. 2011). Humans and dogs are the main form of human activity at Southern California beaches (McCrary and Pierson 2000; Lafferty 2001). Unpredictable patterns <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> prevent <b>birds</b> from finding refuge, and while associations between instantaneous human and shorebird use might not be clear (McCrary and Pierson 2000; Lafferty 2001; Neuman et al. 2008), birds will move to areas protected from disturbance (Lafferty et al. 2006). <b>Birds</b> <b>of</b> prey predate on shorebirds and other species on beaches and may act as an additional source <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> for foraging and roosting birds. Therefore, the degree <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> may affect the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> from beach to beach.

50|$|Threats {{come from}} habitat loss through building, {{pollution}} or vegetation growth, or <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> breeding <b>birds</b> by humans, vehicles, boats or dogs.

Overgrown vegetation may be burned to clear the ground, and gulls can be killed or discouraged by deliberate disturbance. Contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) resulted in enhanced levels of feminisation in male embryos, which seemed to disappear prior to fledging, with no effect on colony productivity, but dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), which results from the breakdown of DDT, led to very low levels of successful breeding in some US locations.|$|R

The barrier beach at Napatree Point, RI, provides important breeding habitat for several bird species, key stopover habitat for thousands of migrating shorebirds, and is also a popular destination for people. Anecdotal evidence suggested that walkers, joggers, dogs, and watercraft were disrupting birds that foraged and roosted at this site. Our objectives were to characterize the frequency and sources <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> to <b>birds</b> and use this information to develop management recommendations to minimize the frequency <b>of</b> human <b>disturbances</b> to <b>birds</b> at Napatree Point. We conducted 106 hours of observation from May through August in 2013. Of 211 flight responses, the most common sources <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> to <b>birds</b> were beach walkers (57. 8 %), motorboats (8. 5 %), kayaks (8. 5 %), bird watchers (7. 6 %), and anglers (6. 2 %).

40|$|The {{effects on}} <b>birds</b> <b>of</b> forest insects, tree diseases, wildfire, and {{management}} strategies {{designed to improve}} forest health (e. g., thinning, prescribed burns, road removal, and spraying with pesticides or biological microbial agents) are discussed. Those <b>bird</b> species <b>of</b> concern that occur in forested habitats in eastern Oregon and Washington, USA include the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), harlequin duck (Histrionicus histrionicus), upland sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda), northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis), and black rosy finch (Leucosticta arctoa). In addition, seven species of woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus, P. arcticus, P. tridactylus, Melanerpes lewis and Dryocopus pileatus) and nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea and S. carolinensis) were considered because of their rare status. Forest disturbances that create dead trees and logs are critical to cavity-nesting birds because the dead trees with their subsequent decay provide nesting and roosting habitat. The insects associated with outbreaks or dead trees provide prey for the woodpeckers and nuthatches. The loss of nest or roost trees as a result <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> could be detrimental to bald eagles, goshawks, or ferruginous hawks, while the loss of canopy cover could be detrimental to harlequin ducks and goshawks or to prey {{of some of the}} raptors. The more open canopies created by thinning may be beneficial to a species like the black rosy finch, yet detrimental to some woodpeckers due to a decrease in cover. Prescribed burning may be beneficial to those woodpeckers primarily associated with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands and detrimental to other woodpeckers because of the loss of coarse woody debris. Removal of roads is likely to benefit most of these species because of the subsequent decrease in human activity.

It is also interesting to note that all the boxes of high noise level zone remain inactive. Statistical analysis shows that the response is positive. Hence the nest box replacement may be considered as one of the solutions to enhance the population of sparrows particularly in urban and suburban areas...|$|R
40|$|With a   growing human population, cities {{keep growing}} {{worldwide}} altering ecosystem   and thereby affecting the species living in these areas. Most studies of   urbanization {{and its effect}} on ecosystem have been conducted in the western   world and little is known about its effect in the neotropical part of the   world. I examined effects of fragment size, vegetation structure and   connectivity of urban green areas on bird species richness, mean abundance,   diversity and biomass in La Paz, Bolivia. Additionally, the effects <b>of</b>   different <b>disturbance</b> variables on bird community were evaluated. In total,   36 bird species were found in 24 fragment of varying size, connectivity and   level <b>of</b> <b>disturbance.</b> <b>Bird</b> species richness decreased with increasing   disturbance while connectivity and fragment size did not contribute   significantly to explain the variation in species richness at count point scale (p> 0. 005, multiple linear regression). At fragment   scale, however, species richness increased with fragment sizes,   which has been shown in other studies from neotrophical regions. Variation in   abundance, diversity or biomass could not be explained by connectivity,   fragment size or disturbance.      Furthermore, coverage of construction had a negative effect on species   richness while coverage of bushes and coverage of herbs were negatively   related to biomass and diversity, respectively. The composition <b>of</b> <b>bird</b>   species differed with size and <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> the fragments, so that more   omnivorous and granivorous species such as Zonotrichia capensis, Turdus chiguanco and Zenaida auriculata, were present in areas highly affected by human activities. Larger fragments,   less affected by human presence held a larger proportion of insectivorous   species...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{application}} of DPIV methods is presented for measuring velocity and vorticity distributions in vertical cross sections through {{the wake of}} a freely flying bird (thrush nightingale) in a wind tunnel. A dual-camera system is used, and successive cross-correlation operations remove lens/camera distortions, and then the undisturbed background flow, so that the final operation simply examines the <b>disturbance</b> effect <b>of</b> the <b>bird</b> alone. The concentration and tuning of processing methods to the disturbance quantities allows full exploitation of the correlation calculation and estimation algorithms. Since the ultimate objective is to deduce forces and power requirements on the bird itself from the wake structure, the analytical procedure is followed through an example on a fixed airfoil, before sample results from extensive bird flight tests are described. The wake structure of the thrush nightingale in slow (5 -m/s) flight is qualitatively quite similar to those previously described in the literature, but certain quantitative details are different in important respects...|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} a partial summary of a literature review {{dealing with the}} effect of noise on wildlife emphasizing the effects on birds. Beginning with studies in the Netherlands and, later, in the United States, {{a series of studies}} have indicated that road noise has a negative effect on bird populations (particularly during breeding) in a variety of species. These effects can be significant with ‘effect distances’ (i. e., those within which the density <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> is reduced) <b>of</b> two to three thousand meters from the road. In these reports, the effect distances increase with the density of traffic on the road being greatest near large, multilane highways with high densities. A similar effect has been reported for both grassland and woodland species. It {{is important to note that}} 1) not all species have shown this effect and 2) some species show the opposite response, increasing in numbers near roads or utilizing rights-of-way. It is important to determine the cause of this effect and to utilize additional or alternative methods beyond population densities as the sole measure of effect distance, because the latter is susceptible to variation due to changes in overall population density. Recommendations for further study are given, including alternative measures <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> in <b>birds...</b>|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Through passive {{adaptation}} to incidental flow, flexible aerodynamic surfaces exploit effects of increased lift, delayed stall and <b>disturbance</b> rejection. Wings <b>of</b> <b>birds,</b> bats, and insects exhibit these passive effects, {{and at the}} same time through the use of structural state feedback sensed from the loads on the wing, active control is applied to achieve stable and highly dynamic maneuvers. The goal of this research is to predict aerodynamic loads on flexible wings, by sensing their structural responses to static and dynamic airflow conditions. Three approaches are presented to estimate aerodynamic loads on highly flexible membrane wings, under static and dynamic conditions, at low Reynolds number. The first applies a linear membrane formulation to correlate the wing's structural strain to lift, through wing-tip vorticity. In the second, the Poisson equation for a 2 D linear-elastic membrane with out-of-plane deformation was used to calculate normal pressure distribution from virtual strain sensors using proper orthogonal decomposition basis functions and a recursive least squares minimization. Finally, potential flow theory and a first order state space representation is applied to the transient flow effects around a pitching membrane airfoil to model the time varying loads due to dynamic pitching...|$|R
