5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had been called to the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|The mosques at Gedi {{contained}} {{wells and}} washing facilities, {{which would have}} been used for cleansing prior to worship. However, they were not constructed with minarets used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> to prayer, which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with anterooms flanking the central room, which had a roof supported by wood beams resting on square stone pillars. The isles created by the pillars obstructed the view of the mihrab, which were situated on the north walls in the direction of Mecca.|$|E
5|$|This species' call is a distinctive, plaintive cooOOoo-woo-woo-woooo, {{uttered by}} males to attract females, {{and may be}} mistaken <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> of an owl at first. (Close up, a grating or throat-rattling sound may be heard {{preceding}} the first coo.) Other sounds include a nest call (cooOOoo) by paired males to attract their mates to the nest sites, a greeting call (a soft ork) by males upon rejoining their mates, and an alarm call (a short roo-oo) by either male or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound {{that is hard to}} hear. The wing whistle is much louder and more noticeable upon take-off and landing.|$|E

5000|$|Proper {{telephone}} etiquette {{recommends that}} the wrongly dialled party politely inform the caller of that fact, {{and also that}} the caller apologize rather than simply hanging up. Often the two parties will confirm {{whether or not the}} intended number is indeed the number that was reached (e.g. [...] "Is this 555-0184?") before ending <b>the</b> <b>call.</b> It is widely considered [...] "dangerous" [...] <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>called</b> party to disclose their phone number — rather it is considered more prudent to require <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> party to state which number he dialled and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>called</b> party to simply confirm whether or not that is his number.|$|R

The CLI remains similar to ODBC, and applications can be ported from one platform to the other with few changes.|$|E

25|$|In a December {{game against}} the Seattle Seahawks, Testaverde was {{involved}} in a play that was cited as an impetus for the NFL's adoption of a new instant replay review system the next season. With the Jets trailing 31-26 and twenty seconds left in the game, Testaverde attempted to score on a quarterback sneak on fourth and goal from the Seattle five-yard line. Testaverde had been tackled and the ball was not across the goal line when this happened, but because Testaverde's helmet had crossed the line the game's head linesman, Earnie Frantz, ruled the play a touchdown. The Jets won the game 32-31 and the loss was said to have cost the Seahawks a playoff berth and coach Dennis Erickson his job. The game's referee, Phil Luckett, drew criticism <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> although he was not the one who made it.|$|E
25|$|TV station callsigns in Canada {{are usually}} {{made up of}} four letters, {{although}} two stations have three call letters (CKX in Brandon and CKY in Winnipeg) and some (primarily CBC-owned Radio-Canada stations) have five. The first call letter is always C, and callsigns of privately owned television stations start with the two-letter combinations of CF, CH, CI, CJ, or CK. The combinations CG, CY, CZ and several combinations beginning with V and X are also assigned to Canada, but to date no Canadian television station has ever been licensed to take a call sign within those ranges. There is no clear rule <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> letters of rebroadcasterssome are labelled by the call-letters of the originating station, followed by a number, while others have their own distinct call letters. Low-power repeater transmitters (LPRTs) have their own unique callsign format, which consists of the letters CH followed by four numbers. Some rebroadcast transmitters are licensed as semi-satellites, which are licensed to air separate commercials (and, on rarer occasions, {{a limited amount of}} distinct programming) targeted to their community of license.|$|E

[...] Pitcher Todd Worrell faced the Royals Jorge Orta first, Orta hit a slow ground ball to first baseman Jack Clark, who flipped the ball to Worrell at first for the apparent out.

There he learnt to shoot and ride horses, allowing him to join the Suffolk Imperial Yeomanry after the outbreak of the Second Boer War. After demobilisation he worked briefly as an apprentice to an engineer in Wales before moving to London to become a barrister.

[...] In 1910 Mexico's President Porfirio Diaz was overthrown by a reform leader, Francisco Madero, beginning the Mexican Revolution which would last for nearly a decade. Madero was supported by General Victoriano Huerta in putting down a series of revolts in 1912, but the following year was assassinated by the General, who then seized power. Though many countries recognized the Huerta government, President Woodrow Wilson would not, and he hoped to return Mexico to a constitutional government by backing Venustiano Carranza.

The dejected Homer, feeling that no one respects him, turns to TV for solace and comes across a live space shuttle launch, which he finds dull. Meanwhile, NASA, frustrated over its drop in the Nielsen ratings, decides to send an [...] "average shmoe" [...] into space as the solution. At that moment, Homer telephones NASA to complain about their [...] "boring space launches", as well as asking if they know where he can find some Tang, and NASA chiefs realize they have found their man. When they arrive at Moe's Tavern in search of Homer, who is currently calling Bill Clinton to ask about Tang, he believes he is in trouble for making a prank call to NASA and blames Barney for the incident. The NASA employees ask Barney to be an astronaut, and when Homer realizes what the proposal entails, he steps in and takes credit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E
500|$|At 4:30pm Pacific Time, Nixon, Chotiner, and Rogers were {{discussing}} where {{the public should}} be told to send their responses to the speech, when a Dewey aide telephoned for Nixon. Reluctantly, suspecting the reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>call,</b> Chotiner brought Nixon to the phone {{to speak with the}} New York governor. Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower's aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state {{at the end of his}} telecast. Nixon asked what the general wanted him to do. Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general's view. The candidate replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. The governor suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow—the two-time losing presidential candidate was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower's aides wanted to find out, they could watch just like everyone else. Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, [...] "And tell them I know something about politics, too!" ...|$|E
