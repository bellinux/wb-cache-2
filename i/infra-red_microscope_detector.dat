30|$|The {{results from}} Pt 2 with many biopsies and smaller masses {{with a low}} {{variation}} in mass showed a clear trend consistent with the heterogeneity of normal liver parenchyma, with strictly decreasing CV and SK with increasing masses. The strong decreasing trend of the CV indicates that the basic element of the heterogenic pattern is larger than or similar in size to the biopsies in the group with the largest masses (about 70 mg). The decreasing positive SK indicates a rather frequent and repetitive presence of hot spots of radioactivity, i.e. microsphere clusters or regional gatherings. The small sample investigated by light microscopy showed a similar and slightly higher CV (2.1) and SK (4.9) than was identified by activity measurements on the sample group of origin (CV of 1.3 and SK of 4.0; Table 4). These findings seem {{to agree with the}} repetitive microscopic vascularisation structure of the liver.

Besides recording the particle fluence, they allow for energy deposition quantification, i. e. linear energy transfer (LET) determination by measuring the fluorescence signal. A correlation between LET and measured fluorescence intensity was already observed but suffers, especially concerning the clinical LET range, from large variabilities. Since a precise relation between those two quantities is still desirable, {{the aim of this}} Bachelor’s thesis was to evaluate different sources of uncertainty regarding the measured fluorescence intensity. Therefore, a set of 66 detectors was irradiated with mono-energetic particle beams covering a LET range of 1 - 150 keV/um. This results in 22 data points with different LET values consisting of each three irradiated detectors. Intensity measurements were performed using a commercial confocal laser-scanning microscope. The read out of this set of detectors enables to investigate <b>microscope</b> and <b>detector</b> related fluctuations. Different read out days and the read out with different laser powers influence the resulting fluorescence signals only slightly.
