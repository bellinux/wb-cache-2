5|$|Coastal troop deployments, {{comprising}} five {{companies of}} infantry, were concentrated mostly at 15 strongpoints called Widerstandsnester ("resistance nests"), numbered WN-60 {{in the east}} to WN-74 near Vierville in the west, located primarily around the entrances to the draws and protected by minefields and wire. Positions within each strongpoint were interconnected by trenches and tunnels. As well as the basic weaponry of rifles and machine guns, more than 60 light artillery pieces were deployed at these strongpoints. The heaviest pieces were located in eight gun casemates and four open positions while the lighter guns were housed in 35 pillboxes. A further 18 anti-tank guns completed the <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> artillery targeting the beach. Areas between the strongpoints were lightly manned with occasional trenches, rifle pits, and 85 machine-gun emplacements. No area of the beach was left uncovered, and the <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> weapons meant that flanking fire could {{be brought to bear}} anywhere along the beach.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's final <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> the {{libretto}} came in 1911, when it {{was included}} in the fourth volume of his Original Plays. However, Gilbert died before he could correct proofs for that edition, and so it reprinted the 1871 text, correcting only a few spelling mistakes.|$|E

5|$|William's <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> {{his forces}} implies {{that he planned}} to open the battle with archers in the front rank {{weakening}} the enemy with arrows, followed by infantry who would engage in close combat.

5|$|After Williams' death, Audrey Williams filed a suit in Nashville against MGM Records and Acuff-Rose. The suit {{demanded that}} both of the {{publishing}} companies continue to pay her half of the royalties from Hank Williams' records. Williams had an agreement giving his first wife half of the royalties, but allegedly there was no clarification that the deal was valid after his death. Because Williams may have left no will, the <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> the other fifty percent was considered uncertain; those involved included the second Mrs. Williams and her daughter and Hank Williams' mother and sister.|$|E

The {{probable}} posts of greatest danger, at the front and especially {{the rear of the}} column, were given to the military orders. They had the most experience of fighting in the East, were arguably the most disciplined, and were the only formations which included Turcopole cavalry who fought like the Turkish horse archers of the Ayyubid army.|$|E

5|$|Bougainville {{questioned}} {{some of the}} men captured {{during the}} battle. He learned from them the <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> men and materials all the way from Albany to Fort William Henry. Other captured British ended up as slaves to the Indians.

5|$|Differences {{of opinion}} over social order between {{northern}} and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans, ultimately led to the American Civil War. Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.|$|E
