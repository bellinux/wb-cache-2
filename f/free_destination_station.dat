30|$|Despite the {{hierarchical}} master-slave cluster structure, all the communications {{are done in}} a peer-to-peer fashion between any pair of source and <b>destination</b> <b>stations.</b> Note that the term destination in this context refers to the next-hop destination of a packet (which will be specified by the routing protocol) and not necessarily to its final <b>destination</b> <b>station.</b> Routing {{is out of the}} scope of the basic definition of DQMAN, but any existing routing protocol could be applied on top of DQMAN without any restriction. Therefore, the master just acts as an indirect coordinator of the peer-to-peer communications within the cluster but it has no explicit control on the access to the channel.|$|R

30|$|To {{alleviate}} the hidden station problem, virtual carrier sensing {{has been introduced}} to wireless MAC layers [18]. It {{is based on a}} two-way handshaking that precedes data transmission. One such virtual sensing mechanism is the 802.11 Request To Send/Clear To Send (RTS/CTS) exchange mechanism [19]. In this mechanism, the source station transmits a short control frame, called RTS, to the <b>destination</b> <b>station.</b> Upon receiving the RTS frame, the <b>destination</b> <b>station</b> replies by a CTS frame, indicating that it is ready to receive the data frame. Both RTS and CTS frames contain the total time of the data transmission. All stations receiving either RTS or CTS will keep silent during the data transmission period (e.g., station C in Figure 2).|$|R

40|$|Abstruct-A shared {{directional}} multichannel (SDM) {{consists of}} a set of inputs and a set of outputs to which we connect transmitters and receivers, respectively. A signal placed at any given input reaches a subset of the outputs, and a channel is specified by the sets of outputs that are reachable from each input. A message is received successfully at an output of the channel if and only if it is addressed to the receiver connected to that output and no other signals reach that output at the same time. Constructive lower bounds as well as some upper bounds on the uniform-traffic capacity of SDM-based single-hop interconnections between a set of multitransmitter source stations and a set of multireceiver <b>destination</b> <b>stations</b> are derived. (Every source station is connected to every <b>destination</b> <b>station</b> through the channel.) A bidirectional interconnection among a set of stations would be obtained by representing each station as one source <b>station</b> and one <b>destination</b> <b>station.</b> Both randomized transmissions and deterministic scheduling are considered. It is shown that with randomized transmissions, SDM’s that can be described as a collection of buses can perform as well as any other ones. With deterministic scheduling, however, the use of certain non-bus-oriented SDM’s yields a much higher interconnection capacity.

50|$|As {{a result}} of fares being set on a zonal basis, single or return tickets do not show a <b>destination</b> <b>station</b> - they display an 11-character {{abbreviation}} of the origin station name.

50|$|There are {{regular train}} {{services}} {{from other parts}} of the UK to the south west, principal <b>destination</b> <b>stations</b> being Barnstaple, Exeter, Newquay, Penzance and Plymouth.

30|$|COST: {{the meaning}} of this factor varies in every {{alternative}} choice. (1) The pricing method of Shanghai URT system is restricted by the origin and <b>destination</b> <b>stations</b> information, without regarding which stations the route passed. That is, the cost in emergency is the same as in normal state. (2) As the shuttle bus replaces the interrupting section, passengers must leave and reenter the URT system. The cost consists of four parts: (a) origin station to Shanghai Railway Station; (b) Shanghai Railway Station to a certain subway station by the shuttle bus. This service is free based on the previous emergent situations. (c) A certain <b>station</b> to <b>destination</b> <b>station.</b> (d) ¥ 1 privilege is given at reentering the URT system. (3) The only cost passengers need to pay is from origin station to Shanghai Railway Station. (4) Taxi fare is used as the cost of mode 4.|$|R
50|$|As {{the train}} {{approaches}} the <b>destination</b> <b>station,</b> announcements are made concerning arrival time updates, {{and a general}} call for the passengers to gather up their personal belongings. At 9:00 am the train arrives in the <b>destination</b> <b>station.</b> Passengers may not immediately detrain at this point, as the autoracks are first decoupled from the consist, {{and in the case}} of the Sanford station, the passenger cars are split into two sections to fit on Sanford's shorter platforms. At this point the passengers are then allowed to detrain and move to the auto claim area. Cleaning crews move into the train once all passengers are off and the train is re-supplied with that day's food and water. The passenger cars' seat backs are all changed to allow everyone in seats to ride facing forward. The train's power (locomotive engines) is turned around, using a railway turntable in Lorton and a wye in Sanford.|$|R
