2500|$|In Barenboim's {{recording}} of The Well-Tempered Clavier, he makes {{frequent use of}} the right-foot sustaining pedal, a device absent from the keyboard instruments of Bach's time (although the harpsichord was highly resonant), producing a sonority {{very different from the}} [...] "dry" [...] and often staccato sound favoured by pianist Glenn Gould. Moreover, in the fugues, he often plays one voice considerably louder than the others, a practice impossible on a harpsichord. According to some scholarship, this practice began in Beethoven's time (see, for example, Matthew <b>Dirst's</b> book Engaging Bach). When justifying his interpretation of Bach, Barenboim claims that he is interested in the long tradition of playing Bach that has existed {{for two and a half}} centuries, rather than in the exact style of performance in Bach's time: ...|$|R

This is specially true for carefully designed block ciphers for which advanced cryptanalysis (e. g. : linear, differential) is not applicable. In this paper, we <b>dirst</b> update {{the cost of an}} exhaustive key search of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Then we illus- trate how a time-memory tradeoff attack can be mounted for a similar cost, with much more dramatic consequences...|$|E
40|$|This {{workshop}} explored {{machine learning}} approaches to 3 topics: (1) finding structure in music (analysis, continuation, and comple-tion of an unfinished piece), (2) modeling perception of time (ex-traction of musical meter, explanation of human data on timing), and (3) interpolation in timbre space. In recent years, NIPS has heard neural networks generate tunes and harmonize chorales. With {{a large amount of}} music becoming available in computer readable form, real data can be used to train connectionist models. At the beginning of this workshop, Andreas Weigend focused on architectures to capture structure on multiple time scales. J. S. Bach's last (unfinished) fugue from Die Kunst der Fuge served as an example (<b>Dirst</b> & Weigend, 1994). 1 The prediction approach to continuation and completion, as well as to modeling expectations, can be charac-terized by the question "What's next?". Moving to time as the primary medium of musical communication, the inquiry in music perception and cognition shifted t...|$|E
