Peter has successfully reigned as mayor despite many mistakes, such as giving people jobs picked out of a hat rather than based on the person's skills.

25|$|Road {{construction}} from {{logging and}} mining operations decreases the distance hunters <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{to reach a}} given section of the forest to hunt, making what was previously a multi-day trip possible to complete within a day.

25|$|A single {{draught horse}} can {{normally}} pull a single-furrow plough in clean light soil, but in heavier soils two horses are needed, one {{walking on the}} land {{and one in the}} furrow. For ploughs with two or more furrows more than two horses are needed and, usually, one or more horses <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> on the loose ploughed sod– and that makes hard going for them, and the horse treads the newly ploughed land down.

25|$|The shutdown, however, {{was not for}} long. Tourism to Alaska {{began to}} increase, with many cruise ships {{stopping}} at Skagway.

Cruise operators, remembering the attraction of the little mountain climbing trains to their passengers, pushed for a re-opening of the line as a heritage railway. The White Pass was and is perfectly positioned to sell a railroad ride through the mountains to cruise ship tourists; they do not even <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> far.|$|E

In September 2003, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held to mark the official opening of the arena.

[...] "At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became 'Anna Wintour,' at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public," [...] wrote The Guardian. [...] "I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> about a mile into the office before you get to her desk and I'm sure it's intentional," [...] Coddington says.

500|$|Some {{discussion}} in local media has focussed on alleged problems within the community. In 1999, The Australian reported {{that many of}} Cullacabardee's residents were unemployed, had no public transport despite 20 years of State Government management and no access to jobs, shops, education or health services. The article noted that [...] "residents <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up to [...] along a dangerously busy road or through a bush track to reach a shop or bus stop", and that the nearest primary school is [...] away. Nine derelict homes in the community were being refurbished under a training scheme to assist young community members to gain skills, although the community claimed that funding was only available for 12-month periods, making apprenticeships (which run for several years) impossible to offer. A review report into the community in 2000 identified these and other {{issues such as the}} land being zoned General Rural, effectively prohibiting residential development, and the illegal dumping of concrete demolition rubble and other refuse near the community.|$|E
500|$|Pistons coach Larry Brown {{was not yet}} very concerned, because {{fights in}} the NBA rarely lasted {{for more than a}} few seconds. During the altercation, Artest lay down on the scorer's table to relax while putting on a headset to speak with Pacers radio {{broadcaster}} Mark Boyle. The microphone was not live. Boyle recalled that the broadcasting team knew Artest's personality and [...] "there was no way we were going to put an open mic in front of [...] in that situation". Pacers president Donnie Walsh later stated that Artest was following advice he had received on how to calm down and avoid trouble in a volatile situation. After unsuccessfully attempting to break up the confrontation, referees prepared to eject various players before the game resumed. Sportscaster Mike Breen, calling the game for ESPN, believed Wallace would be ejected, while Bill Walton was of the opinion that Stephen Jackson should be ejected as well, for shouting at the Pistons players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if ejected, Wallace would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> past the Pacers bench, which could trigger another incident.|$|E
500|$|Zaillian {{discussed}} many of {{the themes}} in Larsson's Millennium series with Fincher, taking the pair deeper into the novel's darker subjects, such as the psychological dissimilarities between rapists and murderers. Fincher {{was familiar with the}} concept, from projects such as Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2007). Zaillian commented, [...] "A rapist, or at least our rapist, is about exercising his power over somebody. A serial killer is about destruction; they get off on destroying something. It's not about having power over something, it's about eliminating it. What thrills them is slightly different." [...] The duo wanted to expose the novels' pivotal themes, particularly misogyny. [...] "We were committed to the tack that this is a movie about violence against women about specific kinds of degradation, and you can't shy away from that. But {{at the same time you}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> a razor thin line so that the audience can viscerally feel the need for revenge but also see the power of the ideas being expressed." [...] Instead of the typical three-act structure, they reluctantly chose a five-act structure, which Fincher pointed out is [...] "very similar to a lot of TV cop dramas." ...|$|E
