A short piece shows that Van Kooten feels guilty because {{he still has}} not finished translating Mazdazdan {{is an example of}} this. If he continues work on the papers he has the idea that his guilt will dissipate because it represents a constructive act. He gives himself the idea that he is doing 'something'. Also, Van Kooten states that the innocence and simplicity of the fifties opposes the superficiality of the eighties. The warm family life then counters the chilly aloofness of Frans towards his father. Even Van Kooten cannot enjoy his life either. At least, not without his wife. He suffers under the fact that he cannot enjoy anything as much as before. He is uncertain without the warmth of his family and is worried that Barbara would leave him for a man with more humor.|$|E
40|$|A large {{international}} {{sample was}} used to test whether <b>hedonia</b> (the experience of positive emotional states and satisfaction of desires) and eudaimonia (the presence of meaning and development of one’s potentials) represent 1 overarching well-being construct or 2 related dimensions. A latent correlation of. 96 presents negligible evidence for the discriminant validity between Diener’s (1984) subjective well-being model of <b>hedonia</b> and Ryff’s (1989) psychological well-being model of eudaimonia. When compared with known correlates of well-being (e. g., curiosity, gratitude), eudaimonia and <b>hedonia</b> showed very similar relationships, save goal-directed will and ways (i. e., hope), a meaning orientation to happiness, and grit. Identical analyses in subsamples of 7 geographical world regions revealed similar results around the globe. A single overarching construct more accurately reflects <b>hedonia</b> and eudaimonia when measured as self-reported subjective and psychological well-being. Nevertheless, measures of eudaimonia may contain aspects of meaningful goal-directedness unique from <b>hedonia...</b>|$|E
30|$|From Aristotle to {{contemporary}} positive psychology, well-being or happiness has been usefully proposed {{to consist of}} at least two ingredients: <b>hedonia</b> and eudaimonia (Aristotle 2009; Seligman et al. 2005). While definitions of these by philosophers and psychologists have varied, most generally agree that <b>hedonia</b> at least corresponds psychologically to a state of pleasure. Thus a particularly important topic for hedonic psychology and affective neuroscience is to understand how pleasure is generated by brain mechanisms so as to contribute to well-being. Fortunately, deciphering <b>hedonia</b> in the brain is a task in which considerable progress has already been made. Eudaimonia by comparison may be more difficult to define philosophically or approach scientifically, but most agree it corresponds to some cognitive and/or moral aspect of a life lived well and not to any mere emotional feeling. We view eudaimonia to mean essentially a life experienced as valuably meaningful and as engaging. Thus, for psychological neuroscience of the future another major goal will be to uncover how such experiences are reflected in patterns of brain activity (Urry et al. 2004).|$|E

40|$|The {{perception}} of reward {{is crucial in}} many psychological processes. Wise (1982) {{has suggested that the}} neurotransmitter dopamine is involved in producing 'hedonic' responses to rewards. Dopamine is also involved in the control of movement and hunger. Testing dopamine's role in reward perception is therefore complicated by these other actions; the effects of manipulations can often be interpreted as actions on hunger or motor control, rather than on reward. Two methods are described in this thesis which isolate reward effects. The effects of dopaminergic drugs on the rewarding impact of exploration were investigated. The use of exploration eliminates the influence of hunger, while the impact of motor deficits was reduced by using choice measures. Control experiments assessed effects on activity and emotionality. Results indicated that dopamine was involved in exploratory reinforcement independently of its roles in hunger or simple motor control. Tests of whether dopamine is involved in <b>hedonia,</b> or merely in engaging responses to reinforcers, used the 'behavioural contrast' paradigm. Contrast occurs when animals over-react to unexpected changes in reinforcement and allow response elicitation effects to be dissociated from effects on <b>hedonia.</b> Although the dopamine anatagonist a-flupenthixol did not affect contrast induced by changes in reinforcement value, the introduction or withdrawal of the drug could, itself, induce contrast effects. It is concluded that dopamine is involved in <b>hedonia</b> independently of any involvement in response elicitation. A speculative model of the nature of dopamine’s involvement in <b>hedonia</b> is proposed and its implications for our understanding of Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia, in which dopamine dysfunctions are implicated, are discussed...|$|E

In particular, {{we were interested}} in the development and changes of motor and non-motor features (anxiety, motivation and <b>hedonia)</b> of disease over time and their interactions. We found tgHD animals to be hyperkinetic in the open field test compared to their wild-type littermates at all ages tested, which was accompanied by reduced anxiety-like behaviour in the open field test and the elevated zero maze, but not in the home cage emergence test. No major changes were found in <b>hedonia</b> (sucrose intake test) and motivation for food (food intake test). Our data suggest that hyperkinetic features and reduced-anxiety in the tgHD rats are associated behaviours and are seen in the earlier stages of the disease. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Studies {{show that}} {{happiness}} leads to success nearly in every life domain, including work. Employees who are happier have superior productivity, creativity, performance {{and are more}} satisfied with their jobs. All these perks make the topic of happiness highly relevant for the business world. This thesis aims {{to get a better}} understanding of how the job affects happiness by distinguishing between two different paths to happiness and well-being that origin from the philosophical terms <b>hedonia</b> and eudaimonia. <b>Hedonia</b> can be described as the pursuit of pleasure and eudaimonia as the pursuit of meaning. <b>Hedonia</b> and eudaimonia will be assessed in general and in job-settings in order to evaluate how these orientations affect the global happiness of individuals. By using the model of subjective well-being by Diener and by analyzing its hedonic facets of life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect, in general and on the job, it was determined under what conditions or in what situations on the job an individual will contribute to their happiness. The same approach was used to assess eudaimonic well-being. The dimensions of the model of psychological well-being by Ryff, were evaluated as facets and it was assessed how each of these dimension; environmental mastery, self-acceptance, positive relationships, growth, autonomy and purpose, affected global happiness in job-related settings. The results of the analysis of the facets are presented in a visual model that shows how these facets contribute positively to happiness. Nevertheless, this model has a lot of limitations that are a reflection of the challenges in the field, where there is a problem with the semantics, with the categories of analysis, with the research methods and biases, and all the differing perspectives of the leading researchers...|$|E
30|$|Therefore here we {{will focus}} mostly upon the <b>hedonia</b> or {{pleasure}} aspect of well-being. The pleasure aspect is most tractable, {{and can be}} inspected against a growing background {{of understanding of the}} neural foundations for specific pleasures. Supporting a hedonic approach to happiness, happy people typically feel more pleasure in life. Indeed {{it has been suggested that}} the best and simplest measure of well-being may be to merely ask people how they hedonically feel right now--again and again--so as to track their hedonic accumulation across daily life (Kahneman 1999). Such repeated self-reports of hedonic states could also be used to identify more stable neurobiological hedonic brain traits that dispose particular individuals toward happiness. Conversely, it will probably not be much disputed that the capacity for pleasure is essential to normal well-being. Pathological loss of pleasure can be devastating, and precludes well-being. Our aim is to use findings from recent research on brain mechanisms of pleasure to ask how to higher states of <b>hedonia</b> might be generated to produce well-being, and conversely what might go wrong in affective disorders (Berridge and Kringelbach 2008; Kringelbach and Berridge 2010; Leknes and Tracey 2010; Smith et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|Most {{people want}} to be happy. But if happiness, or well-being, comes in {{different}} forms, which one should they pursue? Some researchers do argue that the traditional hedonic view of life satisfaction and pleasant feelings are necessary but not sufficient constituents of a good life. This alternative viewpoint contains both <b>hedonia</b> and eudaimonia which emphasizes personal growth and engagement. With the use of participants from Lofoten Folk High School, Norway (N = 89) orientations and feelings toward hedonic and eudaimonic dimensions of well-being were investigated. An experimental priming task concerning task difficulty, as well as an intervention study was conducted. The attempt of priming the participants into different kinds of well-being orientations did not succeed. However, results revealed that eudaimonically oriented participants had a preference for engaging themselves in more challenging activities, as compared with less eudaimonically oriented individuals. During the five-day intervention study the participants focused either on expressing gratitude (<b>hedonia)</b> or developing a personal skill (eudaimonia). Results showed that expressing gratitude had the most positive effect on well-being; affecting mood, as well as both hedonic and eudaimonic feelings. This tells us that there might in fact be more to well-being than the traditional viewpoint indicates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDrug {{addiction}} {{is viewed as}} a maladaptive memory induced by contextual cues even in the abstinent state. However, the variations of <b>hedonia</b> and appetite induced by the context during the abstinence have been neglected. To distinguish the representative behaviors between <b>hedonia</b> and appetite, micro-behaviors in abstinent animal such as psycho-activity and drug seeking behaviors were observed in morphine conditioned place preference (CPP). To confirm the different effects of reward between drug and natural reward, a palatable food CPP paradigm was compared in current work. After a 10 -day training in CPP with morphine or food, the preference was tested on day 1, 14, 28, and the changes of micro-behaviors were analyzed further. Our data showed that tree shrews treated with morphine performed more jumps on day 1 and more visits to saline paired side on day 28, which indicated a featured behavioral transition from psycho-activity to seeking behavior during drug abstinence. Meanwhile, food-conditioned animals only displayed obvious seeking behaviors in the three tests. The results suggest that the variations of micro-behaviors could imply such a transition from hedonic response to appetitive behaviors during morphine abstinence, which provided a potential behavioral basis for further neural mechanism studies...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: How is {{happiness}} generated via {{brain function}} in lucky {{individuals who have}} {{the good fortune to}} be happy? Conceptually, well-being or happiness has long been viewed as requiring at least two crucial ingredients: positive affect or pleasure (<b>hedonia)</b> and a sense of meaningfulness or engagement in life (eudaimonia). Science has recently made progress in relating hedonic pleasure to brain function, and so here we survey new insights into how brains generate the hedonic ingredient of sustained or frequent pleasure. We also briefly discuss how brains might connect <b>hedonia</b> states of pleasure to eudaimonia assessments of meaningfulness, and so create balanced states of positive well-being. RESULTS: Notable {{progress has been made in}} understanding brain bases of hedonic processing, producing insights into that brain systems that cause and/or code sensory pleasures. Progress has been facilitated by the recognition that hedonic brain mechanisms are largely shared between humans and other mammals, allowing application of conclusions from animal studies to a better understanding of human pleasures. In the past few years, evidence has also grown to indicate that for humans, brain mechanisms of higher abstract pleasures strongly overlap with more basic sensory pleasures. This overlap may provide a window into underlying brain circuitry that generates all pleasures, including even the hedonic quality of pervasive well-being that detaches from any particular sensation to apply to daily life in a more sustained or frequent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Hedonic insights are applied to understanding human well-being here. Our strategy combines new findings on brain mediators that generate the pleasure of sensations with evidence that human brains use many of the same hedonic circuits from sensory pleasures to create the higher pleasures. This in turn may be linked to how hedonic systems interact with other brain systems relevant to self-understanding and the meaning components of eudaimonic happiness. Finally, we speculate a bit about how brains that generate <b>hedonia</b> states might link to eudaimonia assessments to create properly balanced states of positive well-being that approach true happiness...|$|E
30|$|We note {{in passing}} that our {{focus on the}} <b>hedonia</b> {{component}} of happiness {{should not be confused}} with hedonism, which is the pursuit of pleasure for pleasure's own sake, and more akin to the addiction features we describe below. Also, to focus on hedonics does not deny that some ascetics may have found bliss through painful self-sacrifice, but simply reflects that positive hedonic tone is indispensable to most people seeking happiness (Bok 2010; Bok 2010; Diener et al. 2008; Gilbert 2006; Kahneman 1999; Seligman et al. 2005).|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which <b>hedonia,</b> salience and prediction error hypotheses predicted different patterns of dopamine (DA) release in the striatum during learning of conditioned avoidance responses (CARs). The data strongly favor the latter hypothesis. It predicts that during learning of the 2 -way active avoidance CAR task, positive prediction errors generated when rats do not receive an anticipated foot-shock (which is better than expected) cause DA release that reinforces the instrumental avoidance action. In vivo microdialysis in the rat striatum showed that extracellular DA concentration increased during early CAR learning and decreased throughout training returning to baseline once the response was well learned. In addition, avoidance learning was proportional {{to the degree of}} DA release. Critically, exposure of rats to the same stimuli but in an unpredictable, unavoidable, and inescapable manner, did not produce alterations from baseline DA levels as predicted by the prediction error but not hedonic or salience hypotheses. In addition, rats with a partial lesion of substantia nigra DA neurons, which did not show increased DA levels during learning, failed to learn this task. These data represent clear and unambiguous evidence that it was the factor positive prediction error, and not <b>hedonia</b> or salience, which caused increase in the tonic level of striatal DA and which reinforced learning of the instrumental avoidance response.

30|$|Beyond {{the default}} network, other {{cortical}} networks {{have been proposed}} to correspond by direct activation with eudaimonic evaluations of self, relation to others, and with meaningful themes related to life satisfaction (Heller et al. 2009; Schacter et al. 2007). These include dorsolateral prefrontal, and other parietal and temporal cortex networks. In short, the default network and lateral cortical networks whose activation encodes evaluations of self and life meaning stand among the brain candidates for a substrate that might mediate eudaimonic appraisals. How these networks actually embody eudaimonia components, and how they link evaluations of life meaningfulness and satisfaction with pleasurable states of <b>hedonia,</b> remains a major puzzle for psychological neuroscience to unravel in the future.|$|E

40|$|The {{pursuit of}} {{happiness}} is a preoccupation for many people. Yet only the pursuit can be promised, not happiness itself. Can science help? We focus on the most tractable ingredient, <b>hedonia</b> or positive affect. A step toward happiness might be gained by improving the pleasures and positive moods in daily life. The neuroscience of pleasure and reward provides relevant insights, and we discuss how specific hedonic mechanisms might relate to happiness or the lack thereof. Although the neuroscience of happiness {{is still in its}} infancy, further advances might be made through mapping overlap between brain networks of hedonic pleasure with others, such as the brain's default network, potentially involved in the other happiness ingredient, eudaimonia or life meaning and engagement...|$|E
30|$|The {{tendency}} {{of pleasure and}} meaningfulness ratings to cohere together opens a potential window of opportunity to the neuroscientific study of both aspects of well-being (Kringelbach and Berridge 2009; Urry et al. 2004). If both <b>hedonia</b> and eudaimonia co-occur in the same happy people, then identifying neural markers of one may give a toehold into identifying the other. Still, most would probably agree that eudaimonic happiness poses harder challenges to psychology and neuroscience. It is difficult even to define life meaningfulness in {{a way as to}} avoid dispute, let alone to tie a happy sense of meaningfulness to any specific brain patterns of activation. The difficulties of approaching eudaimonic meaning are not insurmountable in principle, but for the foreseeable short term seem likely to remain obstacles to affective neuroscience.|$|E

Integrating these theoretical perspectives affords an opportunity to hypothesize that ‘green’ buildings could enrich human experience by promoting psychological and social engagement (eudaimonia) while providing healthier indoor environments that enhance the well-being of its occupants (<b>hedonia).</b> This paper provides evidence to support the intuition that an architecture that sustains the well-being of its occupants will be valued and endure...|$|E

40|$|Positive {{psychology}} {{has significantly}} advanced {{our understanding of}} well-being, yet there remains a need {{to better understand the}} how, what, and why of both positive and negative well-being. This study combined positive psychology and job loss perspectives to investigate the subjective experience of well-being following job loss. Using a qualitative-focused case study methodology, this three article dissertation explored the experiences of 20 workers who were displaced from the Ottawa, Canada technology sector from 2000 - 2006. The first article explored the experience of well-being from a bottom-up, naturalistic point of view and compared these inductive notions with existing a priori theories. Findings support integrated conceptualizations of <b>hedonia</b> and eudaimonia, while also potentially identifying new notions of well-being. Identified themes include (a) life evaluation, (b) transitory experiencing, (c) growth and grounding, (d) environmental mastery/stability, (e) mental ill-being/ill-health, and (f) motivational mindsets/conditions. This study showed well-being to be a rich, pluralistic construct. It included the non-dualistic notions of both subjectivity and objectivity, as well as encompassing notions related to the what and how of well-being. The second and third articles present inductively derived themes which helped to explain the relationship between job loss and well-being (i. e., the how and why). Three externally focused themes were reported in the second article: (a) systemic factors (e. g., broader business environment), (b) interpersonal factors (e. g., social support), and (c) chance (e. g., luck and serendipity). The third article identified two internally focused major themes: (a) differential coping responses and processes and (b) protective and sensitizing processes. Coping specifically consisted of problem-focused coping, meaning-making, attitudes and expectancies, behavioural processes, and emotional processes. Protective and sensitizing processes included identity and self-esteem, the impact of past adversity, and personal resources and characteristics. Implications for theory, research, and practice for both positive psychology and job loss are discussed.

40|$|The orientations to {{happiness}} scale (OTH) {{was designed to}} measure three routes {{to happiness}}: pleasure (<b>hedonia),</b> meaning (eudaimonia) and engagement (flow).

However, these findings are inconsistent with other research; one plausible explanation being that the OTH scale lacks validity. This was tested by having participants (N = 107) complete the OTH scale and the Satisfaction with Life scale, prior to completing an online diary reporting actual instances of hedonic and eudaimonic behaviour. Although meaning predicted eudaimonic behaviour, the pleasure orientation was unrelated to hedonic behaviour.

40|$|Enjoyment in {{life among}} Amazonian Urarina is {{examined}} {{through the lens}} of two contrastive concepts of happiness. The first, “tranquility,” is a relatively long-term, relational condition implying emotional spontaneity and a flexible, freely chosen work routine that allows for a merging of action and awareness. It epitomizes a broader concern with the development of an individual “style of life,” where attitudes, manners, and actions come into alignment. The second concept, “joy,” is a fleeting state of excitement and anticipation, epitomized by the prospect of sharing a meal. While the two concepts imply a distinction between the sensuous and the moral, or pleasure and the good life—loosely analogous to the classic distinction between <b>hedonia</b> and eudaimonia—it is argued that the experience of joy in its purest form effectively crystallizes and intensifies many of the ingredients that make up tranquility, thus resolving the tension by suggesting the possibility of harmony between sensory enjoyment and virtuous living...|$|E
30|$|It {{should also}} be noted that other murine tests not {{explored}} in this study could also be used to establish the relationship between acute exposure to mefloquine and emotional disinhibition, including the resident-intruder test (Einat 2007)—such an approach could also be valuable in elucidating mefloquine’s putative relation to aggressive behavior—and <b>hedonia</b> as measured by the sweetness preference test (Flaisher-Grinberg and Einat 2009). Studies of startle behavior could be helpful in disambiguating whether mefloquine’s effects on activity in the current study are indicative of anxiolysis or not. Should mefloquine have an anxiolytic effect, it should decrease startle magnitude; conversely, if mefloquine induces a more fundamental emotional disinhibition of the kind that that underlies confusional psychosis and mania, we should see exactly the opposite. A separate issue is whether the effects shown here are the result of mefloquine’s effects on adenosine or through some other mechanism; studies of co-administration with adenosine antagonists could be illustrative in this regard. In the future, we hope to incorporate the use of behavioral recording software to more precisely track behavior in these and other tests.|$|E

30|$|Those few hedonic {{hotspots}} {{in which}} damage does destroy normal pleasure might be {{particularly important to}} <b>hedonia</b> in happy people. The most crucial hotspot for normal pleasures known so far is {{the one in the}} ventral pallidum. The ventral pallidum hotspot is the only brain location where lesion damage has been found in our lab studies to eliminate normal sensory pleasure, and so convert sweetness from a nice into a nasty experience (Pecina 2008; Pecina and Smith 2010; Smith et al. 2010). This site is still preserved in locked-in patients, perhaps contributing to their remaining well-being. Damage to the ventral pallidum brain site abolishes hedonic 'liking' reactions to sweetness and replaces them instead with disgust or 'disliking' reactions (e.g., gapes) as though the sweet taste had turned bitter (Berridge et al. 2010; Cromwell and Berridge 1993; Smith et al. 2010). The ventral pallidum is the chief recipient of output from the nucleus accumbens and part of a corticolimbic circuit that extends from prefrontal cortex to nucleus accumbens to ventral pallidum, which then loops up via thalamus to begin the circuit all over again in prefrontal cortex (Smith et al 2010).|$|E
3000|$|Conceptually, hedonic {{processing}} and eudaimonic meaningfulness {{are very different}} from each other. Yet, empirically, in real people well-being has been found to involve both together. High questionnaire scores for <b>hedonia</b> and eudaimonia typically converge in the same happy individual (Diener et al. 2008; Kuppens et al. 2008). That is, if a person self-reports to be hedonically happy, then that same person is also likely to report a high sense of positive meaningfulness in life. For example, in happiness surveys, over 80 percent of people rate their overall eudaimonic life satisfaction as [...] "pretty to very happy". Comparably, 80 percent also rate their current hedonic mood as positive (for example, positive 6 - 7 on a 10 point valence scale, where 5 is hedonically neutral (Diener et al. 2008; Kuppens et al. 2008). A lucky few may even live consistently around a hedonic point of 8. Beyond that, however, there may be such a thing as being too happy. Excessively higher hedonic scores above 8 may actually impede eudaimonic attainment of life success, however, as measured by wealth, education, or political participation (Oishi et al. 2007).|$|E

Mental health is conceived of as a syndrome of subjective wellbeing consisting of symptoms of <b>hedonia</b> (positive feelings toward life) and eudaimonia (positive functioning in life).

40|$|Recently, the {{disagreement}} that separates hedonic from eudaimonic philosophers {{has spread to}} the science of wellbeing. This has resulted in two opposing perspectives regarding both wellbeing concepts and proposed pathways to wellbeing. Whilst contention continues, most contemporary psychologists now agree that hedonic and eudaimonic approaches each denote important aspects of wellbeing. This has led to integrated wellbeing conceptualisations, in which the combined presence of hedonic and eudaimonic wellbeing components {{is referred to as}} ‘flourishing’. In regard to the attainment of wellbeing, research simultaneously investigating hedonic and eudaimonic pathways suggests that a life rich in both types of pursuits is associated with the highest degree of wellbeing. Despite this assertion, previously underemphasised methodological limitations question the validity of such claims. To further progress this important area of investigation, future research directions to ameliorate said limitations are explored. It is recommended that the past tendency to contrast and compare <b>hedonia</b> and eudaimonia be abandoned, and instead that the inherent value of both be recognised. Time-use research methods are needed to cross-validate past findings obtained from cross-sectional research, which will make it possible to transition from purely descriptive conclusions to applied conclusions. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Resting EEG is {{sensitive}} to transient, acute effects of nicotine administration and abstinence, but the chronic effects of smoking on EEG are poorly characterized. This study measures the resting EEG profile of chronic smokers in a non-deprived, non-peak state to test whether differences in smoking behavior and personality traits affect pharmaco-EEG response. Methods Resting EEG, impulsiveness, and personality measures were collected from daily smokers (n = 22), nondaily smokers (n = 31), and non-smokers (n = 30). Results Daily smokers had reduced resting delta and alpha EEG power and higher impulsiveness (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) compared to nondaily smokers and non-smokers. Both daily and nondaily smokers discounted delayed rewards more steeply, reported lower conscientiousness (NEO-FFI), and reported greater disinhibition and experience seeking (Sensation Seeking Scale) than non-smokers. Nondaily smokers reported greater sensory <b>hedonia</b> than nonsmokers. Conclusions Altered resting EEG power in daily smokers demonstrates differences in neural signaling that correlated with greater smoking behavior and dependence. Although nondaily smokers share some characteristics with daily smokers that may predict smoking initiation and maintenance, they differ on measures of impulsiveness and resting EEG power. Significance Resting EEG in non-deprived chronic smokers provides a standard for comparison to peak and trough nicotine states and {{may serve as a}} biomarker for nicotine dependence, relapse risk, and recovery...|$|E
