Analysis of metal plastic flow velocity in the edging passes, during the flat bars rolling process, was carried out.

The different height of band has influenced on the metal plastic flow during the band rolling in the flat rolls...|$|E

40|$|If a graph embeds in {{a surface}} with k crosscaps, does it always have an {{embedding}} {{in the same}} surface in which every <b>edge</b> <b>passes</b> through each crosscap at most once? This well-known open problem can be restated using crossing numbers: the degenerate crossing number, dcr(G), of G equals the smallest number k so that G has an embedding in a surface with k crosscaps in which every <b>edge</b> <b>passes</b> through each crosscap at most once. The genus crossing number, gcr(G), of G equals the smallest number k so that G has an embedding in a surface with k crosscaps. The question then becomes whether dcr(G) = gcr(G), {{and it is in}} this form that it was first asked by Mohar. We show that dcr(G) ≤ 6 gcr(G), and dcr(G) = gcr(G) as long as dcr(G) ≤ 3. We can separate dcr and gcr for (single-vertex) graphs with embedding schemes, {{but it is not clear}} whether the separating example can be extended into separations on simple graphs. Finally, we show that if a graph can be embedded in a surface with crosscaps, then it has an embedding in that surface in which every <b>edge</b> <b>passes</b> through each crosscap at most twice. This implies that dcr is NP-complete...|$|R

50|$|A {{group of}} polygons which are {{connected}} by shared vertices {{is referred to}} as a mesh. In order for a mesh to appear attractive when rendered, it is desirable that it be non-self-intersecting, meaning that no <b>edge</b> <b>passes</b> through a polygon. Another way of looking at this is that the mesh cannot pierce itself. It is also desirable that the mesh not contain any errors such as doubled vertices, edges, or faces. For some purposes {{it is important that the}} mesh be a manifold - that is, that it does not contain holes or singularities (locations where two distinct sections of the mesh are connected by a single vertex).|$|R
50|$|As the {{principal}} curvatures are the eigenvalues {{of the second}} fundamental form, there are two at each point, and these give rise to two points of the focal surface on each normal direction to the surface. Away from umbilical points, these two points of the focal surface are distinct; at umbilical points the two sheets come together. When the surface has a ridge the focal surface has a cuspidal edge, three such <b>edges</b> <b>pass</b> through an elliptical umbilic and only one through a hyperbolic umbilic. At points where the Gaussian curvature is zero, one sheet of the focal surface will have a point at infinity corresponding to the zero principal curvature.|$|R

50|$|A common {{interior}} {{point of}} two edges, {{at which the}} first <b>edge</b> <b>passes</b> {{from one side of}} the second edge to the other, is called a crossing. Two edges of a topological graph cross each other if they determine a crossing. For any integer k > 1, a topological or geometric graph is called k-quasi-planar if it has no k pairwise crossing edges.Using this terminology, if a topological graph is 2-quasi-planar, then it is a planar graph.It follows from Euler's polyhedral formula that every planar graph with n > 2 vertices has at most 3n &minus; 6 edges. Therefore, every 2-quasi-planar graph with n > 2 vertices has at most 3n &minus; 6 edges.|$|R

The aerodynamic theory developed {{can be used to}} predict airloads felt by a helicopter blade experiencing a blade/vortex interaction for high blade tip speed and/or for small vertical blade/vortex separation. Under these conditions one can show that the blade's trailing edge has little influence on the character of the chordwise loading at all spanwise sections; thus, the chord may be allowed to extend to infinity in the downstream direction. Therefore, the model considered here is that of a quarter-infinite flat plate wing with side <b>edge</b> <b>passing</b> subsonically through an oblique gust...|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, a topological graph is a {{representation}} of a graph in the plane, where the vertices of the graph are represented by distinct points and the edges by Jordan arcs (connected pieces of Jordan curves) joining the corresponding pairs of points. The points representing the vertices of a graph and the arcs representing its edges are called the vertices and {{the edges of the}} topological graph. It is usually assumed that any two edges of a topological graph cross a finite number of times,no <b>edge</b> <b>passes</b> through a vertex different from its endpoints, and no two edges touch each other (without crossing).
