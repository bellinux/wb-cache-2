The club was formed to allow the players to combine professional football with higher education. Team Bath rose rapidly through the English football league system, reaching the Conference South in its ninth season, but disbanded after one season at that level following a decision by the Football Conference and The Football League that its <b>financial</b> <b>structure</b> disqualified it from further promotion.|$|E

In May 1999, {{he was named}} president and CEO of Harvard Vanguard's parent company, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a non-profit health benefits organization. The company had lost $58 million in 1998 and was predicted to lose over $90 million in 1999. Baker responded by cutting the workforce by 90 people, increasing premiums, establishing new contracts with Massachusetts physicians, reassessing the company's <b>financial</b> <b>structure,</b> and outsourcing its information technology.

In 2009, THSRC negotiated with the government to change the method of depreciation from depending on concessions on rights to ridership. At the same time, the government also started to help refinance THSRC's loans to assist the company so it could remain operational and profitable. In 2015, the government injected NT$30 billion as a financial bailed out, boosting the government's stake to about 64% from about 37%. The government also extended the rail concession from 35 years to 70 years and terminated the company’s build-operate-transfer business model.|$|E

40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis has required policymakers {{to reconsider the}} role that the <b>structure</b> of their <b>financial</b> systems plays in achieving good economic outcomes. A number of forces can be expected to change <b>financial</b> intermediation <b>structures</b> in the period ahead, including crisis intervention measures and an evolving regulatory reform agenda. The changing <b>structures</b> for <b>financial</b> intermediation (through banks or nonbanks, funded by deposits or other sources, interconnected domestically or across borders) can be expected to affect economic growth, its volatility, and financial stability. This chapter investigates these potential relationships from 1998 to 2010 using the measures for <b>financial</b> <b>structures</b> developed in Chapter 3. With this knowledge, the chapter forms ideas about how the evolving <b>financial</b> <b>structures</b> relate to economic outcomes. It is worth recognizing that forming concrete inferences about the relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>structures</b> and economic growth is difficult—as is most work on the determinants of growth. First, time series of detailed cross-country data on <b>financial</b> <b>structures</b> are short, circumscribing the ability to do long-term analyses. Second, the recent period for which data is available included a very severe financial crisis, and while some techniques can control for its influence, the ability to isolate structural effects is difficult.

25|$|In 2000, the Chester-Upland School District was {{declared}} financially distressed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, {{resulting in the}} appointment of a Special Board of Control. On March 8, 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak issued a Declaration Concerning Reestablishment of Sound <b>Financial</b> <b>Structure</b> in Chester-Upland School District, stating that the Special Board of Control of the Chester-Upland School District had operated the district for a period sufficient to reestablish a sound <b>financial</b> <b>structure,</b> and, notwithstanding the district's many serious and continuing educational performance and other problems, a sound <b>financial</b> <b>structure</b> had been reestablished in the District. As a result of this declaration, the Empowerment Board of Control was replaced by a new three-member Empowerment Board of Control to address the district's poor educational performance while managing its fiscal condition.
