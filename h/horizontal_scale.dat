40|$|Simple {{physical}} relations (namely, the Rossby ratio between {{vertical and}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>scales</b> in quasi-geostrophic flow and the dispersion relation for internal gravity waves) {{are used to}} estimate the vertical resolution consistent with a given horizontal resolution. Using these relations {{it is found that}} virtually all large scale models and observing systems have inadequate vertical resolution.

40|$|Sea surface {{elevation}} and bottom pressure anomalies due to thermohaline forcing are examined through analytical and numerical models, including Boussinesq and non-Boussinesq models. It is shown that Boussinesq approximations can introduce noticeable errors, {{depending on the}} spatial and temporal scales of the perturbations. According {{to the theory of}} geostrophic adjustment, when the initial perturbations have <b>horizontal</b> <b>scales</b> com-parable to the barotropic radius of deformation, the initial pressure perturbations will be basically retained through the adjustment. On the other hand, if the initial perturbations have <b>horizontal</b> <b>scales</b> much smaller than the barotropic radius of deformation, the initial pressure perturbations will be largely lost. Precipitation has <b>horizontal</b> <b>scales</b> on the order of 10 – 100 km, much smaller than the barotropic radius of deformation. Thus, for timescales longer than days, the contribution from individual precipitation events to the local free {{surface elevation}} and bottom pressure is small and is difficult to identify from satellite data. On the other hand, thermal forcing has <b>horizontal</b> <b>scales</b> comparable to the barotropic radius of deformation, so its long-term contribution to sea surface height anomaly is noticeable and is easily identified from satellite data. Because Boussinesq models induce faulty sea surface height and bottom pressure signals, the errors introduced by these models are noticeable for anomalies in large-scale [O(1000 km) ] thermohaline forcing. 1...|$|R
30|$|Scalability {{focuses on}} the general ability to process {{arbitrary}} workloads. A definition of scalability for distributed systems in general and with respect to DDBMSs is provided by Agrawal et al. [40], where the terms scale-up, scale-down, scale-out and scale-in are defined focusing on the management of growing workloads. Vertical as well as <b>horizontal</b> <b>scaling</b> techniques are applied to distributed DBMSs and can also be applied to DFSs. Vertical scaling applies by adding more computing resources to a single node. While <b>horizontal</b> <b>scaling</b> applies by adding nodes to a cluster (or in general to the instances of a certain application component).|$|R
