5000|$|Edaphic Climax: When {{there are}} more than one climax {{communities}} in the region, modified by local conditions of the substrate such as soil moisture, soil nutrients, topography, slope <b>exposure,</b> <b>fire,</b> and animal activity, it is called edaphic climax. Succession ends in an edaphic climax where topography, soil, water, fire, or other disturbances are such that a climatic climax cannot develop.|$|E
50|$|The term {{fire-retardant}} {{as applied}} to organic (i.e., containing carbon) materials, is intended to refer to reduced fire hazard, as all will burn under certain circumstances. The tests used specified in building codes, such as NFPA 701, are more correctly flame resistance tests, which test a fabric's ability to resist ignition with the flame size and duration in the test conditions. The result is a comparative test, which provides {{a measure of the}} material's resistance to propagating combustion caused by small scale ignition sources. These tests do not predict the burning characteristics of full scale hazards. In many cases, if exposed to a sufficiently large and sustained <b>exposure</b> <b>fire,</b> the fire-retardant fabrics will burn vigorously. Polyester is inherently flame retardant, and therefore doesn't flare up when applied to various tests. Any amount of heat delivered within a long enough time interval will have no impact on the fabrics' integrity while a limited amount of heat delivered within short enough time interval may ignite or melt the fabric. A simple method for evaluating the threshold incident energy for ignition or melting of fabrics as a function of convective and radiant heat flux has been developed.|$|E

The one test that deviated showed a V-pattern emanating from the floor behind the entertainment center giving the appearance that the “fire origin could be interpreted to be located on or near the floor behind the entertainment center when the fire origin was to the left and along side the television inside the entertainment center” (Hoffmann et al. 2003). The researchers report this deviation in the fire patterns was caused by “the burning, melting and dripping of the plastic electronic appliance next to the television” (Hoffmann et al. 2003).|$|E

40|$|Successful use of {{fire has}} been {{essential}} to survival throughout {{the majority of}} human history—an environmental pressure that {{may have led to}} cognitive mechanisms dedi-cated to attaining mastery of fire manipulation and control. Concordant with this hypothesis is the fact that, despite its inherent danger, the frivolous use of fire remains firmly embedded within modern societies; conversely, in societies where fire is used for utilitarian purposes, ethnographic reports suggest that fire is considered mundane. The exposure hypothesis holds that the attraction to fire in modern societies is {{due to the lack of}} adequate <b>exposure</b> to <b>fire</b> throughout childhood. Two studies—comprising North American samples that have had significantly different levels of exposure to fire—investigated the relationship between frequency of <b>exposure</b> to <b>fire</b> throughout childhood and psychological associations with fire. Psychological associations with fire were overwhelmingly positive in both samples. Study 1 found no significant association between childhood <b>fire</b> <b>exposure</b> and positive affective associations with fire.

40|$|Cavity walls {{containing}} combustible insulation {{present an}} increased risk for fire propagation in a confined, concealed space. Damage to the building resulting from ignition of combustible insulation can be extensive; especially so, {{in the absence of}} horizontal and vertical fire-stops. Current codes and standards assess fire performance of exterior wall assemblies subjected to external ignition sources. However, test methods do not address the potential fire hazard resulting from ignition of combustible insulation within the wall cavity. A fire performance test has been developed that evaluates the fire propagation behavior of combustible insulation in a configuration that is representative of the actual installation. The test utilizes a full scale cavity wall assembly and offers fire performance evaluation of insulation of any thickness for either a 51 [*]mm or 102 [*]mm wide air space. A propane sand burner was selected as the ignition source; in addition to being reliable and repeatable, its heat output was carefully calibrated to be representative of potential ignition scenarios that may occur within a cavity wall. During the 15 minute fire performance test, the sample is continuously subjected to the propane sand burner <b>exposure</b> <b>fire.</b> An acceptable sample will produce a peak chemical heat release rate less than 100 [*]kW and a maximum visible flame height less than 1. 8 [*]m.

Technology for glass consists of two production cycles ? first glass mass technology and second glass products technology. In such technology we identified the following typical manufacturing processes, characterized by the presence of dangerous factors: transportation of raw materials, which is characterized by the influence of noise effects on respiratory aerosols, ergonomic factors impact, industrial injuries; burning and melting, which is characterized by the influence of combustion products, fumes and aerosols feedstock <b>exposure,</b> <b>fire</b> or explosion hazard, infrared radiation molten material influence, electrical injuries, noise impact; manual operations in the production and restoration works and reconstruction, characterized by ergonomic injuries, the influence of aerosols.

40|$|We {{explore the}} effect of post—fire microsites on seed and {{seedling}} distribution and hence their potential role in community restoration. A summer wildfire and control burn in a sclerophyll shrubland in mediterranean Australia produced mosaics of physically and chemically contrasting microsites of litter and sand. Most seeds (> 75 %) of all species released from the burnt canopies fell, or were redispersed by wind, into the litter patches after both fires. Data on microsite characteristics and wind <b>exposure</b> (<b>fire</b> intensity), height of fruits, time of release, and seed properties were required to interpret relative distribution between the litter and sand patches. Seeds remained equally viable (up to 100 %) over summer—autumn in the litter and sand and had equally high rates and levels (up to 100 %) of subsequent winter germination. However, seedlings were 2 — 3 times less likely {{to survive in the}} litter and survivors were 35 % smaller than those in the sand {{by the end of the}} first summer. Banksia hookeriana was particularly vulnerable to microsite properties, whereas the needle—leaved Hakea polyathema showed only minor responses. Pre—summer thinning of seedlings in the litter increased survival of the remainder by 2 times and size of the survivors by 31 %. The fire—sensitive, small—seeded B. hookeriana had 17 times more seeds in the backburn litter than the resprouting, larger—seeded B. attenuata, which more than compensated for its 3 times greater seedling mortality levels over the dry summer. Recruitment of species prone to density—dependent mortality in the litter was enhanced by the retention of some seeds in the sand where competition for water was minimal, as indicated by the 2. 2 times greater stomal conductance of their seedlings in early summer...|$|E
40|$|Tropical {{hardwood}} {{species are}} more and more used in the field of construction due to the particular qualities they can offer. Presently it is no longer possible to envisage the development of construction materials and products without taking into consideration the problem of their fire behaviour, and more particularly of their fire resistance. In the case of timber elements, this characteristic is mainly influenced by the charring rate of the external layers of the element. On the other hand this parameter is influenced by the density of the material. Limited information is available on the charring rate of tropical hardwood species. Therefore experimental investigations have been conducted at the University of Liege to study this characteristic. Seven tropical and three timber species from temperate countries have been examined. Two types of test have been used, one on small specimens, the other on a construction element made of one single material. In the first type, 20 specimens have been manufactured by gluing several laminates together. The specimens were instrumented with four thermocouples inserted at various depths in four different laminates. In the second type, a non-loaded wall made of 12 glued-laminated spruce beam profiles was instrumented with thermocouples embedded at different depths in the panel for the evaluation of the charring rate. Experimental charring rates have been compared with the results derived from Eurocode EC 5 - 1. 2 recommendation [ENV 1995 - 1 - 2. Eurocode 5 : Design of timber structures - Part 1 - 2 : General rules - Structural fire design. European prestandard; 1994], Australian standard AS 1720. 4 relation [AS 1720. 4.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} is to assess how the Customer Delivery Center (CDC) satisfies prescriptive design requirements of the 2012 International Building Code (IBC) for fire exiting, structural design, smoke detection, alarm notification and communication and water-based fire suppression. A performance-based analysis is then performed using hand calculations and computer-based models {{to determine if the}} available safe egress time exceeds the required safe egress time from the building. In order to complete this analysis, the issued-for-construction design and the contractor submittals were made accessible by the owner’s fire protection engineer and the project management group overseeing construction. These documents were reviewed and a thorough study was performed using the 2012 IBC, the NFPA 101 Life Safety Code (LSC) and other NFPA standards. All design elements that have been analyzed meet the IBC 2012 code requirements for safe egress. Occupants of this multi-use facility have been characterized and literature has been used to identify model parameters to determine total evacuation time for the building. The estimated total required evacuation time ranges from 6. 5 to 9. 9 minutes after alarm notification. The structural design satisfies all prescriptive requirements. The construction and building elements are designed to meet Type I-A per the IBC Section 503. The alarm system satisfies all prescriptive requirements. The current NFPA National Fire Alarm and Signaling Code (2013) and handbooks for fire alarm and signaling and system commissioning were consulted. Although a couple of omissions in the drawings were found during this analysis, only one recommendation for improving the design is made. Visual inspection of the ceiling mounted strobes in the warehouse should be performed to ensure that all areas have visibility of the signal. The water supply is sufficient in capacity and pressure to meet the system demand. The current NFPA standards for automatic sprinkler systems, private fire service mains, rack storage and system commissioning were consulted. The water suppression system design exceeds the minimum requirements in the code for water protection. No recommendations for improving the design have been made. Several performance based analyses are considered based on a hazard assessment and criteria from the Life Safety Code. The results of the performance based analysis of an open office workstation fire are included. A design fire in the third floor open office area results in tenable conditions of visibility, temperature and toxicity for allowing occupants to safely leave the third floor and all occupants to safely exit the building.

METHODS The study comprised 51 firefighters. Blood samples were taken within 24 [*]hr following <b>exposure</b> to <b>fire</b> smoke, {{and after a}} week and 3 months. Sputum was induced within 5 days post-exposure and subjects underwent spirometry and methacholine provocation one week post-exposure. Exposure was registered by a questionnaire. RESULTS No changes were observed following smoke exposure in bronchial hyperresponsiveness and serum pneumoprotein levels. Nevertheless, in a sizable proportion of the firefighters (44 %) elevated sputum neutrophil levels (≥ 60 %) were found. Serum IL- 8 concentrations were higher 24 [*]hr post-exposure compared to pre-exposure. Elevated neutrophil levels in sputum were associated with elevated serum IL- 8 (β[*]=[*] 0. 010, P[*]=[*] 0. 004) and TNFα (β[*]=[*] 0. 005, P[*]=[*] 0. 034) levels within 24 [*]hr post-exposure and IL- 8 elevation lasted up to 3 months.
