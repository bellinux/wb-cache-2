6000|$|... 3. It is {{an age of}} dreams, of adventure, of {{unbounded}} enthusiasm springing {{from the}} new lands of fabulous riches revealed by English explorers. Drake sails around the world, shaping the mighty course which English colonizers shall follow through the centuries; and presently the young philosopher Bacon is saying confidently, [...] "I have taken all knowledge for my province." [...] The mind must search farther than the eye; with new, rich lands opened to the sight, the imagination must create new forms to people the new worlds. Hakluyt's famous Collection of Voyages, and Purchas, His Pilgrimage, were even more stimulating to the English imagination than to the English acquisitiveness. While her explorers search the new world for the Fountain of Youth, her poets are creating literary works that are young forever. Marston writes:[114] [...] "Why, man, all their <b>dripping</b> <b>pans</b> are pure gold. The prisoners they take are fettered in gold; and as for rubies and diamonds, they goe forth on holydayes and gather 'hem by the seashore to hang on their children's coates." [...] This comes nearer to being a description of Shakespeare's poetry than of the Indians in Virginia. Prospero, in The Tempest, with his control over the mighty powers and harmonies of nature, is only the literary dream of that science which {{had just begun to}} grapple with the forces of the universe. Cabot, Drake, Frobisher, Gilbert, Raleigh, Willoughby, Hawkins,--a score of explorers reveal a new earth to men's eyes, and instantly literature creates a new heaven to match it. So dreams and deeds increase side by side, and the dream is ever greater than the deed. That is the meaning of literature.|$|R
50|$|PhIP {{has been}} found in cooked beef, pork, chicken, and fish products. Exposure to PhIP depends on the eating habits of the {{individual}} and can vary up to 5000-fold. Exposure is also related to the type of meat, doneness, cooking method, and quantity consumed. Individual exposures can differ due to various anti-carcinogens in the diet. Different cooking methods for meat (broiling, grilling, frying, roasting, <b>pan</b> <b>drippings)</b> all contribute to formation of PhIP.|$|R

50|$|A pastry brush, {{also known}} as a basting brush, is a cooking utensil used to spread butter, oil or glaze on food. Traditional pastry brushes are made with natural {{bristles}} or a plastic or nylon fiber similar to a paint brush, while modern kitchen brushes may have silicone bristles. In baking breads and pastries, a pastry brush is used to spread a glaze or egg wash on the crust or surface of the food.In roasting meats, a pastry brush may be used to sop up juices or <b>drippings</b> from under <b>pan</b> and spread them {{on the surface of the}} meat to crisp the skin.|$|R
5000|$|Heterocyclic amines are a {{group of}} {{chemical}} compounds, many {{of which can be}} formed during cooking. They are found in meats that are cooked to the [...] "well done" [...] stage, in <b>pan</b> <b>drippings</b> and in meat surfaces that show a brown or black crust. Epidemiological studies show associations between intakes of heterocyclic amines and cancers of the colon, rectum, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung, stomach/esophagus and animal feeding experiments support a causal relationship. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service labeled several heterocyclic amines as likely carcinogens in its 13th Report on Carcinogens. Changes in cooking techniques reduce the level of heterocyclic amines.|$|R

The dish is traditionally made from cheaper cuts of meat and cooked in a cast iron pot, typically for an extended time period in order to let the tough cuts of meat become tender. Beef, pork, chicken or any of a large variety of game meats are used for its preparation. Popular local varieties include hamburger steak, smothered rabbit, turkey necks, and chicken fricassee.|$|R
50|$|HCA {{formation}} during cooking {{depends on}} the type of meat, cooking temperature, the degree of browning and the cooking time. Meats that are lower in fat and water content show higher concentrations of HCAs after cooking. More HCAs are formed when pan surface temperatures are higher than 220oC (428oF) such as with most frying or grilling. However, HCAs also form at lower temperatures when the cooking time is long, as in roasting. HCA concentrations are higher in browned or burned crusts that result from high temperature. The <b>pan</b> <b>drippings</b> and meat bits that remain after meat is fried have high concentrations of HCAs. Beef, chicken and fish have higher concentrations than pork. Sausages are high in fat and water and show lower concentrations.|$|R
50|$|The {{sauce is}} {{prepared}} with shallots, mushroom, thyme, bay leaf, tarragon, white wine, brown veal stock and beurre maître d'hôtel (sweet butter infused with parsley). Additional ingredients may include meat glaze, demi-glace, <b>pan</b> <b>drippings,</b> onion, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, peppercorn and salt. The preparation involves cooking {{all of the}} ingredients together except for the brown veal stock and beurre maître d'hôtel, until it is reduced by two-thirds of the original content. After this, the veal stock is added in proportions equal {{to the amount of}} wine that was originally used before the reduction, and this mixture is then reduced to half its size. The final step is for the mixture to be strained and then topped with chopped tarragon and beurre maître d'hôtel.|$|R

5000|$|Part of the {{function}} of menu prose is to impress customers {{with the notion that}} the dishes served at the restaurant require such skill, equipment, and exotic ingredients that the diners could not prepare similar foods at home. In some cases, ordinary foods are made to sound more exciting by replacing everyday terms with their French equivalent. For example, instead of stating that a pork chop has a dollop of applesauce, a high-end restaurant menu might state [...] "Tenderloin of pork avec compôte de pommes." [...] Although [...] "avec compôte de pommes" [...] translates directly as [...] "with applesauce," [...] it sounds more exotic—and more worthy of an inflated price tag. Menus may use the culinary terms concassé to describe coarsely chopped vegetables, coulis to describe a puree of vegetables or fruit, or au jus, to describe meat served with its own natural gravy of <b>pan</b> <b>drippings.</b>|$|R
