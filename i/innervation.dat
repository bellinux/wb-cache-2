5|$|The {{surrounded}} sac {{becomes the}} primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, {{such as the}} esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The esophagus develops {{as part of the}} foregut tube. The <b>innervation</b> of the esophagus develops from the pharyngeal arches.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} skull, the cranial {{component}} detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around {{the level of}} the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius muscle to provide motor <b>innervation</b> to its upper part.|$|E
5|$|G-spot proponents are {{criticized for}} giving too much {{credence}} to anecdotal evidence, and for questionable investigative methods; for instance, the studies which have yielded positive {{evidence for a}} precisely located G-spot involve small participant samples. While {{the existence of a}} greater concentration of nerve endings at the lower third (near the entrance) of the vagina is commonly cited, some scientific examinations of vaginal wall <b>innervation</b> have shown no single area with a greater density of nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{function}} of the vagus nerve (X) {{will lead to a}} loss of parasympathetic <b>innervation</b> to {{a very large number of}} structures. Major effects of damage to the vagus nerve may include a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Isolated dysfunction of only the vagus nerve is rare, but can be diagnosed by a hoarse voice, due to dysfunction of one of its branches, the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E

5|$|Several {{researchers}} {{also consider the}} connection between the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak. The urethral sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral <b>innervation</b> of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because there are very few tactile nerve endings in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E
5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the {{hypoglossal nerve}} {{arise from the}} hypoglossal nucleus {{near the bottom of}} the brain stem. The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; <b>innervation</b> of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|These {{muscles are}} {{involved}} in moving and manipulating the tongue. The left and right genioglossus muscles in particular are responsible for protruding the tongue. The muscles, attached to {{the underside of the}} top and back parts of the tongue, cause the tongue to protrude and deviate towards the opposite side. The hypoglossal nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, involved in the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply <b>innervation</b> aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.|$|E

They are important in facilitating neuroendocrine immune interactions. Bi-directional communication between these two systems in both {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) and the periphery are arbitrated by the presence of these peptidergic <b>innervations.</b> These <b>innervations</b> interacting through unique ligand receptor binding complexes have immunomodulatory effects that preserve neuroendocrine and neuroimmune health...|$|R

5|$|In many species, the molars are {{relatively}} large, intricately structured, and highly cusped or ridged. Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles. The jaw musculature is strong. The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing. Rodent groups {{differ in the}} arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures, both from other mammals and amongst themselves. The Sciuromorpha, such as the eastern grey squirrel, have a large deep masseter, making them efficient at biting with the incisors. The Myomorpha, such as the brown rat, have enlarged temporalis muscles, making them able to chew powerfully with their molars. The Hystricomorpha, such as the guinea pig, have larger superficial masseter muscles and smaller deep masseter muscles than rats or squirrels, possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors, but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscles may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing. The cheek pouch is a specific morphological feature used for storing food and is evident in particular subgroups of rodents like kangaroo rats, hamsters, chipmunks and gophers which have two bags that may range from the mouth {{to the front of the}} shoulders. True mice and rats do not contain this structure but their cheeks are elastic due to a high degree of musculature and <b>innervation</b> in the region.|$|E
25|$|Sensory <b>innervation</b> of the {{temporomandibular}} joint {{is derived}} from the auriculotemporal and masseteric branches of V3 or mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. These are only sensory <b>innervation.</b> Recall that motor is to the muscles.|$|E

40|$|More than 30 % of the {{population}} suffers from obesity, which {{increases the risk of}} death and secondary health problems. Body fat [white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) ] are innervated and regulated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). WAT stores energy, while BAT generates heat for thermoregulation. Fat also has sensory <b>innervations,</b> but the roles of sensory nerves are still being elucidated. Hence, understanding the neuroanatomy of the SNS <b>innervations</b> of fat and the neural regulation of fat metabolism will be valuable for advancing obesity treatment. Using trans-synaptic tract tracers with unique fluorescent proteins, we defined and compared the SNS <b>innervations</b> of visceral fat [mesenteric WAT (MWAT) ] and subcutaneous fat [inguinal WAT (IWAT) ] and of IWAT and interscapular BAT (IBAT) in Siberian hamsters. MWAT and IWAT have moderately shared SNS <b>innervations</b> within the hindbrain, but separate SNS <b>innervations</b> in rostral regions. In contrast, IWAT and IBAT have relatively separate SNS circuitries throughout the brain yet some overlap in SNS nuclei known to regulate thermogenesis. We tested for the presence of functional coordination between IWAT and IBAT defined by overlap in IWAT SNS and IBAT SNS <b>innervations.</b> When IBAT function was impaired by SNS denervation, IWAT SNS drive, thermogenic activity, and beige adipocyte recruitment increased in cold exposed hamsters likely through coordination with IWAT SNS pathways. Conversely, we found that only SNS drive to IWAT increased during acute food deprivation suggesting that populations of SNS neurons singly innervating each fat depot may contribute to differential SNS drive to fat. Lastly, we demonstrated that IWAT sensory nerves mediate the functional coordination between IWAT and IBAT and the regulation of SNS drive to fat. The absence of IWAT sensory feedback via sensory denervation differentially decreased SNS drive to IBAT and IWAT itself, but not to MWAT, retroperitoneal WAT, and epididymal WAT in cold exposed hamsters. Collectively, the studies in this dissertation provide neuroanatomical evidence of separate and shared SNS brain sites likely receiving sensory signaling and regulating SNS drive to fat, and direct evidence of the roles of SNS and sensory nerves innervating fat to energetic homeostasis and thermoregulation...|$|R

50|$|Conduction {{abnormalities}} {{are also}} associated with T. cruzi. At the base of these conduction abnormalities is a depopulation of parasympathetic neuronal endings on the heart. Without proper parasympathetic <b>innervations,</b> one could expect to find not only chronotropic but also ionotropic abnormalities. It is true that all inflammatory and non-inflammatory heart disease may display forms of parasympathetic denervation; this denervation presents in a descriptive fashion in Chagas’ disease. It has also been indicated {{that the loss of}} parasympathetic <b>innervations</b> can lead to sudden death due to a severe cardiac failure that occurs during the acute stage of infection.|$|R
40|$|Aim. The length-contractile force {{relationships}} of six human extraocular muscles (EOMs) in primary <b>innervations</b> should be determined during eye movement modeling and surgery of clinical EOMs. This study aims to investigate these relationships. Method. The proposal {{is based on}} the assumption that six EOMs have similar constitutive relationships, with the eye suspended in the primary position. The constitutive {{relationships of}} EOMs are obtained by optimizing from previous experimental data and the theory of mechanical equilibrium using traditional model. Further, simulate the existing experiment of resistance force, and then compare the simulated results with the existing experimental results. Finally, the mechanical constitutive relationships of EOMs are obtained. Results. The results show that the simulated resistance forces from the other four EOMs except for the horizontal recti well agree with previous experimental results. Conclusion. The mechanical constitutive relationships of six EOMs in primary <b>innervations</b> are obtained, and the rationality of the constitutive relationships is verified. Whereafter, the active stress-strain relationships of the six EOMs in the primary <b>innervations</b> are obtained. The research results can improve the eye movement model to predict the surgical amounts of EOMs before EOM surgery more precisely...|$|R
40|$|In rodents, the circumvallate papilla (CVP), {{with its}} {{underlying}} minor salivary gland, the von Ebners' gland (VEG), {{is located on}} the dorsal surface of the posterior tongue. Detailed morphological processes to form the proper structure of CVP and VEG have not been properly elucidated. In particular, the specific localization patterns of taste buds in CVP and the branching formation of VEG have not yet been elucidated. To understand the developmental mechanisms underlying CVP and VEG formation, detailed histological observations of CVP and VEG were examined using a three-dimensional computer-aided reconstruction method with serial histological sections and pan-Cytokeratins immunostainings. In addition, to define the developmental processes in CVP and VEG formation, we examined nerve <b>innervations</b> and cell proliferation using microinjections of AM 1 - 43 and immunostainings with various markers, including phosphoinositide 3 -kinase, Ki- 67, PGP 9. 5, and Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA 1). Results revealed specific morphogenesis of CVP and VEG with nerve <b>innervations</b> patterns, evaluated by the coincided localization patterns of AM 1 - 43 and UEA 1. Based on these morphological and immunohistochemical results, we suggest that nerve <b>innervations</b> and cell proliferations play important roles in the positioning of taste buds in CVP and branching morphogenesis of VEG in tongue development...|$|R
