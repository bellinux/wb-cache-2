25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} spherical coordinate systems following other conventions are used outside mathematics. In a geographical coordinate system positions are measured in latitude, longitude and height or altitude. There are a {{number of different}} celestial coordinate systems based on different fundamental planes and with different terms for the various coordinates. The spherical coordinate systems used in mathematics normally use radians rather than degrees and measure the azimuthal angle counterclockwise from the -axis to the -axis rather than clockwise from north (0°) to east (+90°) like the horizontal coordinate system. The polar angle is often replaced by the <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> measured from the reference plane. <b>Elevation</b> <b>angle</b> of zero is at the horizon.|$|E
25|$|In {{astronomy}} {{there are}} a series of spherical coordinate systems that measure the <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> from different fundamental planes. These reference planes are the observer's horizon, the celestial equator (defined by Earth's rotation), the plane of the ecliptic (defined by Earth's orbit around the Sun), the plane of the earth terminator (normal to the instantaneous direction to the Sun), and the galactic equator (defined by the rotation of the Milky Way).|$|E
25|$|The SLR {{features}} active aerodynamics; {{there is}} a spoiler mounted on the rear integral air brake flap. The spoiler increases downforce depending on its angle of <b>elevation</b> (<b>angle</b> of attack). At a set speed, the spoiler/brake automatically raises to 10degrees (15degrees in the 722 edition), when demanded via the driver's switch, the elevation can be increased to 30degrees (35degrees in the 722 version) for increased rear downforce, {{at the cost of}} increased steady state drag.|$|E
40|$|The case {{of outdoor}} to indoor {{propagation}} prediction at high <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> has been scarcely addressed and no {{direct relationship between}} the <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> and the building penetration loss has been reported. High Altitude Platform Stations - a new means of providing International Mobile Telephony (IMT- 2000) -will be operating at high <b>elevation</b> <b>angles.</b> This paper examines {{the impact of the}} high <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> in the propagation mechanism and the penetration into buildings loss. A 3 -D ray-tracing tool was developed in order to simulate a specific environment of 11 buildings and take into account parameters, such as diffractions from building edges and rooftops. This approach concludes that the penetration loss is an increasing function of the <b>elevation</b> <b>angles.</b> © 2002 IEEE...|$|R
30|$|First, {{as stated}} previously, daytime GHz scintillations occur {{frequently}} over UKM and Langkawi, where satellite <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> are low. This {{finding is consistent}} with the idea that scintillation-producing irregularities are embedded in a relatively thin layer, and longer path lengths through irregularities are necessary to produce significant scintillations. This need for low <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> is also consistent with the idea that Esb layers are involved. In this regard, Zeng and Sokolovskiy (2010) used GPS radio occultation (RO) and concluded that the scintillations resulting from Es were a result of wave interference caused by defocusing of the GPS signal within the Es cloud, where this mechanism works for low <b>elevation</b> <b>angles.</b>|$|R

25|$|The RAF's {{airborne}} systems {{moved the}} antennas {{by moving the}} entire aircraft. In the case of GL, the bearing angle was already movable {{through the use of}} the rotating cabin. One solution to moving the <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> would be to have the vertical pole tilt, but for reasons that are not recorded in the references, this solution was not used. Instead, the upper antenna of the vertical pair was able to be moved up and down the ladder-like extension.|$|E
25|$|For {{the orbit}} of the Earth around the Sun, the time of apsis is often {{expressed}} in terms of a time relative to seasons, since this determines the contribution of the elliptical orbit to seasonal variations. The variation of the seasons is primarily controlled by the annual cycle of the <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> of the Sun, which {{is a result of the}} tilt of the axis of the Earth measured from the plane of the ecliptic. The Earth's eccentricity and other orbital elements are not constant, but vary slowly due to the perturbing effects of the planets and other objects in the solar system. See Milankovitch cycles.|$|E
25|$|Satellites Radiosat 1 through Radiosat 3 fly in {{geosynchronous}} (not geostationary) Tundra orbits. Like the geostationary orbit, {{the tundra}} orbit has {{a period of}} 23 hours, 56 minutes (one sidereal day). Unlike the geostationary orbit, the tundra orbit is elliptical, not circular, and is inclined {{with respect to the}} equator rather than orbiting directly over it. The eccentric orbit ensures that each satellite spends about 16 hours of each day high over the continental United States. At least one satellite is always visible, with another often visible as well. The orbit's high inclination places apogee just west of Hudson Bay in Canada, providing a much higher <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> for most of the country than is possible from a geostationary orbit. This reduces blockage from tall buildings in urban areas, allowing a much smaller terrestrial repeater network than does sister network XM, which uses geostationary orbits.|$|E

500|$|The BTO {{value was}} added to the ground station's data set to assist in geo-locating an {{aircraft}} following the Air France Flight 447 accident in 2009 and the initial BFO analysis—relating the BFO value to the <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> between the aircraft and satellite—was based on methods developed during the Flight 447 investigation. The first and seventh handshakes gave anomalous results and were excluded from the initial analysis, but the issue was later resolved. The initial analysis, accurate to approximately 1°, determined that <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> between the aircraft and satellite at the 08:11 handshake was 40°. When this was publicly disclosed by Malaysian officials, the arc was broken into two arcs—dubbed the [...] "northern corridor" [...] and [...] "southern corridor." [...] The first and seventh handshakes were later determined {{to be part of a}} log-on sequence, as opposed to the other handshakes that were log-on interrogation messages. The bias value during the logon sequence is different and was calculated using historical data for the aircraft's SDU. This allowed the distance between the satellite and aircraft to be determined at these times.|$|E

The radar stations send the centre a six-dimensional vector consisting of co-ordinates and velocities taken from the smoothing of discrete measurements. This data consists of range, azimuth and <b>elevation</b> <b>angle,</b> and in addition some radars send radial velocity. The centre compares the measurements to the catalogue to see whether it is a known object. If not, additional data is collected to see if the signal represents a new orbit of a known object. If it is not then a new object is catalogued.|$|E

2500|$|When the Soviet war in Afghanistan {{broke out}} the Soviet forces {{operated}} BMP-1 IFVs and BMD-1 airborne IFVs. They were both armed with 73mm 2A28 [...] "Grom" [...] low pressure smoothbore short-recoil semi-automatic gun, 9S428 ATGM launcher capable of firing 9M14 [...] "Malyutka" [...] (NATO: AT-3A Sagger A), 9M14M [...] "Malyutka-M" [...] (NATO: AT-3B Sagger B) and 9M14P [...] "Malyutka-P" [...] (NATO: AT-3C Sagger C) ATGMs and 7.62mm PKT coaxial tank machine gun. Although their armament made for strong anti-tank firepower, it didn't provide sufficient firepower against enemy unarmored vehicles, infantry, firing points and light fortified positions, especially during mountain battles {{because of low}} <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> of the main gun.|$|E
2500|$|The AN/FPS-115 radar {{consists}} of two phased arrays of antenna elements mounted on two sloping sides of the 105ft high transmitter building, which are oriented 120° apart in azimuth. [...] The beam from each array can be deflected up to 60° from the array's central boresight axis, allowing each array to cover an azimuth angle of 120°, thus the entire radar can cover an azimuth of 240°. [...] The building sides are sloped at an angle of 20°, and the beam can be directed at any <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> between 3° and 85°. [...] The beam is kept at least 100ft above the ground over public-accessible land to avoid the possibility of exposing the public to significant electromagnetic fields.|$|E
40|$|Abnormal {{refractivity}} gradients {{may cause}} radio waves to be trapped within tropospheric layers, thus producing regions {{through which the}} waves do not pass called radio holes. For some locations and for many applications, refractive corrections based on the surface refractivity are adequate for <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> above a few degrees. However, new systems which operate at <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> near the horizon often require improved accuracies. Techniques for obtaining these improved corrections are reviewed...|$|R

30|$|When the goniometric {{method was}} used to analyze {{scapular}} movement during arm elevation, humeral movement was considered dominant at low <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> and scapular movement was considered dominant at high <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> (Kibler 2006). However, when we examined arm elevation before and after knot formation, {{the change in the}} scapular upward rotation decreased in the latter segment for many subjects. This finding contradicts previously reported findings, and hence, further investigation is necessary to evaluate the interplay between these movements.|$|R

2500|$|For space {{launches}} from Earth, {{relatively short}} acceleration distances (less {{than a few}} km) would require very strong acceleration forces, higher than humans can tolerate. Other designs include a longer helical (spiral) track, or a large ring design whereby a space vehicle would circle the ring numerous times, gradually gaining speed, before being released into a launch corridor leading skyward. [...] Nevertheless, if technically feasible and cost effective to build, imparting hyper-velocity escape velocity to a projectile launching at sea level, where the atmosphere is the most dense, may result {{in much of the}} launch velocity being lost to aerodynamic drag. [...] In addition, the projectile might still require some form of on-board guidance and control to realize a useful orbital insertion angle that may not be achievable based simply on the launcher's upward <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> relative {{to the surface of the}} earth, (see [...] practical considerations of escape velocity).|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} form of dipole is two {{straight}} rods or wires oriented end to end on the same axis, with the feedline connected to the two adjacent ends, but dipoles may be fed anywhere along their length. [...] This is the simplest type of antenna from a theoretical point of view. [...] Dipoles are resonant antennas, meaning that the elements serve as resonators, with standing waves of radio current flowing back and forth between their ends. [...] So the length of the dipole elements is determined by the wavelength of the radio waves used. [...] The {{most common form}} is the half-wave dipole, in which each of the two rod elements is approximately 1/4 wavelength long, so the whole antenna is a half-wavelength long. [...] The radiation pattern of a vertical dipole is omnidirectional; it radiates equal power in all azimuthal directions perpendicular to the axis of the antenna. [...] For a half-wave dipole the radiation is maximum, 2.15 dBi perpendicular to the antenna axis, falling monotonically with <b>elevation</b> <b>angle</b> to zero on the axis, off the ends of the antenna.|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} measurement {{program designed}} to obtain the information requisite to determining the feasibility of airborne and/or satellite-borne LDV (Laser Doppler Velocimeter) systems is discussed. Measurements made from the ground are favored over an airborne measurement as far as {{for the purpose of}} determining feasibility is concerned. The expected signal strengths for scattering at various altitude and <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> are examined; it appears that both molecular absorption and ambient turbulence degrade the signal at low <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> and effectively constrain the ground based measurement of <b>elevation</b> <b>angles</b> exceeding a critical value.

2500|$|In {{order to}} match the {{performance}} of the longer barreled 130mm/55 Pattern 1913 gun it was necessary to use a higher barrel pressure in the 130mm/50 B13 Pattern 1936. This led to such a rapid barrel wear that the Leningrad and Gnevny class destroyers using the first gun versions could not even empty their magazines a single time before needing to change out the barrel. The solution to the excessive barrel wear was found to be deeper rifling grooves. The original design had [...] deep grooves and a barrel life of 130 rounds; a modified version with [...] deep grooves had a barrel life of 1100 rounds. Additionally there existed a model with [...] deep grooves. The gun had 40 grooves with a constant twist. All three gun models with different groove depths had different, mutually incompatible, ammunition, sights and range tables. A loading platform that could be rotated next to the gun barrel was used to deliver the shell to a pneumatic loading mechanism. The gun could be loaded on any <b>elevation</b> <b>angle,</b> but the rate of fire was reduced on elevations higher than +25°. A modified dual-purpose model with 55 caliber barrel suitable for anti-aircraft fire was planned but the project was stopped due to the war.|$|E
