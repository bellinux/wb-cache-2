5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance the officer was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if the officer had <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if the officer <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E

Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control.
