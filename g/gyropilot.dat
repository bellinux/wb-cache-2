50|$|Falling {{overboard}} while single-handed {{ocean sailing}} {{is almost certainly}} fatal, {{as there is no}} one to attempt to recover the crewmember who has fallen overboard. However, the nightmare scenario of floating in mid-ocean while watching one's boat sail away under auto-pilot makes many single-handers very cautious. Staying on the boat (by careful and thorough use of handholds, lifelines, and tethers) is undoubtedly the best approach for any sailor, but some single-handers tow a rope astern, as a last desperate chance if they should fall overboard. Modern technology has given us EPIRB, PLB, SART Radar SART and AIS SART devices which can help recover victims of a man overboard (MOB) incident. Additionally the most modern autopilot systems eg NKE <b>Gyropilot</b> have - or can have added as a retro-fit option - remote control handsets which not only allows the autopilot to be remotely controlled from anywhere on the boat but also detects when an individual carrying/wearing one goes over board, sounding the alarm and, depending on type of installation and mode selected, either turning the boat into the wind or locking the rudder hard over on the opposite tack causing the yacht to stall/forereach, in both cases preventing the boat from continuing on its route and allowing a conscious MOB the possibility of getting back aboard. Falling overboard while single-handed sailing also creates a hazard to navigation for all other vessels as the now-uncontrolled vessel can remain afloat for an extended period.|$|E

Background. The {{paper is}} devoted to {{critical}} analysis of literature that covers the major aspects of adaptive ship motion control systems. Objective. The objective of a study is identifying the promising areas {{of research in the}} field of adaptive ship motion control. Methods. The analysis of existing approaches to ship model parameters identification (including identification during zig-zag motion, during circulation and identification using Kalman filtering) is done; advantages and disadvantages of those methods are determined. The methods mentioned {{can be used as a}} basis for creating adaptive <b>gyropilots.</b> A critical review of approaches to ship control by means of classical and modern methods of automatic control, including the parametric adjustment of classic PID regulators, switching of regulators, use of nonlinear regulators ? linear-quadratic (LQ), sliding mode regulators, and artificial intelligence ? neural networks, fuzzy logic and hybrid approaches, is done. Separately, in the survey analysis of papers of Ukrainian authors, which are devoted to the development of adaptive <b>gyropilots</b> and adaptive ship motion control, is presented. Results. As a result of literature survey, prospective areas of studies in the field of adaptive ship control are determined. Conclusions. Most promising research areas are: 1) development of novel approaches to the identification of the vessel model parameters and disturbances acting on it; 2) application of artificial intelligence, including fuzzy logic and neural networks, to adaptive ship control methods; 3) development of adaptive nonlinear systems for ship motion control. ????????????. ?????? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ??????????, ???????????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ?????. ???? ????????????. ???? ?????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????????? ? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????? ?????. ???????? ??????????. ???????? ?????? ???????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ?????????? ?????? ?????
