5|$|Knox led a busy life in Geneva. <b>He</b> <b>preached</b> three sermons a week, each lasting {{well over}} two hours. The {{services}} used a liturgy that was derived by Knox and other ministers from Calvin's Formes des Prières Ecclésiastiques. The church in which <b>he</b> <b>preached,</b> the Église de Notre Dame la Neuve—now {{known as the}} Auditoire de Calvin—had been granted by the municipal authorities, at Calvin's request, {{for the use of}} the English and Italian congregations. Knox's two sons, Nathaniel and Eleazar, were born in Geneva, with Whittingham and Myles Coverdale their respective godfathers.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 Joaquín {{returned}} to Monterrey to preach {{to his former}} associates. There he learned {{that he had been}} baptized using the Trinitarian formula and not in the name of Jesus Christ as <b>he</b> <b>preached.</b> His re-baptism in the name of Jesus Christ by his collaborator Lino Figueroa marked Joaquín's separation {{from the rest of the}} Pentecostal community.|$|E

From India, he set out for Bushire, Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz.|$|E
5|$|According to {{accounts}} from his life, <b>he</b> <b>preached</b> {{the importance of}} realization of the self, and criticized love towards perishable things. His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to the God and guru. He {{stressed the importance of}} surrender to the true Satguru, who, having trod the path to divine consciousness, will lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual training.|$|E
5|$|Chance was a disciplinarian. <b>He</b> <b>preached</b> {{moderation}} in socializing, including avoiding alcohol, to {{his players}}. Chance fined his players for {{shaking hands with}} members of the opposing team and forced Solly Hofman to delay his wedding until after the baseball season, lest marriage impair his abilities on the playing field.

5000|$|... "Brother Ham is a {{young man}} and has been preaching but a short time. He has {{distinct}} elements of power. In the first place <b>he</b> <b>preaches</b> certainties and not doubts. An evangelist of doubt is a sorry traveler in these low grounds. He believes the great truths of the Bible up to the hilt, and <b>he</b> <b>preaches</b> with directness and great aggressiveness." ...|$|R

5|$|<b>He</b> <b>preached</b> and lectured on the Immaculate Conception, {{and rose}} to {{seniority}} under the patronage of the Avignon Papacy and King Robert II of Scotland, becoming Bishop of Galloway and the only Franciscan to hold a Scottish bishopric. Thereafter he was a staunch advocate of Avignon Pope Clement VII against the English-backed Urban VI, for whom he engaged in partisan preaching and writing, famously challenging any English bishop to settle the issue by single combat.|$|E

His jiva (soul) is believed in all Jain traditions to be in Siddhashila (abode of the liberated souls).|$|E
5|$|Martyn {{arrived in}} India in April 1806, {{and for some}} months he was {{stationed}} at Aldeen, near Serampur. In October 1806, he proceeded to Dinapur, where he was soon able to conduct worship among the locals in the vernacular, and established schools. In April 1809, he was transferred to Cawnpore, where <b>he</b> <b>preached</b> to British and Indians in his own compound, in spite of interruptions and threats from local non-Christians.|$|E

5000|$|Spencer Kornhaber, a {{reviewer}} for the The Atlantic, {{called the}} song [...] "both a statement—don’t just {{be aware of}} racism, speak up about it—and a demonstration...Macklemore is practicing what <b>he</b> <b>preaches,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>preaches</b> it. <b>He</b> also spotlights the voices of actual black activists. Who could attack him for that? I can’t. This is a brave song." [...] However, he also criticizes the song for not using enough subtle artistry to convey his message, [...] "forgoing metaphor or ambiguity or impressionism." ...|$|R

5|$|Sometime between 1902 and 1905, al-Qassam {{left for}} Cairo {{to study at}} the al-Azhar Mosque. Who he studied with is disputed by sources; some {{accounts}} say he studied under the Muslim reformist scholar Muhammad Abduh and {{came into contact with}} the prominent proto-Salafist, Rashid Rida, who himself studied under Abduh, while others are skeptical of al-Qassam's relationships with either. However, the attitude al-Qassam later adopted toward the political issues in the Arab world suggests he was well-acquainted with the ideas Abduh and Rida espoused. At al-Azhar, al-Qassam developed the thinking that would guide his future activism. Critical of a stagnant Islam, <b>he</b> <b>preached</b> among the ranks of farmers and other locals about the necessity for a modern Islam, one capable of defending itself from Western colonialism through jihad (holy struggle). He returned to Jableh in 1909 as an ′alim and worked as a teacher at a Qadariyya madrasa (Islamic school) where he taught both the mystical practices of the Qadariyya Sufi order and the jurisprudence and commentary of the Qur'an. In addition <b>he</b> <b>preached</b> as the imam of the Ibrahim Ibn Adham Mosque.|$|E
5|$|Symeon often {{taught that}} all {{followers}} of Christ {{could have the}} direct experience of God, or theoria, just as the early church fathers experienced and taught. In that context he frequently described his own experiences of God as divine light. <b>He</b> <b>preached</b> to his monks {{that the way to}} God's grace was through a life of simplicity, asceticism, sanctity, and contemplation, which was also the doctrine of the hermits and monks known as the Desert Fathers. In addition, Symeon placed great emphasis on putting oneself under the complete guidance of a spiritual father.|$|E

50|$|Moore {{has been}} an {{inspirational}} speaker at various sites, which include NFL and NBA Pre-Game Chapels, corporations, businesses, churches, schools and community agencies. Elder Moore prides himself on being {{a student of the}} gospel and life. Wherever you see him, he is learning, so that he can become a better teacher. He not only practices what <b>he</b> <b>preaches,</b> but <b>he</b> <b>preaches</b> and teaches what he practices. He will often tell someone to make sure they give back what they’ve been given, and he has done that.|$|R
5|$|The Bristol Corporation of the Poor was {{established}} {{at the end of}} the 17th century and a workhouse, to provide work for the poor and shelter for those needing charity, {{was established}}, adjacent to the Bridewell.

Wesley had come to Bristol at the invitation of George Whitfield. <b>He</b> <b>preached</b> in the open air to miners and brickworkers in Kingswood and Hanham.|$|E
5|$|Tragedy marred Sunday's final years. His {{three sons}} engaged {{in many of}} the {{activities}} <b>he</b> <b>preached</b> against, and the Sundays paid blackmail to several women to keep the scandals relatively quiet. In 1930, Nora Lynn, their housekeeper and nanny, who had become a virtual member of the family, died. Then the Sundays' daughter, the only child actually raised by Nell, died in 1932 of what seems to have been multiple sclerosis. Their oldest son George, rescued from financial ruin by the Sundays, committed suicide in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Winston Churchill was {{impressed}} by Henson. Grimley comments that they had much in common, both spending years as isolated figures speaking out for beliefs that were dismissed {{at the time and}} later vindicated. As prime minister, Churchill persuaded Henson out of retirement in 1940 to resume his old duties as a Canon of Westminster Abbey. After overcoming the momentary strangeness of being back in his old post after nearly thirty years <b>he</b> <b>preached</b> with vigour until cataracts made his eyesight too poor to continue. He retired from the Abbey in 1941.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in Strasbourg, Calvin was not {{attached}} to one particular church, but held his office successively in the Saint-Nicolas Church, the Sainte-Madeleine Church and the former Dominican Church, renamed the Temple Neuf. (All of these churches still exist, but none are in the architectural state of Calvin's days.) Calvin ministered to 400–500 members in his church. <b>He</b> <b>preached</b> or lectured every day, with two sermons on Sunday. Communion was celebrated monthly and congregational singing of the psalms was encouraged. He also worked on the second edition of the Institutes. Calvin was dissatisfied with its original structure as a catechism, a primer for young Christians.|$|E
5|$|Later in Acts, Peter preached {{the gospel}} to the {{household}} of Cornelius the Centurion, a gentile. While <b>he</b> <b>preached,</b> the Holy Spirit {{fell on the}} gentiles, {{and they began to}} speak in tongues. The Jewish believers with Peter were amazed, and the household was water baptized. While the apostle Paul was in Ephesus, he found disciples there and discovered {{that they did not know}} of the existence of the Holy Spirit and had only received John the Baptist’s baptism. After baptizing them in Jesus’ name, Paul laid his hands on them, and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy.|$|E
