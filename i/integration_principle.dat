40|$|International audienceThis study {{seeks to}} provide {{insights}} into the principle of “integration of coopetition paradox” considered as a managerial necessity to manage coopetition situations. Coopetition is a relationships filled with tensions related to the coexistence of two contradictory dimensions of cooperation and competition. And to manage this situation, individuals need to integrate the coopetive paradox, that means to accept cognitively the paradox and to integrate both contradictory dimensions into their daily activities. The cognitive dimension of the <b>integration</b> <b>principle</b> and its consequences on managerial practices remain under investigated in previous literature. How do individuals perceive the coopetition paradox? What are {{the consequences of the}} <b>integration</b> <b>principle</b> on managerial practices? We aim to fill this gap by identifying how individuals are capable of integrating coopetition paradox and how do they deal with it in their daily management. Based on an in-depth study of an exemplar case of intra-firm coopetition we succeed {{for the first time in}} the coopetitive literature to show and discuss different capacities of integration of the coopetition paradox between managers. According to the <b>integration</b> <b>principle</b> at the individual level, individuals should cognitively accept the coopetition paradox and behave correspondingly to their cognitive perception, emphasizing on both dimensions of cooperation and competition. However, in this study, we show that managerial practices can be disconnected from a cognitive acceptance of the paradox. Moreover, depending on the level of the cognitive integration, we point out that managerial tools are insufficient to efficiently manage coopetition. We suggest that a specific manager profil is required to integrate the paradox and handle coopetition situations...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of landscapes and the complexity of landscape policies, <b>integration</b> <b>principle</b> plays {{a very important role}} in formulating a conceptual framework for effective landscape policies. This is often overlooked in normal practice of landscape related policy making, as a result of overemphasizing development and economic growth by local government. If the <b>integration</b> <b>principle</b> could be taken into account sufficiently, a consciously more responsive approach for landscape policy making could be formulated with higher effectiveness and less uncertainty. This thesis seeks to contribute to the system of landscape policy that integrates multiple environmental and spatial planning concerns into its processes and structures. This thesis has combined landscape planning and policy theories to analyze landscape policies currently in force in cities of Asia to demonstrate the complexity of landscape policies and the importance of integration in policymaking process. While there are few approaches in landscape policy studies except the European Landscape Convention which is a continental scale treaty with focus on environmental and cultural conservation within the context of Europe, there are widespread research on public policies particularly in urban planning, environmental protection, and sustainable development which provided plentiful sources as references. To apply <b>integration</b> <b>principle</b> in policymaking on the basis that landscape policy of nowadays is even important than before, a conceptual framework of landscape policy is established to gauge impacts and changes, as well as to inform planning, and implementation progressively. After providing a combined literature review of landscape architectural theories, landscape policy related areas, and practices of current landscape policymaking, this thesis discusses the importance of integrated approach in landscape policymaking due to the complexity and multidisciplinarity nature of landscape architecture discourse, and sets a two-way action between theory and practice as research strategy. After an overview of current landscape policies of Europe and Asia, this thesis has summarized four types of landscape policies based on its administrative level to reflect the hierarchical structure of landscape policy, from European Landscape Convention at global level to Hong Kong’s Greening Master Plan at project scale. This thesis further looks into two best practices of landscape policymaking in Japan and Singapore, to further elaborate the conceptual basis of the research and analyze the gap between current landscape policies and its urban development practice context. Case studies of Japan and Singapore are employed as references for both discussion and comparative purpose, aiming to demonstrate different ways in which <b>integration</b> <b>principle</b> could be utilized and interpreted with coherent consistency across policy levels and different government sectors, so as to clarify implications of <b>integration</b> <b>principle</b> in policymaking, implementation, and the following continuous improvement processes mainly at city level. The study is concluded by highlighting key issues of conceptual framework with recommendations for further research on integrated landscape policymaking, by applying Grounded Theory as main research method through collection and analysis of qualitative data, with the use of both explorative and interpretive approaches. published_or_final_versionArchitectureDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|At the {{creation}} of the European Community in 1957, little attention was paid to environmental concerns. It’s only in 1997, after decades of debate, that the ‘Integration Principle’ became formally engraved in European treaties. This principle, requiring all policies to take environmental concerns into account, represents a major landmark in the institutionalisation of environmental policy. Yet the effects of this integration appear unclear. So does its meaning. Does the <b>Integration</b> <b>Principle</b> ensure an effective impact of sustainable development institutions in Europe? We aim to answer this question by casting light on the origin and significance of the <b>Integration</b> <b>Principle.</b> We recapitulate the policy events leading to the formal integration of environmental concerns within EU policy since the 1970 s. We highlight its gradual extension from a horizontal (cross-sectoral) to a vertical (cross-societal) dimension and stress the challenges posed by the necessary cross-societal integration of sustainable development policy. As a step toward answering the above question, our hypothesis is that the effectiveness of an institution depends on its integration not only across policy or economic sectors but also across governance levels. We derive implications with regard to the importance of learning to eco-innovation...|$|E

40|$|Achieving {{sustainable}} {{urban development}} is identified as one ultimate goal of many contemporary planning endeavours and has become central to formulation of urban planning policies. Within this concept, land-use and transport integration is highlighted {{as one of the}} most important and attainable policy objectives. In many cities, integration is embraced as an integral part of local development plans, and a number of key <b>integration</b> <b>principles</b> are identified. However, the lack of available evaluation methods to measure extent of urban sustainability levels prevents successful implementation of these principles. This paper introduces a new indicator-based spatial composite indexing model developed to measure sustainability performance of urban settings by taking into account land-use and transport <b>integration</b> <b>principles.</b> Model indicators are chosen via a thorough selection process in line with key principles of land-use and transport integration. These indicators are grouped into categories and themes according to their topical relevance. These indicators are then aggregated to form a spatial composite index to portray an overview of the sustainability performance of the pilot study area used for model demonstration. The study results revealed that the model is a practical instrument for evaluating success of local integration policies and visualizing sustainability performance of built environments and useful in both identifying problematic areas as well as formulating policy interventions...|$|R

40|$|The <b>integration</b> <b>principle</b> was {{initially}} conceived by the EU as {{the incorporation of}} environmental concerns into those policies with harmful effects on the environment, its main aim being the improvement of Community environmental policy. Later on, the same principle {{has been linked to}} the European Strategy of Sustainable Development (SD) which advocates the compatibility between economic growth, environmental conservation andsocial welfare. This connection has reflected itself in a «global version» (horizontal) of the principle, {{in the sense that the}} sustainability programme aspires now to influence the entire political process, from its early stage of agenda-setting to the final stage of policy assessment, in contrast with the «narrow version» (vertical) which simply revolved around the need to apply environmental criteria to the working of certain public agencies. The main problem of the global version is that it blurrs the crucial conflicts of interest that are brought about when SD is put into practice. This is so because the theoretical harmony between the three different pillars which compose SD is false. The low political feasibility of SD can be seen in the insufficient development of the horizontal dimension of the <b>integration</b> <b>principle,</b> as shown by the national strategies of SD which are underway in the OECD, and also in the fact that the vertical dimension of the principle is adhered to in a rather rethorical way...|$|E
