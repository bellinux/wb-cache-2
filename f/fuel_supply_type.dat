50|$|The small {{dimensions}} and shallow draught of the Bramble class {{were designed to}} facilitate navigation on the complex coastlines and great rivers of Africa, South Asia and the Far East. The drawback this imposed was a limited <b>fuel</b> <b>supply.</b> The <b>type</b> entered service with a standard bunkerage of just 50 tons of coal. For Thistle, {{considered one of the}} better-performing ships of the class, this would only provide two and a half days' movement at her sustained cruising speed of 11.5 knots, and full-speed runs used nearly twice the quantity of coal over any given length of time. In practice, storage was found for 145 tons of coal, but this was still sufficient for only one week of cruising.|$|R

40|$|The <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> {{of forest}} chips has {{to adapt to}} the annual {{fluctuations}} of power and heat generation. This creates inefficiency and unbalances the capacity utilization of the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> fleet in the direct <b>fuel</b> <b>supplies</b> from roadside storages to power and heat generation. Terminals can offer an alternative approach for the fleet management of <b>fuel</b> <b>supplies</b> in terms of smoothing the unbalanced fleet use towards more even year-round operations. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the supply costs of a conventional direct forest chip supply to an alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> with the use of a feed-in terminal using the discrete-event simulation method. The influences of the terminal location, terminal investment cost, outbound terminal transport method, terminal truck utilization and quality changes of terminal-stored forest chips for the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> cost were studied in the case environment. By introducing a feed-in terminal and a shuttle truck for the transports of terminal-stored forest chips, the total supply cost was 1. 4 % higher than the direct <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> scenario. In terminal scenarios, the supply costs increased 1 – 2 % if the cost of the terminal investment increased 30 %, the distance to the terminal increased from 5 to 30 km or the total annual use of a terminal truck decreased 1500 h. Moreover, a 1 per cent point per month increase in the dry matter loss of terminal stored chips increased the total supply cost 1 %. The study revealed that with the relatively low additional cost, the feed-in terminal can be introduced to the conventional forest chip supply. Cost compensation can be gained through the higher annual use of a <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> fleet and more secured <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> to power plants by decreasing the need for supplement fuel, which can be more expensive at a time of the highest fuel demand...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{experiments}} of {{the fuel}} economy performance and emission characteristics of diesel engine fueled with butanol diesel were performed on a dual-cylinder direct injection diesel engine at different <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> advance angles. The results showed that whether the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> advance angle is too large or too small, it will increase the fuel consumption. As the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> advance angle is 20 °CA, the brake specific fuel consumption {{is the best of}} the butanol diesel engine. When the supply advance angle becomes larger, the smoke and CO emissions can be reduced on the medium and high loads, but NOX emissions are significantly increased on a variety of load conditions. The engine will obtain the lowest HC emissions, as the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> advance angle is 20 °CA...|$|R
