5000|$|The {{front end}} of {{innovation}} is quite distinct from {{the remainder of the}} innovation process. When the very best ideas are discovered they can be managed with a stage gate oriented project management system, where the work flow is defined. The {{front end of}} innovation is commonly referred to as [...] "fuzzy" [...] because it functions best when a collaborative system nurtures chaos, disruption and the serendipitous discovery of ideas. Most ideas submitted via an electronic suggestion box are limited to <b>incremental</b> <b>innovation</b> (doing things the way we always have but better). There is nothing wrong with <b>incremental</b> <b>innovation,</b> in fact the ideas leading to projects resulting from <b>incremental</b> <b>innovation</b> typically yield rapid revenue gains or cost savings. But most organizations are using collaborative idea management systems to get breakthrough or radical innovation (ideas that {{can be thought of as}} [...] "out of the box" [...] thinking").|$|E

50|$|Innovation {{defined in}} a supra-entity domain or scope {{consists}} of the creation, generation or introduction of new occurrences of supra-entity elements with good results or success, and which are first invention (major innovation) or improved (minor or <b>incremental</b> <b>innovation),</b> not including those new occurrences that replicate to other similar previous ones.|$|E
50|$|For example, if {{we apply}} this {{definition}} of innovation to the supra-entity Products, we obtain the product innovations, which consist of the creation, generation or introduction {{in the market}} of new element occurrences of the supra-entity Products with good results or success, and which are first invention (major innovation) or improved (minor or <b>incremental</b> <b>innovation),</b> not including those new occurrences that replicate to other similar previous ones.|$|E
40|$|<b>Incremental</b> {{technical}} <b>innovation</b> {{is one of}} {{the significant}} dynamic processes taking place in manufacturing firms. For this study, <b>incremental</b> technical <b>innovation</b> has been classified as material, operations, scale and product innovations and we contend that their source and efforts directed are different and therefore it is imperative to identify the predictors of each. Based on a field study of 83 manufacturing firms in India, the study has found that government policies, customer orientation and formalisation are the predictors of material innovations. Operational innovations are related to inter-functional coordination, process orientation, centralisation and annual demand of the product. Customer orientation and formalisation are the predictors of scale <b>innovations.</b> Finally, <b>incremental</b> product <b>innovations</b> are related to technology planning and R&D intensity. <b>Incremental</b> <b>innovations,</b> material, process, operation and product innovations...|$|R

Such <b>incremental</b> <b>innovations</b> differ from the learning-by-doing effects usually considered by diffusion models, and greatly affect the structure of the adopting industry. The case for keeping them in due account is made by revisiting Paul David’s classic paper on the McCormick reaper, by criticising the subsequent evolution of threshold models of adoption, and by summarising my own findings on the diffusion of electronic pre-press device...|$|R

Spillovers exert no such independent influence on drastic innovation activities. The results support the hypothesis that establishments face difficulties in using knowledge that comes from areas they are not familiar with. Establishments exploit spillovers for <b>incremental</b> <b>innovations</b> rather than for drastic innovations. To a limited degree R&D cooperations can help to overcome the difficulties in using spillovers for drastic innovations. Furthermore, our estimates provide evidence that a firm?s own R&D effort and the use of outside information are substitutive. [...] New Products,Patents,Spillovers,Learning,R&D...|$|R
40|$|Many product {{innovation}} studies have described key determinants that {{should lead to}} successful <b>incremental</b> product <b>innovation.</b> Despite numerous studies suggesting how <b>incremental</b> product <b>innovation</b> should be successfully undertaken, many firms still struggle {{with this type of}} innovation. In this paper, we use an institutional perspective to investigate why established firms in the financial services industry struggle with their complex <b>incremental</b> product <b>innovation</b> efforts. We argue that although the impact of micro institutional forces is often overlooked in innovation studies, these forces matter for innovation success. Our study complements the existing innovation literature and provides an additional explanation why <b>incremental</b> product <b>innovation</b> is highly complex and suffers from several liabilities in established firms. Using qualitative data from the Dutch financial services sector collected over the period 1997 - 2002, the paper illustrates how micro institutional forces at the business unit level affect complex <b>incremental</b> product <b>innovation</b> and how the interaction of these forces delivers their impact. complex incremental {{product innovation}};financial services sector;micro institutional forces;neo-institutional theory...|$|R
40|$|<b>Incremental</b> product <b>innovation</b> is a {{critically}} important competitive factor in established industries. Firms in the cardiac pacemaker industry often benefit by bringing <b>incremental</b> <b>innovations</b> to market {{even though the}} new products may cannibalize the sales of existing profitable products. The more often an industry incumbent {{was among the first}} to introduce important <b>incremental</b> product <b>innovations</b> the greater its market share in the industry, while adopting innovations that had been introduced by competitors had a small positive relationship with greater market share. The greater the number of competitors that introduced similar products, the greater the market share of firms that were first to market. Greater market share, in turn, reduced the likelihood of business dissolution, while introducing important <b>incremental</b> <b>innovations</b> provided little or no reduction in the likelihood of business dissolution net of the effects of the market share that the firm achieved. The results apply most directly to industries in which buyers incur moderate switching costs. This paper investigates how an industry incumbent’s market share and business survival are affected by the firm’s tendency to lead or follow its competitors when introducing important <b>incremental</b> product <b>innovations.</b> We define important <b>incremental</b> product <b>innovations</b> as refinements and extensions of established designs that result in substantial price or functional benefits to users (Dosi, 1982; Henderson and Clark, 1990). A substantial literature addresses entry timing influences on market share and survival, but much of this work either addresses Key words: incremental innovations; business survival; market share; industry incumbents paradigmatic technical change, focuses on entry into new markets, or treats new product introductions as isolated events (e. g.

40|$|In this study, we unpack the radical, <b>incremental</b> <b>innovations,</b> and imitations in {{business}} models (BMs) of entrepreneurial firms, addressing {{the question of}} how each of these activities affects firm performance at a micro-level.

On the other hand, rapid imitation ensures a quick reaction to competitors, which may positively affect firm performance in the short-term.

40|$|Innovation is key {{to company}} growth, but hinges on timely access to new knowledge.

We expect governance modes directed at knowledge exploration to generate long-term, radical innovations, and governance modes aimed at knowledge exploitation to generate short-term, <b>incremental</b> <b>innovations.</b> Employing data from two Dutch community innovation surveys, we indeed discovered that companies that license in technology tend to produce more <b>incremental</b> <b>innovations.</b> We also found a strong positive correlation between inter-organisational collaboration and both long-term and short-term innovation.

5000|$|Several commenters, {{including}} Novartis, {{noted that}} a decision either way would not have affected the ability of generics companies in India to continue selling generic Gleevec.
