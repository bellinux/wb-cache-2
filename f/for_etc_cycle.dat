40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the characteristics of exhaust emissions and the fuel economy of a compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle fueled with biogas and natural gases. A large CNG vehicle currently used as a city bus in Korea was tested on a chassis dynamometer under the European Transient <b>Cycle</b> (<b>ETC)</b> and the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) 06 cycles. One CH 4 -enriched biogas (97. 6 % CH 4) and 5 natural gases with different CH 4 contents (81. 6 - 94. 0 % CH 4) were used as test fuels. Total hydrocarbons (THC), CO, NOx and CO 2 emissions in the NIER 06 cycle were higher {{than those in the}} <b>ETC</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>for</b> all tested fuels, while the fuel economy in the NIER 06 cycle was 43. 7 - 51. 5 % lower than that in the <b>ETC</b> <b>cycle.</b> Total VOC emissions increased with increasing CH 4 content in the fuel, with toluene being the highest proportion of the BTEX emissions in both the <b>ETC</b> <b>cycle</b> (72 - 80 %) and the NIER 06 cycle (73 - 78 %). Emissions of elemental/organic carbon exhibited a similar trend to that of nanoparticle emissions. Total organic carbon was mainly comprised of organic compounds at 97 - 99 % (<b>ETC</b> <b>cycle)</b> and 95 - 99 % (NIER 06 cycle). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions in the NIER 06 cycle were 133. 3 - 577. 8 % higher than in the <b>ETC</b> <b>cycle</b> because of incomplete combustion and an increase in unburned fuel in the NIER 06 cycle, which is a low-speed driving mode. Nanoparticle number concentrations were lowest for M 91 among the 6 tested fuels; the total number of particles in the NIER 06 cycle was 33. 2 - 123. 8 % higher than in the <b>ETC</b> <b>cycle.</b> close 7...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: To {{meet the}} NOx limit without a penalty of fuel consumption, urea-SCR system is {{currently}} regarded as promising NOx reduction technology for diesel engines. SCR {{system has to}} achieve maximal NOx conversion in combination with minimal NH 3 slip. In this study, the performance characteristics of urea-SCR system with open loop control were assessed in the European Transient Cycle(ETC) for heavy duty diesel engine. The SCR inlet temperaure varied {{in the range of}} 200 to 340 °C in the <b>ETC</b> <b>cycle.</b> Open loop control calculated the urea flow rate based on the NOx and NSR map which gave for each combination of SCR inlet temperature and space velocity the normalized NH 3 to NOx stoichiometric ratio which resulted in a steady-state NH 3 slip of 20 ppm. During the <b>ETC</b> <b>cycle,</b> the open loop control with the optimized NSR offset achieved NOx reduction of 80 % while keeping the average NH 3 slip below 10 ppm and maximum 20 ppm. It was also found that NOx sensor was cross-sensitive to NH 3 and a control strategy fo...|$|R
