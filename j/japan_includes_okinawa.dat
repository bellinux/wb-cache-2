5000|$|Today {{the word}} soba means buckwheat, in {{particular}} buckwheat noodles, in Japanese. This word is in origin an abbreviation of soba-mugi (buckwheat).

50|$|The East Asian monsoon is a monsoonal flow {{that carries}} moist {{air from the}} Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean to East Asia. It affects {{approximately}} one-third of the global population, influencing the climate of <b>Japan</b> (<b>including</b> <b>Okinawa),</b> the Koreas, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, the Philippines, Indochina, and much of mainland China. It is driven by temperature differences between the Asian continent and the Pacific Ocean. The East Asian monsoon is divided into a warm and wet summer monsoon and a cold and dry winter monsoon. This cold and dry winter monsoon {{is responsible for the}} aeolian dust deposition and pedogenesis that resulted {{in the creation of the}} Loess Plateau. The monsoon influences weather patterns as far north as Siberia, causing wet summers that contrasts the cold and dry winters caused by the Siberian High, which counterbalances the monsoon's effect on northerly latitudes.|$|R

40|$|Asexual reproduction, {{including}} parthenogenesis {{in which}} embryos develop within a female without fertilization, {{is assumed to}} confer advantages over sexual reproduction, which includes a "cost of males. " Sexual reproduction largely predominates in animals, however, indicating that this cost is outweighed by the genetic and/or ecological benefits of sexuality, including the acquisition of advantageous mutations occurring in different individuals {{and the elimination of}} deleterious mutations. But the evolution of sexual reproduction remains unclear, because we have limited examples that demonstrate the relative success of sexual lineages in the face of competition from asexual lineages in the same environment. Here we investigated a sympatric occurrence of sexual and asexual reproduction in the pineapple mealybug, Dysmicoccus brevipes. This pest invaded southwestern <b>Japan,</b> <b>including</b> <b>Okinawa</b> and Ishigaki Islands, in the 1930 s in association with imported pineapple plants. Our recent censuses demonstrated that on Okinawa sexually reproducing individuals can coexist with and even dominate asexual individuals in the presence of habitat and resource competition, which is considered to be severe for this nearly immobile insect. Molecular phylogeny based on partial DNA sequences in the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, as well as the endosymbiotic bacterial genome, revealed that the asexual lineage diverged from a common sexual ancestor in the relatively recent past. In contrast, only the asexual lineage exhibiting obligate apomictic thelytoky was discovered on Ishigaki. Co-existence of the two lineages cannot be explained by the results of laboratory experiments, which showed that the intrinsic rate of increase in the sexual lineage was not obviously superior to that of the asexual lineage. Differences in biotic and/or abiotic selective forces operating on the two islands might be the cause of this discrepancy. This biological system offers a unique opportunity to assess the relative success of sexual versus asexual lineages with an unusual morphology and life cycle...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{atmospheric}} circulation fields during the baiu in Japan with global warming projection experimental data conducted using a 20 -km-mesh global atmospheric model (MRI-AGCM 3. 2 S). The baiu front {{indicated by the}} north-south gradient of moist static energy moves northward, both in present and future climate simulations. The rate of progression is very slow in May and June. Particularly in the future climate, the baiu front stagnates in south of <b>Japan,</b> <b>including</b> the <b>Okinawa</b> region. In addition, then northward shift in July {{is associated with the}} westward expansion of the enhanced north Pacific subtropical high into Japan region. The horizontal warm advection roughly at the mid-troposphere corresponds to upward vertical pressure velocity, and shows northward migration as seen in the lower troposphere. The future change in these variables, about 5 -day move north is delayed compared to the present-day climate. This tendency is evident in the north-south term of 500 -hPa warm advection in particular. In conclusion, a late of the baiu rainfall band northward and an increase in precipitation during late of the baiu season are apparent {{from the point of view}} of atmospheric fields...|$|R
