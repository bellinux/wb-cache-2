A man follows him from the tavern and hires the Cimmerian to obtain a mysterious but valuable item. Outfitting himself with the initial payment, Conan proceeds {{to the city of}} Sicas in Aquilonia. Once renowned for its silver mines but now a den of iniquity, more people are said to leave Sicas 'by the river, floating', than through the gates.

In contrast to most of the players, Conan emerges from Sicas ahead of the game, passing by royal forces en route to the town to restore order. Questioned as to how he did it, he responds [...] "That was a town of rogues, my friend, and I am the greatest rogue of all."

5000|$|Upon its release, the {{collaboration}} of [...] "Back to Black" [...] received mixed reviews by music critics. Critics discussed that {{the song was}} already [...] "perfect" [...] to be further reworked. A writer of the website Consequence of Sound commented that the cover was [...] "an intriguing take on the sultry number, featuring a soft pulse of dub underneath the syrupy sing-talk of André and breathy croon a la Marilyn Monroe/Betty Boop from Queen B." [...] Paula Mejía of the same website listed the song as a highlight on the album, adding that the singers [...] "take an unsettling postmortem stab": [...] "Oozing womps from the latter Beyoncé trickle into the ear slowly, mimicking that feeling when you're walking alone at night and have the suspicion you're being followed, but you're too freaked-out and cool to look behind you." [...] Christina Lee of the website Idolator wrote in her review of the song that it was [...] "a gloomier take on Southern hip-hop's codeine effect", comparing it with OutKast's album Aquemini (1998) reinterpreted for contemporary times. Charley Rogulewski of Vibe magazine commented that the cover was [...] "a drugged-out slow burner {{in comparison to the}} doo-wop original, which boasted Winehouse's robust vocals". C. Vernon Coleman of XXL magazine simply described it as [...] "dope". Describing it as a shift in Beyoncé's usual approach, Ann Powers of NPR noted that [...] "she gets stuck in the 1950s, sounding far more like a torch singer than a blues queen" [...] but added {{that it was not a}} problem since [...] "Lurhmann's (sic) postmodernism has plenty of room for the juxtaposition of historic and current styles." [...] She further added that André 3000 sings in a [...] "dandyish snarl that's been off-putting to some, but his radical rearrangement of the song comes closer than anything else here to Lurhmann's (sic) own nearly surrealist aesthetic". Describing the cover as [...] "distinguishable", Logan Smithson of PopMatters further commented, [...] "Though the cover doesn't top Winehouse's original, it is good in its own <b>right</b> and <b>feels</b> <b>right</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> on Gatsby. Besides, who doesn't love hearing André 3000's voice?". Kelly Dearmore from the American Songwriter described the cover as [...] "synthy and trippy", writing that the singers turn it into a [...] "wondrously hypnotic effect, and in turn, setting the tone for the entire album by blending brash audacity with dark surrealism".|$|R
