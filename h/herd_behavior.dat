5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis precipitated in 2007 and 2008 shared {{some of the}} key features exhibited by the wave of international financial crises in the 1990s, including accelerated capital influxes, weak regulatory frameworks, relaxed monetary policies, <b>herd</b> <b>behavior</b> during investment bubbles, collapsing asset prices, and massive deleveraging. The systemic problems originated in the United States and other advanced nations. Similarly to the 1997 Asian crisis, the global crisis entailed broad lending by banks undertaking unproductive real estate investments as well as poor standards of corporate governance within financial intermediaries. Particularly in the United States, the crisis was characterized by growing securitization of non-performing assets, large fiscal deficits, and excessive financing in the housing sector. While the real estate bubble in the U.S. triggered the financial crisis, the bubble was financed by foreign capital flowing from many different countries. As its contagious effects began infecting other nations, the crisis became a precursor for the global economic downturn now referred to as the Great Recession. In the wake of the crisis, total volume of world trade in goods and services fell 10% from 2008 to 2009 and did not recover until 2011, with an increased concentration in emerging market countries. The {{global financial}} crisis demonstrated the negative effects of worldwide financial integration, sparking discourse on how and whether some countries should decouple themselves from the system altogether.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} four {{specific}} hypotheses relating to <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> on the Chinese stock market. These hypotheses are that: (a) <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> {{exists on the}} Chinese stock market; (b) <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> exists in the pre-September 2008 financial crisis and the crisis period (post- September 2008 period) on the Chinese stock market; (c) <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> exists under different market conditions (rises and declines) in China; and (d) sector-specific (commerce, conglomerate, industrial, property and public utility sectors) <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> exists in the pre-September 2008 financial crisis and the crisis period (post- September 2008 period) and under different market conditions (rises and declines) in China. Based on 15 years of daily data for all firms dual-listed A and B shares on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE), we find that <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> exists on Chinese stock market except {{in the case of}} the Shanghai B share market. Second, in the pre-crisis period, <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> is existed on SHSEA, SZSEA and SZSEB. In the crisis period, <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> is only existed on SHSEB. Third, <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> is existed on SHSEA, SZSEA and SZSEB regardless of whether the market is up or down. <b>Herding</b> <b>behavior</b> on down market is higher than up market.

25|$|In 1963 Benoit Mandelbrot {{analyzed}} the variations of cotton prices on a time series starting in 1900. There were two important findings. First, price movements {{had very little}} to do with a normal distribution in which the bulk of the observations lies close to the mean (68% of the data are within one standard deviation). Instead, the data showed a great frequency of extreme variations. Second, price variations followed patterns that were indifferent to scale: the curve described by price changes for a single day was similar to a month’s curve. Surprisingly, these patterns of self-similarity were present during the entire period 1900-1960, a violent epoch that had seen a Great Depression and two world wars. Mandelbrot used his fractal theory to explain the presence of extreme events in Wall Street. In 2004 he published his book on the “misbehavior” of financial markets - The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward. The basic idea that relates fractals to financial markets is that the probability of experiencing extreme fluctuations (like the ones triggered by <b>herd</b> <b>behavior)</b> is greater than what conventional wisdom wants us to believe. This of course delivers a more accurate vision of risk in the world of finance. The central objective in financial markets is to maximize income for a given level of risk. Standard models for this are based on the premise that the probability of extreme variations of asset prices is very low.|$|E
2500|$|Prominent Church leader Blanche Barton {{described}} Satanism as [...] "an alignment, a lifestyle". LaVey and the Church espoused {{the view}} that [...] "Satanists are born, not made"; that they are outsiders by their nature, living as they see fit, who are self-realized in a religion which appeals to the would-be Satanist's nature, leading them to realize they are Satanists through finding a belief system that {{is in line with}} their own perspective and lifestyle. Adherents to the philosophy have described Satanism as a non-spiritual religion of the flesh, or [...] "...the world's first [...] religion". LaVey used Christianity as a negative mirror for his new faith, with LaVeyan Satanism rejecting the basic principles and theology of Christian belief. It views Christianity [...] alongside other major religions, and philosophies such as humanism and liberal democracy [...] as a largely negative force on humanity; LaVeyan Satanists perceive Christianity as a lie which promotes idealism, self-denigration, <b>herd</b> <b>behavior,</b> and irrationality. LaVeyans view their religion as a force for redressing this balance by encouraging materialism, egoism, stratification, carnality, atheism, and social Darwinism. LaVey's Satanism was particularly critical of what it understands as Christianity's denial of humanity's animal nature, and it instead calls for the celebration of, and indulgence in, these desires. In doing so, it places an emphasis on the carnal rather than the spiritual.|$|E
2500|$|Behavioral {{psychology}} {{approaches to}} stock market trading are {{among some of}} the more promising alternatives to EMH (and some investment strategies seek to exploit exactly such inefficiencies). But Nobel Laureate co-founder of the programme Daniel Kahneman —announced his skepticism of investors beating the market: [...] "They're [...] just {{not going to do it}} [...] It's just not going to happen." [...] Indeed, defenders of EMH maintain that Behavioral Finance strengthens the case for EMH in that it highlights biases in individuals and committees and not competitive markets. For example, one prominent finding in Behaviorial Finance is that individuals employ hyperbolic discounting. It is demonstrably true that bonds, mortgages, annuities and other similar financial instruments subject to competitive market forces do not. Any manifestation of hyperbolic discounting in the pricing of these obligations would invite arbitrage thereby quickly eliminating any vestige of individual biases. Similarly, diversification, derivative securities and other hedging strategies assuage if not eliminate potential mispricings from the severe risk-intolerance (loss aversion) of individuals underscored by behavioral finance. On the other hand, economists, behaviorial psychologists and mutual fund managers are drawn from the human population and are therefore subject to the biases that behavioralists showcase. By contrast, the price signals in markets are far less subject to individual biases highlighted by the Behavioral Finance programme. Richard Thaler has started a fund based on his research on cognitive biases. In a 2008 report he identified complexity and <b>herd</b> <b>behavior</b> as central to the global financial crisis of 2008.|$|E
40|$|<b>Herding</b> <b>Behavior</b> is the {{tendency}} of institutional or individual investors to behave similar. This behavior is irrational because investors do not depend their investment decisions on information available but follow the crowd. Distinguishing the causes of <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> is crucial for discovering whether herding leads to market inefficiency and financial bubbles. Herding may destabilize stock prices and thus impair the proper functioning of financial market. This study is analyzing the effect of size, trading volume activity, return and volatility to <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in 2009 to 2014 period. <b>Herding</b> <b>behavior</b> will be measured based on the types of investors in Indonesian capital market.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> of investors in ten CEE stock markets for size-ranked portfolios and to assess the impact of the recent global financial crisis on the cross-sectional absolute deviation of stock returns, based on the intuitive assumption that <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> is more intensive during extreme market movements. Considering that the majority of studies on <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> are focused on the US and Asian markets and given that in emerging and frontier markets there is a slower assimilation of information into stocks prices, and in consequence a higher propensity to herd, our study fills a gap in the literature by approaching Central and Eastern European markets.

50|$|Hey and Morone (2004) {{analyzed}} a {{model of}} <b>herd</b> <b>behavior</b> in a market context. Their work is related to at least two important strands of literature. The first of these strands is that on <b>herd</b> <b>behavior</b> in a non-market context. The seminal references are Banerjee (1992) and Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer and Welch (1992), both of which showed that <b>herd</b> <b>behavior</b> may result from private information not publicly shared. More specifically, both of these papers showed that individuals, acting sequentially {{on the basis of}} private information and public knowledge about the behavior of others, may end up choosing the socially undesirable option. The second of the strands of literature motivating this paper is that of information aggregation in market contexts. A very early reference is the classic paper by Grossman and Stiglitz (1976) that showed that uninformed traders in a market context can become informed through the price {{in such a way that}} private information is aggregated correctly and efficiently. In this strand of the literature, the most commonly used empirical methodologies to test for herding toward the average, are the works of Christie and Huang (1995) and Chang, Cheng and Khorana (2000). Overall, it was shown that it is possible to observe herd-type behavior in a market context. The results refer to a market with a well-defined fundamental value. Even if <b>herd</b> <b>behavior</b> might only be observed rarely, this has important consequences for a whole range of real markets - most particularly foreign exchange markets.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Previous {{studies have}} devoted much effort on {{investigating}} <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in equity markets. However, their findings not only tended to become homogeneous, but also {{stayed at the}} surface level of the problem. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the insights of <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in the Confucian markets by conducting a set of empirical tests. More specifically this study investigates a sample of 7 countries and 13 markets to gain a deeper understanding of the causes of <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> and the potential factors that cause investors to behave in a group manner. Furthermore, this study investigates the relationship between managerial decision making processes in Confucian culture. Methodology: Following a comprehensive review of the existing methodologies on <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> this study employs return dispersion approaches and herding tests developed by Christie and Huang (1995), Chang, Cheng, and Khorana (2000), and Tan, Chiang, Mason, and Nelling (2008). Thus, the foundation of empirical models of this study is based on these return dispersion methods and herding tests. This study investigates a sample of 13 stock markets of seven Asian economies with 10 different hypotheses. Those economies, which are considered to have Confucian culture, are mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam. The hypotheses of this study aim to investigate formation of <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in different market and economic circumstances. In testing the empirical models, this study uses OLS regression for the main test as well as regression with Newey-West (1987) for the robustness test of each result from OLS regression analysis. Data of this study consists of 13 index returns (Shanghai A and B share, Shenzhen A and B share, Hang Seng index, NIKKEI 225, TOPIX, KOSDAQ, KOSPI, Straits Times Index, TAIEX, and indices of Hanoi and Hochimin city Stock Exchanges) and returns of their constituent stocks. Moreover, to test behavioral pitfalls and monetary policy effects, this study adopted trading volumes, market values, prime lending interest rates, and exchange rates. The time period of the sample data is from January 01, 1999 to December 31, 2014. All data were collected from the Thomson Reuters Datastream database. Findings: In order to investigate the insights of <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> among Confucian markets, this study proposes and tests 10 different hypotheses. According to the empirical findings, all hypotheses are accepted. The breakdowns of the findings are as follows: First, the sample markets demonstrate significant <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in general and significant <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in different markets conditions such as in rising-falling markets, high-low trading volumes and high-low market volatility. Second, the sample markets reveal significant cross-market herding effect. Further investigation of the results suggest that the cross-market effect exists in direction from advanced markets (Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong) toward emerging markets (China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Vietnam). Third, the sample markets disclose significant effects on herding tendency due to events, such as the global financial crisis 2008 and Chinese New Year. Fourth, about 35 % of the sample markets exhibit significant lower herding tendency when the markets were characterized by excessive optimism, and 90. 9 % of the sample markets exhibit significant lower herding tendency when they were characterized with overconfidence. Fifth, there is a significant inverse herding tendency, which is expressed with the expanding return dispersion, when the volatility of interest rate and exchange rate is high. Finally, results of the robustness test shows highly significant <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> during the extreme market movements, which also gives a strong support to our empirical findings. Contribution: This study has three major contributions to the literature of <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> and the link between <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> and cultural aspects. First, this study uses dataset of 13 Confucian stock markets of seven Asian economies, with time range from 1999 to 2014. Second, this research developed and tested 10 different hypotheses along its main purpose, and most importantly all of them are accepted. However, previous studies examined Confucian markets separately with different time periods; no study brought all of them together into the set of empirical examination under the same and this long time period. But this study did, which appears to be the first two contributions of this study to the literature of behavioral finance. Third, this study adds the new dimension of the cultural aspects in order try to explain the root causes to <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> among investors in the equity markets. Recognizing that the Confucian culture appears to be one of the most influential cultural aspects in management, this study examines <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> of Confucian culture in stock markets under the umbrella of one empirical study. According to the findings of this study, Confucian culture has a positive and significant effect on <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> among investors in equity markets. There is no study examined investors` <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in terms of Confucian culture at any level. However, this study did, and found significant positive results. This is the most important contribution of this study to the existing body of literature on <b>herding</b> <b>behavior.</b> Suggestions: This empirical study emphasizes on <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in Confucian culture in linkage with the CNY influence. Thus, future studies are advised to employ more diverse methods, such as survey analysis or experimental design, to go for more deliberate findings. Limitations: Data limitation issues made some of the empirical models to exclude markets of Vietnam from the empirical testing. Data from some markets, such as STI of Singapore Exchange, tracks from 1973, however for some markets, the data fades even during 1990 s. The Thomson Reuters Datastream database is the only source of data for this study. [[abstract]]Purpose: Previous studies have devoted much effort on investigating <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in equity markets. However, their findings not only tended to become homogeneous, but also stayed at the surface level of the problem. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the insights of <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in the Confucian markets by conducting a set of empirical tests. More specifically this study investigates a sample of 7 countries and 13 markets to gain a deeper understanding of the causes of <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> and the potential factors that cause investors to behave in a group manner. Furthermore, this study investigates the relationship between managerial decision making processes in Confucian culture. Methodology: Following a comprehensive review of the existing methodologies on <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> this study employs return dispersion approaches and herding tests developed by Christie and Huang (1995), Chang, Cheng, and Khorana (2000), and Tan, Chiang, Mason, and Nelling (2008). Thus, the foundation of empirical models of this study is based on these return dispersion methods and herding tests. This study investigates a sample of 13 stock markets of seven Asian economies with 10 different hypotheses. Those economies, which are considered to have Confucian culture, are mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam. The hypotheses of this study aim to investigate formation of <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in different market and economic circumstances. In testing the empirical models, this study uses OLS regression for the main test as well as regression with Newey-West (1987) for the robustness test of each result from OLS regression analysis. Data of this study consists of 13 index returns (Shanghai A and B share, Shenzhen A and B share, Hang Seng index, NIKKEI 225, TOPIX, KOSDAQ, KOSPI, Straits Times Index, TAIEX, and indices of Hanoi and Hochimin city Stock Exchanges) and returns of their constituent stocks. Moreover, to test behavioral pitfalls and monetary policy effects, this study adopted trading volumes, market values, prime lending interest rates, and exchange rates. The time period of the sample data is from January 01, 1999 to December 31, 2014. All data were collected from the Thomson Reuters Datastream database. Findings: In order to investigate the insights of <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> among Confucian markets, this study proposes and tests 10 different hypotheses. According to the empirical findings, all hypotheses are accepted. The breakdowns of the findings are as follows: First, the sample markets demonstrate significant <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in general and significant <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in different markets conditions such as in rising-falling markets, high-low trading volumes and high-low market volatility. Second, the sample markets reveal significant cross-market herding effect. Further investigation of the results suggest that the cross-market effect exists in direction from advanced markets (Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong) toward emerging markets (China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Vietnam). Third, the sample markets disclose significant effects on herding tendency due to events, such as the global financial crisis 2008 and Chinese New Year. Fourth, about 35 % of the sample markets exhibit significant lower herding tendency when the markets were characterized by excessive optimism, and 90. 9 % of the sample markets exhibit significant lower herding tendency when they were characterized with overconfidence. Fifth, there is a significant inverse herding tendency, which is expressed with the expanding return dispersion, when the volatility of interest rate and exchange rate is high. Finally, results of the robustness test shows highly significant <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> during the extreme market movements, which also gives a strong support to our empirical findings. Contribution: This study has three major contributions to the literature of <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> and the link between <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> and cultural aspects. First, this study uses dataset of 13 Confucian stock markets of seven Asian economies, with time range from 1999 to 2014. Second, this research developed and tested 10 different hypotheses along its main purpose, and most importantly all of them are accepted. However, previous studies examined Confucian markets separately with different time periods; no study brought all of them together into the set of empirical examination under the same and this long time period. But this study did, which appears to be the first two contributions of this study to the literature of behavioral finance. Third, this study adds the new dimension of the cultural aspects in order try to explain the root causes to <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> among investors in the equity markets. Recognizing that the Confucian culture appears to be one of the most influential cultural aspects in management, this study examines <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> of Confucian culture in stock markets under the umbrella of one empirical study. According to the findings of this study, Confucian culture has a positive and significant effect on <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> among investors in equity markets. There is no study examined investors` <b>herding</b> <b>behavior</b> in terms of Confucian culture at any level. However, this study did, and found significant positive results.
