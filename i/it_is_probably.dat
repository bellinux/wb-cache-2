5|$|He {{was buried}} in the family {{mausoleum}} at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents.|$|E
5|$|A. b. major (Blyth, 1869) : Known as {{the western}} hartebeest. Formerly {{occurred}} widely in Mali, Niger, Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, southwestern Chad, Cameroon, western Central African Republic and Benin. Nowadays {{it occurs in}} much lower numbers mainly in protected areas of these countries. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> extinct in Gambia.|$|E
5|$|Al-Tabari's account {{does not}} mention the Romans, Odaenathus, Vaballathus or the Sassanians; {{focusing}} on the tribes and their relations, it is immersed in legends. Although the account is certainly based {{on the story of}} Zenobia, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> conflated with the story of a semi-legendary nomadic Arab queen (or queens). Al-Zabba' fortress was probably Halabiye, which was restored by the historic Palmyrene queen and named Zenobia.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the Roman Pons Dubis.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the Roman Portus Abucini.|$|R
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{uncertain}} {{when the}} castle <b>was</b> built, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{in the late}} 11thcentury. In {{the aftermath of the}} Norman Conquest, the manor of Portchester was granted to William Maudit, an associate of William the Conqueror and a powerful magnate, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> he who built Portchester Castle.|$|R
5|$|Epidemiological {{data are}} limited, but {{reactive}} attachment disorder {{appears to be}} very uncommon. The prevalence of RAD is unclear but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> quite rare, other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme, deprived settings such as some orphanages. There is little systematically gathered epidemiologic information on RAD. A cohort study of 211 Copenhagen children {{to the age of}} 18 months found a prevalence of 0.9%.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Adelman {{was honored}} as {{the keynote speaker}} at the First Annual Howard Adelman Lecture in celebration of the Centre for Refugee Studies’ 20th anniversary. Held during Refugee Rights Week in Toronto, Adelman {{reviewed}} recent research on refugees, suggesting <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> more beneficial than detrimental to assist refugees.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, copernicium is a d-block transactinide element. During reactions with gold, {{it has been shown}} to be an extremely volatile metal and a group 12 element, so much so that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a gas at standard temperature and pressure.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> 5 or 4 inches long.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{an attack}} {{aircraft}} dispersal base.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{built in}} about 1660 A.D.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> worth noting, if only {{to avoid}} confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin {{had been unable to}} explain what {{happened}} at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence for either of these claims.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about the {{internal}} structure of Puck. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> made of a mixture of water ice with the dark material similar to that found in the rings. This dark material is probably made of rocks or radiation-processed organics. The absence of craters with bright rays implies that Puck is not differentiated, meaning that ice and non-ice components have not separated from each other into a core and mantle.|$|E
5|$|Potamon fluviatile is edible, as {{indicated}} by its alternative specific epithet edulis, and was known to the ancient Greeks; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> this species which they depicted on medals found at Agrigento, Sicily. More recently, the species was depicted on the 5¢ coin in the last series of Maltese coins before {{the introduction of the}} Euro there in 2007.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{built in}} the 17th century.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{written in}} the 14th century.|$|R
50|$|William Smith {{suggested}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> Market Weighton.|$|R
5|$|The keep {{was inside}} the inner bailey and {{contained}} the king's accommodation. It had two rooms: an antechamber and an audience room. While Allen Brown interpreted the audience room as the king's chamber, historian Liddiard believes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a throne room. A throne room emphasises the political importance of the castle. In England there is nothing similar to Château Gaillard's keep, but there are buildings with a similar design in France in the 12th and 13th centuries.|$|E
5|$|The stoor worm, or Mester Stoor Worm, was a {{gigantic}} evil sea serpent of Orcadian folklore, capable of contaminating plants and destroying {{animals and humans}} with its putrid breath. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> an Orkney variant of the Norse Jörmungandr, {{also known as the}} Midgard Serpent, or world serpent, and {{has been described as a}} sea dragon.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Hyksos and the reunification of Egypt under Ahmose I, the Theban rulers began to {{construct}} elaborate tombs that reflected their newfound power. The tombs of Ahmose and his son Amenhotep I (their exact location remains unknown) were probably in the Seventeenth Dynasty necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga'. The first royal tombs in the valley were those of Amenhotep I (although this identification is also disputed), and Thutmose I, whose advisor, Ineni, notes in his tomb that he advised the king to place his tomb in the desolate valley (the identity of this actual tomb is unclear, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> KV20 or KV38).|$|E
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{uncertain}} {{when the}} castle <b>was</b> built, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{in the late}} 11th century.

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{referred}} from Crimea, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> Mentissa gracilicosta.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> first {{recorded}} in 844 as Oninwanc.|$|R
5|$|Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, CT {{scanning}} {{suggests that}} each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger {{from the first}} to the fifth incisor. Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack serrations, unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems to be slightly concave, and the back edge {{appears to have a}} ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced incisor preserved within its nasal cavity; it is more strongly recurved and has wear marks on its top edge, suggesting that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a lower incisor. Its fourth incisor also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by resorption of the root.|$|E
5|$|At his request, Henry {{was buried}} in Westminster Abbey {{in front of the}} church's high altar, in the former resting place of Edward the Confessor. A few years later, work began on a grander tomb for the King and in 1290 Edward moved his father's body to its current {{location}} in Westminster Abbey. His gilt-brass funeral effigy was designed and forged within the abbey grounds by William Torell; unlike other effigies of the period, it is particularly naturalistic in style, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> not a close likeness of Henry himself.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, and just {{opposite}} his own tomb, Ramesses enlarged the earlier small tomb {{of an unknown}} Eighteenth Dynasty noble (KV5) for his numerous sons. With 120 known rooms, and excavation work still underway, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> the largest tomb in the valley. Originally opened (and robbed) in antiquity, it is a low-lying structure that has been particularly prone to the flash floods that sometimes hit the area. Tonnes of debris and material has washed in over the centuries, ultimately concealing its vast size. It is not currently open to the public.|$|E
50|$|Under the Frentani <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{under the}} {{influence}} of Greater Greece. After the end of the Samnite Wars, which saw the Frentani allied with the Romans, Lancianum obtained the status of municipium. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a flourishing commercial site, across an ancient and important trade route connecting Pescara to Apulia.|$|R
50|$|A.L.F. Rivet & Colin Smith suggest <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> Wetwang.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{built in}} 1910, based on {{examining}} county records.|$|R
5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled wobbegong's ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, while <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and {{spends most of}} the day lying motionless inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled up. Individual sharks have a small home range, containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581c {{is likely}} to lie outside the {{habitable}} zone. No direct evidence has been found for water to be present, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> not present in the liquid state. Techniques like the one {{used to measure the}} extrasolar planet HD 209458 b may in the future be used to determine the presence of water in the form of vapor in the planet's atmosphere, but only in the rare case of a planet with an orbit aligned so as to transit its star, which Gliese 581c is not known to do.|$|E
5|$|Honorius {{consolidated}} {{the work}} of converting the English by sending Felix, a Burgundian, to Dunwich after Felix came to the archbishop and made known his desire to go to East Anglia as a missionary. Honorius may have consecrated Felix as the first bishop of East Anglia or Felix may have already been consecrated on the continent. The dating of this episode is unclear, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> close to 631. It is possible that King Sigeberht of East Anglia, who converted to Christianity {{while he was in}} exile on the continent, had already met Felix and was behind Felix's journey to Honorius. As well as his help to Felix, Honorius consecrated the first Anglo-Saxon bishop, Ithamar of Rochester, and his successor was also a native of England.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{built in}} the 17th century, but with later additions.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the {{location}} of the ancient city of Cnidus (q.v.).|$|R
