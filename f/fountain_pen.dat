5000|$|While {{no longer}} the primary writing {{instrument}} in modern times, <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> are still used for important official works such as signing valuable documents. Today, <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> are often treated as luxury goods and sometimes as status symbols. <b>Fountain</b> <b>pens</b> may serve as an everyday writing instrument, much like the common ballpoint pen. Good quality steel and gold pens are available inexpensively today, particularly in Europe and China, where there are [...] "disposable" [...] <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> such as the Pilot Varsity. In France, in particular, the use of <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> is well spread. To avoid mistakes, special ink can be used {{that can be made}} invisible by applying an ink eraser.|$|R
50|$|Some {{pigmented}} inks {{do exist}} for <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> {{but these are}} uncommon. Normal India ink cannot be used in <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> because it contains shellac as a binder which would very quickly clog such pens.|$|R
5|$|While at the Museum, Stearn became {{increasingly}} {{involved in the}} work of the Linnean Society during his Kensington years. He was also offered the George A. Miller professorship of botany at the University of Illinois (1966), but felt he would be unable to leave his commitments in London. At the time of his retirement in 1976, he was still using a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> as his only means of communication and scholarship, a fact commemorated by his retirement present of a Mont Blanc pen capable of writing for long periods without refills.|$|E
5|$|Waller {{developed}} {{a number of}} community features on this land, including five churches, the Columbia County Courthouse and Jail, and several industries such as the Magee Carpet Company and the Bloomsburg Silk Mills. In 1870, he sold three acres of land on Seventh Street in Bloomsburg {{for the purpose of}} building a park, but the land was instead used for athletic competitions. In 1890, he sold two lots at the corner of Sixth Street and Iron Street to Paul E. Wirt, a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> manufacturer. He also hired the town engineer Samuel Neyhard to develop Bloomsburg from Fifth Street to the Susquehanna River. Most of this work was done after Waller was no longer a minister.|$|E
5|$|These extreme {{difficulties}} in melting the metal limited {{the possibilities for}} handling iridium. John Isaac Hawkins was looking to obtain a fine and hard point for <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> nibs, and in 1834 managed to create an iridium-pointed gold pen. In 1880, John Holland and William Lofland Dudley were able to melt iridium by adding phosphorus and patented the process in the United States; British company Johnson Matthey later stated they had been using a similar process since 1837 and had already presented fused iridium {{at a number of}} World Fairs. The first use of an alloy of iridium with ruthenium in thermocouples was made by Otto Feussner in 1933. These allowed for the measurement of high temperatures in air up to 2000°C.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fountain</b> <b>pens</b> {{can serve}} various artistic {{purposes}} such as expressive penmanship and calligraphy, {{pen and ink}} artwork, and professional art and design. Many users also favor the air of timeless elegance, personalization and sentimentality associated with <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> which computers and ballpoint pens seem to lack, and often state that once they start using <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> ballpoints become awkward to use due to the extra motor effort needed and lack of expressiveness.|$|R
50|$|Cross is {{well known}} for its writing {{instrument}} lines, beginning with mechanical pencils and produced the first stylographic (a technological forerunner of the modern ball point pen) pens in 1879. The current product line includes <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> ballpoint pens, gel pens and mechanical pencils. The first Cross <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> were likely produced in 1930, but not again until the 1980s.|$|R

5|$|Sivanandam interrogates Usha, {{who tells}} him {{how she and}} Rajan fell in love. Sivanandam tricks Usha into using a leaky <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> in order to collect her fingerprints. That evening, he and Naidu meet all of the {{suspects}} at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspectsincluding Ushamust pretend he is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. All the suspects shoot him except Usha, who bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth: Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price. Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated. He became a spy selling India's military secrets to Japan. Usha learnt about this and tried unsuccessfully to reform him. She could not stop him and attempted to shoot him. She changed her mind but pulled the trigger accidentally, killing him. After revealing the truth, Usha commits suicide.|$|E

He joined the German Navy in 1941 and was trained as a radio operator. His military service involved monitoring radio communications in the English Channel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fountain</b> <b>pens</b> carry ink {{within the}} barrel, {{traditionally}} either inserted {{at one end}} in bulk with a syringe or eyedropper pipette, or through a mechanical filling system built into the pen (such as a piston or vacuum-pump mechanism). For such <b>fountain</b> <b>pens,</b> ink is available in bottles which will typically refill an individual pen many tens of times. Simpler <b>fountain</b> <b>pens</b> use pre-filled ink cartridges, although {{in many cases the}} cartridge can be replaced with a converter which replicates the mechanical filling action of more expensive pens. The cost per millilitre of ink tends to be lower for bottled ink than for cartridges.|$|R

25|$|Despite having invented {{much of the}} {{technology}} of software, Dijkstra eschewed {{the use of computers}} in his own work for many decades. Even after he succumbed to his UT colleagues' encouragement and acquired a Macintosh computer, he used it only for e-mail and for browsing the World Wide Web. Dijkstra never wrote his articles using a computer. He preferred to rely on his typewriter and later on his Montblanc pen. Dijkstra's favorite writing instrument was the Montblanc Meisterstück <b>fountain</b> <b>pen.</b> He repeatedly tried other pens, but none ever displaced the Montblanc.|$|E
25|$|Concerning the {{aforementioned}} <b>fountain</b> <b>pen,</b> this {{was said to}} be loaded with the poison Black Leaf 40 and passed to a Cuban asset in Paris the day of President Kennedy's assassination, November 22, 1963. Notably, the evidence also indicates that these two events occurred simultaneously, in the same moment. Rolando Cubela, the potential assassin, contests this account, saying Black Leaf 40 was not in the pen. U.S. Intelligence later responded to say that Black Leaf 40 was merely a suggestion but Cubela thought that there were other poisons that would be much more effective. Overall he was unimpressed with the device. The inventor understood that Cubelo rejected the device altogether.|$|E

When a creditor comes to claim the Orlacs' piano, Stephen throws a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> that barely misses his head. Stephen seeks help from his stepfather, Henry Orlac (Ian Wolfe). Henry denies the request, upset that Stephen did not follow in his line of business as a jeweler. A knife thrown in anger by Stephen misses Henry, but breaks the shop front's window. Gogol meanwhile asks Yvonne for her love, but she refuses. Stephen goes to Gogol's home and demands to know about his hands, and why they throw knives. Gogol suggests that Stephen's problem comes from childhood trauma, but later confirms to his assistant Dr. Wong (Keye Luke) that Stephen's hands had been Rollo's.|$|E

25|$|Scabies may be {{diagnosed}} clinically in geographical areas {{where it is}} common when diffuse itching presents along with either lesions in two typical spots or itchiness is present in another household member. The classical sign of scabies is the burrow made by a mite within the skin. To detect the burrow, the suspected area is rubbed with ink from a <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> or a topical tetracycline solution, which glows under a special light. The skin is then wiped with an alcohol pad. If the person is infected with scabies, the characteristic zigzag or S pattern of the burrow will appear across the skin; however, interpreting this test may be difficult, as the burrows are scarce and may be obscured by scratch marks. A definitive diagnosis is made by finding either the scabies mites or their eggs and fecal pellets. Searches for these signs involve either scraping a suspected area, mounting the sample in potassium hydroxide and examining it under a microscope, or using dermoscopy to examine the skin directly.|$|E
25|$|Dijkstra {{was well}} known for his habit of {{carefully}} composing manuscripts with his <b>fountain</b> <b>pen.</b> The manuscripts are called EWDs, since Dijkstra numbered them with EWD, his initials, as a prefix. According to Dijkstra himself, the EWDs started when he moved from the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam to the Eindhoven University of Technology (then Technische Hogeschool Eindhoven). After going to Eindhoven, Dijkstra experienced a writer's block {{for more than a}} year. Dijkstra distributed photocopies of a new EWD among his colleagues. Many recipients photocopied and forwarded their copies, so the EWDs spread throughout the international computer science community. The topics were computer science and mathematics, and included trip reports, letters, and speeches. These short articles span a period of 40 years. Almost all EWDs appearing after 1972 were hand-written. They are rarely longer than 15 pages and are consecutively numbered. The last one, No. 1318, is from 14 April 2002. Within computer science they are known as the EWD reports, or, simply the EWDs. More than 1300 EWDs have been scanned, with a growing number transcribed to facilitate search, and are available online at the Dijkstra archive of the University of Texas.|$|E
500|$|Iridium–osmium alloys {{were used}} in <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> nib tips. The first major use of iridium was in 1834 in nibs mounted on gold. Since 1944, the famous Parker 51 <b>fountain</b> <b>pen</b> was fitted with a nib tipped by a {{ruthenium}} and iridium alloy (with 3.8% iridium). The tip material in modern fountain pens is still conventionally called [...] "iridium", although there is seldom any iridium in it; other metals such as ruthenium, osmium and tungsten have taken its place.|$|E
