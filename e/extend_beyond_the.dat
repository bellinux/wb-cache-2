5|$|Cerebral malaria {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{neurological}} disabilities in African children. Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences that <b>extend</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> immediate effects of the disease.|$|E
5|$|It {{has a long}} broad {{nose and}} muzzle, with thick ears covered in silky hair that usually end around {{the tip of the}} muzzle.

Its tail typically does not <b>extend</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> hock and is normally straight.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to earlier}} works of this type, Christ's body is more {{physically}} corporeal, {{depicted as a}} real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. His hands and feet seem to <b>extend</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both Christ's body and his semi-circular nimbus are placed at angles which rise outwards and above {{the level of the}} cross.|$|E

5|$|Some {{forms of}} goitre are {{associated}} with pain, whereas many do not cause any symptoms. Enlarged goitres may <b>extend</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> normal position of the thyroid gland to below the sternum, around the airway or esophagus. Goitres {{may be associated with}} hyperthyoidism or hypothyroidism, relating to the underlying cause of the goitre. Thyroid function tests may be done to investigate the cause and effects of the goitre. The underlying cause of the goitre may be treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are simply monitored.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipal}} {{borders of}} Bani Na'im <b>extend</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> town and {{include the following}} villages: Birin, ar-Rawa'in and Masaferet Bani Na'im. The latter is a grouping of the following hamlets: Mantiqat al-Ein, Mantiqat as-Sahel, Mantiqat Qaber K'heil, Mantiqat Hilmi, Mantiqat al-Hamra, Mantiqat al-Qurun, Mantiqat al-Mathbah, Mantiqat as-Sweidat, Mantiqat Um ar-Raqam and Khor 'Atara. Despite having a municipality, most official services are provided {{by the city of}} Hebron. However, Bani Na'im has a police station, a post office, and a local security office.|$|E

Stephen Williams, MP for Bristol West; and the group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways support the electrification being extended to the Severn Beach Line.|$|E

5|$|On 13 December 1920, Betelgeuse {{became the}} first star outside the Solar System to have the angular size of its {{photosphere}} measured. Although interferometry was still in its infancy, the experiment proved a success. The researchers, using a uniform disk model, determined that Betelgeuse had a diameter of 0.047arcseconds, although the stellar disk was likely 17% larger due to the limb darkening, resulting in an estimate for its angular diameter of about 0.055". Since then, other studies have produced angular diameters that range from 0.042 to 0.069arcseconds. Combining these data with historical distance estimates of 180 to 815ly yields a projected radius of the stellar disk of anywhere from 1.2 to 8.9AU. Using the Solar System for comparison, the orbit of Mars is about 1.5AU, Ceres in the asteroid belt 2.7AU, Jupiter 5.5AU—so, assuming Betelgeuse occupying {{the place of the}} Sun, its photosphere might <b>extend</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> Jovian orbit, not quite reaching Saturn at 9.5AU.|$|E
5|$|The sculptures on {{the west}} front at Wells include {{standing}} figures, seated figures, half-length angels and narratives in high relief. Many of the figures are life-sized or larger, and together they constitute the finest display of medieval carving in England. The figures {{and many of the}} architectural details were painted in bright colours, and the colouring scheme has been deduced from flakes of paint still adhering to some surfaces. The sculptures occupy nine architectural zones stretching horizontally across the entire west front and around the sides and the eastern returns of the towers which <b>extend</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> aisles. The strongly projecting buttresses have tiers of niches which contain many of the largest figures. Other large figures, including that of Christ, occupy the gable. A single figure stands in one of two later niches high on the northern tower.|$|E
5|$|The small, rounded {{ears are}} covered with dense golden hairs on the outer and with reddish brown hairs on the inner surface. The mystacial vibrissae (whiskers on the upper lip) are long, usually {{extending}} a little beyond the ears when laid back against the head, but the superciliary vibrissae (whiskers above the eyes) are short and do not <b>extend</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> ears. The upper surface on the forefeet is covered with brown fur, and there is white or silvery fur on the digits. Ungual tufts (fur around the bases of the claws) are present on the second through fourth digits. On the short, fairly broad hindfeet, the upper side is covered densely with silvery to white hairs near {{the tips of the}} feet and toes, and with brown fur otherwise. No other oryzomyine has such brown fur on its hindfeet. The second through fourth digits have long silvery-white ungual tufts, but those on the first digit are short. On the sole, the pads are very large. Among oryzomyines, only Oecomys and the extinct Megalomys have similarly large pads between their digits. There is a dense cover of short brown hairs on both the upper and lower sides of the tail. Unlike in Eremoryzomys, the tail is the same color above and below. The tail ends in a tuft, an unusual feature among oryzomyines.|$|E

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the linguistic impairments associated with a mutation of the FOXP2 gene are not simply the result of a fundamental deficit in motor control. For examples, the impairments include difficulties in comprehension.

25|$|It {{is unknown}} {{how far the}} {{periodic}} table might <b>extend</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> known 118 elements. Glenn T.

25|$|The Kingship of Archenland is {{not broken}} {{by either the}} White Witch or the Telmarines, so the line from King Frank I and Queen Helen remains unbroken, and Archenland still exists {{at the end of}} the world.

Hence the royal line and more general presence of humans in a nearby location did not directly threaten the witch.|$|E
25|$|The {{two primary}} {{features}} {{used to identify}} this bird {{in the field are}} its long wings and its white rump. The white patch on the rump can be seen while the bird is in flight. Its long wings <b>extend</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> tail by about a quarter inch. Baird's sandpiper also shows this trait but can be distinguished by the lack of a white rump. There is also a thin white stripe on the wing and a row of marks on the flanks below the wings.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a strong}} {{connection}} between the transpersonal and the humanistic approaches to psychology, {{as indicated by the}} sourcebook of Donald Moss. Although transpersonal psychology is considered to have started off within, or developed from humanistic psychology, many of its interests, such as spirituality and modes of consciousness, <b>extend</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> areas of interest discussed by humanistic theory. According to writers in the field transpersonal psychology advocates for an expanded, spiritual, view of physical and mental health that is not necessarily addressed by humanistic psychology.|$|E
