5000|$|Foliar {{nematodes}} are {{an important}} plant pathogen to agricultural crops and ornamental plants in the United States, Canada, and Europe. [...] Aphelenchoides fragariae nematodes are found in over 200 plant host species, including crop species strawberry and alfalfa, and ornamental species Begonia, Chrysanthemum, Dahlia, Ficus, Hibiscus, Hosta, Viola, ferns, and Zinnia. [...] Since 1991-1992, strawberry <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> incidence numbers have been increasing {{in a variety of}} plants, but especially in strawberry and greenhouse plants such as Hosta.|$|E
50|$|Strawberry <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> is {{a disease}} common in {{strawberries}} and ornamental plants that can greatly affect plant yield and appearance, resulting {{in a loss of}} millions of dollars of revenue. Symptoms used to diagnose the disease are angular, water soaked lesions and necrotic blotches. Aphelenchoides fragariae is the nematode pathogen that causes the disease. Its biological cycle includes four life stages, three of which are juvenile. The nematode can undergo multiple life cycles in one growing season when favorable conditions are present. They can infect the crowns, runners, foliage, and new buds of the plant via stylet penetration or through the stomata. The best management practices for this disease are sanitation, prevention of induction of the pathogen to the environment, and planting clean seed or starter plants.|$|E
50|$|Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi (Black currant nematode, Chrysanthemum <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode,</b> Chrysanthemum leaf nematode, Chrysanthemum nematode, Chrysanthemum Foliar eelworm) is a plant {{pathogenic}} nematode. It {{was first}} scientifically described in 1890 in England. This nematode {{has a wide}} host range. Among the most important species affected are Chrysanthemums and strawberries. A. ritzemabosi is a migratory foliar feeding nematode. It can feed both ectoparasitically and endoparasitically, with the later causing the most significant damage. When adequate moisture is present, this nematode enters the leaves and feeds from inside the tissue. Typical damage is characterized by necrotic zones between the veins of the leaves. Its lifecycle is short; only ten days from egg to mature adult. A single female can lay as many as 3,500 eggs. This pest {{can be difficult to}} control. Host plant resistance, hot water treatments, and predatory mites are recommended.|$|E
50|$|<b>Foliar</b> <b>nematodes,</b> which leave {{streaks of}} dead tissue between veins, {{have become an}} {{increasing}} problem where pesticide use has decreased.|$|R
50|$|<b>Foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> occur {{throughout}} the United States in greenhouse and nursery settings. <b>Foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> travel in films of water, swimming up the stems {{of plants and}} entering leaf tissue through stomata. The nematodes are transmitted plant to plant by splashing, overhead irrigation, rainfall, {{and other forms of}} dripping water. They can also be transmitted through infected vegetative nursery cuttings, and can be rapidly spread in new material if symptoms are not present during the propagation of cuttings.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> are plant {{parasitic}} roundworms in {{the genus}} Aphelenchoides. The three most economically important species are Aphelenchoides fragariae, A. ritzemabosi, and A. besseyi. <b>Foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> {{are becoming a}} widespread and serious problem for the ornamental and nursery industries. A. fragariae causes damage on hundreds of different plants including chrysanthemum, begonia, gloxinia, African violet, cyclamen, and {{a wide variety of}} bedding plants and ferns, causing brown to black, vein-delimited lesions on leaf tissue, defoliation, and possible stunting of plants.|$|R
5000|$|Agriculturally, <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> can {{be devastating}} to alfalfa and strawberry. Strawberry is a major crop in California where fruit {{production}} is valued over $523 million. Foliar nematodes reduce fruit and plant yield because they feed on the leaves, crowns, and flower buds of the strawberry plant. [...] Ornamental plants are also a multi-million dollar industry in the United States, and foliar nematodes destroy these plants as well. In less severe cases of nematode infection, {{the appearance of the}} plant is affected by the symptoms of disease, which gives an undesirable appearance in ornamental plants. This reduces the value of the plant and makes most infected plants unmarketable. [...] It is difficult to quantitatively estimate the value of the amount of damage caused by nematodes because they are a persistent pathogen once they are introduced to the soil. However, in a multi-million dollar industry, any amount of yield loss could result in loss of millions of dollars’ worth of crop.|$|E
40|$|The <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> Aphelenchoides fragariae is an {{economically}} important and frequent pest of ornamental crops. In nurseries and landscapes in the United States, foliar nematodes {{can be a}} serious problem affecting hostas (Hosta spp.), a common perennial ornamental plant that thrives in shady environments. Fundamental research on the biology and ecology of this nematode provides the basis for development of sound management strategies. The general objective of this dissertation was to study two behaviors that make foliar nematodes very successful as plant pests: desiccation tolerance and alternative feeding on fungi (or facultative feeding on the plant). To study the molecular basis of these behaviors, I used a transcriptomic approach complemented with in vitro and greenhouse experiments. As part of the greenhouse studies, I developed a standard protocol {{for the assessment of}} resistance to Aphelenchoides fragariae on hosta cultivars. I evaluated the effects of inoculum type (nematodes maintained on fungus vs. maintained on plants), inoculation method (with injury vs. without injury), and harvestin...|$|E
40|$|During a {{nematode}} {{survey on}} cut {{flowers in the}} Pakdasht Region, Tehran Province, Iran, a species of <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> belonging to the genus Aphelenchoides Fischer was detected in leaves of 10 - to 11 -month-old, greenhouse-grown (26 to 28 °C) chrysanthemum (Dendranthema grandiflorum Kitam., cv. Puja) plants. Chrysanthemum leaves appeared discolored and slightly deformed. Diseased plants comprised approximately 40 % of all plants in the greenhouse and occurred in scattered clumps along irrigation paths. Spots and blackish brown, irregular, necrotic areas occupied 5 to 50 % of the leaf surface. Symptomatic tissue contained females, males, juveniles, and embryonated eggs of the nematode. All life stages of the nematode were detected in the mesophyll of younger and older infected leaves. The nematode population was extracted and quantified from symptomatic samples of 5 g of leaf tissues by modified Baermann funnel extraction and from 250 g of soil with a modification of the sugar centrifugal flotation method (1), counted, and identified. Morphological observations showed four incisures in the lateral field, excretory pore posterior to nerve ring, ovary single with oocytes in multiple rows, post-vulval uterine sac extending more than one-half of the vulva-anus distance, often containing sperm, tail elongate-conoid bearing a terminal peg with 2 to 4 minute processes. Males common (40 % of females) posteriorly curved through 180 ° upon relaxation, tail conoid bearing a terminal peg with 2 to 3 processes. Measurements of 14 females and 11 males (body length = 987 ± 48 μm, a = 49. 2 ± 4. 4, b = 12. 3 ± 1. 1, c = 20. 6 ± 2. 8, V = 71 ± 1. 7, T = 49 ± 2. 3, stylet length = 12. 6 ± 0. 6 μm, tail length = 47. 9 ± 5. 2 μm; position of vulva = 70. 8 ± 1. 7 %; spicules length = 22. 8 ± 1. 4 μm) conformed to {{the description of the}} chrysanthemum <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi (Schwartz) Steiner & Buhrer, (2). Voucher specimens have been deposited in the University of California Davis Collection. An average of 1, 064 A. ritzemabosi per gram were found in the leaves of chrysanthemum, while only 48 nematodes were detected in the soil.

50|$|Presently, {{there are}} very few control options for plants infested with <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes.</b> The current {{recommendations}} are to destroy infected plant material, and avoid using overhead irrigation {{to prevent the spread of}} nematodes to new plants.|$|R
50|$|While many plant {{parasitic}} nematodes feed on plant roots, <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> {{live and}} reproduce inside {{the leaves of}} plants. The nematodes live within the epidermis and mesophyll tissues of leaves, which causes necrosis and collapse of the palisade and spongy parenchyma tissues.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} causes for the {{increasing}} problem of <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> in agriculture, greenhouse nurseries, and personal lawns, {{but there are}} no systemic nematicides available to growers due to the hazards they pose to people handling the plants. Advancements in plant breeding have enabled nurseries to produce more vegetative plants, which may cause infection of new plants via propagation from infected plants. Plants are also moved long distance to growers across the country and internationally, thus nematodes can easily spread to new areas where infection was previously not a problem.|$|R
40|$|Foliar nematodes, plant-parasitic {{representatives of}} the genus Aphelenchoides, {{constitute}} a minority in a group dominated by fungivorous species. Distinction between (mostly harmless) fungal feeding Aphelenchoides species and high impact plant parasites such as A. besseyi, A. fragariae, A. ritzemabosi, and A. subtenuis is severely hampered by the scarcity of informative morphological characters, {{some of which are}} only observable in specific developmental stages. Poor description of a number of non plant-parasitic Aphelenchoides species further complicates identification. Based on (nearly) full-length small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) sequences (˜ 1, 700 bp), a phylogenetic tree was generated, and the four target species appeared as distinct, well-supported groups. Notably, this genus does not constitute a monophyletic group: A. besseyi and A. ritzemabosi cluster together, and they are phylogenetically isolated from A. fragariae, A. subtenuis and other, most fungivorous species. A phylum-wide SSU rDNA framework was used to identify species-specific DNA motifs. For the molecular detection of four plant-parasitic Aphelenchoides species, PCR primers were developed with high, identical annealing temperatures (63 °C). Within the molecular framework presented here, these primers can be used for the rapid screening of plant material and soil for the presence of one or multiple <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> specie...|$|E
40|$|Population {{dynamics}} of Aphelenchoides fragariae were assessed over three growing seasons and during overwintering for naturally-infected, container-grown lantana (Latana camara) plants in a North Carolina nursery. During the growing season, the <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> population in symptomatic leaves peaked in July each year then remained above 100 nematodes/g fresh weight into late summer. Foliar nematodes were also detected in asymptomatic and abscised leaves. Results suggest that leaves infected with foliar nematodes first develop symptoms at populations of about 10 nematodes/g. Foliar nematodes were detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic plant leaves and in abscised leaves during overwintering in a polyhouse, {{but the number}} of infected plants was low. A steep disease gradient was found for infection of lantana plants by A. fragariae on a nursery pad with sprinkler irrigation. When the canopies of initially healthy plants were touching the canopies of an infected plants, 100 % of the plants became infected within 11 wk, but only 5 to 10 % became infected at a canopy distance of 30 cm. Overwintering of A. fragariae in infected plants and a steep disease gradient during the growing season suggests strict sanitation and an increase in plant spacing are needed to mitigate losses from this nematode pest...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} hot water {{treatments}} on a California population of the <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode,</b> Aphelenchoides fragariae, and on five strawberry cuttivars ('Chandler', 'Douglas', 'Fern', 'Pajaro', and 'Selva') were assessed in laboratory and greenhouse tests. Nematodes extracted from fern leaves were placed in water maintained at 44. 4, 46. 1, 47. 7, or 49. 4 C for different time periods. Exposure periods of 15, 5, 4, and 2 minutes were required to produce 100 % mortality at 44. 4, 46. 1, 47. 7, and 49. 4 C, respectively. In a water bath, 4 minutes were required for strawberry crowns initially at 25 C to equilibrate with temperatures ranging from 44. 4 - 54. 4 C. The maximum exposure periods that did not significantly reduce subsequent plant growth and flowering were 30, 15, and 10 minutes, at 44. 4, 46. 1, and 47. 7 C, respectively. Survival of Selva was lower (P = 0. 05) than for the other cultivars. Treatment at 49. 4 C for 5 minutes significantly reduced plant growth and flowering of all cultivars. The minimum-maximum exposure periods that killed A. fragariae without damaging the cultivars tested were 20 - 30 minutes at 44. 4 C, 10 - 15 at 46. 1 C, or 8 - 10 at 47. 7 C...|$|E
25|$|Plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} {{include several}} groups causing severe crop losses. The most common genera are Aphelenchoides (<b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes),</b> Ditylenchus, Globodera (potato cyst nematodes), Heterodera (soybean cyst nematodes), Longidorus, Meloidogyne (root-knot nematodes), Nacobbus, Pratylenchus (lesion nematodes), Trichodorus and Xiphinema (dagger nematodes). Several phytoparasitic nematode species cause histological damages to roots, including {{the formation of}} visible galls (e.g. by root-knot nematodes), which are useful characters for their diagnostic in the field. Some nematode species transmit plant viruses through their feeding activity on roots. One of them is Xiphinema index, vector of grapevine fanleaf virus, an important disease of grapes, another one is Xiphinema diversicaudatum, vector of arabis mosaic virus.|$|R
5000|$|Strawberry <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> are {{difficult}} to manage due to their robust life cycle. While dormant, they are quite difficult to kill, and they remain viable in dry debris {{for more than one}} year. Adult nematodes can survive desiccation and lie dormant for several years. Eggs can stay dormant until survival conditions are optimal for growth. Once eggs or nematodes are present in the soil, they are nearly impossible to eradicate because they can move laterally in the soil to escape non-optimal conditions. They are found in most foliar tissue, including the leaves, stems, buds, and crowns, making it difficult to control the disease on the plant itself once it has been infected [...]|$|R
40|$|Plants are {{important}} mediators of interactions between aboveground (AG) and belowground (BG) pathogens, arthropod herbivores, and nematodes (phytophages). We highlight recent progress {{in our understanding}} of within and cross-compartment plant responses to these groups of phytophages in terms of altered resource dynamics and defense signaling and activation. We review studies documenting the outcome of cross-compartment interactions between these phytophage groups and show patterns of cross-compartment facilitation as well as cross-compartment induced resistance. Studies involving soilborne pathogens and <b>foliar</b> <b>nematodes</b> are scant. We further highlight the important role of defense signaling loops between shoots and roots to activate a full resistance complement. Moreover, manipulation of such loops by phytophages affects systemic interactions with other plant feeders. Finally, cross-compartment–induced changes in root defenses and root exudates extend systemic defense loops into the rhizosphere, enhancing or reducing recruitment of microbes that induce systemic resistance but also affecting interactions with root-feeding phytophages...|$|R
30|$|On strawberry, A. fragariae causes malformations of {{the shoot}} such as {{twisting}} and puckering of leaves, discolored areas {{with a hard}} and rough surface, undersized leaves with crinkled edges, reddening of petioles, short internodes of runners, reduced flower trusses with {{only one or two}} flowers, and death of the crown bud (CABI 2018). Ectoparasitic feeding on folded crown and runner buds causes small dry, brown feeding areas which can be seen on expanded leaves usually near the midrib; occasionally, the nematodes are found in strawberry fruit pulp (Tacconi 1972). Endoparasitic feeding within leaf tissue produces typical leaf-blotch symptoms. The strawberry disease may be due wholly or partly to A. fragariae; sometimes, these symptoms could be due to other nematodes (A. ritzemabosi or Ditylenchus dipsaci) or caused by bacteria or frost (CABI 2018). These nematodes cause also distortion of the strawberry leaves. Damage by these nematodes is most noticeable on newly formed leaves soon after; growth is initiated in the spring (spring dwarf). However, symptoms may also become evident in the fall. Veins often act as barriers to <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> movement, so symptoms are often interveinal appearing as grayish spots that may turn brown. Leaves are often distorted. Eventually, foliar nematodes are potentially destructive pathogens of strawberry. Experiments in Germany demonstrated Aphelenchoides sp. could reduce yields up to 65 % (Warner 2018).|$|E
40|$|Nematode {{infestation}} {{in forest}} trees {{has been a}} neglected area of research apparently due to non appearance of visible symptoms and difficulty of accessibility to the sampling sites for damage assessment. High organic content, adequate moisture and moderate temperature of forest soils with diversified flora represent conducive condition for nematode survival in forest habitats. Limited investigations so far conducted have revealed infestation of important forest trees such as acacia, sal, teak, pine and sandal wood with Helicotylenchus, Tylenchorhynchus, Hemicriconemoides, Macroposthonia, Pratylenchus, Meloidogyne, Xiphinema, Trichodorus and Paratrichodorus etc. Nematode damage to forest trees usually appears as a slow decline of growth which gradually gets aggravated leading to tree death within 5 to 10 years. However, some nematodes such as pine wilt nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) and <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> (Subanguina chilensis) cause wilting, drying and defoliation of a branch or the entire tree within a year. The legal or illegal export/import of unprocessed timber and wood in Asia especially from risk prone countries such as China, Nepal and Bhutan has posed a serious quarantine risk of spread of this nematode in to India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and other countries having favorable climate for the nematode and its insect vector.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{pathogenicity}} and overwintering {{survival of the}} <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode,</b> Aphelenchoides fragariae, infecting Hosta spp. Nematodes applied to either lower or upper sides of noninjured and injured hosta leaves were able to infect and produce typical symptoms on nine cultivars. Leaves of only four cultivars (Borschi, Fragrant Blue, Patomic Pride, and Olive Bailey Langdon) showed no symptoms of nematode infection. The nematodes overwintered as juveniles and adults in soil, dry leaves, and dormant buds, but not in roots. Nematode winter survival was higher in dormant buds and soil from the polyhouse than in an open home garden. Of the nematodes found in the dormant buds, 35 % to 79 % were located between the first two outside layers of the buds. The nematodes tolerated 8 hr exposure to 40 °C and − 80 °C in leaf tissues. Relative humidity influenced nematode migration from soil to leaves. The presence of nematodes only on the outer surface of foliage (leaves and petioles) confirmed the migration of A. fragariae {{on the surface of}} the plants. Of the total number of nematodes found on the foliage, 25 % to 46 % and 66 % to 77 % were alive at 90 % and 100 % relative humidity, respectively, suggesting that high moisture is required for the survival and upward movement of nematodes. We conclude that A. fragariae can overwinter in soil, infected dry leaves, and dormant buds and migrate in films of water on the outer surface of the plant during spring to leaves to initiate infection...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{abamectin}} B 1, diazinon, and methiocarb insecticides on Aphelenchoides fragariae and Ditylenchus dipsaci in Lamium maculatum, Phlox subulata, Rhododendron indicum, and Begonia × tuberhybrida were determined {{in a series}} of greenhouse experiments. Abamectin at 0. 005 or 0. 011 g a. i. /liter (0. 3 or 0. 6 ml/liter Avid 0. 15 EC), diazinon at 0. 62 or 1. 87 g a. i. /liter (2. 6 or 7. 8 ml/liter KnoxOut GH), or methiocarb at 3. 5 g a. i. /liter (4. 7 g/liter Mesurol) were applied in two to six weekly or biweekly applications to foliage until runoff. Diazinon and abamectin reduced both A. fragariae and D. dipsaci populations in Lamium and Phlox, especially after repeated applications. Diazinon was generally more effective than abamectin. While methiocarb reduced A. fragariae densities in Lamium, it was not as efficacious as diazinon or abamectin. Nematode populations varied widely between host plant species and over time. Management of high nematode populations was difficult, and none of the materials tested was effective against A. fragariae in azalea or begonia.

40|$|Effectiveness of a {{hot water}} drench for the control of Aphelenchoides fragariae infesting hosta (Hosta sp.) and ferns (Matteuccia pensylvanica) was studied. Drenching with hot water at 70 °C and 90 °C in October reduced (P < 0. 05) A. fragariae in the soil {{but not in the}} leaves {{relative}} to the control (25 °C) 300 days after treatment (DAT). Plants drenched with 90 °C water had lower numbers of nematode-infected leaves per plant than those treated with 25 °C and 70 °C water (P < 0. 05). Hot water treatments had no adverse effect on the growth parameters of hosta. Boiling water (100 °C) applied once a month for 3 consecutive months (April, May, June) consistently reduced the number of infected leaves and the severity of infection relative to the control 150 DAT in hosta but not in ferns (P < 0. 05). Boiling water (100 °C) caused a 67 % reduction in A. fragariae population in hosta leaves, 50 % in fern fronds, and 61 % to 98 % in the soil over the control 150 DAT. A boiling water drench had no effect on the fern growth but caused 49 % and 22 % reduction in the number and size of hosta leaves, respectively, over the control in 2002.

40|$|The {{chrysanthemum}} <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> (CFN), Aphelenchoides ritzemabosi, is a plant parasitic nematode that attacks many plants. In this study, a transcriptomes of mixed-stage {{population of}} CFN was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. 68. 10 million Illumina high quality paired end reads were obtained which generated 26, 817 transcripts {{with a mean}} length of 1, 032 bp and an N 50 of 1, 672 bp, of which 16, 467 transcripts were annotated against six databases. In total, 20, 311 coding region sequences (CDS), 495 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 8, 353 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were predicted, respectively. The CFN with the most shared sequences was B. xylophilus with 16, 846 (62. 82 %) common transcripts and 10, 543 (39. 31 %) CFN transcripts matched sequences of all of four plant parasitic nematodes compared. A total of 111 CFN transcripts were predicted as homologues of 7 types of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) with plant/fungal cell wall-degrading activities, fewer transcripts were predicted as homologues of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes than fungal cell wall-degrading enzymes. The phylogenetic analysis of GH 5, GH 16, GH 43 and GH 45 proteins between CFN and other organisms showed CFN and other nematodes have a closer phylogenetic relationship. In the CFN transcriptome, sixteen types of genes orthologues with seven classes of protein families involved in the RNAi pathway in C. elegans were predicted.

40|$|Nematodes are {{probably}} the most abundant Metazoans on our planet. They are present in densities of millions of individuals per square meter in soil and sediments. However, these inconspicuous animals are hardly known to the general public as most individuals are colorless and smaller than 1 mm. If people are aware of nematodes, it is because of the damage they inflict on humans and animals such as elephantiasis (Wucheria bancrofti) and ascariasis (in humans Ascaris lubricoides; in pigs Ascaris suum), or on plants such as potato (potato cyst nematode) and tomato (root-knot nematodes). To a far lesser extent it is known that majority of nematodes are key players in the soil food web, and as such they can be used as indicators for the biological condition of the environment they live in. This PhD thesis focuses on terrestrial nematodes belonging to four orders: Dorylaimida, Mononchida, Aphelenchida and Tylenchida, which represent animals of ecological and economical relevance. Members of families belonging to the first two are highly sensitive to the environmental disturbances, and are informative as biological indicators. The order Aphelenchida harbors numerous facultative plant-parasitic species. In the absence of a host plant, most of them are able to feed on fungi as an alternative food source. This is in contrast to the distal representatives of the order Tylenchida that are invariably obligate parasites of higher plants. Stress-sensitive nematode orders Dorylaimida and Mononchida have a high potential for soil health assessment. The SSU rDNA-based analysis of these two orders resulted in two highly distinct phylogenies. Relationships among the Mononchida, an order dominated by carnivorous nematodes, were to some extent in accordance with the classical nematode systematics. It is noted that the families Mylonchulidae, Mononchidae and Anatonchidae are not monophyletic. Nevertheless, it was possible to design family-specific primers for rDNA-based molecular detection. On the contrary, resolution of the SSU rDNA tree of the Dorylaimida was extremely poor, except for the plant-parasitic family Longidoridae and the mainly predaceous family Nygolaimidae. Analysis of a 1, 000 bp fragment of the 5 ’ region of large subunit (LSU) rDNA resulted in an improved resolution. Twelve subclades were distinguished and this topology was only in slight agreement with the classical systematics of the suborder Dorylaimina. The poor resolution generated by SSU rDNA sequence analysis within this species-rich suborder is remarkable; it has not been observed in any other suborder in the phylum Nematoda. Possibly, Dorylaimina diversification is the result of rapid speciation events. A plant-parasitic lifestyle apparently accelerates the rate of change of rDNA genes. This was not only true for the obligate plant-parasitic Longidoridae, but also for the facultative plant-parasitic Aphelenchoididae. Most members of the genus Aphelenchoides are fungivores, but a few of them feed on higher plants as well. As they feed on aboveground parts of higher plants they are usually called ‘foliar nematodes’. Species such as Aphelenchoides besseyi, A. fragariae and A. ritzemabosi parasitize on ornamental plants in greenhouses and nurseries, and some field crops such as rice or strawberry. Moreover, A. subtenuis causes serious damage infecting flower bulbs. Identification of <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> species, and the distinction between plant- parasitic species and other, mostly harmless, fungal feeding representatives of the genus Aphelenchoides is hampered by the scarcity of informative morphological characters and lack of well-established systematics. Based on nearly full-length SSU rDNA sequences, a phylogenetic tree was generated, where the four target species appeared as distinct, well-supported, monophyletic groups. The presence of species-specific DNA motifs made it possible to design PCR primers for the detection and quantification of the <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> species in complex DNA backgrounds such as plant material and soil samples. The order Tylenchida is dominated by obligatory plant-parasitic nematode taxa and includes economically high-impact species such as the lesion (Pratylenchus spp.), root-knot (Meloidgyne spp.) and cyst (Heterodera, Globodera) nematodes. The sequence diversification of cellulases, a non-neutral, plant pathogenicity-related genes, was investigated. Unlike by far most other animals, nematodes do not depend on endosymbionts for the production of cell wall-degrading enzymes. Among a repertoire of these proteins, glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GHF 5) cellulases are best studied. It is hypothesized that they were acquired by one or multiple horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. Moreover, the nature of the donor - hypothesized to be a plant-parasitic soil bacterium - and the recipient, possibly a bacterivorous nematode is fully unclear. Using a range of primers, partial GHF 5 cellulase sequences spanning the core catalytic domain were amplified and sequenced from basal Meloidogyne, and a range of Pratylenchus and Hirschmanniella species. Phylogenetic analysis of more than 100 partial GHF 5 cellulase sequences resulted in a division of the enzymes’ catalytic domains into three types (A, B, C). Type B was numerically dominant, and notably the P. thornei cellulase was positioned sister to all type B root-knot nematode cellulases. Moreover, the overall topology of the catalytic domain B-type showed remarkable resemblance with trees based on rDNA sequences. This analysis suggests that most likely the cellulases were passed on by ancestors of a family nowadays known as the Pratylenchidae, and root-knot and cyst nematodes did not acquire these genes directly by lateral genes transfer. To further elucidate the relationship between a part of the family Pratylenchidae (namely the subfamilies Pratylenchinae and Hirschmanniellinae) and the Meloidogynidae, two neutral (= pathogenicity-unrelated) genes were taken into consideration: SSU rDNA and a part of the largest subunit of the RNA polymerase II gene (rpb 1). Both morphological and molecular data seem to point at root-knot nematodes being a subclade branching from the migratory endoparasites Pratylenchidae. Extension of the SSU rDNA data set - more sequences from a broader range of species – did not result in a well- resolved relationship between the Pratylenchidae and the Meloidogynidae. A switch to another gene that was previously exploited to investigate relationships within the genus Meloidogyne, a fragment of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II sequences, did not provide us with more robust information about the evolutionary transition between lesion and root-knot nematodes. The genus Pratylenchus comprises more than 100 species. It is referred to as a stenomorphic genus since only a few subtle characteristics are used for species identification. In the current study, only a subset of these species was taken to consideration; predominantly species that are relatively well-characterized as pathogens in agro-ecosystems. It was postulated that the Pratylenchus species closest to the basal root-knot nematodes should be sought among the less well-known and agronomically less relevant lesion nematode species...|$|E
40|$|Published data {{revealed}} that Tagetes spp. suppress polyphagous endoparasitic root nematodes, {{that the effect}} varies, perhaps between Tagetes spp. and cultivars, certainly between nematode genera and perhaps between species and strains. The effect is sometimes striking but the picture in general is far from complete and not clear. This situation determined the three objectives of our investigation: occurrence and significance of Tagetes effect, interpretation, and possibilities of application in agriculture. For most of the trials plants were cultivated under controlled and field conditions, and their growth evaluated; nematode populations were collected, cultivated, maintained and transferred; nematodes in soil and plant tissues were counted and results were analysed statistically. Several special techniques were used occasionally as indicated in the relevant sections. The occurrence and significance of special Tagetes effects on plant nematode population were determined with species of Pratylenchus, Meloidogyne, Tylenchorhynchus, Rotylenchus and Helicotylenchus, other ectoparasitic nematodes, Ditylenchus and Aphelenchoides. Pratylenchus spp. were markedly suppressed by Tagetes spp. in tube cultures (Tables 1 - 5) and in field trials (Tables 6 and 7, Figs 1 and 2). This was true for P. penetrans, P. crenatus, P. neglectus and probably P. thornei. Soil type may be of influence on the result. There were great differences in effectiveness between Tagetes spp. and cultivars. The effectiveness against Pratylenchus spp. decreases in the order T. patula, T. erecta, T. minuta, with T. patula markedly better. T. patula Harmony suppresses field populations of Pratylenchus spp. {{in a few months}} and fallow requires a few years to reach a comparable low final density of these nematodes. Density never fell to zero, probably because of limited reproduction on weeds and limited reproduction on Tagetes itself if it is grown for a full season. There was no evidence that resistance of Tagetes was broken or that nematode strains resistant to Tagetes effects arose even after 7 - 10 successive crops of T. patula. Biennial rotations of T. patula and good hosts kept Pratylenchus spp. at a low density, except the population of P. thornei on heavy soil which fluctuated at a rather high level (Fig. 2). Tagetes spp. were generally as effective or better than fallow in suppressing Meloidogyne spp. in tube cultures (Tables 8 - 12), although with some notable exceptions. Meloidogyne larvae were less persistent than Pratylenchus larvae in fallow soil. T. patula severely suppressed M. hapla, M. incognita, M. arenaria and M. javanica. T. erecta was also suppressive but slightly more syncytia formed in all four Meloidogyne spp.; M. hapla reproduced and maintained a small population on T. erecta. T. minuta differed markedly from the earlier species in that it suppressed M. hapla and M. incognita completely and M. javanica almost completely, whereas M. arenaria could breed on this plant and reach considerable densities in both roots and soil. Any general effect by Tagetes on Meloidogyne is therefore complicated by certain exceptions which may account for conflicting published results. Tube and field trials showed that Tylenchorhynchus spp. were suppressed by T. patula in different soils (Table 7), that Tyl. dubius was suppressed better and more rapidly by T. patula than by fallow (Fig. 3 A, B; literature), and that T. erecta and T. minuta were about as effective as T. patula against Tyl. dubius (Table 6). Tyl. dubius was suppressed slightly less effectively and less rapidly than Pratylenchus spp. in the same soil by T. patulaThe data on R. robustus supports the view that Tagetes spp., at any rate T. patula Golden Harmony and Harmony, maintains a rather high density. Unexplained peaks of the density under Tagetes and fallow make it difficult to indicate any Tagetes effect at all; factors other than the presence of higher plants may govern the population dynamics of this species. The genera Hemicycliophora, Paratylenchus and Trichodorus are not generally suppressed by Tagetes cultivars. Specific host-nematode relationships may vary as widely {{as is the case with}} these nematodes on other plants, and no special Tagetes effect can be demonstrated against these ectoparasites. Some species breed profusely on certain Tagetes spp. but are not affected by other Tagetes spp. The stem nematode D. dipsaci may reproduce to a limited extent and cause typical symptoms in T. patula and T. erecta, but not in T. minuta. The same is true for the <b>foliar</b> <b>nematode</b> A. ritzemabosi (Plate 1 A and B). The data leave no doubt that certain Tagetes spp. suppress certain species of plant nematodes unusually strongly. The Tagetes effect manifested itself most clearly with Pratylenchus spp., Meloidogyne spp. and Tyl. dubius, but was evidently not present or not marked against R. robustus and several other ectoparasitic genera, nor against D. dipsaci and A. ritzemabosi. The results alone or combined with published data do not fully explain the mechanism. For a further analysis the exoradicular effects, the effects on the surface of the plant or during penetration, and the endoradicular effects were subsequently studied. Exoradicular effects may contribute to, but not explain the larger part of the Tagetes effect. As with the good host red clover, P. penetrans is not particularly attracted nor deterred by growing roots of T. patula on agar plates, but there was some aggregation around the roots in soil (Table 14), though it concerned only part of the soil population (Fig. 5). Percolates from pots of T. patula, red clover, apple or without a plant did not differ in effect on activity or mortality of P. penetrans in vitro. Survival of P. penetrans in water cultures of T. patula and T. minuta was only slightly less than in water culture of apple, control solution or distilled water, and the effect was at any rate slight and unspecific (Table 15). Tagetes soil was distinctly nematicidal for some days after the roots have been removed. This effect, however, was not very strong and was not specific for Tagetes, because red clover was equally and apple even more effective than T. patula and T. minuta (Table 16). Damage or kill of nematodes outside the root may therefore play a role, but it is apparently not the essential part of the Tagetes effect. Root systems of three different Tagetes spp. were penetrated by M. hapla larvae as much as root systems of a suitable host. The same holds for penetration by P. penetrans, except perhaps for T. patula which fewer nematodes entered than other Tagetes spp. or good hosts in most trials (Table 17). As a rule only a few of the larvae around the roots succeed in penetrating. Endoradicular influences comprise nematode survival and development, nematicidal effects and histological reactions in Tagetes tissues. M. hapla larvae enter Tagetes spp. to the same amount as tomato within a week. Only a few of the larvae around the roots succeed, although potential sites for penetration are present in excess. The unsuccessful nematodes outside the root decrease rapidly in number, more rapidly in the presence of growing plants than in fallow soil, which may be important for the population dynamics of nematodes in general. M. hapla survives for at least 4 weeks within roots of Tagetes spp., but development beyond the infective second larval stage is hardly noticeable in T. patula and T. minuta, whereas only a few larvae develop and reach adulthood in T. erecta (Table 18). The picture is similar with P. penetrans. The percentage penetration is generally low in all plants, but significantly lower in T. patula than in T. erecta, T. minuta or red clover (Table 19, Fig. 6). T. patula may resist penetration by this nematode The main difference between a suitable host such as red clover, and T. patula is that nematodes reproduce in the first plant and decline or remain few in T. patula. In T. minuta the nematodes survive and may even develop and multiply, though at slower rate than in red clover (Figs. 6, 7 and 8). T. patula, T. minuta and red clover represent degrees of host suitability from almost zero through low to very high (Fig. 7, Table 20). The equilibrium density under T. patula is very low but not zero because some reproduction occurs when the plants have grown a long while. The percentage males among the sexually differentiated nematodes is not higher in the very resistant T. patula and does not increase with ageing of host plants, as has often been published. T. patula allows very little escape or survival of P. penetrans once the nematodes have entered the roots, whereas the population in T. minuta roots does escape and may be infective as in suitable hosts (Tables 21 and 22). Root extracts of Tagetes spp., contrary to root exudates, contain a nematicidal principle which manifests itself against P. penetrans in vitro from the third day on (Fig. 9 A, B, C). Extract of T. patula is more effective than extract of T. minuta and the latter is more effective than extract of potato or control solutions. Fractioning of root extracts of T. patula over a column of Sephadex G- 75 indicate high mortality in a later fraction. No attempt was made to identify the active principle(s) in this fraction. This effect in vitro may be related to the Tagetes effect on nematodes in soil. It may be caused by the nematicides such as the thiophenes isolated from Tagetes roots by Uhlenbroek & Bijloo (1958, 1959). There was some nematode kill in potato root extract too, distinctly less than in Tagetes extract but distinctly higher than in the control solutions. This indicates the presence of a weak nematicidal effect in potato root extract and may support the indication recorded earlier that plants establish or induce in general an "antinemic potential" by means of their exudates or other substances in water or soil. The Tagetes effects are much stronger and evidently differ from it. Histological reactions as part of the endoradicular influences of Tagetes on penetrated nematodes are not conspicuous. Tagetes cultures, unlike most other plants, normally grow well and have well-developed root systems without discoloration in soils with dense populations of Meloidogyne and Pratylenchus spp. Despite this healthy appearance Tagetes roots may show barely visible histological reactions after such nematode infestations. M. hapla larvae penetrate the root apex of T. patula in much the same way as that of tomato. They do not normally develop nor cause marked necrosis or swelling in the roots of T. patula. Occasionally, however, small syncytia or sometimes even small galls occur associated with a developing larva. Unlike tomato, T. patula develops few and very small syncytia and galls and only slowly, and the nematode often dies and syncytia often abort in T. patula. P. penetrans penetrates young roots of T. patula, T. minuta and red clover at random sites on their surface except at the apex and causes cortical lesions in all three plants. The lesions in T. patula are small, dark and necrotic but do not abort from surrounding cortex tissue; they normally harbour only 1 - 3 nematodes, often dead, dying or twisted. In T. minuta the lesions appear slower, are larger and less dark than in T. patula; the number of nematodes per lesion may be up to 38 and often occur outside lesions. Red clover lesions appear still slower, are usually larger and contain a large breeding population. Histological reactions, therefore, largely coincide with nematode development. The endoradicular effects are apparently instrumental in the nematode suppression by Tagetes spp. They are incorporated in or super-imposed upon the common plant-nematode relationships which are different for each association and may therefore influence the result. It is suggested that the special nematicidal principle in Tagetes is made up of more components, of which thiophenes recorded up to now from T. erecta, and that the components or their relative weights vary between Tagetes spp. Some other Compositae related closely to Tagetes spp. were also found to be effective against P. penetrans and also contained the same thiophenes as found in Tagetes or hitherto unidentified active principles. T. patula is probably superior to other Tagetes spp. in its effect against P. penetrans because necrosis appears earlier and more acutely. This may be a consequence of more rapid intoxication of the nematodes, as in root extracts. Ectoparasitic cortex feeders of the genus Tylenchorynchus are affected less and root-vessel feeders are evidently not influenced by the nematicidal principles in Tagetes roots, probably because they do not undergo the same type or degree of contact with the Tagetes tissue. The Tagetes effect, therefore, seems to be generally strong for endoparasitic root nematodes or cortical feeders, but varies even within this group with the different plant-nematode associations. The agricultural value of Tagetes as a source of organic matter, stains, therapeutics, or other chemicals, and as ornamentals is limited and has up to now supported only small-scale cultivation. The use of Tagetes crops for suppression of plant nematodes and the marked growth improvement obtained in main crops, is handicapped by the lack of value of the crop. Furthermore Tagetes spp. and cultivars are limited in their agricultural applicability. Nematode suppression is the primary determinant of their practical value so that T. patula particularly the cultivars Golden Harmony or Harmony are recommended. They are more effective against Pratylenchus and at least as effective against Meloidogyne populations, and appear to be as good or better than other Tagetes cultivars for growing and handling as a crop. Seed characteristics, rapid development as an autumn crop and winter-hardiness could all be improved, whereas a search for profitable use of the crop is desirable. Breeding of Tagetes spp. have resulted in a great assortment of ornamentals, and prospects seem good for the plant breeder of combining strong nematicidal effect with useful agricultural properties. The desired characters will depend on the type of agriculture. Tagetes grown as a full-season crop has been found effective by several workers and may cause striking growth and yield increments, it may find use in areas where valuable main crops are grown and where land rent is low, as in some tropical and subtropical countries. Tagetes as a spring crop does not seem promising in temperate climates due to its slow seedling growth. Even when sown densely, 10 cm apart on 15 May, minimum densities of Pratylenchus could be achieved only after about 2 months; these densities appear later when greater plant distances are taken (Fig. 10). Tagetes grown as an autumn crop has better possibilities. The degree of development of autumn Tagetes is evidently critical for its effect, and this varies strongly from year to year. Autumn Tagetes may be very effective in nematode suppression as well as in yield increase of main plants in certain years (Tables 23, 24 and 25), but the earliest sowing dates after an early pea crop varied in the period 1961 - 1968 from 6 July to 14 August, and a good development was obtained in only 4 out of 8 years (Table 6). Continuous autumn Tagetes, however, may be effective despite failure in certain years. Autumn Tagetes should be sown not later than the end of July and 10 rather than 25 cm apart is advisable. Simultaneous culture of Tagetes with a main crop appeared to be effective around and between trees and woody ornamentals and may be promising in more cases, especially since sowing at 60 cm apart completely suppressed nematodes, though slower than when closer sown. Sowing between rows is practized incidentally (Plate IIC and D). Sowing under cereals and other high crops to give the crop a quicker start after harvesting the main crop has not so far been promising, because only few weak plants survived. Autumn application after a main crop and application between rows of a main crop may be promising under certain conditions. The technical possibilities increase when climatic conditions allow a better growth in the autumn or when agricultural systems allow a full-season crop. Yield of main crops after Tagetes may be increased by nematological or other growth factors or both. Tagetes promoted growth of apple seedlings in soil with P. penetrans to 167 % of fallow infested soil, though Tagetes decreased growth in uninfested soil; allowance for the nitrogen used by Tagetes would lead to a higher growth promotion in infested soil (Table 27). The decline in nematode population continued markedly after the growth of Tagetes had been disrupted by removal of the tops. Direct mulch with a natural dosage of Tagetes roots suppresses P. penetrans much better than other mulches or fallow. It is probable that there is a significant aftereffect also under field conditions. Leaf mulches were also effective in suppressing P. penetrans, but Tagetes leaves were less effective than apple and no specific nematicidal effect of Tagetes leaves could be demonstrated. The results in uninfested soil show that cultivation of Tagetes and removal of tops decreases soil fertility in unfertilized soil (Table 27). The addition of root or leaf mulch generally increases soil fertility and therefore growth of test plants (Tables 30, 31, 32). These effects, however, are unspecific, and would have been smaller in fertilized soils, uninfested or infested. The dominance of nematicidal over non- nematicidal effects of Tagetes is clear for the growth of apple seedlings in soil infested with P. penetrans. The relative weight of these factors may of course be different in other plant nematode relationships. Our results, therefore, confirm or substantiate the marked Tagetes effect, but also the variation between plant-nematode relationships. The Tagetes effect is exceptional in nature, though not completely restricted to the genus Tagetes because it does occur in some genera ofthe Heleniae. The effect appears to be centred inside the roots and is evidently correlated with the presence in these plants of strongly nematicidal thiophenes, which are rare elsewhere in nature. The fact that it is conspicuous against endoparasitic polyphagous root nematodes and not against epidermal and vessel feeders is understandable from the difference in parasitic way of life. Histopathological reactions to nematode invasion vary between Tagetes spp. This may explain the stronger effect of T. patula on P. penetrans than of other Tagetes spp. The concept of nematode intoxication by nematicidal thiophenes and histopathological resistance phenomena may be interrelated and are not necessarily contradictory. Use of Tagetes spp. often markedly increases yield of main crops, but is limited by type of agriculture. In temperate regions Tagetes grown simultaneously with the main crop or grown in the autumn after the main crop is considered promising. Slow seedling growth, high light requirement and frost susceptibility of available cultivars are disadvantages. Tagetes has better prospects in tropical and subtropical agriculture...|$|E
