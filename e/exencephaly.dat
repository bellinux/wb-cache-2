25|$|Programmed {{cell death}} {{can be reduced}} or {{eliminated}} in the developing nervous system by the targeted deletion of pro-apoptotic genes or by the overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes. The absence or reduction of PCD can cause serious anatomical malformations but can also result in minimal consequences depending on the gene targeted, neuronal population, and stage of development. Excess progenitor cell proliferation that leads to gross brain abnormalities is often lethal, as seen in caspase-3 or caspase-9 knockout mice which develop <b>exencephaly</b> in the forebrain. The brainstem, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia of these mice develop normally, however, suggesting that the involvement of caspases in PCD during development depends on the brain region and cell type. Knockout or inhibition of apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), also results in malformations and increased embryonic lethality. Manipulation of apoptosis regulator proteins Bcl-2 and Bax (overexpression of Bcl-2 or deletion of Bax) produces {{an increase in the}} number of neurons in certain regions of the nervous system such as the retina, trigeminal nucleus, cerebellum, and spinal cord. However, PCD of neurons due to Bax deletion or Bcl-2 overexpression does not result in prominent morphological or behavioral abnormalities in mice. For example, mice overexpressing Bcl-2 have generally normal motor skills and vision and only show impairment in complex behaviors such as learning and anxiety. The normal behavioral phenotypes of these mice suggest that an adaptive mechanism may be involved to compensate for the excess neurons.|$|E

50|$|A study {{examining}} {{the consequences of}} several different mutations of the Slc40a1 mouse gene suggested that several serious neural tube and patterning defects were produced as a result, including spina bifida, <b>exencephaly,</b> and forebrain truncations, among others. Given the findings of studies to date, {{there appears to be}} significant evidence that intact iron transport mechanisms are critical to normal neural tube closure. Furthermore, other experiments have suggested that Fpn1 product and activity is required along the entire anterior-posterior axis of the animal to ensure proper closure of the neural tube.|$|E

In those animals that have survived gestation, developmental abnormalities have been observed, particularly in rodents whose mothers were exposed to endrin early in pregnancy. In hamsters, {{the number of cases}} of fused ribs, cleft palate, open eyes, webbed feet, and meningoencephaloceles have increased. Along with open eyes and cleft palate, mice have developed with fused ribs and <b>exencephaly.</b> Skeletal abnormalities in rodents have also been reported.|$|E

These mice do exhibit the phenotype of premature mortality, decreased fertility in female mice, reduction in body weight and impairment in mammary gland development. It also acted to decrease serum estrogen levels and caused reduced mammary epithelial cell proliferation {{in the early stages of}} puberty. These Jarid1b−/− mice seem to be greatly affected in many regulators of the development of mammy development such as FOXA1 and estrogen receptor α. However, others have shown that a Jarid1B knockout embryos usually have neonatal lethality due to the failure of their respiratory system. Knockout embryos have also been seen to have several different neural defects including: disorganized cranial nerves, increased incidences of <b>exencephaly,</b> and defects in eye development.|$|E
50|$|Sp8 mediates limb {{outgrowth}} {{during early}} development. Sp8 deletion in mice resulted in severe <b>exencephaly.</b> Sp8 is a zinc-finger transcription factor. The structural difference between Sp8 and Sp9 {{is only one}} amino acid. These transcription factors are Apical Ectodermal Ridge (AER) specific in limb development. The Apical Ectodermal Ridge signaling is important for specification of distal limb structures. Sp8 and Sp9 mediate Fgf10 signaling, which in turn regulates Fgf8 expression (Fgf10--->Fgf8). Fgf8 is essential for normal limb development, and without the presence of Fgf8 in early development, {{there would be a}} decreased length of the limb bud and possible failure of the limb tissue develop. Both Sp8 and Sp9 have been found in vertebrates. Although, so far only Sp8 has been proven to be present in invertebrates too. Under lab conditions, Sp8 replaced btd in Drosophila, showing that Sp8 and btd both have similar functions in limb development in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Gene knockdown in zebrafish displayed that Fgf8 expression is necessary for appendage development.|$|E

As a result of new genetic research, some of these are, in fact, highly related in their root cause despite the widely varying set of medical symptoms that are clinically visible in the disorders. <b>Exencephaly</b> is one such disease that has recently been identified {{as part of an}} emerging class of diseases called cilopathies. The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell, organelles which are present in many cellular types throughout the human body.

30|$|Some authors {{consider}} <b>exencephaly</b> {{an early}} stage of anencephaly, because the unprotected anomalous brain tissue located outside the cranial vault will eventually take on the appearance of anencephaly after being destroyed by the trauma induced by constant collision against the walls of the uterus [11]. In both <b>exencephaly</b> and anencephaly, the osseous structures above the orbits are absent. The base of the skull, the facial structures, and the orbits are present and are usually normal.|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the early sequential morphogenetic progress of <b>exencephaly</b> and myeloschisis, rat embryos whose mothers {{had been treated}} with hypervitaminosis A were studied at 1 -day interval from gestation day 10. 5 to 15. 5. In exposed animals sequential change was found in both <b>exencephaly</b> and myeloschisis as the embryos grew up. The 10. 5 -day old exencephalic embryos had still widely open cephalic neural tubes. Exencephalic embryos older than 13. 5 days of gestation showed strikingly severe eversion and overgrowth of the cephalic neuroepithelium, thus failed in forming normal primitive brain. The convex dorsal surface of the <b>exencephaly</b> was covered with ependyma, which was connected directly with surrounding surface eqithelium at the periphery. The earliest morphologically recognized myeloschisis was in the 13. 5 -day old embryos. In myeloschisis, divergence at the roof plate and eversion of the spinal neural tube, disorganized overgrowth of the neuroepithelium, malformed and misplaced spinal ganglia and nerve roots, and absence of the neural arch and dermal covering were characteristic. It is suggested that <b>exencephaly</b> results from failure of the cephalic neural tube closure which is followed by eversion and overgrowth of the neuroepithelium.

40|$|Introduction: Monoamniotic {{twins are}} {{considered}} a cause of high-risk pregnancies. Thereby, discordant malformations do occur rarely. A discordant <b>exencephaly</b> has been described {{in only a few}} cases. Transcervical embryoscopy can be performed in cases of monoamniotic twins with missed abortion directly before the abort-curettage. Case Report: The case of a 35 -year-old G 1 /P 0 women in the 12 (th) week of pregnancy is described. She had a monoamniotic twin pregnancy with discordant <b>exencephaly</b> and missed abortion diagnosed at 11 + 2 weeks. A transcervical embryoscopy was performed immediately before the abort-curettage and identified the discordant <b>exencephaly</b> and an additional umbilical cord knot of the 2 foetuses as a probable cause for the abortion. Discussion: The transcervical embryoscopy lead in our case report to the diagnosis of a umbilical cord knot in a monoamniotic twin pregnancy with missed abortion. We also identified a discordant <b>exencephaly</b> by embryoscopy. With blunt access to the amniotic cavity, the transcervical embryoscopy applies only a minor additional risk to the abort-curettage. However, it should only be performed when the patient explicitly asks for enhanced diagnostics. Conclusion: Transcervical embryoscopy can be performed as an additional diagnostic tool in cases of monoamniotic twins with missed abortion. However, a detailed risk-benefit analysis should be done upfront in consultation with the patient. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|SummaryHere we {{identify}} the humpty dumpty (humdy) mouse mutant with failure {{to close the}} neural tube and optic fissure, causing <b>exencephaly</b> and retinal coloboma, common birth defects. The humdy mutation disrupts Phactr 4, an uncharacterized protein phosphatase 1 (PP 1) and actin regulator family member, and the missense mutation specifically disrupts binding to PP 1. Phactr 4 is initially expressed in the ventral cranial neural tube, a region of regulated proliferation, and after neural closure throughout the dorsoventral axis. humdy embryos display elevated proliferation and abnormally phosphorylated, inactive PP 1, resulting in Rb hyperphosphorylation, derepression of E 2 F targets, and abnormal cell-cycle progression. <b>Exencephaly,</b> coloboma, and abnormal proliferation in humdy embryos are rescued by loss of E 2 f 1, demonstrating the cell cycle is the key target controlled by Phactr 4.

The duration of heat shock protein induction in lymphocytes was found to be increased by 1 hr in the teratogen-sensitive SWV/SD strain as compared to the resistant DBA/ 2 J strain. Densitometric analysis revealed a significant decrease in the relative synthesis of at least two non-heat shock proteins (36 kD and 45 kD) in the SWV/SD lymphocytes as compared to DBA/ 2 J cells. The increased sensitivity of protein synthesis to hyperthermia in the SWV/SD lymphocytes were lost in the F(1) progeny of reciprocal crosses between SWV/SD and DBA/ 2 J mouse strains.

40|$|Summary. Mutant curly-tail mice {{are genetically}} {{predisposed}} to produce off-spring with neural tube defects. Estimation of ar-fetoprotein in the amniotic fluid of fetuses of these mutants {{has shown that}} the levels are raised in fetuses with <b>exencephaly</b> and open spina bifida. This suggests that these mice are a valid model for studies ofthe aetiology and genesis ofneural tube defects in man. The mutant mouse curly-tail (ct) has a high inci-dence of spina bifida and <b>exencephaly.</b> The muta-tion arose spontaneously in a GFF stock and the abnormalities were described by Gruneberg in 1954. The expression of the gene is variable. Mice with <b>exencephaly</b> or large open lumbosacral spina bifida die shortly after birth. Smaller sacral lesions may heal in {{the first few days of}} life, and the animals survive with no apparent dysfunction. However, they have a tightly coiled tail. Other mice have no overt spina bifida at birth but have a kinked or a spirally twisted tail. Gruneberg's studies show that these mice have a transitory caudal spina bifida which heals during fetal life. According to Gruneberg, however the abnormality presents itself, the primary defect is in the central nervous system, which fails to close, and the effect on the skeleton is secondary. These mice seem to be an animal model for human neural tube defects, and they have potential for the study of the genesis, aetiology, and many other aspects of the condition. In order to see if these mice even begin to mimic human neural tube defects, we have examined the amniotic fluids of the mouse embryos, to see if open lesions are associated with raised levels of a-fetoprotein (AFP). In humans this is so, and it forms the basis of a success-ful diagnostic test for the antenatal detection o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Perlecan is a heparan sulfate {{proteoglycan}} that {{is expressed}} in all basement membranes (BMs), in cartilage, and several other mesenchymal tissues during development. Perlecan binds growth factors and interacts with various extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules. Homozygous mice with a null mutation in the perlecan gene exhibit normal formation of BMs. However, BMs deteriorate in regions with increased mechanical stress such as the contracting myocardium and the expanding brain vesicles showing that perlecan is crucial for maintaining BM integrity. As a consequence, small clefts are formed in the cardiac muscle leading to blood leakage into the pericardial cavity and an arrest of heart function. The defects in the BM separating the brain from the adjacent mesenchyme caused invasion of brain tissue into the overlaying ectoderm leading to abnormal expansion of neuroepithelium, neuronal ectopias, and <b>exencephaly.</b> Finally, homozygotes developed a severe defect in cartilage, a tissue that lacks BMs. The chondrodysplasia {{is characterized by a}} reduction of the fibrillar collagen network, shortened collagen fibers, and elevated expression of cartilage extracellular matrix genes, suggesting that perlecan protects cartilage extracellular matrix from degradation.

A total of 22 breeders were used, from which 3 were middle-heavy type cocks and 19 female ring-necked pheasants. After only one week of living together, cocks with female pheasants, the first fertile eggs came out. From a total of 556 eggs set, the fertility was 52. 3 %. 123 hybrids clutched, showing the 41, 5 % of <b>exencephaly</b> and dying during the first four weeks of age. Two types of hybrid birds, a heavy weight and a light weight became visible, being significantly different from the age of 35 days. At the age of 105 days, the heavy type reached 1400 g, exactly twice as much the weight reached by the light type. By the choose of the appropriate cock breed it could be possible to decrease the <b>exencephaly</b> incidence as reported in the literature and to increase the number of vital hatchlings.

Previous studies demonstrated that melatonin protected against LPS-induced fetal demise, IUGR and preterm delivery. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effects of melatonin on LPS-induced NTDs. All pregnant mice except controls were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (25 µg/kg) daily from gestational day (GD) 8 to GD 12. Some pregnant mice were orally administered with melatonin (MT, 50 mg/kg) before each LPS injection. A five-day LPS injection resulted in 27. 5 % of fetuses with anencephaly, <b>exencephaly</b> or encephalomeningocele. Additional experiment showed that maternal LPS exposure significantly down-regulated placental proton-coupled folate transporter (pcft) and disturbed folate transport from maternal circulation through the placentas into the fetus. Interestingly, melatonin significantly attenuated LPS-induced down-regulation of placental pcft. Moreover, melatonin markedly improved the transport of folate from maternal circulation through the placentas into the fetus. Correspondingly, orally administered melatonin reduced the incidence of LPS-induced anencephaly, <b>exencephaly</b> or encephalomeningocele. Taken together, these results suggest that orally administered melatonin prevents LPS-induced NTDs through alleviating LPS-induced disturbance of folate transport from maternal circulation through the placenta into the fetus...|$|E
40|$|SummaryRAL small GTPases, encoded by the Rala and Ralb genes, {{are members}} of the RAS {{superfamily}} of small GTPases and can act as downstream effectors of RAS [1]. Although highly similar, distinct functions have been identified for RALA and RALB: RALA has been implicated in epithelial cell polarity [2], insulin secretion [3], GLUT 4 translocation [4, 5], neurite branching, and neuronal polarity [6, 7], and RALB in tumor cell survival [8], migration/invasion [9 – 12], TBK 1 activation [13], and autophagy [14]. To investigate RAL GTPases in vivo, we generated null and conditional knockout mice. Ralb null mice are viable with no overt phenotype; the Rala null leads to <b>exencephaly</b> and embryonic lethality. The <b>exencephaly</b> phenotype is exacerbated in Rala−/−;Ralb+/− embryos; embryos null for Rala and Ralb do not live past gastrulation. Using a Kras-driven non-small cell lung carcinoma mouse model, we found that either RALA or RALB is sufficient for tumor growth. However, deletion of both Ral genes blocks tumor formation. Either RALA or RALB is sufficient for cell proliferation, but cells lacking both fail to proliferate. These studies demonstrate functions of RAL proteins in development, tumorigenesis, and cell proliferation and show that RALA and RALB act in a redundant fashion...|$|E
