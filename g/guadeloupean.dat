Napoleon sent an expeditionary force to recapture the island from the rebellious slaves.

25|$|On 27 October 1940, the General {{council was}} {{dissolved}} and the Mayors of Guadeloupe and its dependencies were relieved of their duties {{and replaced by}} prominent citizens appointed by the Vichy government. The mayor of Terre-de-Haut, Théodore Samson, {{was replaced by a}} Béké of Martinique, Mr. de Meynard. Popular gatherings were forbidden and freedom of expression was banned by the regime. A passive resistance to Vichy and its local representatives was organised from 1940 to 1943. More than 4,000 French West Indians left their islands, at the risk of their life, to join the nearby British colonies. Then they rallied the Free French Forces, first by undertaking military training in the United States, Canada or Great Britain. At the same time, Fort Napoléon became a political jail where the dissidents were locked. The Saintois boarded their traditional Saintoise to the <b>Guadeloupean</b> coast to pick up the volunteers for dissidence departure. Then, they were sailed through Dominica Passage, avoiding the cruisers and patrol boats of Admiral Robert.|$|E

40|$|A {{central concern}} of the {{literature}} on Caribbean creoles has been the development of models to explain the distribution of linguistic codes. Most linguists have argued that it is most accurate to describe cases where French-lexified creoles are spoken along with their lexifier as stable diglossic situations, in contrast to those where English-lexified creoles are spoken along with their lexifier, which are described as creole continua marked by decreolization. Still, these categorizations remain a topic of discussion (e. g., Lefebvre, 1974; Meyjes, 1995; Prudent, 1981). In this paper I consider the applicability of the diglossia model (Ferguson, 1959) for describing patterns of language use in Guadeloupe, French West Indies. <b>Guadeloupeans,</b> all French citizens, are generally bilingual in French, the official language, and Kréyòl, a French-lexicon creole. For the present paper, I draw on 100 hours of audio- and videotaped data to explore how people in Guadeloupe use French and Kréyòl in their daily interactions and which model best describes their language use. As a further point, I consider whether or not Guadeloupe’s linguistic situation is best described as a stable one. In doing so, I will counter the argument of Meyjes (1995) that language shift is occurring in favor of French monolingualism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Haitian {{migrants}} {{living in}} Guadeloupe, French West Indies, face the predicament of all marginal groups − simultaneously {{inside and outside}} the dominant social order − but from a transnational perspective. Subjected to formal state control (arrest and deportation) and stigmatized as culturally inferior, Haitians respond to their marginality in two ways. At one level, they press claims to full legal incorporation as citizens or documented residents. At another level, however, they self-consciously elaborate the position of cultural outsider in order to defend against their denigration and criticize the dominant exclusionary norms. Although Haitian migrants wish to obtain the proper residency papers, they do not aim at assimilation. In fact, they draw on their cultural distinctiveness to underscore the political and cultural weakness of Guadeloupe, and many <b>Guadeloupeans</b> agree with their critique. The transnational orientation of Haitian migrants thus influences how they experience, re-interpret and resist their marginalization. This article examines the marginalization of the Haitian transnational community in Guadeloupe, French West Indies 1. About 25, 000 Haitians live in Guadeloupe, an overseas department of France located in the eastern Caribbean (INSEE 1999). They constitute a small minority enclave that is subject to economic and legal discrimination. At the same time, the Haitia...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} our study is to model a {{geothermal}} reservoir. When geothermal reservoir {{are assumed to be}} composed of pure water, the transfer of mass and energy is classically described by two balance equations: mass balance equation and the energy balance equation. In addition to those equations, fluid velocity ist classically given by the Darcy law while thermodynamic properties, inferred from theoretical or empirical equations of state, are used to close the mathematical system. Once this system is closed, there exist different solutions. The first one is to solve for pressure and temperature with a variable switch to saturation in the two-phase region (e. g. TOUGH 2). The second one is to solve for pressure and enthalpy to increase stability of phase transition between single and two-phase states (e. g. Hydrotherm). We adopted the second option and chose te use a splitting method {{to get rid of the}} complexity of coupling equations and a finite volume method for the spatial discretization. Selecting object-oriented languages, we developed a multi-language framework, combining Python, Fortran and a C++ implementation of IAPWS (from the freesteam project) including the supercritical equations, in porous media velocity is given by Darcy law and to close the system physical properties are determined by the IAPWS-IF 97 thermodynamic formulation. We resolve the equations in pressure and enthalpy instead of pressure and temperature in order to increase stability and to handle easier the passage from a single-phase to a two-phase system. We solve the system by using a splitting method - to get rid of the complexity of coupling equations - and a finite volume method. We offer some freedom to users thanks to the implementation of several methods like explicit or implicit Euler, Runge-Kutta or BDF 2 for time solvers or GMRES and BICGSTAB for the linear solver. We can handle several boundary conditions like no-flow - describing a boundary which can not exchange matter with the exterior - or like a mixed-therm condition - a Dirichlet condition to the pressure and a Dirichlet or an outflow condition to the temperature in order to describe a recharge or a discharge zone - [...] . We're developing a multi-language framework, combining Python, Fortran and the C++ implementation of IAPWS (from the freesteam project). All these languages are object-oriented. We've applied this simulation model to the dogger in Paris, France, to several one-dimensional systems and a two-dimensional one made by Coumou with the CSMP++ platform. The dogger is a reservoir exploited to produce heat by pumping water at 70 and reinjecting it in the reservoir at 40. In the one-dimensional systems we wanted to observe the process of heat transfer from a higher temperature boundary to a smaller one in a high-energy domain. The last simulation shows the natural convection of water in a fault. For every simulation we compared the solutions we found with an other code (TOUGH 2 or CSMP++) and they agreed. The next step will be to model the geothermal plant in Guadeloupe, West Indies. It's the only place in France - and in the West Indies so far - producing electricity with the earth power. The temperature can reach up to 1000 and the pressure range is around a few hundreds MPa. In some surface zones we can see two-phase water at atmospheric pressure. In the 1980 s Bouillante was a laboratory for France. Since 1995 Bouillante has given 30 GWh electricity a year to the <b>Guadeloupeans...</b>|$|R
