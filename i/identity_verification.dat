30|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} {{three groups of}} individuals with varied occupational experience in unfamiliar face matching. Notaries, who are often legally required to hold liability insurance to protect them {{in the event of}} bad notarizations (including those resulting from identity impersonation), bank tellers, who are professionally obligated to verify identity for financial transactions, and undergraduate students completed a brief online unfamiliar face-matching test. Despite their years of experience and weekly <b>identity</b> <b>verifications,</b> both professional groups performed similarly to the student group. Indeed, the only reliable individual difference predictor of performance was age, such that increasing age predicted declining performance. Unlike the forensic image experts studied by White et al. (2015), however, the professionals in the present study received no formal image comparison training, and were only “trained” via on-the-job experience.|$|R

The ubiquity of the grid computing connection to desktops has brought both boon to scientists as well as a cause of concern due to the security of digital assets that may be unknowingly exposed[1, 3]. Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI), with all its components, has been the most commonly deployed solution to secure corporate assets against external and not internal attacks [7]. In other words, certificates are the way users authenticate themselves in grid-network activates that perform <b>identity</b> <b>verifications</b> [4]. The certification methods are supported as an instance of SSL/TSL (Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer) security that implements authentication through the exchange of certificates based on public/private keys according to the X 509 standard [9]and also with help of DS(digital signature) [7].

30|$|Although trained {{forensic}} examiners outperform novices {{in tests}} of unfamiliar face matching, their abilities {{are called upon}} only in limited circumstances, and with minimal time pressure. More often, unfamiliar face-to-photo matching occurs under highly variable conditions, including supermarkets, border control and airport security, and in financial transactions. The people making these matching decisions are also highly variable, with individual differences in age, race, cognitive capacities, training, and on-the-job experience. The present research examined individual differences in age and occupational experience, comparing participants who are personally responsible for verifying identity during financial or legal transactions to a control sample of undergraduate students. The primary population of interest included professional notaries in the United States, individuals who are appointed by their state governments to act as impartial witnesses when important financial and legal documents are signed (e.g., property deeds, powers of attorney). In addition to ensuring that proper procedures are followed, including that all signers engage by their own free will, notaries serve {{a major role in}} fraud prevention by verifying signers’ identities. The present research addressed several questions about individual differences in unfamiliar face ID by (1) comparing professional notaries and bank tellers (who are also often tasked with unfamiliar face matching) to novices and (2) correlating performance with occupational experience measures, including weekly <b>identity</b> <b>verifications</b> and years of on-the-job experience.|$|R

A key feature of business processes is that they are built from composable services, referred to as component services, that may belong to different domains. In such a context, flexible multi-domain identity management solutions are crucial for increased security and user-convenience. In particular, it is important that during the execution of a business process the component services be able to verify the identity of the client to check that it has the required permissions for accessing the services. To address the problem of multi-domain identity management, we propose a multi-factor <b>identity</b> attribute <b>verification</b> protocol for business processes that assures clients privacy and handles naming heterogeneity...|$|R
