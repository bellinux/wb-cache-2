40|$|THE ENGLISH VILLAGE IN <b>JANE</b> AUSTEN <b>S</b> NOVELS WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON EMMA SUMMARY Two Enduring {{symbols of}} Englishness are the English village and <b>Jane</b> Austen <b>s</b> novels. Even though I believe that <b>Jane</b> Austen <b>s</b> {{overriding}} {{purpose was to}} portray human relationships, there are many contemporary factors in her novels, which influenced the behaviour of her characters. Because I believe that today s readers will appreciate the novels more fully when provided with information about the background {{in which they are}} set, I have chosen to make a study of <b>Jane</b> Austen <b>s</b> villages, those she knew herself and those she wrote about. 	Firstly, the history of the typical agricultural village of Southern England is traced, to show how a village changed from its settlement until the early 19 th century. Then <b>Jane</b> Austen <b>s</b> villages, Steventon and Chawton are examined n the light of historical sources on the English agricultural village. The following chapter deals with the villages in the five novels, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, Mansfield Park and Persuasion. These villages are fragmentary, but authentic. Finally, the village of Highbury in Emma, is examined. In this case, there are more details of the physical setting and the village society. These are authentic and there are many instances of contemporary factors which iinfluence the behaviour of her characters. 	This study of the villages and their inhabitants concludes that, even though fragmentary, the villages are authentic, and can be related to <b>Jane</b> Austen <b>s</b> own experience of village life. An understanding of the historical background increases the reader s appreciation of the novels and gives more insight into the behaviour of Austen s characters...|$|R

2500|$|Reinhardt's {{majority}} opinion {{is grounded in}} details specific {{to the case of}} California and supported by a narrow Constitutional principle. This narrowing was widely discussed and analyzed following the decision, with many legal commentators suggesting that the narrower decision made it more likely to either be upheld by, or denied certiorari by, the Supreme Court. William Eskridge, writing at the Stanford Law Review, described the courts as being [...] "unable, and usually unwilling, to strongly challenge entrenched inequalities", and went on to suggest that while California may be ready to embrace same-sex marriage, the country is not, and as a result, the Supreme Court would be [...] "wise to deny review ... or to go along with Judge Reinhardt's narrow ruling." [...] <b>Jane</b> <b>S.</b> Schacter, writing at the Harvard Law Review, framed the opinion in terms of an incremental, federalist approach to securing LGBT rights. Schacter and many other commentators also suggested that Reinhardt's decision may be deliberately directed at Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is widely regarded as a swing vote in any Supreme Court decision on the case.|$|E

5000|$|Custom {{prostheses}} can be {{made any}} size, shape, or color to the specification of the individual in need and some can last for years. In {{the case of a}} single mastectomy, a prosthetic NAC {{can be made}} to match the contralateral side. Most patients are highly satisfied with size, color, and projection (<b>Janes</b> <b>S</b> 2005). Recent improvements (circa 2010) in fabrication resolve most of the major challenges with NAC surgical outcomes, such as nipple projection and areolar color. The prosthetic nipple can be air-filled and deflate when garments such as a bra or tank top are worn, and inflate when no garments are worn. In unilateral cases, women may choose to have an exact match to their contralateral NAC, or they may have a prosthesis that covers the natural NAC and matches the prosthesis on the reconstructed breast.|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates <b>Jane</b> Austen <b>s</b> {{references}} to food and meals in her novels, {{and how these}} references can participate in developing her characters. The characters are of paramount importance {{in this kind of}} novel, and the more information we have about them, the better we can understand their actions and comments, and hence the novel. The reader is often too carried away with the actions and conversations which these meals frame to notice that the meal itself is often used as a tool, and may convey a great deal of information. Austen s use of the meals, or the simple mentioning of a single food item, makes her able to reveal or describe much of either the characters in question, the time the action takes place, where, and maybe even which social class we are dealing with. My main aim with this thesis is to demonstrate how <b>Jane</b> Austen <b>s</b> {{references to}} food can reveal more about the action and characters in her novels than one might think. The intention is to give the food and drink that Austen mentions the literary treatment and analysis it deserves...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{theoretical}} and empirical work. It principally encompasses an analysis, description and comparison ofthree translations of Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, by František Noska (1946), Božena Šimková (1949) and Eva Kondrysová (1967). The introduction briefly sets out {{the reasons for the}} selection of the theme and outlines the goal of the work. The work also concentrates on the circumstances surrounding the emergence of Pride and Prejudice and the reception given to <b>Jane</b> Austen' <b>s</b> novel. Particular attention is paid to the periodical context and the related changing critical responses to, and views on, the value of Jane Austen's literary work in an Anglo-Saxon and Czech environment. The work inter alia strives to identity how the Czech reception differs from the Anglo-Saxon one, and what features are specific to the Czech reception. <b>Jane</b> Austen' <b>s</b> work i s pro ven to ha ve attracted incomparably less attention in the Czech cultural sphere than in the Anglo-Saxon milieu, primarily for cultural and political reasons. There is then a thematic and stylistic examination of Pride and Prejudice, with a special focus on irony and the dialogical and epistolary form; the results of which are subsequently used in a contrastive analysis and evaluation of the three Czech translations of Pride and [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In the past, the {{greatest}} complaint with prosthetics is not having secure adherence. When prostheses are not adhered securely, satisfaction of prostheses is significantly decreased. In {{a survey conducted}} approximately two years after receiving the prostheses, only 67% of respondents “benefited” and only 39% still used them (<b>Janes</b> <b>S</b> 2005). Adhesion of prostheses depends greatly on the materials and fabrication techniques. Presently common are self-adhering prostheses (mass-produced) which adhere well initially, but the adhesion weakens over a few months. Another common method of adhesion is to apply an organic based pressure sensitive adhesive to the prosthesis for each use. However, removing the adhesive is difficult and can easily tear the thin edges of the prosthesis. Most promising though is a fabrication technique where the silicone prostheses are bonded to {{a thin layer of}} polyurethane. A water-based acrylic rubber adhesive is applied to the polyurethane, and the prostheses could be adhered to the skin for up to two weeks at a time. Removing the adhesive from the prostheses is fairly simple and is done with an alcohol swab. The edges of the prostheses remain thin and durable due to the polyurethane layer. Additionally, the water-based adhesive is gentle on the skin and is indicated for irradiated skin.|$|R
