5|$|Modern steels {{are made}} with varying {{combinations}} of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes. Carbon steel, composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90% of steel production. Low alloy steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by weight to improve the <b>hardenability</b> of thick sections. High strength low alloy steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include <b>hardenability,</b> machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E
25|$|In 1937, Jominy & Boegehold of GM {{invented the}} Jominy end-quench test for <b>hardenability</b> of carbon steel, a {{breakthrough}} in heat treating still in use today as ASTM A255.|$|E
25|$|Both {{carbon and}} alloy steels are {{suitable}} for case-hardening; typically mild steels are used, with low carbon content, usually less than 0.3% (see plain-carbon steel for more information). These mild steels are not normally hardenable due to the low quantity of carbon, so {{the surface of the}} steel is chemically altered to increase the <b>hardenability.</b> Case-hardened steel is formed by diffusing carbon (carburization), nitrogen (nitriding) and/or boron (boriding) into the outer layer of the steel at high temperature, and then heat treating the surface layer to the desired hardness.|$|E
2500|$|The {{other and}} most popular formula is the Dearden and O'Neill formula, which {{was adopted by}} IIW in 1967. [...] This formula has been found {{suitable}} for predicting <b>hardenability</b> in a large range of commonly used plain carbon and carbon-manganese steels, but not to microalloyed high-strength low-alloy steels or low-alloy Cr-Mo steels. The formula is defined as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Case-{{hardening}} or {{surface hardening}} {{is the process}} of hardening the surface of a metal object while allowing the metal deeper underneath to remain soft, thus forming a thin layer of harder metal (called the [...] "case") at the surface. For iron or steel with low carbon content, which has poor to no <b>hardenability</b> of its own, the case-hardening process involves infusing additional carbon into the surface layer. Case-hardening is usually done after the part has been formed into its final shape, but can also be done to increase the hardening element content of bars to be used in a pattern welding or similar process. The term face hardening is also used to describe this technique, when discussing modern armour.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hardenability</b> of a {{ferrous alloy}} is {{measured}} by a Jominy test: a round metal bar of standard size (indicated in the top image) is transformed to 100% austenite through heat treatment, and is then quenched on one end with room-temperature water. The cooling rate will be highest at the end being quenched, and will decrease as distance from the end increases. Subsequent to cooling a flat surface is ground on the test piece and the <b>hardenability</b> is then found by measuring the hardness along the bar. The {{farther away from the}} quenched end that the hardness extends, the higher the <b>hardenability.</b> This information is plotted on a <b>hardenability</b> graph.|$|E
5000|$|Chromium (max. 1.50-3.25%), enhances {{strength}} and <b>hardenability</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Acicular ferrite steels: These steels are {{characterized}} by a very fine high strength acicular ferrite structure, a very low carbon content, and good <b>hardenability.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{weldability}} of steel, {{with regard}} to hydrogen-induced cold cracking, is inversely proportional to the <b>hardenability</b> of the steel, which measures the ease of forming martensite during heat treatment. The <b>hardenability</b> of steel depends on its chemical composition, with greater quantities of carbon and other alloying elements resulting in a higher <b>hardenability</b> and thus a lower weldability. In {{order to be able}} to judge alloys made up of many distinct materials, a measure known as the equivalent carbon content is used to compare the relative weldabilities of different alloys by comparing their properties to a plain carbon steel. The effect on weldability of elements like chromium and vanadium, while not as great as carbon, is more significant than that of copper and nickel, for example. As the equivalent carbon content rises, the weldability of the alloy decreases.|$|E
50|$|A material's work <b>hardenability</b> can be {{predicted}} by analyzing a stress-strain curve, or studied in context by performing hardness tests {{before and after}} a process.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hardenability</b> of ferrous alloys, i.e. steels, is a {{function}} of the carbon content and other alloying elements and the grain size of the austenite.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hardenability</b> of a {{metal alloy}} is the {{depth up to}} which a {{material}} is hardened after putting through a heat treatment process. The unit of <b>hardenability</b> {{is the same as}} of length. It is an indication of how deep into the material a certain hardness can be achieved. It {{should not be confused with}} hardness, which is a measure of a sample's resistance to indentation or scratching.It is an important property for welding, since it is inversely proportional to weldability, that is, the ease of welding a material.|$|E

50|$|The {{excessive}} <b>hardenability</b> {{that can}} occur when spot welding HSLA steel can be an issue. The equivalent carbon content {{can be used as}} a parameter to evaluate the propensity for failure.|$|E
5000|$|An [...] "H" [...] suffix can {{be added}} to any {{designation}} to denote <b>hardenability</b> is a major requirement. The chemical requirements are loosened but hardness values defined for various distances on a Jominy test.|$|E
50|$|Since {{pearlite}} {{is harder}} than iron, {{the degree of}} softness achievable is typically limited to that produced by the pearlite. Similarly, the <b>hardenability</b> {{is limited by the}} continuous martensitic microstructure formed when cooled very fast.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} is a range of improved properties in alloy steels (as compared to carbon steels): strength, hardness, toughness, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, <b>hardenability,</b> and hot hardness. To achieve some of these improved properties the metal may require heat treating.|$|E
5000|$|It {{provided}} alternating {{layers of}} differing <b>hardenability.</b> During quenching, the high carbon layers achieve greater hardness than the medium carbon layers. The hardness {{of the high}} carbon steels combine with the ductility of the low carbon steels to form the property of toughness.|$|E
50|$|A {{hypereutectoid}} steel {{contains more than}} 0.77% carbon. When slowly cooling a {{hypereutectoid steel}}, the cementite will begin to crystallize first. When the remaining steel becomes eutectoid in composition, it will crystallize into pearlite. Since cementite is much harder than pearlite, the alloy has greater <b>hardenability</b> at a cost in the ductility.|$|E
50|$|When {{heat-treated}} {{the alloy}} {{has very little}} dimensional change, so it is often machined to its final dimensions. Due to the high alloy content maraging steels have a high <b>hardenability.</b> Since ductile FeNi martensites are formed upon cooling, cracks are non-existent or negligible. The steels can be nitrided to increase case hardness, and polished to a fine surface finish.|$|E

[...] This formula has been found {{suitable}} for predicting <b>hardenability</b> in a large range of commonly used plain carbon and carbon-manganese steels, but not to microalloyed high-strength low-alloy steels or low-alloy Cr-Mo steels. The formula is defined as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{cold-work}} {{tool steels}} include the O-series (oil-hardening), the A-series (air-hardening), and the D-series (high carbon-chromium). These are steels used to cut or form {{materials that are}} at low temperatures. This group possesses high <b>hardenability</b> and wear resistance, and average toughness and heat softening resistance. They are used in production of larger parts or parts that require minimal distortion during hardening. The use of oil quenching and air-hardening helps reduce distortion, avoiding the higher stresses caused by the quicker water quenching. More alloying elements are used in these steels, {{as compared to the}} water-hardening class. These alloys increase the steels' <b>hardenability,</b> and thus require a less severe quenching process and as a result are less likely to crack. They have high surface hardness and are often used to make knife blades. The machinability of the oil hardening grades is high but for the high carbon-chromium types is low.|$|E
50|$|The high shock {{resistance}} and good <b>hardenability</b> {{are provided by}} chromium-tungsten, silicon-molybdenum, silicon-manganese alloying. Shock-resisting group tool steels (S) are designed to resist shock at both low and high temperatures. A low carbon content {{is required for the}} necessary toughness (approximately 0.5% carbon). Carbide-forming alloys provide the necessary abrasion resistance, <b>hardenability,</b> and hot-work characteristics. This family of steels displays very high impact toughness and relatively low abrasion resistance and can attain relatively high hardness (HRC 58/60). In the US, toughness usually derives from 1 to 2% silicon and 0.5-1% molybdenum content. In Europe, shock steels often contain 0.5-0.6 % carbon and around 3% nickel. 1.75% to 2.75% nickel is still used in some shock resisting and high strength low alloy steels (HSLA), such as L6, 4340, and Swedish saw steel, but it is relatively expensive. An example of its use is in the production of jackhammer bits.|$|E
5000|$|Case {{hardening}} processes harden {{only the}} exterior of the steel part, creating a hard, wear resistant skin (the [...] "case") but preserving a tough and ductile interior. Carbon steels are not very hardenable meaning they can not be hardened throughout thick sections. Alloy steels have a better <b>hardenability,</b> so they can through-hardened and do not require case hardening. This property of carbon steel can be beneficial, because it gives the surface good wear characteristics but leaves the core tough.|$|E
50|$|A {{hypoeutectoid}} steel contains less than 0.77% carbon. Upon cooling a {{hypoeutectoid steel}} from the austenite transformation temperature, small islands of proeutectoid-ferrite will form. These {{will continue to}} grow and the carbon will recede until the eutectoid concentration {{in the rest of the}} steel is reached. This eutectoid mixture will then crystallize as a microstructure of pearlite. Since ferrite is softer than pearlite, the two microstructures combine to increase the ductility of the alloy. Consequently, the <b>hardenability</b> of the alloy is lowered.|$|E

Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E
50|$|Carbon steels {{which can}} {{successfully}} undergo heat-treatment have a carbon {{content in the}} range of 0.30-1.70% by weight. Trace impurities of various other elements can {{have a significant effect on}} the quality of the resulting steel. Trace amounts of sulfur in particular make the steel red-short, that is, brittle and crumbly at working temperatures. Low-alloy carbon steel, such as A36 grade, contains about 0.05% sulfur and melts around 1426 - 1538 C. Manganese is often added to improve the <b>hardenability</b> of low-carbon steels. These additions turn the material into a low-alloy steel by some definitions, but AISI's definition of carbon steel allows up to 1.65% manganese by weight.|$|E
50|$|Case {{hardening}} is {{specified by}} hardness and case depth. The case depth {{can be specified}} in two ways: total case depth or effective case depth. The total case depth is the true depth of the case. For most alloys, the effective case depth is {{the depth of the}} case that has a hardness equivalent of HRC50; however, some alloys specify a different hardness (40-60 HRC) at effective case depth; this is checked on a Tukon microhardness tester. This value can be roughly approximated as 65% of the total case depth; however the chemical composition and <b>hardenability</b> can affect this approximation. If neither type of case depth is specified the total case depth is assumed.|$|E
50|$|Many {{elements}} are often alloyed with steel. The main purpose for alloying most elements with steel {{is to increase}} its <b>hardenability</b> and to decrease softening under temperature. Tool steels, for example, may have elements like chromium or vanadium added to increase both toughness and strength, which is necessary for things like wrenches and screwdrivers. On the other hand, drill bits and rotary files need to retain their hardness at high temperatures. Adding cobalt or molybdenum can cause the steel to retain its hardness, even at red-hot temperatures, forming high-speed steels. Often, small amounts of many different {{elements are}} added to the steel to give the desired properties, rather than just adding one or two.|$|E

5000|$|Crucible {{steel is}} {{generally}} attributed to production centres in India and Sri Lanka {{where it was}} produced using the so-called [...] "wootz" [...] process, and {{it is assumed that}} its appearance in other locations was due to long distance trade. Only recently it has become apparent that places in Central Asia like Merv in Turkmenistan and Akhsiket in Uzbekistan were important centres of production of crucible steel. The Central Asian finds are all from excavations and date from the 8th to 12th centuries CE, while the Indian/Sri Lankan material is as early as 300 BCE. In addition, India's iron ore had trace vanadium and other rare earths leading to increased <b>hardenability</b> in Indian crucible steel which was famous throughout the middle east for its ability to retain an edge.|$|E
50|$|Carbonitriding {{also has}} other {{advantages}} over carburizing. To begin, {{it has a}} greater resistance to softening during tempering and increased fatigue and impact strength. It is possible to use both carbonitriding and carburizing together to form optimum conditions of deeper case depths and therefore performance of the part in industry. This method is applied particularly to steels with low case <b>hardenability,</b> such as {{the seat of the}} valve. The process applied is initially carburizing to the required case depth (up to 2.5 mm) at around 900-955°C, and then carbonitriding to achieve required carbonitrided case depth. The parts are then oil quenched, and the resulting part has a harder case than possibly achieved for carburization, and the addition of the carbonitrided layer increases the residual compressive stresses in the case such that the contact fatigue resistance and strength gradient are both increased.|$|E
50|$|As with {{conventional}} quench and tempering the material being heat treated must be cooled from the austenitizing temperature {{quickly enough to}} avoid the formation of pearlite. The specific cooling rate {{that is necessary to}} avoid the formation of pearlite {{is a product of the}} chemistry of the austenite phase and thus the alloy being processed. The actual cooling rate is a product of both the quench severity, which is influenced by quench media, agitation, load (quenchant ratio, etc.), and the thickness and geometry of the part. As a result, heavier section components required greater <b>hardenability.</b> In austempering the heat treat load is quenched to a temperature which is typically above the Martensite start of the austenite and held. In some patented processes the parts are quenched just below the Martensite start so that the resulting microstructure is a controlled mixture of Martensite and Bainite.|$|E
