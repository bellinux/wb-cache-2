5|$|A {{second type}} are the intraductal {{papillary}} mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs). These are macroscopic lesions, which {{are found in}} about 2% of all adults. This rate rises to ~10% by age 70. These lesions <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> 25% risk of developing into invasive cancer. They may have KRAS gene mutations (~40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS Gs alpha subunit and RNF43, affecting the Wnt signaling pathway. Even if removed surgically, there remains a considerably increased risk of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.|$|E
5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> 20% risk of seizures returning. The {{length of time}} until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such children may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|The liger is a {{cross between}} a male lion and a tigress. Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the {{corresponding}} growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers are often fertile. Males <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> 50% chance of having a mane, but, even if they do, their manes will be only around half the size of that of a pure lion. Ligers are typically between 10 and 12feet in length, and can weigh between 800 and 1,000pounds or more.|$|E

25|$|Closed-die forging {{has a high}} {{initial cost}} due to the {{creation}} of dies and required design work to make working die cavities. However, it has low recurring costs for each part, thus forgings become more economical with more volume. This {{is one of the major}} reasons closed-die forgings are often used in the automotive and tool industries. Another reason forgings are common in these industrial sectors is that forgings generally <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> 20 percent higher strength-to-weight ratio compared to cast or machined parts of the same material.|$|E

Midday {{was a time when}} people stayed in the shade and had the main meal followed by a nap, a practice similar to the modern siesta.|$|E
25|$|The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report also {{describes}} {{the impact of}} climate change on food security. Projections suggested {{that there could be}} large decreases in hunger globally by 2080, compared to the (then-current) 2006 level. Reductions in hunger were driven by projected social and economic development. For reference, the Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that in 2006, the number of people undernourished globally was 820 million. Three scenarios without climate change (SRES A1, B1, B2) projected 100-130 million undernourished by the year 2080, while another scenario without climate change (SRES A2) projected 770 million undernourished. Based on an expert assessment of all of the evidence, these projections were thought to <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> 5-in-10 chance of being correct.|$|E
25|$|The risk {{of ovarian}} cancer {{increases}} in women who have ovulated more over their lifetime. This includes those who have never had children, those who begin ovulation {{at a younger age}} or reach menopause at an older age. Other risk factors include hormone therapy after menopause, fertility medication, and obesity. Factors that decrease risk include hormonal birth control, tubal ligation, and breast feeding. About 10% of cases are related to inherited genetic risk; women with mutations in the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> 50% chance of developing the disease. The most common type {{of ovarian cancer}}, comprising more than 95% of cases, is ovarian carcinoma. There are five main subtypes of ovarian carcinoma, of which high-grade serous carcinoma is the most common. These tumors are believed to start in the cells covering the ovaries, though some may form at the Fallopian tubes. Less common types of ovarian cancer include germ cell tumors and sex cord stromal tumors. A diagnosis of ovarian cancer is confirmed through a biopsy of tissue, usually removed during surgery.|$|E

2500|$|Biotin is {{also called}} vitamin H (the H {{represents}} Haar und Haut, German words for [...] "hair and skin") or vitamin B7. Studies on its bioavailability {{have been conducted}} in rats and in chicks. Based on these studies, biotin bioavailability may be low or variable, {{depending on the type}} of food being consumed. In general, biotin exists in food as protein-bound form or biocytin. Proteolysis by protease is required prior to absorption. This process assists free biotin release from biocytin and protein-bound biotin. The biotin present in corn is readily available; however, most grains <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> 20-40% bioavailability of biotin.|$|E
2500|$|A popular idea, {{that has}} failed to gain {{significant}} experimental support, {{is the idea that}} mutation, as distinct from DNA damage, is the primary cause of aging. As discussed above, mutations tend to arise in frequently replicating cells as a result of errors of DNA synthesis when template DNA is damaged, and can give rise to cancer. However, in mice there is no increase in mutation in the brain with aging. [...] Mice defective in a gene (Pms2) that ordinarily corrects base mispairs in DNA <b>have</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> 100-fold elevated mutation frequency in all tissues, but do not appear to age more rapidly.

[...] Decoding readers become exposed to many types of morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes, and it is when they learn to read these as [...] "sight chunks" [...] that their reading and their understanding will speed up dramatically.
