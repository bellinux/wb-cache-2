50|$|The {{presentation}} of the Loremo during the Geneva Auto show in 2006 focused on the car's body, as it still lacked an engine. In September 2007, the company successfully accomplished the car's proof of concept in Frankfurt am Main, {{as part of the}} annual International Motor Show. In preparation of presenting the first <b>driving</b> <b>prototype,</b> the Loremo L1 was equipped with a turbodiesel motor. However, in light of diminishing fossil fuels, an electric motor was expected to be available in the lineup in addition to the originally planned models.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the digital {{photonic}} production of corundum components by a selective laser induced etching process (SLE) is investigated. Initially, {{the generation of}} 2 D corundum components using ultra short pulsed laser radiation and adjacent etching is investigated and optimized. Based on the generated knowledge {{the transfer of the}} process for the generation of 2 1 / 2 D and 3 D components is shown. In addition, a precision scanner with large numerical aperture (μScanner) is developed. The μScanner’s development leads to a decrease in irradiation time during the photonic production of corundum components. The development of the μScanner enables faster and flexible laser irradiation of customized components, <b>driving</b> <b>prototype</b> development and promoting affordable small series production. The generation of 2 1 / 2 D components in sapphire and ruby is demonstrated with the μScanner...|$|E

50|$|With {{a robust}} {{motorsports}} division, Honda had significant development resources {{at its disposal}} and made extensive use of them. Respected Japanese Formula One driver Satoru Nakajima, for example, was involved with Honda in the NSX's early on track development at Suzuka race circuit, where he performed many endurance distance duties related to chassis tuning. Brazilian Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna, for whom Honda had powered all three of his world championship-winning Formula One race cars {{before his death in}} 1994, was considered Honda's main innovator in convincing the company to stiffen the NSX chassis further after initially testing the car at Honda's Suzuka GP circuit in Japan. Senna further helped refine the original NSX's suspension tuning and handling spending a whole day test <b>driving</b> <b>prototypes</b> and reporting his findings to Honda engineers after each of the day's five testing sessions. Senna also tested the NSX at the Nurburgring and other tracks. The suspension development program was far-ranging and took place at the Tochigi Proving Grounds, the Suzuka circuit, the 179-turn Nurburgring Course in Germany, HPCC, and Honda's newest test track in Takasu, Hokkaido. Honda automobile dealer Bobby Rahal (two-time CART PPG Cup and 1986 Indianapolis 500 champion) also participated in the car's development.|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} climate debate, {{electric}} vehicles are widely {{considered to be the}} future of individual transport. The REV Project of the University of Western Australia has converted three regular petrol driven cars to electric vehicles.

In addition, special requirements for test <b>driving</b> a <b>prototype</b> car are defined. These features are essential for the REV Project to evaluate the performance of the cars. It then describes the general ideas behind the development of the program and details their implementation (Chapters 4 and 5). This includes communication with the battery management system, processing of GPS data, calculation of statistics, generation of a map and control of the multimedia functionality. Lastly, the thesis explains the resulting program (Chapter 6), discusses experiences in using it and presents data collected during test drives (Chapter 7). ...|$|R

40|$|Demand for wheelchairs is {{increasing}} with {{growing numbers of}} aged and disabled persons. Manual wheelchairs are {{the most commonly used}} assistive device for mobility because they are convenient to transport. Manual wheelchairs have several advantages but are not easy to use for the elderly or those who lack muscular strength. Therefore, handrim-activated power-assist wheelchairs (HAPAW) that can aid driving power with a motor by detecting user driving intentions through the handrim are being researched. This research will be on HAPAW that judge user driving intentions by using non-contact torque sensors. To deliver the desired motion, which is sensed from handrim rotation relative to a fixed controller, a new driving wheel mechanism is designed by applying a non-contact torque sensor, and corresponding torques are simulated. Torques are measured by a <b>driving</b> wheel <b>prototype</b> and compared with simulation results. The HAPAW prototype was developed using the wheels and a driving control algorithm that uses left and right input torques and time differences are used to check if the non-contact torque sensor can distinguish users’ driving intentions. Through this procedure, it was confirmed that the proposed sensor can be used effectively in HAPAW...|$|R
