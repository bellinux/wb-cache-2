All the observed Hα, CaII 8542 A ̊ and HeI 10830 A ̊ profiles of the flare are significantly broadened and can be well simulated by using the expanding flare atmosphere model with maximum expanding velocities of 100 – 200 km s− 1.

We analyze seven Doppler shift oscillation events detected by SUMER in the hot <b>flare</b> <b>line</b> Fe XIX to obtain oscillation periods of these events.

For the seven events, the plasma β is in the range 0. 15 − 0. 91 with a mean of 0. 33 ± 0. 26, and the estimated magnetic field varies between 21 − 61 G with a mean of 34 ± 14 G.

Potassium is of importance in the continuing debate concerning the nature of the coronal/photospheric element abundance ratios which are widely considered to depend on first ionization potential since it has the lowest FIP of any common element in the Sun. The measurements were obtained with the RESIK crystal spectrometer on the Coronas-F spacecraft. A differential emission measure DEM = const. x exp (-(beta) T(sub e) was found to be the most consistent with the data out of three models considered.

Our measured value for the coronal ratio [Ar/H] = 1. 5 x 10 (exp - 6) is significantly less than photospheric, indicating that there is a slight depletion of this high-FIP element in the corona.

40|$|Abstract. A {{method of}} calculating NLTE models of a plan-parallel solar flare {{atmosphere}} with stationary plasma flows is presented. To solve the radiative trans-fer equation, equations of statistical equilibrium (ESE) and the stationary momentum equation, {{we use the}} mul-tilevel approximate lambda iteration (MALI) approach. The numerical code {{is based on the}} method recently de-veloped by Rybicky & Hummer (1991, 1992) and allows to take into account macroscopic velocity elds in observer’s frame formulation. The preconditioned ESE, constructed by this method, are nally linearized with respect to level populations and electron densities to treat the the hydro-gen ionization balance. The numerical code based on this method is used to compute a grid of NLTE flare models with various velocity elds in order to show the influence of the velocity elds on the H-line asymmetries. The analysis of the results lead to conclusions that would improve interpretations of <b>flare</b> <b>line</b> asymmetries: 1) The velocities aect the level populations, 2) The type of asymmetry depends on the changes in the optical depth scales and on the run of the source function in the atmo-sphere. 3) A monotonous velocity aects only one wing of the line prole. 4) To get the velocity eld from an observed prole the bisector method should be modied...|$|E

Two large flares allowed time-resolved spectra to be analyzed, revealing a very broad component to the Mg II k line profile {{in at least one}} flare spectrum (F 9 b).

40|$|We have {{identified}} 63 flares on M dwarfs {{from the individual}} component spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using a novel measurement of emission line strength called the <b>Flare</b> <b>Line</b> Index. Each of the ~ 38, 000 M dwarfs in the SDSS low mass star spectroscopic sample of West et al. was observed several times (usually 3 - 5) in exposures that were typically 9 - 25 minutes in duration. Our criteria allowed us to identify flares that exhibit very strong H-alpha and H-beta emission line strength and/or significant variability in those lines {{throughout the course of}} the exposures. The flares we identified have characteristics consistent with flares observed by classical spectroscopic monitoring. The flare duty cycle for the objects in our sample is found to increase from 0. 02 % for early M dwarfs to 3 % for late M dwarfs. We find that the flare duty cycle is larger in the population near the Galactic plane and that the flare stars are more spatially restricted than the magnetically active but non-flaring stars. This suggests that flare frequency may be related to stellar age (younger stars are more likely to flare) and that the flare stars are younger than the mean active population.

40|$|UV and {{optically}} selected {{candidates for}} stellar tidal disruption events (TDE) often exhibit broad spectral features (HeII emission, Hα emission, or absorption lines) on a blackbody-like continuum (1 e 4 K<T< 1 e 5 K). The lines presumably emit from TDE debris or circumnuclear clouds photoionized by the <b>flare.</b> <b>Line</b> velocities however are {{much lower than}} expected from a stellar disruption by supermassive black hole (SMBH), and are somewhat faster than expected for the broad line region (BLR) clouds of a persistently active galactic nucleus (AGN). The distinctive spectral states are not strongly related to observed luminosity and velocity, nor to SMBH mass estimates. We use exhaustive photoionization modelling to map the domain of fluxes and cloud properties that yield (e. g.) a He-overbright state where a large HeII(4686 A) /Hα line-ratio creates an illusion of helium enrichment. Although observed line ratios occur in a plausible minority of cases, AGN-like illumination can not reproduce the observed equivalent widths. We therefore propose to explain these properties by a light-echo photoionization model: the initial flash of a hot blackbody (detonation) excites BLR clouds, which are then seen superimposed on continuum from a later, expanded, cooled stage of the central luminous source. The implied cloud mass is substellar, which may be inconsistent with a TDE. Given these and other inconsistencies with TDE models (e. g. host-galaxies distribution) we suggest to also consider alternative origins for these nuclear flares, which we briefly discuss (e. g. nuclear supernovae and starved/subluminous AGNs).

40|$|Many {{operations}} in process industry and other application sectors involve inherent risk due to different hazards. A safety-instrumented system (SIS) is installed to prevent {{development of a}} hazard to an accident or to reduce associated consequence. The topic of reliability assessment of SIS has been widely discussed. However, identification of dangerous combinations of output states of SIS has not been paid enough attention by industry so far. It is a requirement stating explicitly in IEC 61511 Chapter 10. 3. Normally, a SIS is designed in process system with a local perspective. The designer of SIS always analyses operational upsets {{in one part of}} the system individually, without considering the effects on system level caused by individually local effects occurring simultaneously in different parts in a large system. During process operation, such combinations of individual safe states in the SIS can cause a new situation that is dangerous. Although there are many different acceptable hazard identification methods, none of them is particularly suitable in the task of identification of the specified hazard. This report provides background and rationale for mostly common hazard identification methods. Main purpose is to propose a method, which can help to fill in the blanket of current solutions and can be applicable so that dangerous combinations of output states of SIS are able to be identified during process design and to be involved in safety requirement specification (SRS). A three-step method is proposed based on algorithms that typically present in modular process flowsheet simulator, qualitative hazard identification method and dynamic simulation. The three steps are: Step 1 : Carry out system breakdown. Step 2 : Identify dangerous combinations of safety trips. Step 3 : Perform dynamic simulations. The analysis is based on a critical assumption of time-scales of dynamic responses. The hazard event resulting from simultaneous trips is only considered, when a same time-scale is utilized for determining the leading effects on process or plant. A stepwise analysis guides the analyst to confirm a list of dangerous combinations of safety trips. Probability assessment is taken into account with the purpose to focus on severe scenarios. Dynamic simulation is implemented to determine whether the combination violates the design limits of the process or plant from any starting point, where safety trips are occurring at the same time. Nowadays, there is an increasing number of subsea-well tied in topside platform in Norwegian Continental Shell (NCS) as well as many project requiring reassessing the capacity of previously designed flare header. Evaluation of effect in flare header (on system perspective) during blowdown is indispensable, even if depressurisation system (mostly SIS) is installed to protection process unit and pipeline on local level. Dynamic modelling plays a critical role in assessment of maximum allowable operational conditions in <b>flare</b> <b>line.</b> By taking advantage of OLGA Dynamic Multiphase Flow Simulator, the transient process with a comparison between two different scenarios, full blowdown and blowdown (BD) with a time sequence is presented by a case study. When an existing flare header can not be replaced due to limited project budget, a proper time sequence of BDV opening is an alternative solution to avoid overcapacity of flare header. The results of the first case study reveal that evaluation regarding different combinations of tripping BDVs is necessarily executed during design of the time sequence. In addition, the second case study is based on a process system consisting of a single piece of CSTR and cooling system. A dynamic model is established in Matlab. The case study demonstrates the applicability of the suggested three-step method, while the results of dynamic simulation confirm that simultaneously occurring safety trips can generate a hazard event. It is a valuable outcome to raise awareness to the industry about the specified hazard event. During process design, the work of identification of dangerous combinations of output states of SIS can not be disregarded...|$|E
