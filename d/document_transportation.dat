40|$|Keyword-based searching and {{clustering}} of news {{articles have}} been widely used for news analysis. However, news articles usually have other attributes such as source, author, date and time, length, and sentiment which should be taken into account. In addition, news articles and keywords have complicated macro/micro relations, which include relations between news articles (i. e., macro relation), relations between keywords (i. e., micro relation), and relations between news articles and keywords (i. e., macro-micro relation). These macro/micro relations are time varying and pose special challenges for news analysis. In this article we present a visual analytics system for news streams which can bring multiple attributes of the news articles and the macro/micro relations between news streams and keywords into one coherent analytical context, all the while conveying the dynamic natures of news streams. We introduce a new visualization primitive called TextWheel which consists of one or multiple keyword wheels, a <b>document</b> <b>transportation</b> belt, and a dynamic system which connects the wheels and belt. By observing the TextWheel and its content changes, some interesting patterns can be detected. We use our system to analyze several news corpora related to some major companies and the results demonstrate the high potential of our method...|$|E

50|$|Plans to {{construct}} a northern loop of I-840 north of Nashville and past Dickson, Clarksville, Springfield, and Gallatin were abandoned since the Tennessee General Assembly ordered TDOT to discontinue further studies and planning of that highway because of state budget problems. An entire circular loop would possibly be about 178 mi long. Other important objections against additional extensions of the I-840 highway include the hilly nature of the terrain north of Nashville (the Highland Rim), which would require huge and costly amounts of excavation, soil relocation, and bridge construction. In October 2003, TDOT placed the northern loop plan on indefinite hold, citing a lack of <b>documented</b> <b>transportation</b> needs and lack of participation from local politicians.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Road Weather Management Program of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has <b>documented</b> <b>transportation</b> {{management}} practices used during inclement weather. Best {{management practices}} include road weather and traffic surveillance to assess threats to transportation system performance, arterial and freeway management to regulate roadway capacity, {{as well as}} dissemination of advisory information to influence traveler decisions and driver behavior. These management practices are employed in response to various weather threats including low visibility, high winds, precipitation, hurricanes, flooding, and avalanches. Weather-related transportation management practices (1) improve mobility by increasing roadway capacity and promoting uniform traffic flow, (2) increase public safety by minimizing accident risk and exposure to hazards, as well as (3) enhance the safety and productivity of road maintenance personnel...|$|R

I will examine whether this relationship holds in case of cul de sac in an extremely remote community in Iceland. A macro panel data set from Iceland will be used. It provides several essential variables for 79 municipalities in Iceland from 1981 through 2006. The results suggest that the impact is negligible against housing prices in this case. Further inspection shows that the price is sticky in the most relevant region, but the quantity is flexible. Thus, the estimation of the model will be repeated as an inverse demand function, where the housing price as exogene variable is replaced by sales quantity...|$|R

[...] Israel previously stated that the Iron Dome has successfully intercepted [...] "about 90% of rockets headed toward populated or strategic areas".

It submitted the <b>document</b> to <b>Transportation</b> Minister Katz, indicating that the airport was safe for landings and departures. One significant measure taken by the aviation authorities to increase the level of safety at Ben Gurion during the Gaza operation was to route all commercial traffic through the airspace north of the airport and away from the direction of Gaza.

40|$|Performance {{measures}} play {{a critical}} role in the operation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), because they provide feedback to the operators regarding system operations and efficiency. Traffic management systems use archived data, provided by various sensors, as a basis for describing normal conditions and predicting traffic conditions that may be expected at a particular time and place in the highway system. However, data quality is one of the principal concerns of archived ITS data users for the following reasons: 1) Manual inspection techniques are unable to detect significant errors because of the large volume of ITS data; 2) Only minimal error detection can be performed as the data is being collected; 3) Sensors may only fail intermittently and not affect long-term averages; 4) Sensor failures may be masked by congestion or incidents. This project examined several quality control issues on one of the nation’s busiest sections of Interstate, the Borman expressway (I- 80 / 94). Various tests such as speed and volume comparisons, data availability and average effective vehicle length test were developed and applied, revealing significant inconsistency in data quality provided by different detection technologies. Results that document these problems are presented in this study and causes of non-random changes are identified.
