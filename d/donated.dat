40|$|Using data {{drawn from}} the U. S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we explore the {{relationship}} between the <b>donating</b> behaviour of parents and that of their children aged less than 18. Furthermore, we exploit information relating to whether or not parents encourage their children to <b>donate</b> to charity in order to unveil information related to the intergenerational transmission of philanthropic behaviour. Our findings suggest that whether a child <b>donates</b> to charity is influenced by positive effects from whether the parent <b>donates</b> to charity as well as from whether the parent talks to their child about <b>donating</b> to charity. In addition, whether the parent <b>donates</b> to charity has an indirect influence via its positive effect on the probability that the parent talks to the child about <b>donating</b> to charity. Further, we find that the influence of whether the parent <b>donates</b> to charity on the probability that the child <b>donates</b> to charity is particularly heightened in terms of both magnitude and statistical significance in the context of parental donations to religious causes...|$|R

40|$|Inhibitory control {{may play}} an {{important}} part in prosocial behavior, such as <b>donating</b> behavior. However, it is not clear at what developmental stage inhibitory control becomes associated with <b>donating</b> behavior and which aspects of inhibitory control are related to <b>donating</b> behavior during development in early to middle childhood. The present study aimed to clarify these issues with two experiments. In Experiment 1, 103 3 - to 5 -year-old preschoolers completed cool (Stroop-like) and hot (delay of gratification) inhibitory control tasks and a <b>donating</b> task. The results indicated that there were no relationships between cool or hot inhibitory control and <b>donating</b> behavior in the whole group and each age group of the preschoolers. In Experiment 2, 140 elementary school children in Grades 2, 4, and 6 completed cool (Stroop-like) and hot (delay of gratification) inhibitory control tasks and a <b>donating</b> task. The results showed that inhibitory control was positively associated with <b>donating</b> behavior in the whole group. Cool and hot inhibitory control respectively predicted <b>donating</b> behavior in the second and sixth graders. Therefore, the present study reveals that <b>donating</b> behavior increasingly relies on specific inhibitory control, i. e., hot inhibitory control as children grow in middle childhood...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{assessed}} {{the importance of}} altruism and willingness to <b>donate</b> oocytes in British Asian and Caucasian samples. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) {{was used to test}} the importance of attitudes towards oocyte donation, normative and control beliefs to attitudes to <b>donate</b> oocytes. Method: One hundred and one participants (55 % Asian, 45 % Caucasian) completed questionnaires measuring altruism and attitudes to Oocyte donation. There were no socio-demographic differences between ethnic groups. Results: Few women were willing to <b>donate</b> oocytes, Asian women were least likely to <b>donate</b> oocytes, and altruism was not related to willingness to <b>donate.</b> Forty-one participants considered themselves 'possible' oocyte donors and 54 as definite 'non' donors. Possible donors reported significantly more positive attitudes towards egg donation; asking women to <b>donate</b> under various circumstances; to the consequences of <b>donating</b> their eggs; positively experiencing egg donation and to factors that would induce women to <b>donate.</b> Subjective norms and behavioural control also influenced intention to <b>donate.</b> Conclusion: A number of components of the TPB were able to predict possible oocyte donation, and non-oocyte donation. Practice implications: This study provides some empirical support for specific factors influencing cultural differences in gamete donation in the UK. A future culturally appropriate targeted approach to donation education could redress the present imbalance in supply and demand of gametes in infertility treatment...|$|R
