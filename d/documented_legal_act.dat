However, it is argued that those who developed the reform were not as concerned with the rights of citizens as with a nation-building agenda. The analysis of policy <b>documents</b> and <b>legal</b> <b>acts</b> demonstrates that the education reform has not institutionally affected the modes of language education. It is further argued that the reform actually discourages teaching of minority languages and, therefore, will inevitably produce further decline in numbers of students learning their 'native language'...|$|R

This essay contains an in-depth reading of the key governmental <b>documents</b> and <b>legal</b> <b>acts</b> that introduced the reform. Additionally, it comprises {{a description of the}} intensive critical discussion on the reform that, unfortunately, started only when the legislative process was nearly finished. Drawing from this debate and developing its interpretations, the essay analyses key institutional solutions of the reform; its fundamental assumptions; its rhetoric and, generally, its discursive background. Such solutions as: moving towards a more competition-based system of public funding for institutions and individuals; intensification of supervision based on quantitatively measured achievement, or enforcing a multi-level integration of public universities with the local business sector do not address the most urgent problems of the underfinanced and insecure students, PhD candidates and academics. In their naively individualistic approach, the reformers ignore the reflection on the social reproduction or the collective and structural aspects of scientific fields. Their monolithic vision of science leads them to imposing requirements developed for natural and technical disciplines upon social sciences and humanities. Finally, what they present as objective expert knowledge grounding the reform can be interpreted as based on deeply conservative economical and ethical assumptions as well as detached from a comprehensive empirical diagnosis...|$|R

Based on the analysis of archival <b>documents</b> and <b>legal</b> <b>acts</b> the authors conclude that the attitude of the state towards muslims in the Russian empire, despite all political changes, was based on the attempts to consolidate the indigenous component with the Russian ethnos. The events of 1905 year engendered from the muslim population of the country hope to change their situation, and strengthened the desire to religious autonomy. However, the government continues to build its policy so that controlled virtually all spheres of life of the Muslim community. The events of the First Russian revolution contributed to the birth of activity in the muslim world in defending their rights, which led to the manifestation of some exemptions from the state in relation to the Ummah. It was during this period muslims see an opportunity to assert their rights at the legislative level, form their own political movements and are part of the State Duma. Quite noticeable was the participation of Muslims in the Russian army during the First world war. In this regard not by chance that the muslims received the right to perform prayers and approval of the clergy of the muslim faith to the troops. In this case they were equalized in rights with the regimental priests. At the same time, despite the active position of the muslim community, however, by the beginning of 1917 still have quite a lot of unresolved issues and problems related to the device life of the muslim community.

Due to the high precision and clarity requirements {{that are associated with}} these texts, terminology appears {{to be one of the}} most difficult aspects when it comes to translating specialised documents. This difficulty is the main focus of this study.

In order to obtain the primary data used in the study, NATO’s new strategic concept from 2010 was translated from French to Swedish. The concept is supposed to guide the organisation during a ten-year period. Throughout the translation process both lexical and textual sources were used. The analysis was made in the light of different translation theories and models, which include Vinay and Darbelnet’s (1977) “direct” and “indirect” translation techniques, as well as Cabré’s (1992) theories and methods on terminology. The results show the complexity of the subject, and most importantly, that parallel texts, that is to say specialised documentation, can play an important role when it comes to translating specialised terms, since many of them are not to be found in ordinary dictionaries...|$|R
