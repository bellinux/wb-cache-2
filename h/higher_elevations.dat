5|$|Plectania nannfeldtii is {{typically}} found at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> in coniferous forests growing on wet twigs or other rotting woody debris, often {{in or near}} snow. It often begins its development underneath the snow, reaching maturity as the snowbank recedes to expose it; one source suggests that its metabolic heat may help it melt a path through snow as it grows. It may grow singly, scattered or in clusters, and has been noted to have a preference for the wood of Picea engelmannii and Abies lasiocarpa {{as well as other}} conifers. In North America, it is found in the Western United States and Canada, where it fruits from late May to early August; it is common in the Sierra Nevada and in <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> of the Pacific Coast Ranges. Its distribution also includes China and Japan.|$|E

5|$|All erosion types took {{advantage}} of preexisting weaknesses in the rock such as rock type, amount of lithification, {{and the presence of}} cracks or joints in the rock. Basalt flows concentrated in valleys but subsequent erosion removed sedimentary rock that once stood at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations.</b> The resulting inverted relief consists of ridges capped by basalt which are separated by adjacent drainages.|$|E
5|$|During the Quaternary Period (2.6million {{years ago}} up to today), {{deposits}} of windblown sand and alluvium covered {{much of the}} Chinle and Bidahochi. Older dunes {{range in age from}} 500,000years at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> {{in the northern part of}} the park to about 10,000years in sandy drainage areas such as Lithodendron Wash. Stabilized by grasses and other vegetation, young dunes of about 1,000years old are found throughout the park.|$|E
5|$|Glacier retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> are cooler, the {{disappearance}} of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E

5|$|Throughout their range, {{they live}} in forest and in forest edge habitat, similar to other deer species. In mountainous regions, they often dwell at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> in summer, {{migrating}} down slope for winter. The highly adaptable elk also inhabit semi-deserts in North America, such as the Great Basin. Manchurian and Alashan wapiti are primarily forest dwellers and their smaller antler size is a likely adaptation to a forest environment.|$|E
5|$|Across the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} Baja California peninsula, the storm dropped moderate rainfall, {{with a total of}} about 5inches (125mm) reported in Cabo San Lucas; the NHC remarked that higher amounts likely occurred in <b>higher</b> <b>elevations.</b> The rainfall caused minor flooding in and around Cabo San Lucas. Along {{the southern}} coast of the peninsula, Emilia produced tropical storm force winds; two stations reported sustained winds of 43mph (69km/h), with one of those reporting wind gusts to 55mph (89km/h). The storm caused minor damage to buildings and utility lines. Waves from the storm left minor damage at several marinas in the region, with several being closed for two days.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations.</b> This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 {{feet above the ground}} can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E

50|$|A similar pattern, {{known as}} the {{latitudinal}} diversity gradient, describes an increase in biodiversity from the poles to the equator. While the EDG generally follows the LDG (i.e., <b>high</b> <b>elevations</b> in tropical regions have greater biodiversity than <b>high</b> <b>elevations</b> in temperate regions), the LDG {{does not account for}} elevational changes.|$|R
50|$|Its <b>highest</b> <b>elevation</b> was Glittertinden in Norway at 2,470 metres (8,104 feet) {{above sea}} level, {{but since the}} glacier at its summit {{partially}} melted , the <b>highest</b> <b>elevation</b> is at 2,469 metres (8,100 feet) at Galdhøpiggen, also in Norway. These mountains also have the largest glacier on the mainland of Europe, Jostedalsbreen.|$|R
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, sea lions gather on both sandy and rocky shores. On warm days, they lie {{closer to the}} water. At night or in cool weather, they travel farther inland or to <b>higher</b> <b>elevations.</b> Non-breeding individuals may gather at marinas, wharves, or even navigational buoys. California sea lions can also live in fresh water for periods of time, such as near Bonneville Dam, nearly 150 miles up the Columbia River. In 2004 a healthy sea lion was found sitting on a road in Merced County, California, almost a hundred miles upstream from the San Francisco Bay and {{half a mile from}} the San Joaquin River.|$|E
5|$|Glaciation {{has played}} an {{important}} but incompletely understood role in the park. Glaciers existed throughout the park area {{during most of the}} Pleistocene with smaller ones persisting at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> until comparatively recent times. Lassen Peak is situated at a center from which many of these glaciers originated. Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose canyon is mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to be sitting in the depression carved by the Lost Creek Glacier.|$|E
5|$|In Puebla, {{a peasant}} died. Inland, 16persons {{were killed in}} the states of Mexico and San Luis Potosí, where heavy rains caused mudslides across <b>higher</b> <b>elevations.</b> In the latter, 11deaths were {{reported}} as two rivers had overflowed their banks while in the former, five people died. Moreover, six people riding in a taxi died in Veracruz during Calvin. Across Nayarit, Calvin brought heavy rains to the state. Later in its duration, Calvin struck the Baja California peninsula, though the storm had weakened considerably by that time Offshore, threeships containing 659immigrants were intercepted by the storm, but the ship sustained no damage.|$|E

5|$|In the Atlantic, Irene {{produced}} moderate {{rainfall and}} winds along its path, although impact was greatest in Nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane. A total of 96homes were destroyed, and 1,200people were left homeless. The rainfall resulted in widespread flooding, killing {{three people in}} Rivas. In neighboring Costa Rica, Hurricane Irene caused more than $1million (USD) in damage to the banana crop. Later, the remnants of Hurricane Olivia produced rainfall in the southwest United States. Flooding was reported near Yuma, Arizona, which closed a major highway, and the moisture produced snowfall in <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> in the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
5|$|On the {{neighboring}} islands of São Vicente and Santo Antão, the storm's impact was mostly limited to power outages, floods, and damaged crops. Santo Antão recorded light winds and 8in (200mm) of rain, although <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> received even greater quantities. In Porto Novo, 35people {{had to be}} relocated as floods swept through neighborhoods. The rainfall washed out the island's carrot, cabbage, and tomato plantations, especially {{in the vicinity of}} Alto Mira. On São Vicente, roads were closed in and around Laginha, and one person suffered minor injuries when a tree fell on their car. The combined cost for the two islands, mainly from infrastructural damage, totaled CVE$16million ($160,000).|$|E
5|$|Plant {{communities}} {{within the}} park vary with elevation. The TMD has two distinct communities, desert scrub—such as fourwing saltbush and brittlebrush—at the lowest elevations and desert grassland a little higher. The RMD includes these two communities as well as four more at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations,</b> oak woodland, pine–oak woodland, pine forest and, high in the Rincons, mixed conifer forest—Douglas-fir, Ponderosa pine, white fir, Gambel oak, and many other trees, shrubs, and understory plants. During annual inventories in 2011 and 2013, hundreds of scientists and thousands of volunteers identified 389 species of vascular plants, 25 of non-vascular plants, and 197 species of fungi in Saguaro National Park.|$|E
