5|$|Dietrich {{was tried}} in the County Court of Victoria in 1988 for a {{trafficking}} offence under the Customs Act 1901 and certain less serious charges.

He applied to the Supreme Court of Victoria for legal assistance, but was again turned down. Although Dietrich was acquitted of the fourth charge—regarding the possession of a quantity of heroin separate to that which was involved in the first three charges—he was convicted of the principal charge in the County Court.

5|$|In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court {{granted the}} writ to {{two members of}} the Burr conspiracy. Dr. Erick Bollman and Samuel Swartwout, having been apprehended in New Orleans, were transported to Charleston and then Baltimore on a navy vesselnotwithstanding the writs of habeas corpus issued by a {{territorial}} judge in New Orleans and a district judge in Charlestown. The United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia issued an arrest warrant for Bollman and Swartwout (who were already in military custody), slated the case for trial in D.C., and denied the prisoners bail; Judge William Cranch (also the Supreme Court's reporter of decisions) dissented in part on the ground that there was no probable cause for the arrest warrant as required by the Fourth Amendment. The Senate passed, but the House rejected, legislation that would have suspended the writ for three months and legalized Bollman and Swartwout's arrests.

5|$|On February 1, 1983, Yasui {{petitioned the}} Oregon federal {{district}} court for a writ of error coram nobis due {{to the discovery of}} the falsehoods promulgated by the Department of Justice. This writ is only available to people who have already completed their imprisonment, and can only be used to challenge factual errors from the case. Yasui claimed in his writ that the government withheld evidence at the original trial concerning the threat of a Japanese attack on the United States mainland. The court dismissed the original indictment and conviction against Yasui, as well as the petition for the writ on request by the government. Yasui, then appealed the decision to dismiss the petition, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on procedural grounds. However, the Ninth Circuit ultimately did vacate Hirabayashi's conviction, thereby impliedly vindicating Yasui as well. In 2011, the U.S. Solicitor General's office publicly confessed the Justice Department's 1943 ethical lapse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> Minoru Yasui died on November 12, 1986.|$|E
