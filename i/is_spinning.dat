Immediately after accepting the check, Sheriff Truman, Deputy Hawk, and Agent Cooper enter Horne's office. Truman arrests Horne for murder. Horne attempts to flee but is restrained and handcuffed.

5|$|IM Normae {{is one of}} {{only ten}} {{recurrent}} novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20times as massive as the Sun. The stellar wind from the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0km. 1E161348-5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-Ray source with a period of 6.67hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it <b>is</b> <b>spinning</b> much too slowly for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma repeater (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black hole is a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} premièred on August 26, 2010 on Vevo, and was {{directed}} by Hiro Murai. The video begins in a club environment, with misplaced furniture and a shattered glass bottle. The scene goes in reverse motion, people instantly appear, frozen in a raving action. As the scene is still reversing a DJ <b>is</b> <b>spinning</b> his booth, and the shattered glass bottle forms into its original state, the clubbers and the scene then start to move in forward but slow motion and the song begins with Usher approaching from a set of stairs. Usher sings and dances, whilst moving past clubbers who are still moving in slow motion whilst he is in moving normally. Once the chorus comes in, the clubbers begin dancing and raving in normal motion, periodically slowing down; Usher is krumping pass them, {{moving on to the}} next scene. Usher slides into a room with a large lit up window as a back drop. He performs choreography backed-up by female dancers for the second verse, and then returns to the original room with the second chorus coming in. A similar scene is involved to the first chorus, but this time Usher is dancing with the clubbers, who are still alternating in motion speed. Pitbull then begins his verse, and is sat in a V.I.P. area with three females, with the camera alternating between him, the clubbers and Usher. The video ends with its final scene, in a dance off, with Usher dancing adjacent to some of the clubbers. Once the climax of the chorus comes in, Usher jumps in the air and starts freely dancing along with the clubbers, with everyone in the same motion speed; Usher is primarily crip-walking. Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E

25|$|If {{the ball}} <b>is</b> <b>spinning</b> much {{more rapidly than}} it was moving, {{rotational}} friction will dominate. The ball's angular velocity will be reduced after impact, but its horizontal velocity will be increased. The ball will be propelled forward but will not exceed its original height, and will keep spinning in the same direction.|$|E
5000|$|Flax {{can either}} <b>be</b> <b>spun</b> from a distaff, {{or from the}} spinner's lap. Spinners keep their fingers wet when spinning, to prevent forming fuzzy thread.

25|$|Upon {{impacting}} the ground, some translational {{kinetic energy}} {{can be converted}} to rotational kinetic energy and vice-versa depending on the ball's impact angle and angular velocity. If the ball moves horizontally at impact, friction will have a 'translational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's motion. In the figure, the ball is moving to the right, and thus it will have a translational component of friction pushing the ball to the left. Additionally, if the ball <b>is</b> <b>spinning</b> at impact, friction will have a 'rotational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's rotation. On the figure, the ball <b>is</b> <b>spinning</b> clockwise, and the point impacting the ground is moving to the left with respect to the ball's center of mass. The rotational component of friction is therefore pushing the ball to the right. Unlike the normal force and the force of gravity, these frictional forces will exert a torque on the ball, and change its angular velocity (omega&).|$|E
25|$|A third {{approach}} to limiting slippage is {{taken by a}} Torsen differential. A Torsen differential allows the output shafts to receive different amounts of torque. This design does not provide for traction when one wheel <b>is</b> <b>spinning</b> freely, {{where there is no}} torque, but provides excellent handling in less extreme situations. A typical Torsen II differential can deliver up to twice as much torque to the high traction side before traction is exceeded at the lower traction side.|$|E
25|$|Ménière's disease (MD) is a {{disorder}} {{of the inner}} ear that is characterized by episodes of feeling like the world <b>is</b> <b>spinning</b> (vertigo), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), hearing loss, and a fullness in the ear. Typically only one ear is affected, at least initially; however, over time both ears may become involved. Episodes generally last from 20 minutes to a few hours. The time between episodes varies. The hearing loss and ringing in the ears may become constant over time.|$|E

25|$|Experienced players {{strive to}} master the {{conventional}} overhand serve to maximize its power and placement. The server may employ different types of serve including flat serve, topspin serve, slice serve, and kick (American twist) serve. A reverse type of spin serve is hit {{in a manner that}} spins the ball opposite the natural spin of the server, the spin direction depending upon right- or left-handedness. If the ball <b>is</b> <b>spinning</b> counterclockwise, it will curve right from the hitter's point of view and curve left if spinning clockwise.|$|E
25|$|A cutter is a fast {{ball that}} <b>is</b> <b>spinning,</b> that is, a {{delivery}} that is rotating around the opposite axis to the seam instead {{of keeping the}} seam straight. While this rotation is nowhere near as much as that achieved by a spin bowler, the small variations it can produce are still {{enough to make a}} batsman uncomfortable due to the speed of the ball. Cutters can be an effective way for a seam bowler to get the ball to move {{if he or she is}} not receiving much assistance from the pitch.|$|E

50|$|Long draw <b>is</b> the <b>spinning</b> {{technique}} {{used to create}} woolen yarns. It <b>is</b> <b>spun</b> from carded rolags. It <b>is</b> generally <b>spun</b> from shorter stapled fibers. Long draw <b>spun</b> yarns <b>are</b> light, lofty, stretchy, soft, and full of air, thus they are good insulators, and make good knitting yarns.|$|R
25|$|Seam {{deliveries}} can be bowled at any pace, {{but most}} specialist seamers bowl at medium, medium-fast or fast-medium pace. The basic technique of seam bowling is {{to employ the}} normal fast bowling or slower ball grip {{and to try to}} ensure that the seam remains upright until the ball hits the pitch. If the seam is upright and the ball <b>is</b> <b>spinning</b> around its horizontal axis, there is no appreciable Magnus effect and the ball will not move in the air. The seam of the ball is raised and will cause variations in bounce and movement if it is {{the first part of the}} ball to hit the pitch.|$|E
25|$|A ball {{rotating}} {{around the}} seam will move either {{right or left}} when it hits the pitch, depending on which way the ball <b>is</b> <b>spinning.</b> A ball bouncing to the right {{is said to be}} an off cutter as it is travelling from off stump to leg stump for a right-handed batsman. Conversely, a ball that bounces to the left is a leg cutter, travelling from leg to off stump for a right-handed batsman. Cutters are usually aimed so that they hit the pitch just outside the batsman's off stump and move away from the wicket. This will cause the ball to catch the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle and fly up to be caught in the slips.|$|E
25|$|Stroke is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which poor {{blood flow to the}} brain results in cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. They result in part of the brain not functioning properly. Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel {{on one side of the}} body, problems understanding or speaking, feeling like the world <b>is</b> <b>spinning,</b> or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than one or two hours it is known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mini-stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia or loss of bladder control.|$|E
