In an interview, lead singer Ariel explained the song's lyrics: [...] "There are amazing, wonderful, precious people in anguish because they don't {{have access to}} food. There are bright-eyed, adorable little girls forced {{to have sex with}} strangers for fourteen hours a day, and are drugged up if they fail to perform. And what do I do with information like that? <b>I</b> <b>shrug,</b> think about how sad it is, and hope that somebody will come along and do something about it. a Move" [...] brings up {{the fact that we do}} so freaking little with all this knowledge. We are selfish. I am selfish." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ulla Tessin was {{described}} as intellectual and educated. Her spouse left {{the management of the}} household economy on her; he also supported her interest to study history and botany, and she collected a substantial library. In her correspondence, she expressed her frustration and anger over the passive role imposed on women when the laws and customs of society deprived her of most positions in society: [...] "Does not men have their honor, their sword, their judge's caps, their politics, their horticulture etc? I have to admit <b>I</b> <b>shrug</b> to see something like the French Academy, assembled in full. A true usurpation, it should be composed entirely by women; but the beastly men usurp everything, is surprise me that they leave us the spindle and the sewing needle. Well, we must adjust, until it is our turn to write laws. Then we {{will have the opportunity to}} let them see the meaning of the right of the fittest." ...|$|E

[...] reproduces an article titled [...] "When 'They' Win, We All Lose," [...] written for a local magazine the month before, which begins, [...] "By {{the time you read}} this, my home health care business will be a memory... It happened because 'They' won." [...] Do I allow these bureaucratic agencies to bully their way into my office without notice to extort money from my company claiming my files aren't perfect? Do I put up with them dictating to me, forcing me to pay ridiculous outrageous fees to stay in business, and keep growing it to continually cover the government's greed for more which will be never ending? Or do <b>I</b> <b>shrug</b> my shoulders as 'Atlas Shrugged' did and say, you can keep your unnecessary, miserable, burdensome, over-taxation, over-regulated and over legislated BS because I won't participate with you anymore? I didn't realize when I threw those overbearing inspectors out of my office just how much I've tolerated.

40|$|An Equation for Addiction Wolfwalker {{pulls himself}} over the sand dune. A halfling {{in the middle}} of the Oasis of Marr, he is busy honing his druidic skills by hunting down a group of orcs that have been terrorizing {{traveling}} merchants and gypsies in the area. Spotting an orc priest, he casts a spell that commands local flora to ensnare the surprised orc. After Wolfwalker proceeds to pummel it with fire spells, the orc falls dead. He rifles through its pack and finds five silver coins, the spoils of combat. In a dark room, I chuckle to myself, and type in the commands to make Wolfwalker, my avatar on Everquest, sit down and recover from the fight. Glancing at the clock, I notice that it is five in the morning. School starts in a mere three hours. Pausing to consider this, <b>I</b> <b>shrug</b> and turn back to my computer— the only source of light in an otherwise pitch-black house. “Just kill one more orc, ” I mutter to myself, and realize that I won’t be getting any sleep.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my shoulders. Nevertheless, after a moment's {{deliberation}} I {{determined to}} make the attempt; if I succeeded something might come of it.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> again--shrugged in {{token of}} my despair and grief and impotence--and I {{moved down the}} long room towards the door where my mother waited.|$|R
60|$|There was {{accusation}} in her manner, and <b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> {{my shoulders}} in token that I was {{not guilty of}} the unknown crime imputed to me.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my {{shoulders}} while we seated ourselves, the Lady Yva and I on Oro's right, Bickley and Bastin on his left, as he indicated by pointing with his finger.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my shoulders. <b>I</b> privately {{thought that}} Poirot was rather too much given to these fantastic ideas. In this case, surely, {{the truth was}} only too plain and apparent.|$|R
60|$|It {{looked more}} and more like lunacy. However, there was nothing for it but to submit. <b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my {{shoulders}} and sat down in the arm-chair beside the empty fireplace.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my shoulders, {{but did not}} speak. I had {{no sympathy}} for Blanche Stroeve, but {{knew that it would}} only pain poor Dirk if I told him exactly what I thought of her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps {{both are}} equally needful,' said <b>I,</b> <b>shrugging</b> my shoulders. 'We have put our {{hands to the}} plough. But methinks I see the man for whom we wait coming down {{under the shadow of}} yonder line of pollard willows.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my shoulders. [...] "I am {{bound to}} believe it was for the same reason. I was horrified, at any rate, by the whole story. I was {{extremely}} shocked at the Countess's want of dignity in continuing to see the man by whose hand her husband had fallen." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my shoulders. [...] "What {{should keep}} me, Paul? I {{could not live}} here alone. Every stone and tree would be full of barren memories. No! to-morrow I go to London. I have sent all the {{servants}} away to-day, except Gomez. You will be with me early!" ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my shoulders. If he {{was going}} to take the matter that way, it was no good arguing with him. The idea crossed my mind, not for the first time, that poor old Poirot was growing old. Privately I thought it lucky that he had {{associated}} with him some one of a more receptive type of mind.|$|R
60|$|The {{footsteps}} {{of a man}} were clearly audible passing along the dusty little strip of road which fronted our cottage. Leaning forward I saw a tall, dark figure pass slowly by.

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my {{shoulders}} and turned away. No one came to let me out, but I undid the bolts myself, and stepped into my taxicab with a little breath of relief. Somehow or other I felt as though I had escaped from a danger which I could not define, and yet which I had felt with every breath I had drawn in that damp, unwholesome-looking house! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my shoulders. “You must remember, Miss Brewster, {{that you}} are a new {{inhabitant}} of this little world, and that you do not yet understand the laws which operate within it.

60|$|I had {{no plans}} and instead of {{answering}} <b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my shoulders and looked round the apartment. There was a statue of the Virgin upon my uncle's desk. I looked at its face, as he was wont {{to look in the}} midst of his labor. I saw there eternal peace. The air became luminous with an infinite net-work of the jeweled rings of Paradise descending in roseate clouds upon us.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my shoulders. It {{seemed that}} in any event the outcome of our plight must end in death. I was {{refreshed}} from my sleep, but still weak from loss of blood.

60|$|He {{gave his}} men {{the order to}} mount, and bade Monsieur de Lavedan enter the coach, whereupon Gilles shot me a glance of inquiry. For a second, as I stepped slowly after the Chevalier, I was minded to try armed resistance, and to convert that grey {{courtyard}} into a shambles. Then I saw betimes the futility of such a step, and <b>I</b> <b>shrugged</b> my shoulders in answer to my servant's glance.|$|R
