25|$|The {{species was}} first {{published}} as Agaricus luteus by the English mycologist James Bolton who described and illustrated it from a hothouse near Halifax in 1785.

50|$|It {{has also}} been speculated that {{another part of the}} plot device of a {{fugitive}} living a life on the run from the authorities was loosely inspired by Victor Hugo's 1862 novel Les Misérables, and that the Richard Kimble character was inspired by the novel's protagonist, Jean Valjean, an ex-convict living a life as a fugitive and having numerous aliases as well as helping people around him.
