The developing petroleum industry in the early 20th century provided the impetus for the development of accurate design methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method and the Fenske equation.

500|$|Although {{small size}} units, mostly made of glass, {{can be used}} in laboratories, {{industrial}} units are large, vertical, steel vessels [...] (see images 1 and 2) known as [...] "distillation towers" [...] or [...] "distillation columns". [...] To improve the separation, the tower is normally provided inside with horizontal plates or trays as shown in image 5, or the column is packed with a packing material. [...] To provide the heat required for the vaporization involved in distillation and also to compensate for heat loss, heat is most often added {{to the bottom of the}} column by a reboiler, and the purity of the top product can be improved by recycling some of the externally condensed top product liquid as reflux. [...] Depending on their purpose, <b>distillation</b> <b>columns</b> may have liquid outlets at intervals up the length of the column as shown in image 4.|$|E

The [...] "lightest" [...] products (those with the lowest boiling point) exit {{from the top of}} the columns and the [...] "heaviest" [...] products (those with the highest boiling point) exit from the bottom of the column and are often called the bottoms.|$|E

Invariant rectifying and stripping (IRS) curves are employed for thermodynamic analysis of a <b>distillation</b> <b>column.</b> Different configurations for side-exchanger integration are evaluated based on the exergetic efficiency of the distillation process and they are also compared with feed preheating options.

40|$|This paper focusses on the {{strategic}} {{steps in the}} design, operation and response of tray to tray temperature in a binary <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> {{to changes in the}} reflux flow rate. The temperature profile of a <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> is an important parameter in the determination of the column performance. A model for the tray dynamics in <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> is developed and used to determine the temperature profile of a binary <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> that have been subjected to sudden changes in reflux flow rate. These equations were forward tested and the results obtained were compared with those from literature and was discovered that the percentage error ranges from 0 – 10. Thus, the binary <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> equations presented in this paper for the response of tray to tray temperature due to sudden changes in reflux flow rate can be used to predict the tray to tray temperature in multi-component <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> that result from sudden changes in the reflux flow rate in such column. Hence, the developed model is suitable for the prediction of tray to tray temperature changes in any <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> due to changes in reflux flow rate. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this work, {{separation}} of multi-component mixture {{was conducted in}} a continuously fed laboratory scaled <b>distillation</b> <b>column.</b> Mixture including five components, namely methanol-ethanol-n buthanol-isoamine alcohol-anisol, was obtained from ethyl alcohol production plant and {{was used as a}} feed mixture. Stable control of packed <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> is of great importance for improvements of operation efficiency and higher product concentration. Decoupled multi-loop Unconstrained Model Predictive Controllers (MPC) are not carried out to manage to eliminate the effects of interactions among the control loops, but they generally become sluggish due to imperfect process models and a close control of the process is usually impossible in real practice. Based on its inherent unconstrained scheme, Constrained Model Predictive Control (CMPC) is employed to handle such highly interacting system. For high quality requirements, a two-input two-output model of the packed <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> is constructed. Constrained model predictive control is applied in packed <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> plant and operation of the process close to their optimum operating conditions is achieved.

Results indicate that the reactive dividing wall column presented both higher thermodynamic efficiencies and lower exergy losses than those obtained in the classical configurations of a reactor plus a <b>distillation</b> <b>column.</b> The reactive dividing wall <b>distillation</b> <b>column</b> also required lower energy consumption compared to that required by classical processes. These facts confirm the higher energy efficiency of reactive dividing wall designs. Results also indicate that the reactive dividing wall column meets process intensification goals: i) it requires lower energy consumption, which can be translated into lower carbon dioxide emissions, and ii) the reduction in energy consumption can be associated with lower traffic of liquid in the column and reduction in column diameter (miniaturization). Finally, it was observed that proper collection of the liquid in a side tank and an adequate split to both sides of the dividing wall {{play an important role in}} hydraulics. The manipulation of this split enables minimum energy consumption and high thermodynamic efficiency. 1...|$|R
