40|$|Heparin reduces {{development}} of erythrocyte-fibrin thrombi that form in regions of vascular stasis especially within the heart, in severely stenosed arteries sometimes engrafted on white thrombi, in acute arterial occlusions as <b>fresh</b> <b>tails</b> on existing thrombi, and within extremity and pelvic veins. Unfortunately, heparin use can {{be associated with}} severe bleeding, especially if not closely monitored...|$|E
40|$|Question: Low {{back pain}} is an {{increasing}} global health problem, which is associated with intervertebral disc (IVD) damage and de- generation. Major changes occur in the nucleus pulposus (NP), with the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) [1]. Further studies showed that growth factors from the transforming growth factor (TGF) and bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) family may induce chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) [2]. Focusing on non-viral gene therapies and their possible translation into the clinics, we investigated if GDF 6 (syn. BMP 13 or CDMP 2) can induce regeneration of degraded NP. We hypothesized that IVD transfected with plasmid over-expressing GDF 6 also up-regulates other NP- and chondrogenic cell markers and enhances ECM deposition. Methods: Bovine IVD cells were isolated by pronase/collagenase II overnight digestion. After monolayer expansion up to passage 3, cells were transfected with the plasmid pGDF 6 (RG 211366, Origene, SF) or with green fluorescence protein (GFP) control using the NeonÒ transfection system (Invitrogen, Basel), both equipped with a Cy- tomegalovirus (CMV) promotor to induce over-expression. We tested a range of yet unpublished parameters {{for each of the}} primary disc cells to optimize efficiency. To test a non-viral gene therapy applied directly to 3 D whole organ culture, bovine IVDs were harvested from <b>fresh</b> <b>tails</b> obtained from the abattoir within 5 h post-mortem [3]. Discs were then pre-incubated for 24 h in high glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium and 5...|$|E
50|$|Freekeh is {{mentioned}} {{in an early}} thirteenth-century Baghdad cook book as farīkiyya. In that recipe, meat is fried in oil and braised with water, salt, and cinnamon bark. Then, dried coriander is stirred in with young wheat ("freekeh") and is cooked. Finally, the meal is served with cumin, cinnamon, and <b>fresh</b> lamb <b>tail</b> fat.|$|R
40|$|Attributes for two {{value-added}} seafood products {{derived from}} underutilized crawfish are analyzed using conjoint data from seafood {{restaurants in the}} southern region of the United States. Preferences for the products' form, price, and flavor attributes were tested. Statistical tests revealed that the attribute interactions were not significant, and part-worth utilities for all main effects were estimated using an additive preference model. Results indicate that the new crawfish products should be marketed as a high-quality fresh soup base or seafood stuffing, priced between 30 % and 50 % {{of the cost of}} <b>fresh</b> crawfish <b>tail</b> meat.

40|$|Abstract. Measure {{content of}} <b>fresh</b> <b>tailing</b> sand {{in a certain}} skarn type copper mine {{selection}} tailing sand warehouse, lead, cadmium, arsenic, nickel and zinc elements, etc in old tailing sand by ICP-AES. Carry out eluviations test of tailing sand and leaching test of tailing sand by horizontal vibration method and Sulphuric-Nitric acid method respectively. Discuss with phase constitution of harmful elements such as arsenic in tailing sand by XRD analysis chromatogram of tailing sand. Compare with content analysis result and mineral constitution of related elements in raw mine on the basis. Research migration and distribution disciplines of associated harmful elements in raw mine to tailing sand by floatation. Test result shows that arsenic, zinc, cadmium and lead elements in raw mine deeply concentrated in tailing sand after mine selection. Percentage is 96. 89 %, 92. 0 %, 91. 65 % and 41. 12 % respectively. Main existence form of As in tailing sand is FeAsS (arsenopyrite). It intergrowth with pyrite (FeS 2); Zn mainly exists in a ZnS (sphalerite) form. Pb, Cd and As have migration trend from upstream to downstream of tailing sand warehouse and from shallow layer to deep layer. Dissolution rate of Cd, Cu, Zn, Cr and Pb under eluviation and weak acid leaching conditions is lower. However, they have release trend under acid conditions. Arsenic element is special as follows: It is undetected in various points during Sulphuric-Nitric digestion. However...|$|R
