[...] Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a B+ rating and wrote positively of the trivia plot, saying, [...] "When The Office reaches its next hiatus, and then its subsequent return, I’ll find myself hoping for more like the trivia side of 'Trivia', storylines that even after contrived introductions can simply sit back and let the character-driven jokes take over the narrative." [...] Chris Plante from New York magazine explained that [...] "If you plan to continue watching The Office, here’s my advice ... You need to forget the negative energy this show attracts. Start thinking of Season Eight like a reboot." [...] He concluded that [...] "The Office is not irreparable.

[...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, who was notably critical of the new season, called the episode [...] "charming." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White noted that the episode bore stylistic similarities to the third episode of the British version of the show, entitled [...] "The Quiz", writing that [...] "while 'Trivia' does loosely allude to that pub quiz with a bar trivia night, that turns out to be the only thing the two have in common." [...] She did, however, positively write about the humor of the episode, noting that, [...] "the writers squeezed some good laughs out of the idea, and it feels good to be laughing again at The Office." ...|$|E

I have done it before and I can do it again." [...] He also demanded, though there was no contractual requirement, that his cast members refrain from hiring personal managers or booking agents.

[...] Given the rise of the [...] "Little Godfreys" [...] from total obscurity due to their exposure on Godfrey's programs, no one was inclined to challenge him. [...] Despite his ability to bring in profits, CBS executives who respected Godfrey professionally disliked him personally, since he often baited them on and off the air, occasionally by name.
