5|$|The earlier {{theories}} of Newberry, Černý and Grdseloff {{said that the}} Egyptian state under Peribsen suffered from several civil wars, either economic or political in origin. If he was <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> putative misery in the past, this could explain why later king lists excluded Peribsen.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Fort Rosalie {{destroyed}} {{some of the}} Louisiana colony's most productive farms and endangered shipments of food and trade goods on the Mississippi River. As a result, the French state returned control of Louisiana from the French West India Company to the crown in 1731, as the company had been having trouble running the colony. Louisiana governor Étienne Périer was <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> massacre and its aftermath, and he was recalled to France in 1732.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} {{provoked a}} response from {{both sides in the}} conflict. U.S. commanders broadcast radio messages and dropped leaflets demanding the senior North Korean commanders be <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> atrocity. The North Korean commanders, concerned about the way their soldiers were treating prisoners of war, laid out stricter guidelines for handling enemy captives. Memorials were later constructed on Hill 303 by troops at nearby Camp Carroll, to honor the victims of the massacre.|$|E

5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not be <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> accident. It said that the failure of two teachers {{to meet up with}} the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July 1942, Mihailović sent a {{telegram}} to the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{asking them to}} publicly denounce Ljotić, Nedić and the openly collaborationist Chetnik leader Kosta Pećanac as traitors. The Yugoslav government-in-exile responded by doing so publicly over BBC Radio. In October, Ljotić was forced to withdraw his two representatives in the Serbian puppet government {{in order to avoid}} being <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> unpopular and difficult economic measures and food policies enacted by Nedić that month. With the surrender of Italy in September 1943, Montenegrin Chetnik commander Pavle Đurišić established ties with Ljotić. Ljotić later provided Đurišić with weapons, food, typewriters, and other supplies.|$|E

5|$|Stone was {{reportedly}} the first volunteer {{to enter the}} Union Army, and during the war {{he served as a}} general officer, noted for his involvement at the Battle of Ball's Bluff in October 1861. <b>Held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Union defeat, Stone was arrested and imprisoned for almost six months, mostly for political reasons. He never received a trial, and after his release he would not hold a significant command during the war again. Stone later served again with distinction as a general in the Egyptian Army, and is also noted for his role in constructing the base of the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|During Western Han, the Chancellor was {{the chief}} civil official. The duties of the {{chancellery}} were divided between a Right Chancellor (右丞相) and Left Chancellor (左丞相) between 196 and 180 BC. After 180 BC, the Left Chancellor's post was merely titular and its incumbent had no real authority. The Western Han Chancellor oversaw state finances, logistics for military campaigns, registers for land and population, maps of the empire's territories, annual provincial reports, high-profile lawsuits, and drafted the government budget. The Chancellor could directly appoint officials who were ranked 600-dan or below, while he was also able to recommend nominees to the emperor for recruitment to the senior roles in central government. The Chancellor was <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> actions of officials he recommended and appointed, yet he could also punish inadequate officials without the emperor's consent.|$|E
5|$|Harlan, who had later {{directed}} the propaganda movie Kolberg (1945), {{was the only}} film director of the Third Reich {{to be charged with}} crimes against humanity. Harlan defended himself asserting that he had been neither Nazi nor antisemitic. He claimed that Goebbels had controlled his work and that he should not be held personally responsible for its content. He recounted the ways in which he had been forced to endure Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film. In the end, the court condemned the film but exonerated the director. While Harlan had not acted nobly, the court recognized that he had operated under duress and should not be <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> content of the film.|$|E

5|$|In January 1837, Smith {{and other}} church leaders created a joint stock company, called the Kirtland Safety Society, {{to act as}} a quasi-bank; the company issued bank notes {{capitalized}} in part by real estate. Smith encouraged the Latter Day Saints to buy the notes, and he invested heavily in them himself, but the bank failed within a month. As a result, the Latter Day Saints in Kirtland suffered intense pressure from debt collectors and severe price volatility. Smith was <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> failure, and there were widespread defections from the church, including many of Smith's closest advisers. After a warrant was issued for Smith's arrest on a charge of banking fraud, Smith and Rigdon fled Kirtland for Missouri in January 1838.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Kronan {{was a hard}} {{blow for}} Sweden during the Scanian War. Besides being {{the largest and most}} heavily armed ship in the Swedish Navy, she had been an {{important}} status symbol for the monarchy of the young Charles XI. Along with Kronan, the navy lost a sizeable proportion of its best manpower, acting supreme commander Lorentz Creutz, numerous high-ranking fleet officers, and the chief of the navy medical staff. A commission was set up to investigate whether any individuals could be <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Swedish fiasco at the Battle of Öland and other major defeats during the war. Although no one was officially held accountable, Creutz has been blamed by many historians for the sinking of Kronan because of his naval and command inexperience. Recent research has provided a more nuanced picture, and points to Sweden's general lack of a well-developed naval organization and officer corps at the time.|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, sailors on the USS America (CV-66) {{spent about}} 1,700hours to assist Guantánamo Bay in recovery. The sole {{survivor}} of the sinking boat carrying Cuban exiles was tried in a military tribunal. The man was <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 44boat deaths and was quickly executed. The United States Coast Guard deployed boats, helicopters, and airplanes to find victims of the boat capsized in the Straits of Florida. In the United States, the price for lettuce and tomatoes rose due to Inez's crop damage in Florida and reduced crop output in California. The country's military sent helicopters and planes to join the Mexican Air Force, as well as trucks by land, to deliver tons of supplies, including food, clothing, and medicine to flood-affected areas in Tamaulipas. In the weeks after the storm, many residents had minimal food access, and some areas remained flooded. Conditions in Tampico, located near where the storm moved ashore, gradually returned to normal. Heavy rainfall in Mexico restored reservoirs, which assisted future crop growing.|$|E

5|$|In March 1979, when Gaven {{was twenty}} years old, {{she served as}} the {{replacement}} actress for the character Betty Rizzo in the original Broadway production of Grease. This was her Broadway debut. In late 1980, she was cast in the lead role of Janet in the musical The Rocky Horror Show that ran for six nights at Warner Theatre. It {{tells the story of}} a couple, Brad and Janet, who find themselves lost one night and end up in the laboratory of an alien doctor. The cast, including Gaven, was praised by critics. In 1984, she played a Londoner in the revival of Oliver! at Broadway and was the understudy for the major role of Nancy. That same year, in the Broadway revival of Zorba, Gaven played the role of The Widow who is eventually stoned to death by the townspeople after being <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> suicide of a young boy who fell in love with her. She then portrayed the character Luisa, the wife of an Italian film director, in a production of Nine at An Evening Dinner Theater in 1985.|$|E
5|$|This tranquility {{lasted until}} 542/543 {{when the great}} plague arrived in Africa and caused many casualties, {{especially}} {{among members of the}} army. In addition, in early 543 the Moors in Byzacena became restive. Solomon executed the brother of the chieftain Antalas, whom he <b>held</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> disturbances, and ceased the subsidies granted to Antalas, alienating the powerful and hitherto loyal chieftain. At the same time, Solomon's nephew Sergius, newly named governor of Tripolitania as a token of Emperor Justinian's gratitude (along with his brother Cyrus in the Pentapolis), caused the outbreak of hostilities with the tribal confederation of the Leuathae when his men killed 80 of their leaders at a banquet. Although in a subsequent battle near Leptis Magna he was victorious, in early 544 Sergius was forced to travel to Carthage and seek his uncle's aid. The rebellion spread quickly from Tripolitania to Byzacena, where Antalas joined it. Joined by his three nephews, Solomon marched against the Moors as they assembled, meeting them near Theveste. Last-minute diplomatic overtures to the Leuathae failed, and the two armies clashed at Cillium, on the border of Numidia and Byzacena. The Byzantine army was riven by disunity, with many soldiers refusing to fight or doing so only reluctantly. The contemporary poet Flavius Cresconius Corippus even accused Guntharis of treason, alleging that he withdrew from the line with his troops, causing a general and disorderly Byzantine retreat. Solomon and his bodyguard stood their ground and resisted but at last they were forced to retreat. Solomon's horse stumbled and fell in a ravine, wounding its rider. With the aid of his guards, Solomon remounted, but they were quickly overcome and slain.|$|E
