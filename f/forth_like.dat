25|$|Gaye was {{inspired}} by the Black Panther Party and supported the efforts they put <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> giving free meals to poor families door to door, however, he did not support the violent tactics the Panthers used to fight oppression, as Gaye's messages in many of his political songs were nonviolent. The lyrics and music of What's Going On discuss and illustrate issues during the 1960s/1970s such as police brutality, drug abuse, environmental issues, anti-war, and black power issues. Gaye {{was inspired}} to make this album because of events such as the Vietnam War, the 1967 race riots in Detroit, and the Kent State shootings.|$|E
25|$|She {{was dressed}} for {{traveling}} and for cold weather. Her hood {{was large and}} round and red but not smooth, — it was corrugated; that is to say, it consisted {{of a series of}} rolls nearly as large as my arm, passing over her head sidewise, growing smaller toward the back until they terminated in a big button that was embellished with a knot of green ribbon. Its general appearance was not unlike that of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally. The broad, white ruffle of her lace cap projected several inches beyond the front of the hood and waved back and <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> the single leaves of a great white poppy, as she nodded emphatically in her discourse.|$|E
500|$|In the summer, {{water would}} be used to sluice and pan the dirt, {{separating}} out the heavier gold from gravel. This required miners to construct sluices, which were sequences of wooden boxes [...] long, through which the dirt would be washed; up to 20 of these might be needed for each mining operation. The sluices in turn required lots of water, usually produced by creating a dam and ditches or crude pipes. [...] "Bench gold" [...] mining on the hill sides could not use sluice lines because water could not be pumped that high up. Instead, these mines used rockers, boxes that moved back and <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> a cradle, to create the motion needed for separation. Finally, the resulting gold dust could be exported out of the Klondike; exchanged for paper money at the rate of $16 ($430) per troy ounce (ozt) through one of the major banks that opened in Dawson City, or simply used as money when dealing with local traders.|$|E

These traits have earned her the nickname [...] "Yum Yum The Paw." ...|$|R
500|$|Players {{dispatch}} enemies {{by either}} thrusting {{at them with}} his Dragon Sword or by defeating them using Power Boosting Items. These special items consume Ryu's [...] "ninja power", also located {{on the top of}} the screen. Power Boosting Items include the following: shurikens; [...] "Windmill Throwing Stars" [...] that move back and <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> a boomerang; [...] "The Art of the Fire Wheel" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally upwards; [...] "Fire Dragon Balls" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally downwards; and the [...] "Invincible Fire Wheel" [...] that creates a barrier of three fireballs around Ryu, destroying any enemy that touches them. These items can be found in various crystal balls scattered throughout the levels, and they can be switched out by collecting another Power Boosting Item. The amount of ninja power used depends on the type of Power Boosting Item used. At the end of each Act Ryu fights a boss which has its own strength meter, located {{on the top of the}} screen. The boss's strength meter decreases every time the player damages it, and the boss is destroyed when the player completely depletes its strength meter.|$|E
500|$|Verlaine and Lloyd interplayed their guitars {{around the}} rhythm section's drum hits and basslines. Their dual playing drew on 1960s rock and avant-garde jazz styles, abandoning the layered power chords of {{contemporary}} punk rock {{in favor of}} melodic lines and counter-melodies. Verlaine established the song's rhythmic phrase, against which Lloyd played dissonant melodies. Lloyd had learned to notate his solos {{by the time they}} recorded Marquee Moon, allowing him to develop his solo for a song from introduction to variation and resolution. The two traded rhythmic and melodic lines several times on some songs while producing tension. [...] "There weren't many bands where the two guitars played rhythm and melody back and <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> a jigsaw puzzle", Lloyd said. Most of the solos on Marquee Moon followed a pattern wherein Verlaine ran up a major scale but regressed slightly after each step. On [...] "See No Evil", he soloed through a full octave before playing a blues-influenced riff, and on the title track, he played in a Mixolydian mode and lowered the seventh by half a step. Lloyd opened [...] "Friction" [...] by playing octaves before Verlaine's ringing harmonics and series of descending scales.|$|E
500|$|Historians {{have not}} been kind to Gebhard. E.A. Benians, in the Cambridge Modern History, {{was perhaps the most}} generous: [...] "Few men {{personally}} insignificant have made more stir in the world." [...] Walter Goetz described him in less complimentary terms: he [...] "was impelled by no great idea, nor could he claim through virile activity the title to any high striving ambition" [...] and was [...] "wanting in both depth and tenacity". [...] Goetz was not particularly kind to Ernst either: [...] Ernst was not Gebhard's superior; the victory that placed him in the Electorate belonged to his brothers' influence and to that of the Curia (papacy), not to his own striving ambition; Ernst was, fundamentally, riding on the Counter Reformation tide that lifted all boats. [...] Philip Motley described Gebhard thus: despite his swearing an oath to renounce his See if he should marry, [...] "the love of Truchsess for Agnes Mansfeld had created disaster, not only for himself but for all of Germany." [...] Like Goetz, he describes both Gebhard and Ernst as cut from the same cloth: [...] "two pauper Archbishops without men or means of their own were pushed back and <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> puppets, by the highwaymen" [...] on either side, while murder and robbery, in the name of Catholicism and Protestantism, were the [...] "for a time the only motive or result of the contest." ...|$|E

500|$|Ryu can defeat enemies {{by attacking}} with his Dragon Sword or by using {{secondary}} weapons which consume Ryu's [...] "ninja power"; such weapons include the following: [...] "Windmill Throwing Stars" [...] which {{move back and}} <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> boomerangs, [...] "Fire Dragon Balls" [...] which launch fireballs downward at an angle, the [...] "Fire Wheel Art" [...] which launches fireballs upward at an angle, the [...] "Invincible Fire Wheel" [...] that forms a series of rotating of fireballs around Ryu and destroys any enemy who comes into contact, and a new weapon in this series called the [...] "Vacuum Wave Art" [...] which hurls vacuum blades above and below Ryu simultaneously. Players can collect red and blue capsules to refill Ryu's ninja power, and they can also collect [...] "Scrolls {{of the spirit of}} the Dragon" [...] to increase Ryu's maximum ninja power level. Another new item in Ninja GaidenIII is the [...] "Dragon Spirit Sword" [...] that increases Ryu range of his sword. At the end of each Act is a boss which has its own life meter that decreases when damaged; Ryu can defeat the boss by completely depleting its life meter. Ninja GaidenIIIs first four bosses consist of the [...] "bio-noids"– super-human creatures created and controlled by Foster to take over the world; they each represent the four elementals: earth, wind, fire, and water.|$|E
500|$|Gyromancer {{received}} a generally positive reception from reviewers. While many critics noted its similarity to Puzzle Quest, the gameplay was still {{described as being}} [...] "fun and addictive" [...] by Brett Todd of GameSpot, and similar praises were made by Daemon Hattfield of IGN and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh. Welsh claimed {{that it had a}} great deal of replay value, and praised the [...] "surprisingly varied story missions". Game Informers Matt Miller disagreed slightly, stating that while the game had some replay value, it was limited by the lack of depth to the RPG elements of the game. Although the paintings of the monsters and game world were rated highly by critics, the art direction itself was criticized. Todd called the graphics [...] "murky and grainy" [...] and noted the lack of animation in the battles or cutscenes, in which two-dimensional pictures of the characters speaking [...] "slide back and <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> cardboard cutouts" [...] rather than perform realistic movements. Welsh added that the stage maps were [...] "crudely portrayed". Hattfield did not share those concerns, but did note say that they felt that the portraits of monsters were reused for different monsters too often. Miller disagreed completely with the other critics, saying that the game [...] "looks great" [...] and that [...] "even the map screen between battles has a polished appearance". A reviewer from GameTrailers also enjoyed the aesthetic of the game, saying that despite the [...] "still images" [...] and [...] "simple effects", the game made an [...] "effort to look and sound the part" [...] of a deeper game, which they felt would increase the player's enjoyment.|$|E
500|$|Rehearsals {{began at}} Broadway's Belasco Theatre on February 2, 1949. [...] There was no formal chorus; {{each of the}} nurses and Seabees was given a name, and, {{in the case of}} the men, $50 to equip {{themselves}} with what clothing they felt their characters would wear from the military surplus shops which lined West 42nd Street. Don Fellows, the first Lt. Buzz Adams, drew on his wartime experience as a Marine to purchase a non-regulation baseball cap and black ankle boots. [...] Martin and Pinza had not known each other, but they soon formed a strong friendship. [...] Of the mood backstage, [...] "everyone agreed: throughout the rehearsals Logan was fiery, demanding, and brilliantly inventive." [...] He implemented lap changes (pioneered by Rodgers and Hammerstein in Allegro), whereby the actors coming on next would already be on a darkened part of the stage as one scene concluded. This allowed the musical to continue without interruption by scene changes, making the action almost seamless. [...] He soon had the Seabees pacing back and <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> caged animals during [...] "There Is Nothing Like a Dame", a staging so effective it was never changed during the run of the show. One Logan innovation that Rodgers and Hammerstein reluctantly accepted was to have Cable remove his shirt during the blackout after he and Liat passionately embrace on first meeting, his partial nakedness symbolizing their lovemaking. As originally planned, Martin was supposed to conclude [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy" [...] with an exuberant cartwheel across the stage. [...] This was eliminated after she vaulted into the orchestra pit, knocking out Rittman.|$|E

2500|$|Shevchenko {{began writing}} poetry while still being a serf, and in 1840 his first {{collection}} of poetry, Kobzar, was published.

2500|$|Boromir {{accompanied}} Frodo {{south from}} Rivendell with the Fellowship. Before departing, he blew the Horn of Gondor loudly, {{saying that he}} [...] "would not go <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> a thief into the night". Elrond, lord of the Elves in Rivendell, warned him not to blow the horn again until he had reached the border of Gondor. On the journey south, Boromir frequently questioned the wisdom of their leader, Gandalf the Wizard. Boromir did, however, prove himself a valuable companion on the Fellowship's attempt to pass over the Misty Mountains: he advised that firewood be collected before the attempt to climb Caradhras, and this saved the Fellowship from freezing to death. In the retreat from Caradhras, Boromir's strength and stamina was evident as he burrowed through shoulder-high snowbanks alongside Aragorn, in order to clear the path back down the mountain.|$|E

2500|$|Whilst on tour, {{the band}} became reacquainted with Claritys {{producer}} Mark Trombino, {{and decided to}} work with him once again for their forthcoming album. Trombino also produced the band's second studio album, Static Prevails (1996), and their commercial breakthrough, Bleed American (2001). Jimmy Eat World subsequently began recording tracks at their home studio and rehearsal space, Unit 2 in Tempe, Arizona. After [...] "taking [...] songs as far as [...] could," [...] the band emailed them to Trombino, who was based in Los Angeles. Jim Adkins remarked, [...] " [...] would do a mix of it and add production ideas and we would just kind of go back and <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> that. [...] is the wizard at computers, and the history that we have working with him we don't have with anybody else, so it made sense on the familiarity level and the ease of working level." [...] Although the band and Trombino spent little time together in the studio, Trombino joined Jimmy Eat World [...] "a couple of times", with Adkins travelling to Los Angeles to join Trombino during the mixing process. Regarding the overall recording process, Adkins stated: [...] "I could definitely see our approach being a standard working method in the future for a lot of people. It frees up a lot of our geographic restrictions for both the producer and the band; it's not just someone next door." ...|$|E
