5|$|Anbe Vaa {{marked the}} first time AVM Productions had written a script to suit an actor's image and acting style; prior to this they had chosen actors to fit an already {{completed}} script. AVM Productions' founder A. V. Meiyappan's son M. Saravanan, one of the film's producers, recalled in 2013 that, as a fan of M. G. Ramachandran, it was his wish to see him act under the AVM banner. For several days <b>he</b> <b>hesitated</b> to tell his father about this choice, but when he did, he showed support. While Tirulokchandar was writing the script, Meiyappan suggested approaching Ramachandran for the lead role. Tirulokchandar found this intriguing, as the script's genre was dissimilar to what Ramachandran was noted for: action-adventure or social and family dramas which portrayed him as a champion for the downtrodden.|$|E
5|$|Even though Johnson {{had been}} given a mandate to take {{military}} action against North Vietnam and their Viet Cong allies in South Vietnam, <b>he</b> <b>hesitated</b> to take further steps to retaliate against North Vietnam. Towards the end of 1964, Johnson {{was in the midst of}} a presidential election and he did not want the U.S. public to believe that he was leading their country into war. Therefore, Johnson decided to wait until after the election, when his presidency was assured, that he would decide on other military moves. Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam continued to worsen; in August 1964, South Vietnamese General Lan Van Phat tried to overthrow General Nguyễn Khánh, but the coup was aborted and Phat handed power to Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, and Generals Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. However, on 20 December 1964, Khánh formed a new military junta with Kỳ and Thi and the civilian-led High National Council was subsequently dissolved. Thus, the South Vietnamese Government was once again plunged into chaos.|$|E

5|$|In his {{newspaper}} Berliner Arbeiterzeitung (Berlin Workers Newspaper), Gregor Strasser was {{highly critical of}} Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote. However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent {{of the vote in}} some regions. This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders. After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector. In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But <b>he</b> <b>hesitated,</b> as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.|$|E
5|$|While solving cases, Lili {{eventually}} learns from Hiromi's elder sister, , that Hiromi's allergy {{to girls}} resulted from her: ten years ago, he {{waited in the}} rain for Lili to show after he left her a love letter. Lili encounters , a fortuneteller and hypnotist who kidnaps her father. After Hiromi rescues him, Zeus takes Hiromi captive and demands the star ring in exchange. Realizing that Sirius is her missing mother, Lili frees her from Zeus's hypnosis. Lili learns that her mother disappeared to protect her family from Zeus, who hates Sirius, as he believes that she kidnapped his girlfriend and caused her to become comatose. Lili uncovers the truth: his girlfriend feared that he desired the star ring more than her love and asked Sirius to stage a kidnapping and have him decide between her or the star ring. When <b>he</b> <b>hesitated,</b> she was devastated and threw herself off the cliff. After learning this, Zeus loses his desire for the star ring and lets Lili, Hiromi, and Lili's mother leave. Lili accepts Hiromi's love for her. In the conclusion, Lili's mother takes over her fortune-telling business, and Lili continues to solve crimes with Hiromi's assistance.|$|E
5|$|Ziskin {{initially}} considered hiring Buck Henry {{to write}} the adaptation, finding Fight Club similar to the 1967 film The Graduate, which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered Peter Jackson the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film The Frighteners in New Zealand. Bryan Singer received the book but did not read it. Danny Boyle met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. David Fincher, who had read Fight Club and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. <b>He</b> <b>hesitated</b> to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film Alien 3 for the studio. To repair {{his relationship with the}} studio, he met with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic. In August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation of Fight Club.|$|E

25|$|Late on July 4, Meade held {{a council}} {{of war in}} which his corps commanders agreed that the army should remain at Gettysburg until Lee acted, and that the cavalry should pursue Lee in any retreat.

By the morning of July 5, Meade learned of Lee's departure, but <b>he</b> <b>hesitated</b> to order a general pursuit until he had received the results of Warren's reconnaissance.|$|E

25|$|In 1765, Commerson {{was invited}} to join Bougainville's expedition. <b>He</b> <b>hesitated</b> in {{accepting}} because he was often in poor health; he required Baret's assistance as a nurse {{as well as in}} running his household and managing his collections and papers. His appointment allowed him a servant, paid as a royal expense, but women were completely prohibited on French navy ships at this time. At some point, the idea of Baret disguising herself as a man in order to accompany Commerson was conceived. To avoid scrutiny, she was to join the expedition immediately before the ship sailed, pretending to be a stranger to Commerson.|$|E
25|$|One {{scene in}} the film depicts Liddell falling early in a 440-yard race in a Scotland–France dual meet and making up a 20-yard deficit to win; the actual race was during a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England and Ireland at Stoke-on-Trent in England in July 1923. Liddell was knocked to the ground several strides into the race. <b>He</b> <b>hesitated,</b> got up and pursued his opponents, 20 yards ahead. He caught the leaders shortly before the finish line and {{collapsed}} after crossing the tape. This scene was filmed at Goldenacre stadium in Edinburgh, the playing fields of George Heriot's School in Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|Two days later, Riesch's 13,000-man Left Column {{advanced}} against Jean Moreau's French {{army in the}} Battle of Hohenlinden. The 22,000-strong Left Center Column made rapid {{progress on}} the main highway while Riesch's men struggled along muddy forest trails in snowy weather. Because of the delay, Antoine Richepanse's flanking column passed across Riesch's front and crashed into the rear of Johann Kollowrat's Left Center column. Under the circumstances, Riesch might have punished the French soldiers, but <b>he</b> <b>hesitated.</b> After taking extra time to concentrate his column on the heights of Albaching, he unwisely proceeded to divide his force into a reserve and five task forces before advancing.|$|E

25|$|Assad {{was now in}} control, but <b>he</b> <b>hesitated</b> to {{push his}} advantage. Jadid {{continued}} to rule Syria, and the Regional Command was unchanged. However, Assad influenced Jadid to moderate his policies. Class struggle was muted, criticism of reactionary tendencies of other Arab states ceased, some political prisoners were freed, a coalition government was formed (with the Ba'ath Party in control) and the Eastern Front—espoused by Assad—was formed with Iraq and Jordan. Jadid's isolationist policies were curtailed, and Syria reestablished diplomatic relations with many of its foes. Around this time, Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt, Houari Boumediene's Algeria and Ba'athist Iraq began sending emissaries to reconcile Assad and Jadid.|$|E
25|$|On August 20, 1057, Isaac Komnenos {{drew out}} his forces and {{arranged}} them for battle at a plain called, according to Michael Attaleiates, Polemon or Haidos.

On the imperial side, Prince Aaron was stationed on the left wing, Basil Tarchaneiotes was positioned on the right, and the centre was commanded by Theodore the Eunuch. The imperial left wing under Prince Aaron completely routed the rebel right wing.

Sumner managed this part of the battle erratically, selecting regiments for combat from multiple brigades almost at random. By the time all of these units reached the front, the two sides were at rough paritytwo brigades each. Although Magruder had been conservative about his attack, Sumner was even more so. Of the 26 regiments he had in his corps, only 10 were engaged at Savage's Station.|$|E

25|$|Late on July 4, Meade held {{a council}} {{of war in}} which his corps commanders agreed that the army should remain at Gettysburg until Lee acted, and that the cavalry should pursue Lee in any retreat. Meade decided to have Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren take a {{division}} from Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick's VI Corpsthe most lightly engaged of all the Union corps at Gettysburgto probe the Confederate line and determine Lee's intentions. Meade ordered Butterfield {{to prepare for a}} general movement of the army, which he organized into three wings, commanded by Sedgwick (I, III, and VI Corps), Maj. Gen. Henry W.

25|$|Magruder {{was forced}} {{to give up the}} two brigades from Huger's {{division}} at 2 p.m. and was faced with the problem of attacking Sumner's 26,600 men with his own 14,000. <b>He</b> <b>hesitated</b> until 5 p.m., when he sent only two and a half brigades forward. Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw commanded the left flank, Brig. Gen. Paul J. Semmes the center, and Col. William Barksdale (Griffith's Brigade) the right. Franklin and Brig. Gen. John Sedgwick were on a reconnaissance to the west of Savage's Station when they saw Kershaw's brigade approaching. Their immediate assumption was that these were men from Heintzelman's corps, but they soon realized their mistake. This was the first indication of Heintzelman's unannounced departure and Sumner, for one, was particularly outraged, refusing to speak to Heintzelman the following day. Union artillery opened fire and pickets were sent forward to meet the assault.|$|E
25|$|In 1803, Irish poet Thomas Moore {{arrived in}} Bermuda, having been {{appointed}} registrar to the Admiralty there. Robert Kennedy, born in Cultra, County Down, was the Government of Bermuda's Colonial Secretary, {{and was the}} acting Governor of Bermuda on three occasions (1829, 1830 and 1835–1836). Irish prisoners were again sent to Bermuda in the 19th century, including participants in the ill-fated Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848 and Nationalist journalist and politician John Mitchel. Alongside English convicts, {{they were used to}} build the Royal Naval Dockyard on Ireland Island. Conditions for the convicts were harsh, and discipline was draconian. In April, 1830, convict James Ryan was shot and killed during rioting of convicts on Ireland Island. Another five convicts were given death sentences for their parts in the riots, with those of the youngest three being commuted to transportation (to Australia) for life. In June, 1849, convict James Cronin, on the hulk Medway at Ireland Island, was placed in solitary confinement from the 25th to the 29th for fighting. On release, and being returned to work, he refused to be cross-ironed. He ran onto the breakwater, brandishing a poker threateningly. For this, he was ordered to receive punishment (presumably flogging) on Tuesday, the 3rd of July, 1849, with the other convicts aboard the hulk assembled behind a rail to witness. When ordered to strip, <b>he</b> <b>hesitated.</b> Thomas Cronin, his older brother, addressed him and, while brandishing a knife, rushed forward to the separating rail. He called out to the other prisoners in Irish and many joined him in attempting to free the prisoner and attack the officers. The officers opened fire. Two men were killed and twelve wounded. Punishment of James Cronin was then carried out. Three-hundred men of the 42nd Regiment of Foot, in barracks on Ireland Island, responded to the scene under arms.|$|E
