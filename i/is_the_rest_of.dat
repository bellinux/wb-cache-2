5|$|According to the 2006 Nigerian census, the Enugu {{metropolitan}} area has an estimated population of 722,664. This estimate along with population estimates of other Nigerian cities have been disputed with accusations of population inflation and deflation {{in favour of}} {{the northern part of}} the country. The population of Enugu is predominantly Christian, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> southeastern Nigeria. Like the rest of Nigeria most people in Enugu speak Nigerian English alongside the dominant language in the region. In this case the dominant language is Igbo. Nigerian English, or pidgin (a mix of English and indigenous words) is often used because of ethnic diversity and sometimes because of the diversity of dialects in the Igbo language. In cultural and linguistic terms Enugu is within the Northern cluster of the Igbo region which includes other towns and cities like Awka and Nsukka.|$|E
5|$|In Brazil, the Bororo people {{incorporate}} {{the stars of}} Auriga into a massive constellation representing a caiman; its southern stars represent {{the end of the}} animal's tail. The eastern portion of Taurus <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the tail, while Orion is its body and Lepus is the head. This constellation arose because of the prominence of caymans in daily Amazonian life. There is evidence that Capella was significant to the Aztec people, as the Late Classic site Monte Albán has a marker for the star's heliacal rising. Indigenous peoples of California and Nevada also noticed the bright pattern of Auriga's stars. To them, the constellation's bright stars formed a curve that was represented in crescent-shaped petroglyphs. The indigenous Pawnee of North America recognized a constellation with the same major stars as modern Auriga: Alpha, Beta, Gamma (Beta Tauri), Theta, and Iota Aurigae.|$|E
