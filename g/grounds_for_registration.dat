Therefore, to be registered at a particular address (which is recorded then in the registration card and stamped in the internal passport), a person must provide <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration.</b> These <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> are a property certificate, a rental contract, an authorization to occupy a publicly-owned apartment/house (“order”) or the like. If there are no such documents, the official written consent from the property owner(s), if it is a private property, and from the household head and all the adult members of his/her family registered in this apartment/house, if it is a public or corporate property, is required.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis {{is to provide}} general {{requirements}} for the registrability of trademarks and to analyse particular <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> refusal of <b>registration</b> of trademarks according to czech law. The thesis is composed of four main chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of czech trademark law. Chapter One outlines brief history {{of the very first}} legislation dealing with trademarks and their registrability until recent days. Chapter Two is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis and also presents categories of trademarks. The chapter is subdivided into five parts. Part One deals wiht national trademarks, part Two focuses on international trademarks, part Three deals with well-known trademarks. The last part presents the Nice clasification established by the Nice Agreement. Chapter Three provides an outline of all absolute <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> refusal of <b>registration</b> of trademarks under the czech law. The chapter concentrates on particular absolute grounds; the chapter is subdivided into ten parts, each of them dealing with one particular absolute ground. The chapter also illustrates the approach to decision-making by trial courts and practice of competent authorities. Chapter Four concentrates on all relative <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> refusal of <b>registration</b> of trademarks under czech [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Two {{volumes of}} {{interest}} (VOI), each encompassing a kidney {{were selected from}} each volume. We test the effectiveness of our algorithm by registering the entire VOI sequence of each patient to a reference VOI. Each kidney had a different reference VOI. For different cases, different pre- and postcontrast VOIs were chosen as reference. Saliency maps were calculated for each slice of a VOI and saliency information from these maps was used to define the utility measure of each voxel. For every reference-floating VOI pair, the floating VOI is transformed according to the scheme outlined in Section 2.4 and for each candidate transformation parameter, the QMI-based similarity measure (6) is calculated. The candidate transformation parameters that give the maximum value of QMI are used to get the final transformation. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using the <b>ground</b> truth <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> provided by a clinical expert.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the quality of}} certain legal procedures applied in domestic trademark legislation {{in the light of}} harmonizing our legislation with those of the EU. Trademark Law in the Republic of Serbia (2009) does not rely on opposition proceedings as a phase in the process of trademark registration and a tool that would ensure that only those trademarks that fulfill the necessary conditions are granted legal protection. Intellectual Property Office examines the so-called relative <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> trademark <b>registration</b> refusal but does so ex officio, thus preventing the holders of trademark rights from benefiting from a relatively inexpensive and effective opposition procedure regarding the registration of a second trademark which violates their previously established rights. In contrast to our trademark laws, EU Council Regulation 207 / 2009 on Community Trademarks of February 26, 2009 (CTMR -Community trademark regulation) enforces opposition proceedings as the most important phase in the process of trademark registration. European experience shows that opposition proceedings carry significant benefits for the process of trademark application. First of all, they allow the holders of previously established trademark rights to avoid long and costly court proceedings whose purpose is to dispute trademarks that violate the owner's rights. Also, state agencies authorizing in trademark approval no longer need to monitor registered trademarks...|$|R
40|$|When {{conducting}} {{image registration}} in the U. S. state of Alaska, {{it is very}} difficult to locate satisfactory ground control points because ice, snow, and lakes cover much of the ground. However, GCPs can be located by seeking stable points from the extracted lake data. This paper defines a process to estimate the deepest points of lakes as the most stable <b>ground</b> control points <b>for</b> <b>registration.</b> We estimate the deepest point of a lake by computing the center point of the largest inner circle (LIC) of the polygon representing the lake. An LIC-seeking method based on Voronoi diagrams is proposed, and an algorithm based on medial axis simplification (MAS) is introduced. The proposed design also incorporates parallel data computing. A key issue of selecting a policy for partitioning vector data is carefully studied, the selected policy that equalize the algorithm complexity is proved the most optimized policy for vector parallel processing. Using several experimental applications, we conclude that the presented approach accurately estimates the deepest points in Alaskan lakes; furthermore, we gain perfect efficiency using MAS and a policy of algorithm complexity equalization...|$|R

First part of this work focuses on the questions regarding the registration requirements of the three-dimensional trade marks. The work looks closely on what constitutes a sign and which absolute <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> refusal of <b>registration</b> are mostly employed when dealing with the three-dimensional trade marks. Furthermore this work looks at exclusion of registration of certain types of shapes, on the requirement of good faith when applying <b>for</b> trade mark <b>registration</b> and briefly at the average consumer. The landmark cases cited {{in this part of the}} work are Dyson v Registrar of Trade Marks, Philips v Remington, Henkel v OHIM, Lego v OHIM and Lindt v Franz Hauswirth.

40|$|In {{the present}} article author deals with problems, arising {{from the use of}} rules of {{limitation}} in the vindication of objects by the arbitration courts. Particular attention is paid to the determination of the initial moment of the limitation period, when real estate is reclaimed from others unlawful possession. Author notes, that there is some uncertainty, due to the beginning of term from the statute of limitations to claim vindication. The difficult {{is due to the fact}} that for the time of search of the lost (stolen) things the owner cannot apply to the court for protection of violated rights, because the defendant, whose actions violated authority ownership, personally is not defined. At the same time the fact of the expiry of the limitation period is a separate <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> refusal in the lawsuit, in which case any of the other arguments in support of the declaration of the claim are not subject to review. Consequently, there is a question of how to define the starting point of the limitation period, when the owner was aware of the disposal of its ownership of certain things, but could not determine exactly who owns his thing, and to whom you must bring vindication requirement. Author analyzes existing legal acts, legal position of the judiciary branches. Author also examines views of Russian jurists. Author concludes that the moment of the period of limitation for the vindication of the claim has to be determined from the date, when the claimant knew of actual disposal of things from his possession, or when he found about the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> challenging the <b>registration</b> of the property rights of the defendant...|$|R

We use a representation <b>for</b> <b>registration</b> that is invariant to local contrast changes, followed by smoothing of the resulting error measure used <b>for</b> <b>registration,</b> <b>for</b> robust estimation of registration parameters.
