5000|$|Tucks {{began in}} 1969 {{as a group}} of Loyola University {{students}} applied for a parade permit. The club takes its name from Friar Tuck's, an Uptown New Orleans local <b>gathering</b> <b>hole</b> and pub, where two college students decided to create their own Carnival krewe after unsuccessfully trying to become white flambeaux carriers. The parade has grown from a small nighttime parade of pick-up trucks and boats pulled on trailers, into a procession of major proportions. In 1983 the parade became a daytime event and in 1986 the parade route finally stretched to downtown. Past Kings include John Candy and Eugene Levy. Notable riders have included The Blues Brothers, WWF Wrestlers, MTV's: The Real World New Orleans Cast, Rob Dyrdek, from MTV's fantasy factory, and Bravo reality star, Stassi Schroeder.|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} effect of nearest-neighbor (NN) {{interactions}} on the topological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, with alternating hopping amplitudes t 1 and t 2. Both numerically and analytically, we show {{that the presence of}} interactions induces phase transitions between topologically different regimes. In the particular case of one-hole excitations in a half-filled SSH chain, the V=t 2 vs. t 1 =t 2 phase diagram has topological phases at diagonal regions of the phase plane. The interaction acts in this case as a passivation potential. For general filling of the SSH chain, different eigensubspaces of the SSH Hamiltonian may be classified as topologically trivial and non-trivial. The two-hole case is studied in detail in the large interaction limit, and we show that a mapping can be constructed of the two-hole SSH eigensubspaces into one-particle states of a non-interacting one-dimensional (1 D) tight-binding model, with interfaces between regions with different hopping constants and local potentials. The presence of topological edge states in the equivalent chain can be readily identifed, as well as their correspondence to the original two-hole states. Furthermore, we found that the presence of the NN interaction generates a state where two holes occupy two consecutive edge states. Such many-body states should also occur for arbitrary filling leading to the possibility of a macroscopic <b>hole</b> <b>gathering</b> at the surface (at consecutive edge states).
