David Fasold was told by other investigators at the site that these rock samples were petrified wood. I made thin sections of each sample, and none is petrified wood. All were volcanic basalt or andesite. Therefore, all that exists as evidence for Noah???s ark is the broad boat-shaped outline. This evidence is circumstantial because its 515 -foot length matches the 300 -Egyptian-cubit length of Noah???s ark (Fasold, 1988).
