40|$|For a {{thorough}} understanding of the nature and mode of action of <b>filterable</b> <b>viruses,</b> it is necessary that they be separated from the tissue substances with which they are associated. Moreover, the methods whereby such purification may be accomplished, are in themselves capable of fielding additional data concerning the properties of the virus in question. The purpose of this communication is to describe procedures effective in separating the virus of poliomyelitis from most of its associated tissue constituents and in its subsequent concentration. The methods follow closely those which enabled Willst~tter and his coworkers to isolate enzymes in their purest known form. Numerous investigators (1) have reported the capacity of various colloidal suspensions to adsorb <b>filterable</b> <b>viruses.</b> In most instances the viruses appear to be inactivated in the adsorbed state, {{and in the case of}} poliomyelitis virus, Amoss (2) states that "the presence of colloidal substances with adsorptive power destroys the virulence after 1 or 2 days. " Gildemeister and Herzberg (3) adsorbed bacteriophage on kieselguhr and succeeded in subsequently eluting it with dilute ammonia. Their results were confirmed by Callow (4) and Kligler and Olitzki (5). The latter investigators (5) obtained similar results with fowl-pox virus, using kaolin as the adsorbing agent. Recently, Rhoads (6) described the adsorption and inactivation of poliomyelitis virus on aluminum hydroxide Type C of the Willsttttter series, and showed that adsorption occurred at pH 5. 5 and 7. 0, but not at pH 8. 8. It appeared, therefore, that if the inactivation of the virus is not irreversible, it should be possible to adsorb it at an acid pH, and elute at an alkaline pH. That the inactivation is reversible and that elution of the virus is possible, has already been reported in a preliminary communicatio...|$|R

40|$|In the lesions of {{herpes simplex}} and similar {{conditions}} due to <b>filterable</b> <b>viruses,</b> cells are present which show characteristic alterations, {{particularly in the}} nucleus. The nucleus of these cells contains a mass which stains with acid dyes. Surrounding this mass is a clear space or halo, within which there are large granules staining with basic stains. These cells are little if at all enlarged. In a few human cases, especially in infants, enlarged cells have been found which contain nuclei showing changes similar to those seen in the abnormal cells of herpes simplex. In the ducts of the submaxillary glands of guinea pigs, Jackson observed structures which she considered to be protozoan parasites. Our own studies indicate, however, that these structures are greatly swollen epithelial cells with nuclei having the same characters as the nuclei of the atypical cells in the lesions of herpes simplex. These cells are usually surrounded by a mononuclear cellular reaction. They were found in 84 per cent of the full grown guinea pigs examined but they were present in only three of forty-three young guinea pigs less than 1 month old. The resemblance of these cells, except as regards size, to the atypical cells present in lesions due to <b>filterable</b> <b>viruses</b> suggested that they also {{may be the result}} of an infection with a similar agent. That they are usually not present in guinea pigs less than 1 month old indicates that natural infection usually occurs after this period. Experiments were therefore undertaken to determine whether or not an infective agent is concerned in this condition and if so to learn something of its nature. When an emulsion of the submaxillary glands of full grown guinea pigs is injected into the brains of young guinea pigs the animals have fever and exhibit symptoms of cerebral irritation. They usually die in 5 to 7 days and in sections of the brain a diffuse subacute meningitis is found. In the exudate there are large numbers of cells having all the characteristics of the abnormal cells of herpes simplex. Similar cells are present in the lesions resulting from the injection of the same emulsion into the testicle, lung, tongue, and submaxillary glands of young guinea pigs. In none of these lesions, however, are the cells greatly enlarged as they are in the lesions in old guinea pigs. These results support the view that the lesion in the submaxillary gland of old guinea pigs is due to an infective agent. Attempts were therefore made to transmit this agent through a series of young guinea pigs. When the injections were all made into the same organ all the experiments but one gave negative results, but when the site of injection was changed at each transfer it was possible in a number of instances to reproduce the lesions through two animals in series and in one experiment through three animals in series. By modifying the technique, efforts were made to transmit the infection indefinitely but these attempts were unsuccessful. No explanation can be offered for this failure. Studies made to determine some of the properties of the infective agent have shown that it is destroyed by heating at 54 ° for 1 hour, and that it is not injured by preservation in 50 per cent glycerol for as long as 11 days. After the material had remained in 50 per cent glycerol for 28 days, however, it was found to be no longer infective. The infective agent was not held back by a Berkefeld N filter which was impermeable to bacteria. It seems probable therefore that the infective agent belongs in the group of <b>filterable</b> <b>viruses,</b> though further work will be necessary to learn more of its exact nature. These observations present additional evidence that the presence of cells with nuclear inclusions in any lesion indicates that the injury is probably due to an infective agent belonging in the group of <b>filterable</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{in the field}} of <b>filterable</b> <b>viruses</b> have been marked by a tendency to apply to the disease-producing agents of this class certain biological principles which govern the reactions of bacteria. Of particular interest have been the obsercations on the behavior of viruses in an electrical field (1, 2, 3). By means of cataphoresis of virus suspensions, it has been found that the effective agent could be revealed in tissues which, by the usual tests of animal inoculation, failed to show activity. This results from the migration of the virus, or possibly, of the material in a suspension carrying the virus, to one or the other p 01 e, depending on the charge. Thus vaccine virus under ordinary conditions of hydrogen ion concentration migrates to the anode (2, 3). By this method, furthermore, vaccine virus has been isolated from rabbits wholly recovered from infection and several weeks or months after vaccination (3, 4). Finally, cataphoresis has been of use in separating vaccine virus from neutral virusimmun...|$|R

40|$|Suspensions of {{the central}} nervous tissues of monkeys, {{containing}} the active <b>filterable</b> <b>virus</b> of poliomyelitis, may be injected into the brain of rabbits without setting up symptoms, provided the volume of injection does not cause dangerous increased intracranial pressure. Aside from the pressure effects which develop quickly, no other symptoms or pathological lesions are produced by the suspensions. The active virus of poliomyelitis survives in the brain of rabbits for 4 days, as determined by tests in the monkey, into which the excised site of injection in the rabbit brain is reinoculated. It cannot be detected by this test after the expiration of 7 days. The virus of poliomyelitis is unadapted to the rabbit, and neither induces lesions nor survives long in the central nervous organs of that animal. In this respect it differs from certain streptococci cultivated from poliomyelitic tissues. A monkey immunized to streptococcus cultivated from human poliomyelitic nervous tissues yielded a serum which agglutinated the streptococcus in high dilution, but was without neutralizing action on the filtered virus; and the streptococcus-immune monkey was not protected against the effects of an intracerebral inoculation of the filtered virus.

40|$|During {{the past}} several years the {{dissociation}} of <b>filterable</b> <b>viruses</b> from combination with specific immune sera has aroused increasing attention.

Success in that field induced Besredka (3) to apply the principle to the use of sensitized bacterial vaccines.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which immune serum inhibits the disease-producing function of <b>filterable</b> <b>viruses</b> {{has been subjected to}} repeated study by different workers and with different viruses. In most instances amounts of serum just, or not quite sufficient to "neutralize" the selected dose of virus have been employed.

It has also been shown that a serum-virus mixture may produce no evidence of infection when administered to susceptible animals by one route but may produce typical infection if administered by another route (2, 3, 5 - 7). On the basis of these results the conclusion has been generally drawn that no union between immune substance and virus occurs in vitro.

The second type of pneumonia encountered was likewise found to be due to a <b>filterable</b> <b>virus,</b> but the microscopic demonstration of elementary bodies, the characteristic appearance of the early lesions, the greater virulence, and the serological reactions definitely distinguish this virus from the former.

As early as the nineteenth century, Paul Ehrlich using the newly invented microscope made fundamental observations that cancer cells are destroyed by immune/inflammatory cells [1]. Furthermore, over a century ago, Peyton Rous through a series of careful and pioneering studies demonstrated that <b>filterable</b> <b>viruses</b> induce cancer; thus the establishment of the field of virology [2].

In 1986, Dvorak proposed that tumors are wounds that do not heal [4]. Furthermore, the analyses of accidental discoveries that Khatami et al. established in 1980 s on experimental models of ocular inflammatory diseases, are the only series of direct evidence for an association between inflammation and time-course kinetics of induction of identifiable altered phases of immune response profiles toward multistep tumorigenesis and angiogenesis (see below) [5].|$|R

The present paper is a report of the evidence we have thus far obtained that indicates the presence of an inhibitor and represents an amplification of a previous publication 1 (2). Sittenfield, Johnson and Jobling have also published some evidence of the presence of such a factor in chicken tumors (3). In an extensive series of experiments in which an attempt was made to isolate the tumor agent, it was noted that it could be precipitated out from the tumor extract along with certain of the proteins (4). Among other tests applied to the active precipitate was the Feulgen microchemical staining reaction for nucleoprotein. As a parallel to this, the precipitates were also tested with Mallory phosphotungstic stain, which differentiates intercellular material, ceil protoplasm and nucleus. A correlation between the staining reactions of the precipitate and the tumor-producing activity of the extract showed that the more active material gave a strong Feulgen test and a clear yellow-red color with the Mallory. With less active material the Feulgen reaction was not so pronounced, and the Mallory gave a deep maroon-red. Finally with filtrates or extracts of dry tumor, having a * This investigation was carried out under the Rutherford Donation...|$|R
40|$|Virus {{diseases}} of stone fruit orchards have existed in Utah {{for more than}} a quarter of a century and are seriously diminishing the peach and cherry fruit production. Western X of peach, rusty mottle of cherry, wilt and decline of cherry, and little cherry constitute the most economically important stone fruit virus diseases in Utah. Many orchards, particularly in Davis County, have 50 to 83 percent of the trees infected with one or more of the yellow-red viroses. Surveys have shown that the diseases are spreading from 3 to 5 percent each year. It is believed that certain insects are responsible for the natural spread of the virus diesases of stone fruits. Some inconclusive evidence points to leafhoppers as the potential vectors since many cicadellidids are capable of transmitting virus to plants during the feeding process. They have maintained a reputation for being efficient vectors of plant viruses for many years, as well as inducing other types of plant injury. Their adaptable, piercing-sucking mouth parts inoculate plants with <b>filterable</b> <b>viruses</b> taken in from infected plants. They inflict other types of damage to the host by injecting toxic substances. The most sever type of damage, however, is that caused through the virus infection which generally is systemic. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the occurrence, seasonla abundance, and host preference of leafhoppers occurring in the stone fruit orchards of northern Utah. Leafhopper occurrence in plant environs adjacent to the stone fruit orchards was also studied. Studies were made to determine if any correlation existed between leafhopper abundance and percentage of diseased trees in the orchards. Trap studies and surveys seemed to be the most appropriate technique in approaching this problem. The trap studies were conducted in fifteen stone fruit orchards in five counties of norhtern Utah. Surveys were undertaken in most stone fruit growing areas in the northern part of the state...|$|R
