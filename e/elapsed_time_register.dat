40|$|An {{important}} determinant for the well-functioning of {{a criminal}} justice system is <b>elapsed</b> <b>times.</b> The <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> of a case is the period that is required to handle a case that pertains to a suspect or convict. Long <b>elapsed</b> <b>times</b> may be interpreted as delays in a criminal justice system, which in turn may lead to “justice delayed, justice denied”. Such a development may undermine the public trust in the government. Therefore insight in <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> is of crucial importance for policy-makers to define a sound and healthy justice policy. To gain this insight, we propose a model to measure the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> of criminal cases...|$|R

40|$|Summary. We explore Bayesian {{analysis}} for continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) models {{based on a}} conditional reference prior. For CTMC models, inference of the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> be-tween chain observations depends heavily on the rate of decay of the prior as the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> increases. Moreover, improper priors on the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> may lead to improper posterior distributions. In addition to the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time,</b> an infinitesimal rate matrix also characterizes the CTMC. Usually, experts have good prior knowledge about {{the parameters of the}} infinitesimal rate matrix, and thus can provide well-informed priors. We show that the use of a proper prior for the rate matrix parameters together with the conditional reference prior for the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> yields a proper posterior distribution. Finally, we demonstrate that, when compared to anal-yses based on priors previously proposed in the literature, Bayesian analysis on the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> based on the conditional reference prior possesses better frequentist properties. The conditional reference prior therefore represents a better default prior choice for widely-used estimation software...|$|R

40|$|Cross-sections of resin strands. Techniques were {{developed}} to make in situ measurements of gelled resin to determine linear shrinkage, stress-strain response and stress relaxation of single strands of SL 5170 epoxy and SL 5149 photocurable resins. Epoxy strands shrank approximately 1. 4 % and the acrylate strands about 1. 0 % after a single exposure. No forces were measured during cure shrinkage of strands following the first laser exposure. In multiple laser exposures, the acrylate continues to shrink; whereas (University of Dayton data) no additional shrinkage is observed in epoxy strands on a second hit. In force relaxation tests, a strand is drawn and then a 0. 5 % step strain is applied after different <b>elapsed</b> <b>times.</b> The epoxy initial modulus evolves (increases) with <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> following draw of the strand, and this evolution in modulus occurs after linear shrinkage has stopped. On the other hand, acrylates show no evolution of modulus with <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> following a single laser draw; i. e., once shrinkage stops after one laser hit, the initial modulus remains stable with <b>elapsed</b> <b>time.</b> Finally, relaxation response times of epoxy strands get larger with increasing <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> after laser draw. In acrylate strands there was no evolution in initial modulus with <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> after a single draw so relaxation times are not a function of <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> after a single hit with the laser...|$|R

As we logged all the bug {{localization}} runs, {{including the}} <b>time</b> <b>elapsed</b> for each run, we can {{assert that the}} modes that process more constructs (i.e., Mixed and Complete modes) do take longer to complete than the Default mode. However, in the first runs of the adapted modes, we perceived no {{significant increase in the}} <b>elapsed</b> <b>time.</b> Thus, we did not design a research question to evaluate the variation of the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> for each bug localization run. Therefore, we did not implement measures to control the execution environment, such as avoiding parallel execution of other programs that could compromise any measurement of the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time.</b> Consequently, the data we collected regarding <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> cannot be used to compare the cost-benefit of each mapping mode formally.|$|R
40|$|We show {{analytically}} {{that the}} answer to the question, "The longer it has been since the last earthquake, the longer the expected time till the next ?" depends crucially on the statistics of the fluctuations in the interval times between earthquakes. The periodic, uniform, semigaussian, Rayleigh and truncated statistical distributions of interval times, as well as the Weibull distributions with exponent greater than 1, all have decreasing expected time to the next earthquake with increasing time since the last one, for long times since the last earthquake; the log-normal and power-law distributions and the Weibull distributions with exponents smaller than 1, have increasing times to the next earthquake as the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> since the last increases, for long <b>elapsed</b> <b>times.</b> There is an identifiable crossover between these models, which is gauged by the rate of fall-off of the long-term tail of the distribution in comparison with an exponential fall-off. The response to the question for short <b>elapsed</b> <b>times</b> is also evaluated. The lognormal and power-law distributions give one response for short <b>elapsed</b> <b>times</b> and the opposite for long <b>elapsed</b> <b>times.</b> Even the sampling of a finite number of intervals from the Poisson distribution will lead to an increasing estimate of time to the next earthquake for increasing <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> since the last one.
