5|$|Former President of the United States Barack Obama {{has said}} that The Wire is his {{favorite}} television series. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Laureate, Mario Vargas Llosa, wrote a very positive critical review of the series in the Spanish journal El País. The comedian turned mayor of Reykjavík, Iceland, Jón Gnarr, has gone so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he would not enter a coalition government with anyone who has not watched the series.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the plot of Cars bears a {{striking}} resemblance to that of Doc Hollywood, the 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor, who, after causing a traffic accident in a small town, is sentenced to work at the town hospital, {{falls in love with a}} local law student and eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values. Some have gone so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the makers of Cars plagiarized the script of Doc Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} talk of {{building}} a replica of the memorial. On 31 May 2008 on Anzac Parade, Canberra, the formal dedication of a site in which will be placed a new national Boer War memorial was held. A National Boer War Memorial Committee was formed prior to that date, and they will be conducting a national competition to find a design for the new memorial. In the design brief for the memorial, the committee state that it is their desire to build a memorial along the same lines as Adelaide's: going so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{they would be willing to}} accept a replica of the statue from the South Australian memorial if the original mould could be located or if a duplicate could otherwise be produced.|$|E

5|$|On 22 July 2010, reports {{surfaced}} {{suggesting that}} English club Newcastle United {{were looking to}} sign Ben Arfa. After being questioned, Newcastle's manager Chris Hughton denied the reports. Five days later, Ben Arfa's agent declared that Newcastle were indeed interested in the player, along with German clubs Hoffenheim and Werder Bremen, Turkish club Galatasaray, and Italian club A.C. Milan. On 9 August, a season-long loan with an option to make the move permanent was reportedly being negotiated between the two clubs. However, a loan-fee for the deal {{could not be reached}} with Newcastle offering £650,000; £350,000 short of what Marseille wanted. On 12 August, Marseille president Jean-Claude Dassier announced that Ben Arfa would not be moving to Newcastle and even went as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> an offer from the club had not even existed.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{sense in}} which this kind of {{additivity}} expresses a fundamental postulate that goes beyond the simplest ideas of classical closed system thermodynamics; the extensivity of some variables is not obvious, and needs explicit expression; indeed one author goes so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it could be recognized as a fourth law of thermodynamics, though this is not repeated by other authors.|$|E
25|$|Many {{midwives}} of {{the time}} bitterly opposed the involvement of men in childbirth. Some male practitioners also opposed the involvement of medical men like themselves in midwifery, and even went as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> men-midwives only undertook midwifery solely for perverse erotic satisfaction. The accoucheurs argued that their involvement in midwifery was to improve the process of childbirth. These men also believed that obstetrics would forge ahead and continue to strengthen.|$|E

25|$|In September 1640 he {{conveyed}} {{to the king}} at York the petition of the London clergy against the 'etcetera oath', and succeeded in getting it dispensed with. Clarendon in his History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England goes so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the influence of Burges and Stephen Marshall was greater with both houses of parliament than that of Laud had ever been with the court, a statement which, as Edmund Calamy the Elder observes, 'carries a pretty strong figure in it'.|$|E
25|$|If {{a search}} or seizure is {{unlawful}} under the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 {{then it is}} also likely to be considered an unreasonable search or seizure. However, the concepts of unlawfulness and unreasonableness are independent and it is therefore possible that, for example, a lawful search can be unreasonable. Despite this, the courts have said that in terms of the most common remedy of exclusion of evidence an unlawful search should usually be considered an unreasonable search. Elias CJ went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> unlawful searches should automatically be unreasonable. An exception is that where the search is only unlawful on minor or technical grounds it may still be reasonable.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{violence}} of the second intifada and the political success of Hamas (a group dedicated to Israel's destruction) have convinced many Israelis that peace and negotiation are not possible and a two state system is not the answer. Hardliners believe that Israel should annex all Palestinian territory, or at least all minus the Gaza Strip. Israelis view the peace process as hindered and near impossible due to terrorism on the part of Palestinians and do not trust Palestinian leadership to maintain control. In fact, Pedahzur goes as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> suicide terrorism succeeded where peace negotiations failed in encouraging withdrawal by Israelis from cities in the West Bank. A common theme throughout the peace process has been a feeling that the Palestinians give too little in their peace offers.|$|E

25|$|Estimates of {{the extent}} of his empire vary greatly. The Burmese and Thai chronicles report an empire which covered the present-day Burma and {{northern}} Thailand. The Thai chronicles assert that Anawrahta conquered the entire Menam valley, and received tribute from the Khmer king. One states that Anawrahta's armies invaded the Khmer kingdom and sacked the city of Angkor, and another one goes so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Anawrahta even visited Java to receive his tribute. However, Western historians (Harvey, Hall, et al) present a much smaller empire, consisted of the Irrawaddy valley and nearer periphery. His victory terracotta votive tablets (emblazoned with his name in Sanskrit) have been found along the Tenasserim coastline in the south, Katha in the north, Thazi in the east and Minbu in the west.|$|E
25|$|Traditionalist Catholics {{other than}} sedevacantists {{recognize}} as legitimate {{the line of}} Popes leading to and including Pope Francis. Some of them hold that {{one or more of}} the most recent popes have held and taught unorthodox beliefs, but do not go so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they have been formal heretics or have been widely and publicly judged to be heretics. Sedevacantists, on the other hand, claim that the infallible Magisterium of the Catholic Church could not have decreed the changes made in the name of the Second Vatican Council, and conclude that those who issued these changes could not have been acting with the authority of the Catholic Church. Accordingly, they hold that Pope Paul VI and his successors left the true Catholic Church and thus lost legitimate authority in the Church. A formal heretic, they say, cannot be the Catholic pope.|$|E
25|$|A brief {{notice on}} Boudet's book, written by French prehistorian {{specialist}} Émile Cartailhac, {{a member of}} the Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude and of the Société archéologique du Midi de la France was published in 1892 in the Revue des Pyrenées. Unsympathetic to Boudet's works, Cartailhac asked the local archeologists to be cautious about the claims of a gullible priest, author he said of the ridiculous book La Vrai langue celtique. In 1893, Cartailhac's notice was used by Gaston Jourdanne for his introduction of Boudet's book to the Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude. Citing various renowned authorities, including a work by his friend, a well known Celtic expert, Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Jourdanne demonstrated the errors of Boudet's researches and conclusions. Jourdanne's harsh criticism went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Boudet's study was worthy at most of publication in the British satirical magazine Punch.|$|E

25|$|Although Cappadocian Greek {{was once}} {{believed}} to be a dead language, the discovery of a population of speakers has led to an increase in awareness, both within and outside of the Cappadocian community in Greece. In the documentary “Last Words,” which follows Mark Janse through Cappadocian-speaking villages on the Greek mainland, community members are seen encouraging each other to use their dialect for ordinary things, such as joke telling. The members of these villages, including such notable figures as the bishop, recount being touched by a presentation given in Cappadocian by Janse on a visit to the region. The bishop went so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Janse’s speech “has lifted their shame.” The revitalisation process is seen through examples such as this, wherein the speakers have begun to take back their identity and embrace their mother tongue. Additionally, younger generations are embracing the power of technology to spread awareness, utilising social media about the language to inform the larger Greek population.|$|E
25|$|In 1614–1615, Musashi {{participated in}} the war between the Toyotomi and the Tokugawa. The war had broken out because Tokugawa Ieyasu saw the Toyotomi family {{as a threat to}} his rule of Japan; most {{scholars}} believe that, as in the previous war, Musashi fought on the Toyotomi side. Osaka Castle was the central place of battle. The first battle (the Winter Battle of Osaka; Musashi's fourth battle) ended in a truce. The second (the Summer Battle of Osaka; Musashi's fifth battle) resulted in the total defeat of Toyotomi Hideyori's Army of the West by Ieyasu's Army of the East in May 1615. Some reports go so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Musashi entered a duel with Ieyasu, but was recruited after Ieyasu sensed his defeat was at hand. This may seem unlikely since Ieyasu was in his 70s and was in poor health already, but it remains unknown how Musashi came into Ieyasu's good graces.|$|E
25|$|The {{requirement}} for reliance {{has not been}} pushed so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a misrepresentor is never liable when a misrepresentee could have found out the truth. In the leading case, Redgrave v Hurd Mr Hurd {{was told by the}} elderly Mr Redgrave that the solicitor practice earned £300 pa. Mr Redgrave told Mr Hurd he could check some documents in the office to prove it. Mr Hurd did not check, and subsequently signed a contract to join Mr Redgrave as a partner. Then Mr Hurd found out the practice only generated £200 pa, and the documents in the office had never said otherwise. Lord Jessel MR held that the contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, because Mr Redgrave had still made a misrepresentation. Furthmore it would be inferred that Mr Hurd relied on the statement {{from the fact that it}} was untrue. Edgington v Fitzmaurice confirmed further that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract, for a remedy to be available, so long as it is an influence.|$|E

500|$|The {{association}} with the novel was so keen that the application for National Historic Landmark status was entitled, [...] "Casa Estudillo/Ramona's Marriage Place." [...] The Journal of San Diego History goes so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> without the novel's influence and {{the popularity of the}} house, the historic buildings that make up Old Town San Diego would have been razed. In fact, for a time, the Estudillos' relationship to the house was nearly forgotten.|$|E
500|$|The game's suspenseful and {{cinematic}} atmosphere received praise, with Game Revolution {{going so}} <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the game makes the original Resident Evil look like Pong. Resident Evil was also praised for its realistic sound. AllGame reviewer Scott Alan Marriott {{felt that the}} game [...] " [...] a constant sense of dread without relying too much on obvious shock values", while GameSpot highlighted the quality and variety of sound effects, noting that [...] "there seem to be dozens of sound effects for footsteps alone." [...] However, some publications considered the voice acting to be weak due to its exaggerated delivery.|$|E
