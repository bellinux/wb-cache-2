Several attributes {{have been reported}} to ‘‘água-mel’’ particularly in the alleviation of simple symptoms of upper respiratory tract. Samples of ‘‘água-mel’’ from diverse beekeepers from different regions of Portugal were studied in what concerns antimicrobial, antioxidant and antiviral properties. The amounts of phenol and brown pigment were also evaluated and correlated with the antioxidant activities. A <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> the levels of these compounds was found among samples which were responsible for the variability detected also on the antioxidant activities, independent on the method used. Generally, antioxidant activity correlated better with brown pigments’ amount than with phenols’ content.

40|$|It {{has been}} suggested, {{primarily}} based on response time (RT) data, {{that there is}} an age-related increase in intraindividual variability. To determine whether older adults show more intraindividual variability in working memory (WM) performance, we had younger and older adults perform three verbal WM tasks of varying complexity as well as a same–different judgment RT task. For both groups, individual performance tended to be more variable on the two complex span tasks than on the simple span task. Although older adults showed <b>greater</b> <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> the RT task, consistent with previous studies, they did not show <b>greater</b> <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> any of the WM tasks. These findings fail to support theories of frontal lobe aging that predict greater moment-to-moment fluctuations in the performance of older adults. T O a large extent, research on cognitive aging has focusedon differences in the average performance of younger and older adults.

30|$|However, the {{comparison}} of benthic marine litter in different areas collected with different means is a very challenging task with various uncertainties arising mainly related to the local variations in marine litter abundance and distribution.

The lower densities observed in marine litter derived from the commercial trawl fisheries, to the ones derived from ROV can be also attributed to the <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> the benthic marine litter spatial distribution as well as to possible litter underestimation arising when comparing the commercial trawlers with the direct ROV litter observations, particularly for the small-sized items. On the other hand, ROVs have also been criticized for possible underestimation of marine litter since buried items are not quantified as well as the limited visibility of some ROV images can seriously affect our ability to detect litter items.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to assess root traits of 19 common bean genotypes, used in breeding programs for disease resistance. Genotypes DOR 364 and G 19833 were used as deep and shallow basal root checks, respectively. The number of whorls and basal roots were assessed on five-day old seedlings grown in germination paper. Growth pouch studies were conducted to evaluate basal root gravitropism and lateral root length from primary roots, in seven-day old seedlings. The following root gravitropic traits were estimated: basal growth angle, shallow basal root length (localized in the top 2 cm), and relative shallow basal root growth. Number of whorls varied from 1. 47 to 3. 07, and number of basal roots ranged from 5. 67 (genotype TO) to 12. 07 (cultivar Jalo MG- 65). Cultivars BRS MG Talismã, Carioca, BRS Pioneiro, and Diamante Negro exhibited shallow basal roots, while genotypes Vi- 10 - 2 - 1, TU, AB 136, and México 54 showed deep basal roots.

The average (+SE) particulate light absorption coefficient for the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) range (0. 035 + 0. 002 m-l) was characteristic of relatively clear coastal waters but showed <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> occasions. A substantial fraction (53 - 73 %, depending on the wavelength examined) of this variability could {{be accounted for by}} changes in the abundance of inorganic suspended matter, as well as planktonic organisms.

Inorganic particles contributed, on the average, 48 and 74 % of the total particulate absorption for the PAR waveband and at 400 nm, respectively, with their contri-bution to light absorption at 675 nm being negligible. Autotrophs dominated light absorption at 675 nm (on average 45. 8 % of total particulate absorption), whereas mixo- and heterotrophic ciliates and bacteria together contributed, on average, 22. 5 % of the total light absorption at this wavelength.

40|$|Objective Results from {{previous}} studies show effects of stress hormones (cortisol) on cognitive functions, particularly those mediated by the hippocampus, but little research has {{examined the effects of}} cortisol on frontal executive functions, despite a preponderance of cortisol receptors in the frontal lobes. Existing research has focused on traditional measures of executive functions and the findings are inconsistent. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the effects of acute stress on frontal executive function using traditional tasks, and a more ecologically-valid task, the Zoo Map Test, which measures planning. Methods 40 healthy female undergraduates participated in the experiment. Stress was induced in the experimental condition through anticipation of a public speech, which would be evaluated by two psychologists, after which performance on the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), Cognitive Estimation Test (CET), and Zoo Map Test (ZMT) was measured. Physiological (skin conductance and heart rate) and subjective measures of stress were assessed. Results Stress was successfully induced in the experimental condition. However, no significant differences were found between the stressed and unstressed groups on the traditional tests of executive function or on the ZMT. A trend towards the experimental group performing more quickly on the ZMT was observed. Conclusions Acute anticipatory psychosocial stress in young, healthy females does impact on performance on the VFT, CET or ZMT. Stress hormones may simply not have an effect on frontal executive functions or, the stress induced was not sufficient to disrupt performance, or the <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> the ZMT performance meant that significant differences could not be detected in this sample size due to insufficient power...|$|E

Our aim was to describe recreational drug use in both HIV individuals and general population in Europe, and to assess at what extent HIV guidelines address this issue. METHODS: Data on recreational drug use across Europe {{were obtained from the}} European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction for the general population, and through Pubmed search. for HIV patients. We assessed the incorporation of recreational drug issues in HIV treatment guidelines for the following topics: (a) recreational drugs; (b) adherence to antiretrovirals; (c) interactions; (d) transmission risk. Guidelines included: World Health Organization; European Aids Clinical Society; U. S. Department of Health and Human Services; International Antiviral Society-USA; and seven European national guidelines. RESULTS: 29 countries reported recreational drug use in general population. The highest prevalences were observed for Cannabis (i. e., 8 - 10 % in Spain, France, and Czech Republic) followed by cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy. The 13 studies selected in the systematic review showed a great variability in recreational drug use on the HIV population. Apart from classical recreational drugs, we found a relevant use of new drugs including sexual experience enhancers. Polydrug consumption was about 50 % in some studies. Most guidelines included general information about recreational drugs, showing <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> the inclusion of the evaluated topics. We found more specific, evidence-based recommendations on interactions, followed by medication adherence and transmission risk. CONCLUSIONS: Available data on the people living with HIV suggest a higher use of recreational drugs than in the general population, which is already relevant. However, recreational drug issues should be included or addressed more thoroughly in most guidelines...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{many areas}} of activity, {{the value of a}} product depends greatly on the {{perceived}} quality, including visual one. This work aims to better control sensory perception of products with high added value, especially on the first step of the visual control: the detection, or localization of anomalies in appearance to the surfaces. Companies have controllers, specially trained to locate and evaluate anomalies. These specialists have a higher sensitivity for the detection and evaluation of defects as a potential buyer for example, and this higher acuity is generally completed by a weighting of the intensity of defects according to their location. However, there is still <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> the results of the visual inspection. To overcome the disadvantages of human subjectivity, and also handling parts, we present a new device of analysis of surfaces, specifically focused on the step of detection of appearance anomalies, based on a technique called Polynomial Texture Mapping. By varying the direction of the light source, it makes possible to figure out the anomalies present on the surface. The device was developed and built entirely in the Symme laboratory (Université de Savoie, France, Annecy). We are working on developments of the method: - To improve the quality of the "PTM": a new approximation method of reflective surfaces ("Modal Mapping") of each pixel has been done, using the Modal Discrete Decomposition - To estimate the fields of surface normals (slopes). - To integrate normal fields, in order to do 3 D reconstruction of the surface - To implement the methodology related to the sensory "human" control of appearance, like simulating the path of the controller eyes, or simulating the lights effects. The results obtained show that the control aspect is greatly facilitated by the device, and that the PTM method is relevant for the appearance control in an industrial environment. Improved estimation of the surface reflectance of each pixel increase greatly the quality of texture mapping, and makes possible current developments (Curvature Mappings, Slope mappings, 3 D mappings). It opens new possibilities of augmented reality in the control of surface appearance...|$|E

Os cortes histológicos incluídos em parafina foram corados pelas técnicas de hematoxilina-eosina (H-E), tricrômica modificada, Gram-Chromotrope, Giemsa, Brown-Hopps, PAS, Ziehl-Neelsen e Grocott, e ainda pela técnica de calcoflúor. As colorações azul de toluidina-fucsina e azul de toluidina foram utilizadas para os cortes incluídos em resina plástica. As técnicas de Gram-Chromotrope, Brown-Hopps e Ziehl-Neelsen foram as que permitiram melhor visualização dos esporos para o diagnóstico de E. cuniculi em cortes histológicos incluídos em parafina, uma vez que possibilitaram a clara diferenciação dos esporos de outras estruturas teciduais. Nos tecidos incluídos em resina plástica, as colorações de azul de toluidina-fucsina e azul de toluidina também facilitaram o encontro do agente. Por outro lado, a técnica tricrômica apresentou grande variabilidade nos resultados, sendo, portanto, pouco indicada para o diagnóstico em tecido. As demais técnicas - H-E, calcoflúor, Grocott, Giemsa e PAS - não permitiram a fácil identificação do E. cuniculi.

In {{the last}} years, great {{attention}} {{has been devoted to}} the study of bioactive compounds in order to prevent or delay the onset of chronic diseases. This work aims to study the carotenoid, vitamins and total folate content of the traditional foods from Black Sea Area countries (BSAC) that have been prioritised in the frame of the BaSeFood project. Material and methods. Carotenoids and vitamins A and E were quantified by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography with diode array detection (DAD). In order to quantify L ascorbic acid and vitamin B 2, samples were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography with DAD and fluorescence detection, respectively. The total folate content in foods was carried out by a microbiological assay. Results. From the analysed BSAC foods, 12 (43 %) contained lycopene. The foods with highest lycopene content were watermelon juice, sautéed picked green beans and Ukrainian borsch (235  19. 9, 176  48. 3 and 166  1. 01 µg/ 100 g, respectively). Rodopian dried beans from the group of vegetables and vegetable based foods presented the highest α-carotene content (167. 8  18. 0 µg/ 100 g). Among the analysed traditional foods, 15 (54 %) contained β-carotene. The highest β-carotene content (608  52. 4 µg/ 100 g) was found in plums jam, followed by kale soup (538  51. 4 µg/ 100 g). Vitamin C was quantified in only 5 of the analysed foods, with fruit of the evergreen cherry laurel (29. 9 mg/ 100 g) having the highest content. The traditional food from BSAC with higher concentration in vitamins B 2, E and total folate was roasted sunflower seeds (0. 19  0. 02 mg/ 100 g, 6. 0  0. 99 mg/ 100 g and 113 µg/ 100 g, respectively). All results are given per 100 g of edible portion. Conclusions. Despite the <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> the content of carotenoids and vitamins, most of the analysed traditional foods from BSAC can be considered good sources of these health promoting compounds.

40|$|Carotenoids are {{colourful}} compounds {{which provide}} photoprotection {{of plants and}} participate in their photosynthesis. Particularly β-carotene may enhance the human immune response. Some epidemiological studies have suggested an association between carotenoids intake and reduced incidence of some forms of cancer, which might be related with the antioxidant properties of carotenoids, namely by their ability of reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) damages in cell membranes. Moreover, carotenoids may also influence the activity of redox-sensitive transcription factors {{and the production of}} cytokines and prostaglandins. Carotenoids were extracted from Black Sea Area Countries (BSAC) traditional foods with a mixture of hexane/ethanol, 4 : 3 (v/v). In all samples, a procedure with and without saponification step was applied. Separation and quantification was performed by Ultra High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC). Chromatographic separation was performed with a UPLC® BEH guard-column (2. 1 x 5 mm, 1. 7 µm particle size) and a UPLC® BEH analytical column (2. 1 x 50 mm, 1. 7 µm particle size). Mobile phases were (A) ultrapure water; (B) acetonitrile/methanol (containing ammonium acetate) /dichloromethane (75 : 20 : 5, v/v/v). The flow-rate was 0. 5 mL/min. From the 28 analysed traditional foods for carotenoids content, α-carotene was quantified in 7. The highest level was found for rodopian dried beans, followed by vegetable okroshka. β-carotene was quantified in 53. 4 % of the analysed traditional foods from BSAC. The sample with highest β-carotene content was plums jam followed by kale soup and nettles sour soup. Once more, as it was expected, the group that most contributes for β-carotene intake is the vegetable and vegetables based foods followed by fruit or fruit based foods. Wild plum sauce was the sample that presented the highest β-cryptoxanthin content (63. 8 µg/ 100 g of edible portion). Lycopene was quantified in about 43 % of the analysed traditional foods from BSAC. The foods with highest lycopene content were watermelon juice, Ukrainian borsch and sautéed pickled green beans. The analysed traditional foods from BSAC can be considered good sources of bioactive compounds, although it was found a <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> the content of carotenoids.

Dispneia, qualidade do sono (IQSP), sonolÃncia diurna (ESE), sintomas depressivos (InventÃrio DepressÃo de Beck, BDI-II), fadiga (Escala de Gravidade de Fadiga, EGF), cronotipo (QuestionÃrio de Matutinidade-Vespertinidade, MEQ) e risco de apneia obstrutiva do sono (QuestionÃrio de Berlim) foram avaliados. Pacientes com DPOC apresentaram pior escore do IQSP (p< 0. 001), do BDI-II (p= 0. 02) e do EGF (p< 0. 001). Os valores de temperatura Ãs 4 e 6 horas foram maiores nos pacientes do que nos controles (p= 0. 001 e p= 0. 02, respectivamente). Na DPOC, a temperatura Ãs 6 horas correlacionou-se com o IQSP global (p= 0. 015). No terceiro estudo, 11 pacientes com DPOC moderada a grave (idade= 64, 4 Â 8, 8 anos) foram avaliados com polissonografia e determinaÃÃo do grau de dispneia, funÃÃo pulmonar, comorbidades (Indice de Comorbidades de Charlson, ICC) e dosagem de cortisol matinal (6 horas). Em sete casos, foi medida a concentraÃÃo de melatonina Ãs 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 00, 2, 4 e 6 horas. Observou-se prolongamento da latÃncia para o sono REM (118, 1 Â 86, 3 min), baixa eficiÃncia do sono (82, 9 Â 11, 6 %) e elevado Ãndice de despertares (16, 3 Â 8, 5 /hora). As curvas de secreÃÃo de melatonina mostraram grande variabilidade. Em mÃdia, o pico de melatonina (82, 28 Â 49, 4 pg/mL) ocorreu Ãs 22 horas. A eficiÃncia do sono correlacionou-se com a concentraÃÃo de melatonina Ãs 20 (p= 0. 05) e 23 horas (p= 0. 04) e o TTS com a concentraÃÃo de melatonina Ãs 22 horas (p= 0. 05). A concentraÃÃo de cortisol Ãs 6 horas (22, 08 Â 5, 8 mg /dl) correlacionou-se inversamente com o Ãndice de despertares (p= 0. 04). Em conclusÃo, pacientes com DPOC estÃvel apresentam alteraÃÃes do sono avaliados por actimetria, associada ao grau de dispneia. O ritmo da temperatura oral na DPOC estÃ alterado, com temperaturas mais elevadas no inÃcio da manhÃ, o que pode estar relacionado a alteraÃÃes do sono. O padrÃo de secreÃÃo de melatonina na DPOC Ã bastante variÃvel. Os nÃveis de cortisol matinal e a concentraÃÃo de melatonina Ãs 20, 22 e 23 horas associam-se a alteraÃÃes do sono nestes pacientes. Previously, circadian {{alterations in}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) have been insufficiently investigated. In this work, consisting of three studies, we evaluated the impairments in sleep-wake rhythm, the circadian variation of oral temperature, the nocturnal melatonin secretion and morning cortisol concentration {{in patients with}} stable COPD. Initially, 26 patients with moderate to very severe COPD (mean age Â SD = 66. 9 Â 8. 5 years) and 15 controls (age = 63. 0 Â 10. 7 years) were evaluated by actigraphy for 5 - 7 days. Dyspnea, lung function (spirometry), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI) and daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS) were measured. Individuals with COPD showed increased sleep latency (p = 0. 003), mean nocturnal activity (p = 0. 003), and wake after sleep onset (p = 0. 003). Furthermore, they presented reduced total sleep time (TST, p = 0. 024) and lower sleep efficiency (p = 0. 001). In patients, severity of dyspnea was correlated with activity levels during sleep (r = 0. 41, p = 0. 04) and with TST (r = - 0. 46, p = 0. 02). Subjective sleep quality was poorer in patients than controls (p = 0. 043). In the second study, oral temperature was measured every two hours, from 4 : 00 a. m to 10 : 00 p. m, in 31 patients with moderate to very severe COPD (age = 66. 3 Â 6. 5 years) as well as in 19 controls (age = 63. 6 Â 5. 4 years). Dyspnea, sleep quality (PSQI), daytime sleepiness (ESS), depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI-II), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale, FSS), chronotype (morningness-eveningness Questionnaire, MEQ) and risk of sleep apnea (Berlin Questionnaire) were evaluated. COPD patients showed worse PSQI global score (p< 0. 001), BDI-II (p = 0. 02) and FSS (p < 0. 001). Mean temperature at 4 : 00 a. m and 6 : 00 a. m were higher in patients than in controls (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 02, respectively). In the COPD group, the temperature at 6 : 00 a. m was correlated with the PSQI global score (p = 0. 015). In the third study, 11 patients with moderate or severe COPD (age = 64. 4 Â 8. 8 years) were evaluated with polysomnography, dyspnea, pulmonary function and comorbidities (Charlson Comorbidity Index, CCI) and they had the cortisol levels measured in the morning at 6 : 00 a. m. The concentration of melatonin was measured at 6 : 00, 7 : 00, 8 : 00, 9 : 00, 10 : 00, 11 : 00 p. m and, 0 : 00, 2 : 00, 4 : 00 and 6 : 00 a. m in seven cases. It was observed prolongation of REM sleep latency (118. 1 Â 86. 3 min), lower sleep efficiency (82. 9 Â 11. 6 %) and elevated arousal index (16. 3 Â 8. 5 / h). The curves of melatonin secretion showed <b>great</b> <b>variability.</b> <b>On</b> average, the peak of melatonin (82. 28 Â 49. 4 pg / ml) occurred at 10 : 00 p. m. Sleep efficiency was correlated with the concentration of melatonin at 8 : 00 p. m (p = 0. 05) and 11 : 00 p. m (p = 0. 04) and the TST with melatonin concentration at 10 : 00 p. m (p = 0. 05). The cortisol concentration at 6 : 00 a. m (22. 08 Â 5. 8 mg /dl) were correlated inversely with the arousal index (p = 0. 04). In conclusion, clinically stable COPD patients presented sleep alterations assessed by actigraphy, associated with the degree of dyspnea. The rhythm of oral temperature was altered in COPD, with higher temperatures in the early morning, and this may be related to sleep disturbances. The pattern of melatonin secretion in COPD is variable. Cortisol morning levels and melatonin concentration measured at 8 : 00, 10 : 00 and 11 : 00 p. m are associated with changes in the sleep pattern of these patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Children {{and young}} people (CYP) with {{juvenile}} idiopathic arthritis (JIA) {{are known to have}} impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL), which is improved significantly for many by treatment with methotrexate (MTX). However, a significant proportion of CYP experience difficulties in taking MTX, which may reduce its potential benefits for HRQoL. The aim of this research was to examine how CYP with JIA perceive MTX treatment and how this relates to HRQoL. Methods: CYP aged 8 - 16 years taking MTX for JIA completed an adapted Parent Adherence Report Questionnaire, which contains 100 mm visual analogue scales, to assess difficulty taking MTX, adherence, frequency of negative reactions and helpfulness of MTX. They also completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic and Rheumatology scales. We collected data on age, gender, JIA course, disease duration, MTX duration of use, route and dose. Number of inflamed and limited joints were indicators of disease severity. Results: 116 CYP participated. Most considered MTX helpful (median 87; interquartile range (IQR) 50. 75 – 98) and reported adherence was high (median 98; IQR 90 – 100). There was <b>greater</b> <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> scores for difficulty (median 22; IQR 2 – 69) and frequency of negative reactions (median 14. 5; IQR 1. 25 – 80). Mean (S. D.) scores on the PedsQL Physical and Psychosocial subscales were 71. 63 (24. 02) and 71. 78 (19. 59) respectively, indicating poorer HRQoL than that reported by healthy children. After controlling for demographic and disease variables, poorer physical HRQoL was significantly accounted for by greater difficulty in taking MTX. Poorer psychosocial HRQoL was significantly accounted for by subcutaneous MTX administration, a lower rating of MTX helpfulness and a greater reported difficulty in taking MTX. Conclusions: Taking MTX for JIA was viewed as helpful by most CYP but HRQoL was poorer in those who reported greater difficulty in taking MTX...|$|R
40|$|Bone has {{a complex}} {{hierarchical}} structure that has evolved to serve structural and metabolic {{roles in the}} body. Due {{to the complexity of}} bone structure and the number of diseases which affect the ultrastructural constituents of bone, it is important to develop quantitative methods to assess bone nanoscale properties. Autosomal dominant Osteogenesis Imperfecta results predominantly from glycine substitutions (80 %) and splice site mutations (20 %) in the genes encoding the α 1 or α 2 chains of Type I collagen. Genotype-phenotype correlations using over 830 collagen mutations have revealed that lethal mutations are located in regions crucial for collagen-ligand binding in the matrix. However, few of these correlations have been extended to collagen structure in bone. Here, an atomic force microscopy-based approach was used to image and quantitatively analyze the Dperiodic spacing of Type I collagen fibrils in femora from heterozygous (Brtl/+) mice (α 1 (I) G 349 C), compared to wild type (WT) littermates. This disease system has a well-defined change in the col 1 α 1 allele, leading to a well characterized alteration in collagen protein structure, which are directly related to altered Type I collagen nanoscale morphology, as measured by the Dperiodic spacing. In Brtl/+ bone, the D-periodic spacing shows significantly <b>greater</b> <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> average and {{along the length of the}} bone compared to WT, although the average spacing was unchanged. Brtl/+ bone also had a significant difference in the population distribution of collagen D-period spacings. These changes may be due to the mutant collagen structure, or to the heterogeneity of collagen monomers in the Brtl/+ matrix. These observations at the nanoscale level provide insight into the structural basis for changes present in bone composition, geometry and mechanical integrity in Brtl/+ bones. Further studies are necessary to link these morphological observations to nanoscale mechanical integrity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The dynamic {{nature of}} {{wireless}} communication and the stringent energy constraints are major {{challenges for the}} design of low-power wireless sensor network applications. The link quality of a wireless link is known for its <b>great</b> <b>variability,</b> dependent <b>on</b> the distance between nodes, the antenna’s radiation characteristic, multipath, diffraction, scattering and many more. Especially for indoor and urban deployments, there are numerous factors impacting the wireless channel. In an extensive experimental study contained {{in the first part of}} this paper, we show the magnitude of this problem for current Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and that based on the overall connectivity graph of a typical multihop WSN, a large portion of the links actually exhibit very poor characteristics. We present a pattern based estimation technique that allows assessing the quality of a link at startup and as a result to construct an optimal neighbor table right at the beginning using a minimum of resources only. Our estimation technique is superior compared to other approaches where protocols continue to decide on the fly which links to use expending valuable energy both for unnecessary retransmissions and recursive link estimation.

40|$|The Mediterranean Sea is {{especially}} prone {{to the introduction}} of alien species due to an intense marine traffic, the connection with the Red Sea through the Suez Canal and intensive aquaculture. Catalonia, a region in the Northwestern Mediterranean, began an extensive study on the presence, distribution and impact of invasive macroalgae in 1992, which was extended to all macrobenthic alien species by 2007. Gathering all presence and abundance data of introduced species from the monitoring, we also calculated a Biopollution Level (BPL) index to assess the magnitude of the effects of introduced species on the marine biota at a local level (water body) as required by Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). Seventeen alien species have been identified although only three can be considered so far as threatening in non-modified environments: the green alga Caulerpa cylindracea and the red algae Womersleyella setacea and Asparagopsis armata. These species show an uneven distribution along the coast but sometimes coexist in the same water body. The impact of alien species on native communities was never severe as shown by the low values obtained using the BPL. The only species triggering a moderate to strong impact was Caulerpa cylindracea but it only affected a single water body. However, C. cylindracea exhibited a <b>great</b> temporal <b>variability</b> <b>on</b> its abundance, with sudden collapses of its populations, which also caused a <b>great</b> <b>variability</b> in the BPL.

40|$|Background: Centre of {{pressure}} (COP) movement variability, {{as an example}} of 'end-point' variability (stability), {{may be one of the}} indicators that can assess the functional gait asymmetry caused by foot preference in relation to fall risk. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the possible differences in COP movement variability during the stance phase of gait caused by both aging and lower limb preference. Methods: Two groups of females participated in this study: Younger (n = 25, age 22. 2 ± 1. 8 years) and Middle-aged (n = 25, age 56. 6 ± 4. 9 years). COP movement and ground reaction forces during gait at self-selected speed were recorded using two force platforms. The standard deviations of the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior COP displacements in four subphases: loading response (LR), midstance (MSt), terminal stance (TSt) and pre-swing (PSw) were assessed. Results: The observed variables indicated significantly higher mean values in almost all cases in subphases LR and PSw in comparison with MSt and TSt. When comparing preferred and non-preferred limb, the preferred limb showed <b>greater</b> <b>variability</b> in medial-lateral direction during LR and less variability in anterior-posterior direction during PSw.
