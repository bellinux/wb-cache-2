5|$|In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds {{demonstrated}} that alpha particles are helium nuclei {{by allowing the}} particles to penetrate the thin glass wall of an <b>evacuated</b> <b>tube,</b> then creating a discharge in the tube to study the spectra of the new gas inside. In 1908, helium was first liquefied by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes by cooling the gas to less than one kelvin. He tried to solidify it by further reducing the temperature but failed because helium does not solidify at atmospheric pressure. Onnes' student Willem Hendrik Keesom was eventually able to solidify 1cm3 of helium in 1926 by applying additional external pressure.|$|E

The most famous was the <b>evacuated</b> <b>tube</b> used for scientific research by William Crookes. That tube was evacuated by the highly effective mercury vacuum pump created by Hermann Sprengel. Research conducted by Crookes and others ultimately led to the discovery of the electron in 1897 by J. J. Thomson and X-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm Roentgen. But the Crookes tube, as it came to be known, produced little light because the vacuum in it was too good and thus lacked the trace amounts of gas that are needed for electrically stimulated luminescence.|$|E

Michelson died with only 36 of the 233 measurement series completed and the experiment was subsequently beset by geological instability and condensation problems before the result of 299,774±11km/s, consistent with the prevailing electro-optic values, was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E
25|$|Various {{types of}} solar {{collectors}} for residential applications {{are available with}} either direct circulation (i.e., heats water and brings it directly to the home for use) or indirect circulation (i.e., pumps a heat transfer fluid through a heat exchanger, which then heats water that flows into the home) systems. In an <b>evacuated</b> <b>tube</b> solar hot water heater with an indirect circulation system, the evacuated tubes contain a glass outer tube and metal absorber tube attached to a fin. Solar thermal energy is absorbed within the evacuated tubes and is converted into usable concentrated heat. Evacuated glass tubes have a double layer. Inside the glass tube is the copper heat pipe. It is a sealed hollow copper tube that contains {{a small amount of}} thermal transfer fluid (water or glycol mixture) which under low pressure boils at a very low temperature. The copper heat pipe transfers thermal energy from within the solar tube into a copper header. As the solution circulates through the copper header, the temperature rises.|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{number of}} preanalytical {{activities}} strongly infl uence sample quality, especially {{those related to}} sample collection. Since blood drawing through intravenous catheters is reported as a potential source of erythrocyte injury, we performed a critical review and meta-analysis {{about the risk of}} catheter-related hemolysis. Materials and methods: We performed a systematic search on PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus to estimate the risk of spurious hemolysis in blood samples collected from intravenous catheters. A meta-analysis with calculation of Odds ratio (OR) and Relative risk (RR) along with 95 % Con-fi dence interval (95 % CI) was carried out using random eff ect mode. Results: Fifteen articles including 17 studies were fi nally selected. The total number of patients was 14, 796 in 13 studies assessing catheter and <b>evacuated</b> <b>tubes</b> versus straight needle and <b>evacuated</b> <b>tubes,</b> and 1251 in 4 studies assessing catheter and <b>evacuated</b> <b>tubes</b> versus catheter and ma-nual aspiration. A signifi cant risk of hemolysis was found in studies assessing catheter and <b>evacuated</b> <b>tubes</b> versus straight needle and <b>evacuated</b> <b>tubes</b> (random eff ect OR 3. 4; 95 % CI = 2. 9 - 3. 9 and random eff ect RR 1. 07; 95 % CI = 1. 06 - 1. 08), as well as in studies assessing catheter and <b>evacuated</b> <b>tubes</b> versus catheter and manual aspiration of blood (OR 3. 7; 95 % CI = 2. 7 - 5. 1 and RR 1. 32; 95 % CI = 1. 24 - 1. 40). Conclusions: Sample collection through intravenous catheters is associated with signifi cant higher risk of spurious hemolysis as compared with standard blood drawn by straight needle, and this risk is further amplifi ed when intravenous catheter are associated with primary <b>evacuated</b> blood <b>tubes</b> as compared with manual aspiration.

40|$|The {{productivity}} of the solar still {{is determined by the}} temperature of water in the basin and the glass temperature. Various active methods have been adopted to increase the temperature of the basin, so as to improve the {{productivity of}} solar still. Most of the previous research works have been focusing on flat plate collector and concentrating collector. In this experimental study, a single slope solar still directly augmented with <b>evacuated</b> <b>tubes</b> was used to increase the daily productivity by reducing heat losses. <b>Evacuated</b> <b>tubes</b> were directly coupled to the lower side of the single slope solar still with an area of 1 m 2. Black gravel is used to increase the productivity by means of reducing quantity of water in the basin. Extensive experiments were conducted to explore the performance of solar still in several modes namely still alone, still with black stones, still with <b>evacuated</b> <b>tubes,</b> and still with <b>evacuated</b> <b>tubes</b> and black gravel. The experimental setup was designed and installed at Solar Energy Park, Tamilnadu College of Engineering, Coimbatore (77 ˚E, 11 ˚N), Tamilnadu, India.

50|$|Flat-plate {{collectors}} usually {{lose more}} heat {{to the environment}} than evacuated tubes, as an increasing function of temperature. They are inappropriate for high temperature applications such as process steam production. <b>Evacuated</b> <b>tube</b> collectors have a lower absorber plate area to gross area ratio (typically 60-80% of gross area) compared to flat plates. Based on absorber plate area, most <b>evacuated</b> <b>tube</b> systems are more efficient per square meter than equivalent flat plate systems. This makes them suitable where roof space is limiting, for example where the number of occupants of a building {{is higher than the}} number of square metres of suitable and available roof space. In general, per installed square metre, evacuated tubes deliver marginally more energy when the ambient temperature is low (e.g. during winter) or when the sky is overcast. However even in areas without much sunshine and solar heat, some low cost flat plate collectors can be more cost efficient than <b>evacuated</b> <b>tube</b> collectors. Although several European companies manufacture <b>evacuated</b> <b>tube</b> collectors, the <b>evacuated</b> <b>tube</b> market is dominated by manufacturers in the East. Several Chinese companies have track records of 15-30 years. There is no unambiguous evidence that the two designs differ in long term reliability. However, <b>evacuated</b> <b>tube</b> technology is younger and (especially for newer variants with sealed heat pipes) still need to demonstrate competitive lifetimes. The modularity of evacuated tubes can be advantageous in terms of extensibility and maintenance, for example if the vacuum in one tube diminishes.|$|E

5000|$|In {{solar thermal}} water heating applications, an {{individual}} absorber tube of an <b>evacuated</b> <b>tube</b> collector {{is up to}} 40% more efficient compared to more traditional [...] "flat plate" [...] solar water collectors. This {{is largely due to}} the vacuum that exists within the tube, which slows down convective and conductive heat loss. Relative efficiencies of the <b>evacuated</b> <b>tube</b> system are reduced however, when compared to flat plate collectors because the latter have a larger aperture size and can absorb more solar energy per unit area. This means that while an individual <b>evacuated</b> <b>tube</b> has better insulation (lower conductive and convective losses) due to the vacuum created inside the tube, an array of tubes found in a completed solar assembly absorbs less energy per unit area due to there being less absorber surface area pointed toward the sun because of the rounded design of an <b>evacuated</b> <b>tube</b> collector.
