This study emphasized the complexity of CE via validation procedure, {{in the case of}} heterogeneous processes. An <b>in-house</b> <b>validation</b> procedure of a capillary electrophoretic method aiming at analysis of aqueous process samples with heterogeneous matrices was evaluated. The validation parameters were discussed through an example case of a CE method, developed for the determination of saccharose, glucose and polydatin, applied in calibration solutions and process samples. The validation data was used in evaluation of uncertainty components. The results from the <b>in-house</b> <b>validation</b> procedure showed that the most critical parameter in the determination of uncertainty was repeatability. Selectivity and reproducibility are also critical, particularly in the case of analyzing heterogeneous samples with changing composition.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficacy}} of the <b>in-house</b> <b>validation</b> of GMO detection methods (DNA isolation and real-time PCR, polymerase chain reaction), a study was performed to gain insight in the contribution of the different steps of the GMO detection method to the repeatability and in-house reproducibility. In the present study, 19 methods for (GM) soy, maize canola and potato were validated in-house of which 14 {{on the basis of a}}n 8 -day validation scheme using eight different samples and five on the basis of a more concise validation protocol. In this way, data was obtained with respect to the detection limit, accuracy and precision. Also, decision limits were calculated for declaring non-conformance (> 0. 9 %) with 95 % reliability. In order to estimate the contribution of the different steps in the GMO analysis to the total variation variance components were estimated using REML (residual maximum likelihood method). From these components, relative standard deviations for repeatability and reproducibility (RSDr and RSDR) were calculated. The results showed that not only the PCR reaction but also the factors ‘DNA isolation’ and ‘PCR day’ are important factors for the total variance and should therefore be included in the <b>in-house</b> <b>validation.</b> It is proposed to use a statistical model to estimate these factors from a large dataset of initial validations so that for similar GMO methods in the future, only the PCR step needs to be validated.

40|$|On May 10, 2016, {{this report}} was posted online as an MMWR Early Release. Diagnostic testing for Zika virus {{infection}} {{can be accomplished}} using molecular and serologic methods. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the preferred test for Zika virus infection {{because it can be}} performed rapidly and is highly specific (1, 2). However, in most patients, Zika virus RNA is unlikely to be detected in serum after the first week of illness (2, 3). Recent reports using adaptations of previously published methods (2, 4) suggest that Zika virus RNA can be detected in urine for at least 2 weeks after onset of symptoms (3, 5 - 7). Currently, the CDC Trioplex rRT-PCR assay is the only diagnostic tool authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for Zika virus testing of urine (1). Other laboratory-developed tests will need <b>in-house</b> <b>validations</b> to adequately characterize the performance of the assay and meet Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments requirements. Further investigation is needed to determine the sensitivity and utility of Zika virus rRT-PCR on urine specimens collected 22 ̆ 030514 days after onset of symptoms. On the basis of the newly available data, CDC recommends that Zika virus rRT-PCR be performed on urine collected < 14 days after onset of symptoms in patients with suspected Zika virus disease. Zika virus rRT-PCR testing of urine should be performed in conjunction with serum testing if using specimens collected < 7 days after symptom onset (8). A positive result in either specimen type provides evidence of Zika virus infection. Procedures for the collection and submission of body fluids, including urine specimens, have been described previously (9). CDC recommendations for Zika virus testing of serum and other clinical specimens remain unchanged at this time (8). CDC will continue to review and update guidance for Zika virus testing as new data become available.

40|$|Given the {{extensive}} presence of some toxic {{quaternary ammonium compound}} residues in foodstuffs arriving into the EU during 2012, the Food Authority Control of Geneva decided to implement a monitoring plan to investigate {{the presence of these}} contaminants in food: a method based on quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction and liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was developed for analyzing didecyldimethylammonium chloride and four benzalkonium chloride homologue residues in fruits and vegetables. An <b>in-house</b> method <b>validation,</b> based on the SANCO guidelines (Document SANCO No. 12571 / 2013), was conducted using three independent series in orange, lettuce, and avocado composite samples spiked at three levels (10, 100, 500 μg/kg). Trueness and precision were calculated by pooling all results at each concentration level to account for the variability among fruits and vegetables. To avoidmatrix effects on quantitative results, five quantification strategies were investigated: (i) solvent calibration, (ii) matrix-matched calibration prepared on samples and (iii) on sample extract aliquots, and (iv) standard addition prepared on samples and (v) on sample extract aliquots. Due to the nonlinear instrumental response for the large concentration range investigated, a quadratic calibration model was mandatory for all approaches. Solvent calibration gave very poor recoveries due to the high signal suppression caused by matrix effects. Smaller biases were observed for matrix-matched calibrations; however, these results exhibited relatively low precision. Both of the standard addition methods compensated for matrix effects and provided accurate analytical results. Due to the ease of its implementation, the matrix standard addition method, where analytes are added to sample extract aliquots, was preferred over the classical standard addition in samples. Nonlinear extrapolations appeared to be particularly effective in obtaining good results for both standard addition methods when the calibration curve was convex or very slightly concave.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{reference}} materials for quality control of analysis of foodstuffs has been stressed frequently. This {{has been particularly}} true in the phycotoxins field, {{where there is a}} great shortage of both pure calibration standards and reference materials. Worldwide there are very few independent bodies that produce certified reference materials for phycotoxins, the main producers currently being the National Research Council Canada and the Japanese Food Research Laboratory. Limited availability of contaminated shellfish and algae, as well as the time and knowledge necessary for the production of adequate reference materials, continuously lead to limited editions of certified reference materials and even more limited production of in-house reference materials. The restricted availability of in-house quality control materials promotes the rapid use of the limited certified reference materials, which in turn hampers the production of the suite of materials required globally for complete protection of public health. This paper outlines the various options that analysts can pursue in the use of reference materials for internal and external quality control, with a view to optimising the efforts of both reference materials users and reference materials producers. For this purpose, the logical sequence is reviewed from the discovery of a new bioactive compound in shellfish, through initial method development up to regulation for food safety purposes including accepted reference methods. Subsequently, the requirements for and efforts typically spent in the production and characterisation of laboratory reference materials, certified reference materials and other test materials used in inter-laboratory studies or proficiency testing, in the area of marine biotoxins are evaluated. Particular emphasis is put on practical advice for the preparation of in-house reference materials. The intricate link between reference material characterisation and method performance is outlined to give guidance on the appropriate <b>in-house</b> method <b>validation</b> in the rapidly developing field of phycotoxins.

40|$|Rationale and objectives. Carotenoid {{content of}} food plants often varies {{not only with}} species and variety but also with natural factors such as light exposition, soil and temperature. The extent of this {{variation}} is not established since many non-controllable factors are involved {{for a long period}} of time and these factors may affect different plants in different manners. The objective of this work is to study the carotenoid content of the variety Portuguese cabbage in three landraces of three country regions and to contribute to the definition of the respective sampling plan. Materials and methods. Three different samples of Portuguese cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. costata D. C.) landraces, Valhascos, glória de Portugal and penca respectively from Ribatejo (centre), Beira Alta (inland north) and Minho (north) were studied in relation to their carotenoid content which was quantified, after extraction, by a reversed phase HPLC method. Analytical measurement uncertainty was estimated based on data from the <b>in-house</b> method <b>validation.</b> The between samples variance was compared with the measurement uncertainty through an F-test. Results. Lutein and all-trans- -carotene content in Portuguese cabbage samples were, in mg/ 100 g, respectively 4. 7 and 3. 6 for Valhascos, 0. 52 and 0. 46 for glória de Portugal, and 3. 3 and 2. 8 for penca. Relative analytical measurement uncertainty was 0. 19 and 0. 21, respectively, for lutein and all-trans- - carotene. At a significance level of 5 %, Valhascos and penca landraces did not present statistically significant differences. However, glória de Portugal landrace was statistically different from the last two. Conclusions. The analysed Portuguese cabbages are very good sources of lutein and -carotene presenting diet advantages. The results show that carotenoid content of Portuguese cabbage varies with the geographical region of production easily overshadowing contributions from the analytical process. That factor should be addressed in the production of data for Food Composition Data Bases and based on this study, for the group of Valhascos and penca, and for lutein, 5 primary samples are necessary to estimate the population’s mean value, with a 95 % confidence and 10 % accuracy.

An experimental protocol for <b>in-house</b> <b>validation</b> of a screening immunoassay has been designed and applied to evaluate performance characteristics of a multiplex dipstick kit for the determination of major Fusarium toxins, namely zearalenone, T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins, deoxynivalenol and fumonisins in wheat and maize. The test is intended for screening of cereals on the presence/absence of these mycotoxins at maximum permitted levels established by European legislation or target levels. The response of the measurement is determined with a reader device. Samples classified as negative are considered as compliant, whereas positive samples need to be reanalysed with confirmatory methods. The <b>in-house</b> <b>validation</b> design consisted of three steps, namely (1) estimating the precision of the method including "between day" effects and influences from different varieties of the matrices, (2) establishing robust cutoff values for the dipstick response at target mycotoxin levels assuming an acceptable rate of false negative results of 5 % and (3) assessment of the rate of false positive results of blank samples and samples containing the target analytes below the legal limits. The total precision expressed as relative standard deviation and determined individually for each analyte/concentration/matrix combination varied from 9 to 30 % and was considered as acceptable. In 17 out of 28 cases, the repeatability standard deviation was the most important factor. The predominance of the repeatability compared to the other factors (matrix, days) was an indicator for the ruggedness of the assay. The validation study demonstrated that the test was able to differentiate blank samples from samples contaminated at target mycotoxin levels with a false positive rate lower than 6 %. Considering realistic mycotoxin occurrence in European samples, significant economical benefits can be expected when using the test under real-world conditions. JRC.

40|$|A {{capillary}} zone electrophoresis (CZE) method, optimised chemometrically, {{underwent a}} complete <b>in-house</b> <b>validation</b> protocol for the qualification and quantification of sucralose in various foodstuffs. Separation from matrix components was obtained in a dinitrobenzoic acid (3 mM) / sodium hydroxide (20 mM) background electrolyte with a pH of 12. 1, a potential of 0. 11 kV cm- 1 and {{a temperature of}} 22 °C. Detection was achieved at 238 nm by indirect UV. Screening, optimisation and robustness testing were all carried out {{with the aid of}} experimental design. Using standard addition calibration, the CZE method has been applied to still, carbonated and alcoholic beverages, yoghurts and hard boiled candy. The method allows the detection of sucralose at > 30 mg kg- 1, with a linearity range of 50 ¿ 500 mg kg- 1, making it suitable for implementation of the recently amended ¿Sweeteners for use in Foodstuffs¿ Directive [1], which set maximum usable doses of sucralose for many foodstuffs, most ranging from 200 mg kg- 1 to 450 mg kg- 1.

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations (DNS) of turbulent pipe flows {{are carried}} out to investigate the suppression of previously-identified internal noise sources with an acoustic liner using a time-domain acoustic liner model developed by Tam and Auriault (AIAA Journal, 34 (5), 917 - 923, 1996). The liner model is implemented and tested in an <b>in-house</b> DNS code. <b>Validation</b> tests are conducted to show its correct implementation in the DNS solver. In order to study the liner model capability a number of tests {{are carried out}} with different liner parameters and flow Mach Numbers. To understand {{the effect of the}} liner on the acoustic and turbulent components of the unsteady wall pressure, an azimuthal/axial Fourier transform is applied and the acoustic and turbulent wavenumber regimes are clearly identified. It is found that the spectral component occupying the turbulent wavenumber range is unaffected by the liner, whereas the acoustic wavenumber components are strongly attenuated, with individual radial modes evident as each cuts on with increasing Strouhal number. The acoustic wavenumber analysis shows that the acoustic component of the wall pressure prevails over the hydrodynamic wall pressure. This allows the acoustic liner model to dissipate the acoustic field only, leaving the hydrodynamic component statistically unchanged. Furthermore, a DNS of a pipe/jet configuration is computed to study the effects of the acoustic liner model on the far-field noise. Noise prediction is performed using the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) method. The FWH method has also been tested to identify the best configuration of the FWH surface. A conical-shaped surface proved to be a better surface. Furthermore, results show far-field noise reduction when the liner model is present...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work has been to study if it is {{possible}} to reduce the mesh resolution but still capture the general flow behavior and heat transfer in a rocket nozzle cooling channels by using a specific type of domain in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The domain used in this work is a subdomain in the software Ansys CFX by the company Ansys. Ansys CFX is a software used to calculate fluid flow with the Navier-Stokes equations, so called CFD. The geometry that the investigations was conducted on were a square tube with a length of 4. 2 [m] connected with a inlet manifold and a outlet manifold and 4 other tubes. In order to verify the results a simulation were preformed {{in the beginning of the}} thesis that were compared with Volvo Aero’s <b>in-house</b> code. The <b>validation</b> showed that, with the turbulence model SST k − ! and a friction loss coefficient, the temperature, pressure and velocity where matched with the simulation of the in-house code. After verifying the boundary conditions and mesh, the second part of the thesis were to investigate how well CFX handles the interface between a very coarse mesh and a very fine mesh. These results showed that the interface affects the result but the disturbances are sufficiently low for the purpose of the task. Finally the geometry with inlet manifold and outlet manifold and five tubes were simulated and evaluated in order to get a estimate of the time that it takes for the solution to converge. Comparing this simulation time with the time it takes for a fully resolved tube, the results showed a great improvement...|$|R
40|$|Tropane {{alkaloids}} (TAs) are toxic secondary metabolites {{produced by}} plants of, inter alia, the genera Datura (thorn apple) and Atropa (deadly nightshade). The most relevant TAs are (-) -L-hyoscyamine and (-) -L-scopolamine, which act as antagonists of acetylcholine muscarinic receptors and can induce {{a variety of}} distinct toxic syndromes in mammals (anti-cholinergic poisoning). The European Union has regulated the presence of seeds of Datura sp. in animal feeds, specifying that the content should not exceed 1000 mg kg(- 1) (Directive 2002 / 32 /EC). For materials {{that have not been}} ground, visual screening methods are often used to comply with these regulations, but these cannot be used for ground materials and compound feeds. Immunological assays, preferably in dipstick format, can be a simple and cost-effective approach to monitor feedstuffs in an HACCP setting in control laboratories. So far no reports have been published on immunoassays that are capable of detecting both hyoscyamine and scopolamine with equal sensitivity and that can be used, preferably in dipstick format, for application as a fast screening tool in feed analysis. This study presents the results obtained for the <b>in-house</b> and inter-laboratory <b>validation</b> of a dipstick immunoassay for the detection of hyoscyamine and scopolamine in animal feed. The target level was set at 800 µg kg(- 1) for the sum of both alkaloids. By using a representative set of compound feeds during validation and a robust study design, a reliable impression of the relevant characteristics of the assay could be obtained. The dipstick test displayed similar sensitivity towards the two alkaloids and it could be concluded that the test has a very low probability of producing a false-positive result at blank level or a false-negative result at target level. The assay can be used for monitoring of TAs in feedstuffs, but has also potential as a quick screening tool in food- or feed-related poisonings...|$|R
