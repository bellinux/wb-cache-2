5000|$|A <b>hypertext</b> <b>link</b> simply {{indicates}} that a link exists between two documents or [...] "information resources". Hyperdata links go beyond simply such a connection, and express semantics {{about the kind of}} connection being made. For instance, in a document about Hillary Clinton, a <b>hypertext</b> <b>link</b> might be made from the word senator to a document about the United States Senate. In contrast, a hyperdata link from the same word to the same document might also state that senator was one of Hillary Clinton's roles, titles, or positions (depending on the ontology being used to define this link).|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} based on earlier work [Loehr 97] {{investigating}} the relationship between <b>hypertext</b> <b>linking</b> and ordinary deixis. That work was an exploratory foray into a brand-new realm, and attempted to answer some basic questions: Just what forms do <b>hypertext</b> <b>links</b> take? Given the intuitively deictic nature of <b>hypertext</b> <b>links,</b> is there any quantitative relationship between how Web authors use <b>hypertext</b> <b>links</b> and deictics? Finally, given the brand-new genre of Web documents, does this relationship change as authors become more experienced with hypertext authoring? The first study, while illuminating, was unable to confirm any quantitative relationship between <b>hypertext</b> <b>links</b> and deictics. The goal of the current research is to focus and refine the methodology used earlier, in attempt to get a clearer answer. Specifically, the earlier methodology had several flaws, which I will attempt to repair. First, in attempting to quantitatively m [...] ...|$|R

An example of interactive presentation semantics is defining the expected behavior of a <b>hypertext</b> <b>link</b> on a suitable syntax.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe authors, who publish {{knowledge}} on the Web related to readable electronic documents on a screen, {{use the technology}} of <b>hypertext</b> <b>links</b> or the <b>hypertext</b> writing approach for making their sites more interesting and more attractive, and also to enrich it by information coming from other Web sites. However, <b>hypertext</b> <b>links</b> are not without posing problems for readers and search engines like disorientation and cognitive overload for readers and publicities links for search engines. We are interested in semantics of <b>hypertext</b> <b>links,</b> in terms of extraction and exploitation {{with the aim of}} facilitating the search of {{knowledge on}} the Web. In this article, we propose an original methodology for the semantic extraction of hypertext. Firstly, we show how we constitute a corpus of documents on the Web, which will be our data set. Then we propose a method of semantic analysis of <b>hypertext</b> <b>links.</b> This method consists in making the semantic analysis of calling context of link and context called by link, and explicit in a formal way the semantic relation between the two contexts...|$|R
5000|$|A push {{notification}} {{is a message}} that is [...] "pushed" [...] from backend server or application to user interface, e.g. (But not limited to) mobile applications and desktop applications. It is more user experience specific which is different from Push technology, which pushes the requests between components such as server to server communication. A common scenario of {{push notification}} is the client application pops up a message in front of application's user information, along with the alert sounds. The notification could also be coupled with images and <b>hypertext</b> <b>link</b> in some cases. Via interacting with the push notification it usually brings up the client applications to the front.|$|E
5000|$|Section 512(d) {{provides}} {{service providers}} protection against copyright infringement {{by reason of}} referring or linking users to an online location containing infringing material or infringing activity by using information location tools, including <b>hypertext</b> <b>link.</b> CCBill argued that it fell under this safe harbor because it displays a hyperlink {{to provide access to}} the user to access the client website {{at the end of the}} consumer transaction. The court disagreed with the claim by pointing out the majority of CCBill’s functions are outside providing information location services. In addition, P10 did not claim that CCBill infringed its copyrights by providing a hyperlink; rather, the alleged infringement was through other services provided by CCBill. Therefore, CCBill should not qualify for the § 512(d) safe harbor.|$|E
50|$|Mosaic {{had been}} {{developed}} by university programmers who had access to full TCP/IP connections and high-speed transmissions. This {{was evident in the}} design of the program—for instance, after clicking on a <b>hypertext</b> <b>link,</b> the user had to wait until all parts of the page had been retrieved by the browser before anything showed on the screen. High-speed connections allowed TCP/IP's ability to do multiple retrievals at once, and for the delay between the user's request for a page and its appearance to be short. Therefore, not only could Mosaic not be used by most home users because of their lack of TCP/IP connections, but even if they had TCP/IP, the low speed of home modems would bring out the problems in the Mosaic design for slower speed connections (typically 9600 and 14.4k baud).|$|E

5000|$|Once the HTML or XHTML markup is {{delivered}} to a page-visitor's client browser, {{there is a}} chance that client-side code will need to navigate the internal structure (or Document Object Model) of the web page. The most common {{reason for this is that}} the page {{is delivered}} with client-side JavaScript that will produce on-going dynamic behavior after the page is rendered. For example, if rolling the mouse over a 'Buy now' link is meant to make the price, elsewhere on the page, become emphasized, JavaScript code can do this, but JavaScript needs to identify the price element, wherever it is in the markup. The following markup would suffice: [...] Another example is the Ajax programming technique, where, for example, clicking a <b>hypertext</b> <b>link</b> may cause JavaScript code to retrieve the text for a new price quotation to display in place of the current one within the page, without re-loading the whole page. When the new text arrives back from the server, the JavaScript must identify the exact region on the page to replace with the new information.|$|E

[...] The bill requires the Attorney General to serve notice to the defendant. [...] Once the court issues an order, it could be served on financial transaction providers, Internet advertising services, Internet service providers, and information location tools to require them to stop financial transactions with the rogue site and remove links to it. [...] The term [...] "information location tool" [...] is borrowed from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and is understood to refer to search engines but could cover other sites that link to content. The PROTECT IP Act says that an [...] "information location tool shall take technically feasible and reasonable measures, as expeditiously as possible, to remove or disable access to the Internet site associated with the domain name {{set forth in the}} order". In addition, it must delete all hyperlinks to the offending [...] "Internet site". Nonauthoritative domain name servers would be ordered to take technically feasible and reasonable steps to prevent the domain name from resolving to the IP address of a website that had been found by the court to be [...] "dedicated to infringing activities." [...] The website could still be reached by its IP address, but links or users that used the website’s domain name would not reach it.
