Large, medium-size and tiny birds as groups displayed significantly higher visitation <b>frequency</b> <b>indices</b> on fruits of both emerging alien shrub species than the other shrub species. Small birds as a group displayed insignificantly different visitation <b>frequency</b> <b>indices</b> on fruits of both emerging and established alien shrub species but significantly higher visitation <b>frequency</b> <b>indices</b> on fruits of both emerging and established alien shrub species than on fruits of the native shrub species. However, {{there were significant differences}} in foraging <b>frequency</b> <b>indices</b> of the bird species included within each of these body size groups on fruits of the different shrub species. Among the large birds, Columba guinea and among the medium size birds Sturnus vulgaris, Streptopelia senegalensis, Turdus olivaceus and Onychognathus morio all exhibited significantly higher visitation <b>frequency</b> <b>indices</b> on fruits of both emerging alien shrub species than on fruits of the other shrub species. These findings indicate that alien plant control measures should be focused on eradicating localised populations of emerging aliens to limit preferential consumption of their fruits by birds and consequent dispersal of their seeds that germinate readily into natural areas...|$|R

5000|$|The Momentary Average Interruption <b>Frequency</b> <b>Index</b> (MAIFI) is a {{reliability}} indicator used by electric power utilities. MAIFI {{is the average}} number of momentary interruptions that a customer would experience during a given period (typically a year). Electric power utilities may define momentary interruptions differently, with some considering a momentary interruption to be an outage of less than 1 minute in duration while others may consider a momentary interruption to be an outage of less than 5 minutes in duration.|$|E

Ratio of transmitting signal bandwidth to channel coherence bandwidth is defined as <b>frequency</b> selectivity <b>index.</b> BER and bit energy-to-noise ratio gain of transmitted signal according to <b>frequency</b> selectivity <b>index</b> are evaluated. In the results of indoor water tank experiment, BER is well matched theoretical results at <b>frequency</b> selectivity <b>index</b> less than about 1. 0. And bit energy-to-noise ratio gain is also matched theoretical value of 5 dB. BER is effectively decreased at frequency selective multipath channel with <b>frequency</b> selectivity <b>index</b> higher than 1. 0.

What <b>Frequency</b> <b>Indices</b> Suggest While the EU is a customs union in merchandise trade (goods), it has not yet reached this stage of integration in service trade.

Social networks potentially form a huge repository of private knowledge that is unavailable on any search engine. The Multi Agent Referral system (MARS) prototype is a tool for building and exploiting social networks. Referral chains represent social networks and are used to request for experts in a particular field. The MARS system uses software agents to automate the search of information and expertise. However information about a user’s expertise is not readily available. Also currently most systems do not exploit {{the fact that the}} user’s document repository is a good pointer to other user’s interests.
