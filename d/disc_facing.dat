5000|$|The general {{assembly}} hereby establishes a recommended procedure for the folding {{of the state}} flag by two people. The procedure is as follows:With the flag unfolded, fold the flag in half lengthwise so that the points of the flag are aligned. Fold the flag in half lengthwise a second time to form a long strip with the red <b>disc</b> <b>facing</b> the ground. Next, fold the pointed end back onto itself to form a rectangle. These steps entail three folds.Starting on the end formed by the fold of the pointed end back onto itself, fold two inches of the flag onto itself for a flag with a three-foot hoist and a five-foot fly, or another appropriate width of fold for a flag of a different size. Repeat the folds a total of fourteen times, alternating the folds in a fan-like manner.The result is a total of seventeen folds symbolizing that Ohio was the seventeenth state admitted to the Union. Finally, neatly and snugly wrap the remaining length of flag around the fan-folds to form a compact rectangle.|$|E

We use a double pulse-echo technique to provide an accurate measure of transit time through the thickness of aluminum discs produced by hydrostatic extrusion (25 % area reduction).

40|$|Using {{smoothed}} particle hydrodynamics, we numerically simulate {{steady state}} accretion discs for Cataclysmic Variable Dwarf Novae {{systems that have}} a secondary-to-primary mass ratio (0. 35 < q < 0. 55). After these accretion discs have come to quasi-equilibrium, we rotate each disc out of the orbital plane by (δ = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,) or (20) ^o) to induce negative superhumps. For accretion discs tilted 5 ^o, we generate light curves and associated Fourier transforms for an atlas on negative superhumps and retrograde precession. Our simulation results suggest that accretion discs need to be tilted more than three degrees for negative superhumps to be statistically significant. We also show that if the disc is tilted enough such that the gas stream strikes a <b>disc</b> <b>face,</b> then a dense cooling ring is generated near the radius of impact. In addition to the atlas, we study these artificially tilted accretion discs to find the source to negative superhumps. Our {{results suggest that the}} source is additional light from innermost disc annuli, and this additional light waxes and wanes with the amount of gas stream overflow received as the secondary orbits. The nodes, where the gas stream transitions from flowing over to under the disc rim (and vice versa), precess in the retrograde direction.

40|$|The {{intervertebral}} <b>disc</b> <b>faces</b> high {{compressive forces}} during daily activities. Axial compression induces creeping fluid loss and reduction in disc height. With degeneration, disc fluids and height are progressively lost, altering biomechanics. It {{is assumed that}} this reduction of fluids {{is caused by a}} decline of osmolality within the disc due to proteoglycan depletion. Here we investigate the isolated effect of a reduction in osmosis on the biomechanical properties of the intervertebral disc. Continuous diurnal loading was applied to healthy caprine intervertebral discs in a loaded disc culture system for a total of 6 days. We increased testing bath osmolality with two doses of polyethylene-glycol (PEG), thereby reducing the osmotic gradient between the disc and the surrounding fluid. This way we could study the isolated effect of reduced osmosis on axial creep, without damaging the disc. We evaluated: daily creep and recovery, recovery time-constants and compressive stiffness. Additionally, we investigated water content. There was a strong dose-dependent effect of PEG concentration on water content and axial creep behaviour: disc height, amplitude and rate of creep and recovery were all significantly reduced. Axial compressive stiffness of the disc was not affected. Reduction of water content and amplitude of creep and recovery showed similarity to degenerative disc biomechanics. However, the time-constants increased, indicating that the hydraulic permeability was reduced, in contrast to what happens with degeneration. This suggests that besides the osmotic gradient, the permeability of the tissues determines healthy intervertebral disc biomechanic...|$|R
