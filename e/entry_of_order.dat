An automated primary/on-call coverage by direct typing. An automated primary/on-call coverage list directs patient alerts and cosigning requests to the proper physician.

40|$|Lepton-flavour {{symmetry}} in the Standard Model {{is broken}} by small masses for charged leptons and neutrinos. Introducing neutrino masses via dimension- 5 operators associated to lepton-number violation {{at a very}} high scale, the corresponding coupling matrix may still have <b>entries</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> 1, resembling the situation in the quark sector with large top Yukawa coupling. As we have shown recently, in such a situation one may introduce the coupling matrices between lepton and Higgs fields as non-linear representations of lepton-flavour symmetry within an effective-theory framework. This allows us to separate the effects related to the large mass difference observed in atmospheric neutrino oscillations from those related to the solar mass difference. We discuss the cases of normal or inverted hierarchical and almost degenerate neutrino spectrum, give some examples to illustrate minimal lepton-flavour violation in radiative and leptonic decays, and also provide a systematic definition of next-to-minimal lepton-flavour violation within the non-linear framework.

Assuming that P≠NP, this disproves a conjecture by Öhman. Furthermore, we present several new families of avoidable arrays. In particular, every single entry array (arrays where each cell contains at most one symbol) <b>of</b> <b>order</b> n≥ 2 k with entries from at most k distinct symbols and where each symbol occurs in at most n− 2 cells is avoidable, and every single <b>entry</b> array <b>of</b> <b>order</b> n, where each of the symbols 1,…,n occurs in at most ⌊n 5 ⌋ cells, is avoidable.

40|$|Purpose. Study results {{demonstrating the}} {{effectiveness}} of order-entry clinical decision support (CDS) alerts {{as a tool for}} enforcing therapeutic interchange are presented. Methods. A retrospective observational study was conducted at an academic medical center to evaluate formulary nonadherence before and after implementation of a fully electronic medical record with computerized prescriber order-entry (CPOE) technology configured to display therapeutic interchange alerts immediately on <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> for nonformulary agents. Formulary nonadherence (defined as the proportion <b>of</b> pharmacist-verified nonformulary <b>orders</b> to total verified orders) within eight medication classes was assessed during a six-month baseline period and two consecutive six-month periods after implementation. Results. In the 12 months after implementation of the therapeutic interchange alerts, the overall rate of formulary nonadherence decreased by 65 %, from 3. 5 % at baseline to 1. 2 % during the second 6 -month postintervention period (p < 0. 001). The total number <b>of</b> verified nonformulary <b>orders</b> decreased from 300 at baseline to 102 during the second postintervention period. The largest decreases in formulary nonadherence were observed in the intranasal steroid drug class (the rate <b>of</b> nonadherent <b>orders</b> declined by a total of 12 percentage points) and the nonbarbiturate sedatives and hypnotics class (a 5 -point decline), with significant 6 - and 12 -month declines also documented in four of the remaining six drug classes.

40|$|The {{retailing}} industry, in the United States and Europe alike, faces maturing {{markets and}} stiffening domestic competition. In response, {{many of the}} industry's main players have shown a growing interest in cross-border initiatives. The success <b>of</b> such foreign <b>entries</b> obviously depends on {{the appropriateness of the}} retail firm's post-entry decisions, but may also depend on the strategic choices made at the time <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> as they shape the platform from which competitive advantages can be gained. Little empirical evidence is available, however, on the contribution of these time-of-entry choices to post-entry performance, especially in the longer run. In this paper, we consider simultaneously five strategic <b>entry</b> decisions: scale <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> mode <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> the adaptation <b>of</b> the retail format to local market conditions and the familiarity of the store format to the parent company. We focus on the estimation of these decisions' effects on the long-run performance of a retail firm's foreign operations. In addition, we account for the moderating impact of three sets of control variables: characteristics of the foreign operations' retail mix, the parent firm's resources and the host-market's characteristics. Formally, the strategic choices and control variables are linked to the foreign operation's asymptotic performance level, which we derive from S-shaped growth models. We calibrate these models on a data set covering the post-entry performance of over 160 foreign entries made by Europe's top 75 food retailers, both towards Western-European countries and to a variety of transition economies in Eastern Europe. The empirical findings suggest that the strategic decisions made at the time <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> continue to influence the foreign subsidiary's future performance, both in terms of sales performance and in terms of efficiency (sales/m 2). Specifically, higher long-run post-entry sales and efficiency can be expected when entering early, with substantial scale, using no partners or acquired assets while offering a store format that {{is at the same time}} new to the host market and familiar to the parent firm...|$|R
