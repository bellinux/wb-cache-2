5|$|The up-down <b>display</b> <b>is</b> {{used for}} a number of {{interactions}} {{with other members of the}} species. Here a stork positions its body horizontally and quickly bobs its head up from down-facing to around 30 degrees above horizontal and back again, while displaying the white segments of its plumage prominently, and this is repeated several times. The <b>display</b> <b>is</b> used as a greeting between birds, and—more vigorously—as a threat display. The species' solitary nature means that this threat <b>display</b> <b>is</b> rarely witnessed.|$|E
5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by {{the responses of the}} animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the <b>display</b> <b>is</b> classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the <b>display</b> <b>is</b> taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{coincides with}} the {{availability}} of water. In South America and South Africa, the main nesting period is December–February, in Nigeria it is July–December, and in North America mid-May–August. In India, the breeding season is from June to October but peaking in July and August. Fulvous whistling ducks show lifelong monogamy, although the courtship <b>display</b> <b>is</b> limited to some mutual head-dipping before mating and a short dance after copulation in which the birds raise their bodies side-by-side while treading water.|$|E
50|$|Only a few {{of these}} <b>displays</b> <b>are</b> commercially {{available}} in the 2010s, though OLED <b>displays</b> <b>are</b> beginning deployment in smartphones and very recent in televisions.|$|R

5|$|Frogs such as Physalaemus nattereri, Physalaemus deimaticus, and Pleurodema brachyops have {{a warning}} display behaviour. These animals inflate {{themselves}} with air {{and raise their}} hind parts to appear as large as possible, and display brightly coloured markings and eyespots to intimidate predators. Seven species of frogs in the genus Pleurodema have lumbar glands (making the animals distasteful, so in their case the <b>display</b> <b>is</b> likely aposematic); these glands are usually boldly contrasted in black as a further warning.|$|E
5|$|Like others storks, {{it lacks}} vocal muscles and {{produces}} sound mainly by bill-clattering, although low grunting, mooing or roaring sounds are made especially when nesting. The bill-clattering <b>display</b> <b>is</b> {{made with the}} bill raised high and {{differs from that of}} the closely related African marabou which holds the bill pointed downwards.|$|E
5|$|Observed in this species, the wing-fluttering <b>display</b> <b>is</b> seen {{in several}} situations: females responding, and presumably acquiescing, to male {{courtship}} displays, juveniles begging for food, by helpers to older birds, and immature males to senior ones. The fairywren lowers {{its head and}} tail, outstretches and quivers its wings and holds its beak open silently.|$|E
40|$|In many novel {{application}} scenarios such {{as smart}} rooms or sensing rooms visual sensors (such as cameras) {{need to know}} which visual actuators (such as <b>displays)</b> <b>are</b> visible to them. Often only parts of a <b>display</b> <b>are</b> visible from a camera. Therefore, a novel algorithm for precise visibility determination is presented. The algorithm makes {{the assumption that the}} <b>displays</b> <b>are</b> active, i. e., they can be controlled by the application. Under these conditions the algorithm determines precisely where which parts of a <b>display</b> <b>are</b> imaged by a camera. 1...|$|R
50|$|The <b>displays</b> <b>were</b> {{designed}} by Arch E. Baranger, Hazel J. Baranger and Robert Gerlach and manufactured in runs of about 30 each. A total of 167 different designs <b>were</b> produced. The <b>displays</b> <b>were</b> never sold but rented to jewellers under a contract {{in which the}} <b>displays</b> <b>were</b> rotated monthly, each jeweller returning the old one and receiving a new one to display.|$|R

5|$|Symantec has {{released}} {{a special edition}} of Norton Internet Security optimized for netbooks. This is available as download from the Symantec website or in a USB thumb drive. Symantec states that the Netbook edition is optimized for netbooks. The main <b>display</b> <b>is</b> optimized to provide support for the 800 x 480 screen resolution. In addition, non-critical tasks are delayed while the netbook is on battery. Furthermore, the Netbook edition contains complimentary access to Norton's secure online backup and parental control to protect children as they surf the web.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{contains}} {{a collection of}} books and journals pertaining to arts, crafts, performance, anthropology and folklore of South India. There are also 1,000,000 pictures. The entire <b>display</b> <b>is</b> in the English language, and highlights the cultural aspects of Brahminical people and the craft traditions of heritage homes of South India.|$|E
5|$|Also on <b>display</b> <b>is</b> {{a burden}} basket created by basketmaker Sophie George {{in the design}} of the baskets used by the Kalapuya, the Native American tribe that {{formerly}} inhabited the Tualatin Valley. As few members of the Kalapuya remain and none had the knowledge of how to make the basket, George visited the British Museum to find an example of a basket in order to design the replica. A bronze cast was created and is displayed at Hillsboro Central. The station also includes a weather vane, one of a series of eight on the Westside MAX. Designed by Keith Jellum and located on the roof of the station building, the vane resembles old train signals. Constructed of bronze, the semaphore signals stop and approach.|$|E

5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males mate with multiple females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males that are unable to claim a site are forced {{to live on the}} periphery where they have less reproductive success. Promiscuity, where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat. Nevertheless, there does appear to be bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though <b>display,</b> <b>is</b> rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E
5|$|Deimatic {{displays}} {{are made}} by insects including the praying mantises (Mantidae) and stick insects (Phasmatodea). While undisturbed, these insects are usually well camouflaged. When disturbed by a potential predator, they suddenly reveal their hind wings, which are brightly coloured. In mantises, the wing <b>display</b> <b>is</b> sometimes reinforced by showing brightly coloured front legs, and accompanied by a loud hissing sound created by stridulation. For example, the grasshopper Phymateus displays red and yellow areas on its hind wings; it is also aposematic, producing a distasteful secretion from its thorax. Similarly the threat display of the walking stick phasmid (Peruphasma schultei) is not a bluff: the insect sprays defensive dolichodial-like monoterpene chemical compounds at attackers.|$|E
5|$|Males display {{during the}} {{breeding}} season at a lek {{in a traditional}} open grassy arena. The ruff {{is one of the}} few lekking species in which the <b>display</b> <b>is</b> primarily directed at other males rather than to the females, and it is among the small percentage of birds in which the males have well-marked and inherited variations in plumage and mating behaviour. There are three male forms: the typical territorial males, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, and a very rare variant with female-like plumage. The behaviour and appearance for an individual male remain constant through its adult life, and are determined by its genes (see §Biology of variation among males).|$|E
50|$|The PFD and {{navigation}} display (and multi-function <b>display,</b> where fitted) <b>are</b> often physically identical. The information <b>displayed</b> <b>is</b> {{determined by the}} system interfaces where the <b>display</b> units <b>are</b> fitted. Thus, spares holding is simplified: the one <b>display</b> unit can <b>be</b> fitted in any position.|$|R
5000|$|The fourth {{generation}} of <b>displays</b> <b>were</b> introduced simultaneously with the Blue & White Power Macintosh G3 in 1999, {{which included the}} translucent plastics of the iMac (initially white and blue [...] "blueberry", then white and grey [...] "graphite" [...] upon {{the introduction of the}} Power Mac G4). The <b>displays</b> <b>were</b> also designed with same translucent look. The Apple Studio Display series of CRT <b>displays</b> <b>were</b> available in a 17" [...] Diamondtron and a 21" [...] Trinitron CRT, both driven by an LG-Manufactured chassis. These <b>displays</b> <b>were</b> notorious for faulty flybacks. The last Apple external CRT <b>display</b> <b>was</b> introduced in 2000 along with the Power Mac G4 Cube. Both it and the new LCD Studio Displays featured clear plastics to match the Cube, and the new Apple Display Connector, which provided power, USB, and video signals to the monitor through a single cable. It was available only in a 17" [...] flat screened Diamondtron CRT. It was discontinued the following year.|$|R
40|$|Auditory <b>displays</b> <b>are</b> {{an ongoing}} topic of human {{computer}} interaction research {{and have been}} shown to be beneficial in human interfaces. Further, binaural spatial acoustic <b>displays</b> <b>are</b> a topic of increasingly active research. As these virtual acoustic displays become more predominant, new methods for measuring user's perceptions and the display's effectiveness become necessary. A novel method for examining virtual acoustic displays, specifically localization strategies within these <b>displays,</b> <b>is</b> presented. This method is analogous to eye tracking in visual displays. Such a method may be useful in the evaluation of virtual acoustic displays and in the design of adaptive acoustic displays.

5|$|Since the 20thcentury it {{has been}} {{traditional}} for the newly crowned monarch {{and other members of}} the royal family to sit for official portraits at Buckingham Palace and appear on the balcony, from where in 1953 they watched a flypast by the Royal Air Force. During the appearance, the monarch wears the Imperial State Crown and, if there is one, the queen consort wears her consort crown. In the evening, a fireworks <b>display</b> <b>is</b> held nearby, usually in Hyde Park. In 1902, EdwardVII's illness led to the postponement of a fourteen-course banquet at Buckingham Palace. In 1953, two state banquets were held in the ballroom there, and classical music was provided by the Royal Horse Guards.|$|E
5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a syrinx, their vocal <b>display</b> <b>is</b> limited to grunts and hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.|$|E
5|$|The West Point Museum is {{directly}} {{adjacent to the}} visitor's center, in the renovated Olmsted Hall {{on the grounds of}} the former Ladycliff College. Originally opened to the public in 1854, the West Point Museum is the oldest military museum in the country. During the summer months, the museum operates access to the Fort Putnam historic site on main post and access to the 282 acre Constitution Island. Some of the most notable items on display at the museum are George Washington's pistols, Napoleon's sword, a dagger carried by Hermann Goering when he was captured, a revolver that belonged to Goering, and a silver-plated party book, signed by Charles Lindbergh, Herbert Hoover and Mussolini, among others. Arguably, the most prized artifact on <b>display</b> <b>is</b> a gold-plated pistol that belonged to Adolf Hitler.|$|E

50|$|Cockpit presentation: The TCAS {{interface}} with the pilots {{is provided by}} two displays: the traffic display and the RA display. These two <b>displays</b> can <b>be</b> implemented {{in a number of}} ways, including displays that incorporate both displays into a single, physical unit.

5|$|The {{courtship}} <b>display</b> <b>is</b> poorly recorded. Ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith {{observed a}} display {{in which the}} male hopped beside the female in a tree, drooping its wings and ruffling the chestnut-coloured feathers on its back. Groups {{of two or more}} males have been observed chasing a female. In the house sparrow a similar display exists, in which a female who is not ready to copulate is chased by her mate, who is joined by other males. It is not known if the display in the Cape sparrow has a similar significance. When ready to mate, the female crouches in solicitation and is mounted by the male. Instances of hybridisation with the house sparrow, the southern grey-headed sparrow, and captives or escapees of the Sudan golden sparrow have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, sales {{took place}} in the {{daffodil}} fields prior to harvesting the bulbs, but today sales are handled by Marketing Boards although still before harvesting. In the Netherlands there are special exhibition gardens for major buyers to view flowers and order bulbs, some larger ones may have more than a thousand narcissus varieties on display. While individuals can visit these gardens they cannot buy bulbs at retail, which are only available at wholesale, usually at a minimum of several hundredweight. The most famous <b>display</b> <b>is</b> at Keukenhof, although only about 100 narcissus varieties are on display there.|$|E
5|$|Waxwings are {{not highly}} territorial, and, {{although}} normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest close together {{where there are}} a number of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates, and females may squabble over nest sites. Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black throat, and opening the bill. The breeding <b>display</b> <b>is</b> almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and turns his head away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, to his partner, placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females.|$|E
50|$|<b>Display</b> {{multiplexing}} <b>is</b> {{very different}} from multiplexing used in data transmission, although {{it has the same}} basic principles. In display multiplexing, the data lines of the <b>displays</b> <b>are</b> connected in parallel to a common bus on the microcontroller. Then, the <b>displays</b> <b>are</b> turned on and addressed individually. This allows use of fewer I/O pins than it would normally take to drive the same number of displays directly.|$|R
25|$|There is {{a debate}} over whether rousant or <b>displayed</b> <b>is</b> the eagle's default depiction. <b>Displayed</b> <b>is</b> more common {{because it is more}} artistically {{pleasing}} and it fully uses the field's space.
