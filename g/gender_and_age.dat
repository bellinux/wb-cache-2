5|$|Although the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{has affected}} men, women, {{and children in}} Malawi, certain factors such as sexual orientation, <b>gender,</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> influence infection patterns. In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex, but the epidemic has also significantly impacted the homosexual male population in Malawi. In addition, women in Malawi {{are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Finally, the disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 Malawian children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of orphans in Malawi has increased dramatically since the epidemic began in 1985.|$|E
5|$|That a large {{population}} remained in residence in the north sector of Mundo Perdido during the Terminal Classic {{is evidenced by the}} quantity of burials of differing <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>age.</b> Some were interred inside collapsed buildings or in casual graves. They were usually accompanied by very few funerary offerings, generally bone and lithic artefacts. The dense occupation of the north sector, which included elite activity, continued for at least a hundred years after the abandonment of the rest of Tikal and is perhaps linked to the nearby water supply and to continued ritual activity at Temple III. While the northern portion of the Mundo Perdido continued in use, the rest of the complex was partially abandoned. The occupation of the Mundo Perdido came to an end in the Terminal Classic and very few traces of Postclassic activity have been recovered, limited to a few ceramic finds in Structure 3D-43 to the north.|$|E
5|$|There were {{formerly}} up {{to seven}} species described, including C. casuarius, C. bicristatus Parks 1935, C. brevicristatus Parks 1935, C. excavatus Gilmore 1923, C. frontalis Parks 1935, and C. intermedius Parks 1923. In 1975 Peter Dodson studied {{the differences between the}} skulls and crests of different species of lambeosaurine dinosaurs. He found that the differences in size and shape may have actually been related to the <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> of the animal. Now only one species is recognized for certain, C. casuarius, although C. intermedius has been recognized as valid in some studies. It is based on specimen ROM 776, a skull found by Levi Sternberg in 1920 and was named by William Parks in 1923, who had originally named it Stephanosaurus intermedius earlier that year. The specific name of C. intermedius is derived from its apparent intermediate position according to Parks. C. intermedius lived at a slightly later time in the Campanian than C. casuarius, and the two species are not identical, which supported the separation of them in a 2009 study.|$|E

25|$|Individuals {{with the}} {{diagnosis}} of schizophrenia can show deficits in theory of mind. Mirjam Sprong and colleagues investigated the impairment by examining 29 different studies, {{with a total of}} over 1500 participants. This meta-analysis showed significant and stable deficit of theory of mind in people with schizophrenia. They performed poorly on false-belief tasks, which test the ability to understand that others can hold false beliefs about events in the world, and also on intention-inference tasks, which assess the ability to infer a character's intention from reading a short story. Schizophrenia patients with negative symptoms, such as lack of emotion, motivation, or speech, have the most impairment in theory of mind and are unable to represent the mental states of themselves and of others. Paranoid schizophrenic patients also perform poorly because they have difficulty accurately interpreting others' intentions. The meta-analysis additionally showed that IQ, <b>gender,</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> of the participants does not significantly affect the performance of theory of mind tasks.|$|E
25|$|A {{skipping}} rope (British English) or jump rope (American English) {{is a tool}} used in the sport of jump rope where one or more participants jump over a rope swung so that it passes under their feet and over their heads. There are multiple subsets of jump rope including: single freestyle, single speed, pairs, three person speed (double dutch), and three person freestyle (double dutch freestyle). The events are often separated by <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>age.</b> There are hundreds of competitive teams all around the world. There are a few major organisations that support jump rope as a sport as seen below, schools rarely have jump rope teams, and states do not sanction official events for high school or elementary school. In freestyle events, jumpers {{use a variety of}} basic and advanced techniques in a routine of one minute, which is judged by a head judge, content judges, and performance judges. In speed events, a jumper alternates their feet with the rope going around the jumper every time one of their feet hit the ground for 30 seconds, one minute, or three minutes. The jumper is judged on the number of times the right foot touches the ground in those times.|$|E

500|$|On 19 August, Chetniks {{commanded}} by Ostojić, but drawn mainly from Đurišić's Lim-Sandžak Chetnik Detachment and {{acting on the}} orders of Mihailović, attacked and captured the eastern Bosnian town of Foča, which had been abandoned by the Partisans in June and had then been occupied by NDH forces. After a two-hour battle, Chetnik units entered Foča and began massacring the Muslim population of the town, regardless of <b>gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>age.</b> According to the initial Chetnik reports, a total of 1,000 people were killed, including about 450 members of the Croatian Home Guard and Ustaše Militia, as well as around 300 women and children. Later Chetnik reports stated that between 2,000 and 3,000 were killed in Foča after its capture. A few days after they seized Foča, Baćović and Jevđević reported to Mihailović that all traces of the massacre had been removed and they had formally announced that those responsible for looting and killing had been shot. Eight days after the capture of Foča, Baćović wrote, [...] "on that occasion 1,200 Ustaše in uniform and about 1,000 compromised Muslims perished, while we suffered only four dead and five wounded".|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} received {{mixed reviews}} from critics. In {{a review of}} the PSP version of My Spanish Coach, IGN noted that acquiring mastery points in the minigames lead to [...] "quite a bit of grinding" [...] due to the game's repetitive structure.

IGN's review of the DS versions of both games commented that neither game taught the future or past tense, calling it one of the [...] "most disappointing" [...] aspects of the game, but praised the effective incorporation of the DS stylus into the minigames. Eurogamer noted that the minigames were [...] "only really good for practicing reading" [...] {{due to a lack of}} games for practicing proper speaking, but GameZone disagreed, noting that the player was able to hear their attempt to speak the French or Spanish words alongside the correct pronunciation during lessons, and praised this aspect as the [...] "most interesting and intriguing feature of [...] ". In {{a review of the}} DS version of My Spanish Coach, Nintendo World Report lamented that many of the minigames [...] "exhibit the same type of unimaginative boringness" [...] and that [...] "it takes ages to unlock new lessons and mini-games"; however, it noted that the minigames were [...] "extremely effective" [...] and [...] "constructed extremely well" [...] in terms of teaching the language. Nintendo World Report's review of the DS version of My French Coach called the game's reference section [...] "a very handy travel dictionary", noting that having a dictionary list and a phrasebook with audio files that could bookmark chosen phrases was [...] "an absurd value".|$|E

This book builds on Arber and Ginn’s edited collection Connecting <b>Gender</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ageing</b> published in 1995, but breaks with much feminist scholarship by redressing the earlier focus on women <b>and</b> empha-sizing changing <b>gender</b> identities <b>and</b> relationships. Turning points, such as transitions to retirement, widowhood and the onset of health problems or caring, throw into sharp relief the meanings of masculinity and identities in later life. Cohorts entering midlife and later life {{in the early years of}} the twenty-first century grew up following the Second World War and had a very different life course experience compared with earlier generations. This is particularly so for women, who have experienced longer attachment to the labour market...|$|R

In this paper, some practical implementation issues of VTN are discussed. We adopted a method to train model and selected the proper normalization scales of different speakers. The acoustic model is estimated from the unnormalized acoustic vectors of large speakers by maximum likelihood training. Then we use the gender-independent model to select the proper normalization scales of different speaker. The above steps are repeated. For VTN in training, we discussed with the drift effect of the warp parameter with the increasing of the number of iterations and the number of mixtures of the acoustic model. We studied the distribution of the warp parameter of different <b>genders</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> groups. To facilitate the fast warp parameter selection process, we proposed a hierarchical method and compared with the traditional methods...|$|R
