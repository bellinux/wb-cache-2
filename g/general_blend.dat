40|$|Construction and Demolition (C and D) wastes are {{increasingly}} used as construction material {{in a range}} of civil engineering applications. Fine Recycled Glass (FRG) is collected at municipal kerbsides and its usage to date has been limited to unbound pavement layers. This research was undertaken to evaluate the performance of FRG as a supplementary material in blends with cement stabilized recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). Laboratory evaluation was undertaken on the RCA/FRG blends with 10 %, 20 % and 30 % FRG content and stabilized with 3 % medium setting <b>General</b> <b>Blend</b> (GB) cement. The laboratory evaluation was comprised of pH, plasticity index, foreign materials content, particle size distribution, linear shrinkage, California Bearing Ratio, modified Proctor compaction, Repeated Load Triaxial test, Unconfined Compressive Strength test and flexural beam tests. The cement stabilized RCA/FRG blends with up to 30 % FRG content were found to have physical properties, which comply with the local state road authority requirements. The results of Repeated Load Triaxial tests indicated the RCA/FRG blends performed well with 30 % FRG content just on the border line for bound pavement material. Unconfined Compression Strengths met the minimum requirement for 7 days of curing for all blends, while the 28 day strength of the blends showed a significant improvement with curing. The results of the flexural beam tests were noted to be consistent with past works with cement stabilized virgin quarry rock products. The modulus of rupture and flexural modulus for all the cement-stabilized RCA/FRG blends indicate that these blends are suitable for applications such as cement-stabilized pavement bases/subbases. The fatigue life was also within the range previously reported for quarry materials. The cement-stabilized blends with FRG as a supplementary material with up to 30 % FRG content and 3 % GB cement were found to have physical and strength properties, which would comply with road authority requirements...|$|E

Geopolymers use by-product substances such as fly ash, and can help reduce carbon dioxide emission of concrete production. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study on the fly ash based geopolymer concrete suitable for curing at ambient temperature. To activate the fly ash, a combination of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solutions was used. The setting and hardening of geopolymer concrete were obtained by blending blast furnace slag with fly ash instead of using heat curing. Ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) was used at the rate of 10 % or 20 % of the total binder. The tests conducted include compressive strength, tensile strength, flexure strength, sorptivity and volume of permeable voids (VPV) test. The geopolymer concrete compressive strength at 28 days varied from 27 to 47 MPa.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} effect of feed {{composition}} {{on the performance of}} the high-level vitrification process. It is assumed in this study that the tank wastes are retrieved and blended by tank farms, producing 12 different blends from the single-shell tank farms, two blends of double-shell tank waste, and a separately defined all-tank blend. This blending scenario was chosen only for evaluating the impact of composition on the volume of high- level waste glass produced. Special glass compositions were formulated for each waste blend based on glass property models and the properties of similar glasses. These glasses were formulated to meet the applicable viscosity, electrical conductivity, and liquidus temperature constraints for the identified candidate melters. Candidate melters in this study include the low-temperature stirred melter, which operates at 1050 {degrees}C; the reference Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant liquid-fed ceramic melter, which operates at 1150 {degrees}C; and the high-temperature, joule-heated melter and the cold-crucible melter, which operate over a temperature range of 1150 {degrees}C to 1400 {degrees}C. In the most conservative case, it is estimated that 61, 000 MT of glass will be produced if the Site`s high-level wastes are retrieved by tank farms and processed in the reference joule-heated melter. If an all-tank blend was processed under the same conditions, the reference melter would produce 21, 250 MT of glass. If cross-tank blending were used, it is anticipated that $ 2. 0 billion could be saved in repository disposal costs (based on an average disposal cost of $ 217, 000 per canister) by blending the S, SX, B, and T Tank Farm wastes with other wastes prior to vitrification. <b>General</b> <b>blending</b> among all the tank farms is expected to produce great potential benefit...|$|R
