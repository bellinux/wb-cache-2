5|$|Unlike {{most other}} self-extracting revolvers (such as the Webley service revolvers or the Smith & Wesson No. 3 Revolver), the Enfield Mk I/Mk II was {{complicated}} to unload, having an Owen Jones selective extraction/ejection system {{which was supposed}} to allow the firer to eject spent cartridges, whilst retaining live rounds in the cylinder. The Enfield Mk I/Mk II had a hinged frame, and when the barrel was unlatched, the cylinder would move forward, operating the extraction system and allowing the spent cartridges to simply fall out. The idea was that the cylinder moved forward <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> permit fired cases to be completely extracted (and ejected by gravity), but not <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> permit live cartridges (i.e., those with projectiles still present, and thus longer in overall length) from being removed in the same manner.|$|E

5|$|Bodyline was {{a tactic}} devised for and {{primarily}} {{used in the}} Ashes series between England and Australia in 1932—33. The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at {{the body of a}} batsman stood in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on the leg side would catch any defensive deflections from the bat. The batsman's options were to evade the ball through ducking or moving aside, allow the ball to strike their body or play the ball with his bat. The latter course carried additional risks. Defensive shots brought few runs and could carry <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be caught by the fielders on the leg side; pull and hook shots could be caught {{on the edge of the}} field where two men were usually placed for such a shot.|$|E

5|$|Alibera quickly intensified, {{attaining}} {{tropical cyclone}} status on December20 while southwest of Agaléga. Although the MFR estimated 10‑minute winds of 140km/h (85mph) that day, the JTWC assessed that {{the storm was}} vastly stronger, estimating peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (150mph). This is equivalent to a super typhoon, which made Alibera tied for the strongest cyclone in the southern hemisphere that season, along with Cyclone Alex in the Australian basin. On December21, Alibera turned sharply {{to the south and}} slowly weakened. On the next day, the storm curved to an eastward drift as a downgraded severe tropical storm, its path influenced by ridges to the east and west. It maintained its intensity for the next several days, turning back to the south on December24 and slowly recurving to the west. However, the movement was erratic, and the storm executed four small loops. Although the MFR had forecasting difficulties during this time, the storm remained <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> the north of the Mascarene Islands to limit rainfall warnings.|$|E

5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E

5|$|The German {{artillery}} bombardment was heaviest in {{the sector}} {{held by the}} right company of the 47th Battalion and the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers {{on either side of}} the railway bridge northwest of Dernancourt. I/230 RIR had barely been able to reach its jumping off point in time, and fell behind its barrage. It advanced through the British barrage south of Dernancourt and quickly moved through the village, with part of the battalion reaching the railway embankment. About 09:30, the German shelling in the sector near the bridge lessened. The commander of the right section of the 12th Machine Gun Company, stationed near the bridge with the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers, climbed up the embankment and looking over the rails, saw a number of German bayonets sticking up on the other side. After a quick discussion with the ranking officer of the pioneers in that area, it was decided they would attack immediately. Charging across the railway line, they pushed the German force back <b>far</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> bring one of the Vickers guns into action. The fire from this gun drove the Germans of I/230 RIR back as far as Dernancourt. Before this counter-attack was launched, Foord, feeling his position to be insecure, requested reinforcement. Two companies of Highland Light Infantry were sent forward from the 106th Brigade support line, arriving around the time of the counter-attack, although they suffered significant casualties as they moved down the exposed slope. II and III/230 RIR were unable to get through Dernancourt to reinforce I/230 RIR, due to a tremendous British bombardment that fell on the village as they approached. They sought shelter in the cellars of the village. Any troops that attempted to cross the open ground between the village and the railway were shot down.|$|E
