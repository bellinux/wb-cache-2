5|$|A {{town that}} had just over 65,000 {{residents}} in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, {{with a population of}} nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 <b>high-tech</b> industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other <b>high-tech</b> companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move into the valley and open manufacturing operations.|$|E
5|$|Art Connections {{underwent}} a complete renovation in 2004. Most {{of the work}} went into installing new, <b>high-tech</b> activities, including a virtual canvas powered by a laser-light paintbrush and a room that turns dancers' shadows into art on the wall.|$|E

Oak asks the player to fulfill his dream of compiling a comprehensive list of every Pokémon in the game.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, the Bay Area {{and the rest}} of Northern California became the center of the {{counterculture}} movement. Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in San Francisco were seen as centers of activity, with the hit American pop song San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair) further enticing like-minded individuals to join the movement in the Bay Area and leading to the Summer of Love. In the proceeding decades, the Bay Area would cement itself as a hotbed of New Left activism, student activism, opposition to the Vietnam War and other anti-war movements, the black power movement, and the gay rights movement. At the same time, San Jose {{and the rest of}} the South Bay began to rapidly develop as it began to transition from a largely agricultural-based economy into the hotbed of the <b>high-tech</b> industry. Fred Terman, the director of a top-secret research project at Harvard University during World War II, joined the faculty at Stanford University in order to reshape the university's engineering department. His students, including David Packard and William Hewlett would later help usher in the region's <b>high-tech</b> revolution. In 1955, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory opened for business near Stanford, and although the business venture was a financial failure, it was the first semiconductor company in the Bay Area, and the talent that it attracted to the region eventually led to a <b>high-tech</b> cluster of companies later known as Silicon Valley.|$|E
5|$|The Hsinchu Station is an oval-shaped {{space with}} a curved {{parallelogram}} roof. It is designed {{to respond to the}} sunlight and winds in Hsinchu. The cladding of the roof is durable stainless steel. It keeps the maintenance easier and enhances the <b>high-tech</b> image. The roof opens up over the platform and rail to avoid a piston effect and the style responds to the local environment. The station has become the new landmark of Hsinchu.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{considered}} highly innovative {{for a variety}} of reasons, including the presence of academia, access to venture capital, and the presence of many <b>high-tech</b> companies. The Route 128 corridor and Greater Boston continue to be a major center for venture capital investment, and high technology remains an important sector.|$|E
5|$|The methodological {{breakthroughs}} of the neurosciences, {{in particular}} the introduction of <b>high-tech</b> neuroimaging procedures, has propelled scientists toward the elaboration of increasingly ambitious research programs: {{one of the main}} goals is to describe and comprehend the neural processes which correspond to mental functions (see: neural correlate). Several groups are inspired by these advances.|$|E
5|$|The {{substation}} {{was proposed}} in the early 2000s, during redevelopment of South Lake Union into a <b>high-tech</b> hub. A former Greyhound bus garage was acquired by Seattle City Light and demolished in 2014.

5|$|Drama {{is equally}} important, with plays staged {{throughout}} the school year, the main performance being at Great Academies, whilst some students take Theatre Studies as an additional AS Level subject. The college has a traditional theatre, the Academy Room, and a <b>high-tech</b> theatre built at St Mary's Hall {{as part of the}} Centenaries Appeal in 1993. The latter plays host to the annual Ribble Valley International Piano Week. Several former pupils have gone on to achieve success upon the stage, including OSCAR-winning actor and director Charles Laughton and BAFTA-winning director and producer Peter Glenville.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term in office, Tainan City became the first Taiwanese city to enter the Alliance for Healthy Cities of the World Health Organization. In addition, Tainan also became the first Taiwanese city to enter the Global Cities Dialogue. Hsu also {{believes}} that Tainan should become a city of international tourism and culture, and he is working towards that purpose. In September 2007, {{he spoke to the}} 2007 Asia-Pacific Cities Summit participants and stated that Tainan is blessed with natural, historic, cultural and humanistic characteristics, and that Tainan also possesses great conditions for <b>high-tech,</b> trade and investment development.|$|E
5|$|Founded {{concurrently}} {{with the}} passenger operations of EVA Air, EVA Air Cargo operates facilities in Europe, Asia, and North America. Its cargo operations have diversified to include transportation of <b>high-tech</b> equipment and special care {{items such as}} museum artwork and live zoological specimens. EVA Air has stated its goal of achieving a 50/50 split in revenues between its passenger and cargo operations. The airline's cargo operations are mainly operated via a fleet of Boeing 747-400, MD-11 dedicated freighters, Boeing 747-400 Combi aircraft, and additional belly cargo space on passenger aircraft.|$|E
5|$|<b>High-tech</b> {{systems may}} be {{dedicated}} devices developed solely for AAC, or non-dedicated {{devices such as}} computers that run additional software {{to allow them to}} function as AAC devices. They may be static or dynamic in form. Static communication devices have symbols in fixed positions on paper overlays, which are changed manually. To increase the vocabulary available, some static devices have multiple levels, with different words appearing on different levels. On dynamic AAC devices, the user can change the symbols available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Billboard {{was sold}} again to Affiliated Publications for $100 million. Billboard Publications Inc. became a {{subsidiary}} of Affiliated Publications called BPI Communications. As BPI Communications, it acquired The Hollywood Reporter, Adweek, Marketing Week and Mediaweek. It purchased Broadcast Data Systems, which is a <b>high-tech</b> firm for tracking music airtime. Private investors from Boston Ventures and BPI executives re-purchased a two-thirds interest in Billboard Publications for $100 million and more acquisitions followed. In 1993, it created a division called Billboard Music Group for music-related publications.|$|E
5|$|In addition, a 50,000 square-meter {{entertainment}} {{complex that}} will contain a Disney theme park, cinemas, shops, and a 25-screen Multiplex theater {{will be built}} at the Check Post exit from the Carmel Tunnels. In 2014, a new major plan for the city was proposed, under which extensive development of residential, business, and leisure areas will take place with the target of increasing the city's population by 60,000 by 2025. Under the plan, five new neighborhoods will be built, along with new <b>high-tech</b> parks. In addition, existing employment centers will be renovated, and new leisure areas and a large park will be built.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the region {{gave birth to}} some of the state's {{earliest}} oil fields and refineries as the Texas Oil Boom took hold. Refining and manufacturing grew rapidly in the area, particularly around Baytown, Pasadena, and Texas City. The opening of the Port of Texas City, and later Barbours Cut and Bayport, gradually established the region as an important shipping center. As wealth increased in southeast Texas, resorts and other tourist draws developed in the Bay Area. During the 1960s the area became home of the Johnson Space Center, headquarters for the nation's manned space program, which helped diversify the regional economy and began the development of an aerospace industry, and later other <b>high-tech</b> industries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{it was decided}} to upgrade the Røa and Sognsvann Lines to metro standard. This would allow them to use T1000 stock. Twelve T2000 were ordered in 1991, and would be {{sufficient}} to operate the services on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines, that would retain an overhead wire. The development costs for the T2000 were in part subsidized by the government, as the <b>high-tech</b> product from Strømmens Verksted (by then part of the ABB Group) and AEG was seen as a future export product. The trains were delivered in 1994 and taken into use in 1995. The same year, the metro started operating all services through the city center, connecting the western and eastern networks.|$|E
5|$|Japan is {{the third}} largest {{automobile}} producer in the world, and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company. The Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is currently {{in a state of}} decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea, the United States and China. However, despite also facing similar competition from South Korea and China, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is expected to remain strong due to an increased focus on specialized, <b>high-tech</b> designs.|$|E
5|$|Power remains {{relatively}} inexpensive along the Columbia, {{and in recent}} years <b>high-tech</b> companies like Google have begun to move server farm operations into the area to avail themselves of cheap power. Downriver of Grand Coulee, each dam's reservoir is closely regulated by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and various Washington public utility districts to ensure flow, flood control, and power generation objectives are met. Increasingly, hydro-power operations are required to meet standards under the US Endangered Species Act and other agreements to manage operations to minimize impacts on salmon and other fish, and some conservation and fishing groups support removing four dams on the lower Snake River, the largest tributary of the Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{progress}} in {{hardware and software}} development continued, including projects funded by the European Community. The first commercially available dynamic screen speech generating devices were developed in the 1990s. At the same time synthesized speech was becoming available in more languages. Software programs were developed that allowed the computer-based production of communication boards. <b>High-tech</b> devices have continued to reduce in size and weight, while increasing accessibility and capacities. Modern communication devices can also enable users to access the internet and some {{can be used as}} environmental control devices for independent access of TV, radio, telephone etc.|$|E
5|$|Symbols are visuals used to {{represent}} objects, actions, and concepts {{through the use of}} items such as the physical object itself, colored or black and white photographs, line drawings, and written words. For users with literacy skills, alphabet-based symbols including individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof may be used in combination with the other types of symbols.Tactile symbols which are textured objects, real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a communication symbols particularly for individuals with visual impairments and/or significant intellectual impairments. Both low- and <b>high-tech</b> devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. Picture Communication Exchange System (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication symbols (PCS). , a <b>high-tech</b> communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills. This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.|$|E
5|$|The Batsuit {{consisted}} of 110 separate pieces, {{each of which}} had to be replicated dozens of times {{over the course of the}} production. The base layer was made of a polyester mesh that is utilized by the military and <b>high-tech</b> sports manufacturers because of its breathability and moisture-wicking properties. Molded pieces of flexible urethane were then attached to the mesh, to form the overall body armor plating. Carbon fiber panels were placed inside the sections on the legs, chest and abdomen. The cowl was sculpted from a cast of Bale's face and head to become a perfect fit for Christian Bale. The suit remained unchanged for the film since The Dark Knight.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 {{cannot be}} {{exported}} under American federal law {{to protect its}} stealth technology and other <b>high-tech</b> features. Customers for U.S. fighters are acquiring earlier designs such as the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon or the newer F-35 Lightning II, which contains technology from the F-22 but {{was designed to be}} cheaper, more flexible, and available for export. In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales. Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to prepare a report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report on the effect of F-22 export sales on U.S. aerospace industry.|$|E
5|$|The Jaguar was {{to replace}} the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR2 in the close air support, {{tactical}} reconnaissance and tactical strike roles, freeing the Phantom {{to be used for}} air defence. Both the French and British trainer requirements had developed significantly, and were eventually fulfilled instead by the Alpha Jet and Hawker Siddeley Hawk respectively. The French, meanwhile, had chosen the Jaguar {{to replace the}} Aeronavale's Dassault Étendard IV, and increased their order to include an initial 40 of a carrier-capable maritime version of the Jaguar, the Jaguar M, for the Aeronavale. From these apparently disparate aims would come a single and entirely different aircraft: relatively <b>high-tech,</b> supersonic, and optimised for ground-attack in a high-threat environment.|$|E
5|$|The Robot Building, {{located in}} the Sathorn {{business}} district of Bangkok, Thailand, houses United Overseas Bank's Bangkok headquarters. It was designed for the Bank of Asia by Sumet Jumsai to reflect the computerization of banking; its architecture is a reaction against neoclassical and <b>high-tech</b> postmodern architecture. The building's features, such as progressively receding walls, antennas, and eyes, contribute to its robotic appearance and to its practical function. Completed in 1986, the building {{is one of the}} last examples of modern architecture in Bangkok.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons visit a <b>high-tech</b> gadget {{store and}} Bart buys a gimmicky utility belt from Comic Book Guy for $4. He shows off its {{features}} to his classmates {{until he is}} beaten up by Dolph, Jimbo and Kearney, who steal the belt. In response, Homer decides {{to talk with the}} bullies' fathers at Moe's Tavern, but he is also beaten; however, they are unnerved when they cannot even knock Homer down, and are then chased away by a shotgun-wielding Moe.|$|E
