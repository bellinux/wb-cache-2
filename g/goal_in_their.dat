He started in Iraq's first match, against Indonesia, on 17 July 1977, and scored his first goal with Iraq after only 8 minutes from kickoff, scored a goal in Iraq's 5–0 win over Thailand after 6 minutes, and scored Iraq's only <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> 1–1 draw against South Korea. Iraq finished in 2nd place in the table behind South Korea, meeting them again in the final where Iraq lost 1–0. Saeed played all the 630 minutes of Iraq's 7 matches.|$|E
5|$|Mertens' agent Søren Lerby {{confirmed}} on 16 June 2013 {{that the}} player {{had agreed to}} sign with Napoli. He became Rafael Benítez's first signing as new Napoli manager after a reported fee of €9.5million was agreed with PSV. He made his Serie A debut on 25 August 2013, coming on as a second-half substitute for Marek Hamšík in a 3–0 win over Bologna. His first goal for Napoli came on 30 October when he netted the winner in a 2–1 away victory over Fiorentina. In Napoli's first game following the Serie A winter break on 6 January 2014, Mertens scored his first brace for the club in a 2–0 win over Sampdoria. He then scored Napoli's second <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> 2–0 win over Juventus on 30 March, helping inflict only the second league defeat over the eventual champions. In {{the final of the}} Coppa Italia on 3 May 2014, Mertens replaced Marek Hamšík in the 64th minute and went on to score in stoppage time, securing a 3–1 win over Fiorentina.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{performance}} improved {{during the}} early 1970s, under manager Raymond Goethals. Fully dressed in white, as the White Devils, Belgium had their first victories at World and European Championships at the 1970 World Cup and Euro 1972. En route to that Euro appearance, their first, they eliminated reigning European champions Italy by winning the two-legged play-offs on aggregate. At the end stage, they finished third by winning the consolation match against Hungary. In 1973, the denial of a match-winning <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> last 1974 FIFA World Cup qualification game for UEFA Group 3 cost Belgium their appearance at the finals, causing Belgium to become the only nation ever to miss a World Cup final round despite not allowing a goal during the qualifiers. The next two attempts to reach a major finals were also fruitless.|$|E

5|$|During the World Cup in Germany, Messi {{witnessed}} {{their opening}} match {{victory against the}} Ivory Coast from the substitutes' bench. In the next match, against Serbia and Montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent Argentina at a FIFA World Cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. He assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> 6–0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer {{in the history of}} the World Cup. As their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. Messi consequently started the game against the Netherlands, a 0–0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential. In the round of 16 match against Mexico, played on his 19th birthday, Messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1–1. He appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed. He did not play in the quarter-final against Germany, during which Argentina were eliminated 4–2 in a penalty shootout. Back home, Pékerman's decision to leave him on the bench against Germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed Messi could have changed the outcome of the match in Argentina's favour.|$|E
5|$|He scored 8 {{goals in}} 17 {{appearances}} as Rotherham made the Third Division play-offs, which saw them lose to Leyton Orient in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-final. The 1999–2000 season saw Fortune-West finish as Rotherham's top scorer with 17 goals in 43 appearances, while the club won promotion to the Second Division as Third Division runners-up. After a month into 2000–01, he joined Cardiff City of the Third Division {{for a fee}} of £300,000 on 11 September 2000. They earned promotion to the Second Division as Third Division runners-up, and he scored 13 goals from 41 appearances over the season. By {{the end of the}} season, Cardiff's rivals Swansea City were believed to be ready to make an attempt at signing Fortune-West. He scored Cardiff's second <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> play-off semi-final first leg match against Stoke City, which finished as a 2–1 away victory in April 2002. However, after featuring in a 2–0 home defeat in the second leg, Cardiff missed out on making the final, losing 3–2 on aggregate. He finished 2001–02 with 44 appearances and 11 goals. Cardiff qualified for the play-offs in 2002–03 with a sixth-place finish, and were promoted after beating Queens Park Rangers in the final, although Fortune-West {{was not part of the}} matchday squad.
