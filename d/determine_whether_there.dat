5|$|On 18 September, a {{preliminary}} enquiry {{in a district}} court was held to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was sufficient evidence for a trial to proceed. The magistrate overseeing the enquiry ordered Martin to stand trial for Gerard Lowe's murder on 2 October after hearing statements from 39 witnesses, and looking at more than 100 exhibits and 100 photographs that the prosecution had prepared as evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} {{referred}} to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on 16 September 2009 to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was evidence of misconduct or negligence by the police during the original murder investigation, the handling of Lace’s confession in 1983 and the request from Hodgson’s solicitors in 1998 for forensic examination of exhibits. The head of Southampton CID, Detective Chief Superintendent Shirley Dinnell, stated that the referral was voluntarily made by Hampshire Constabulary because of the miscarriage of justice {{that had taken place}} and to ensure transparency of inquiries.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is any real basis to them.|$|E

5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in {{whether there is a}} national security issue involved.|$|E

25|$|TiVo Inc. {{motioned to}} hold EchoStar Corp. in {{contempt}} {{for violating the}} Infringement and Disablement Provisions of the permanent injunction. The District Court utilized the KSM test {{to determine if a}} contempt proceeding was appropriate and if there was continuing infringement. The first step of the KSM test was to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was a “colorable” difference between the infringing and modified products. The second step was to compare the modified products to the patent claims to determine if the modified product infringes.|$|E
25|$|Justice Blackmun, {{joined by}} Justice Brennan and Justice White, wrote a dissent arguing against an {{automatic}} rule to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is a taking, and objected to drawing an artificial distinction between temporary and permanent physical presence.

25|$|To {{generate}} {{an image of}} the cardiovascular system, including the arteries and veins (angiography) an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest. A second image is then taken of the same region after an iodinated contrast agent has been injected into the blood vessels within this area. These two images are then digitally subtracted, leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels. The radiologist or surgeon then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is any damage or blockage of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has found}} a genetic {{component}} in sleep paralysis. The characteristic fragmentation of REM sleep, hypnopompic, and hypnagogic hallucinations have a heritable component in other parasomnias, which lends credence {{to the idea that}} sleep paralysis is also genetic. Twin studies have shown that if one twin of a monozygotic pair experiences sleep paralysis that other twin is very likely to experience it as well. The identification of a genetic component means that there is some sort of disruption of function at the physiological level. Further studies must be conducted to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is a mistake in the signaling pathway for arousal as suggested by the first theory presented, or whether the regulation of melatonin or the neural populations themselves have been disrupted.|$|E
25|$|For graphs {{drawn in}} the plane without crossings, Fáry's theorem states that one gets the same class of planar graphs {{regardless}} of whether the edges of the graph are drawn as straight line segments or as arbitrary curves. But this equivalence does not hold true for other types of drawing. For instance, although the crossing number of a graph (the minimum number of crossings in a drawing with arbitrarily curved edges) may be determined in NP, it is complete for the existential theory of the reals to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> exists a drawing achieving a given bound on the rectilinear crossing number (the minimum number of pairs of edges that cross in any drawing with edges drawn as straight line segments {{in the plane}}).|$|E

25|$|In the 1993 case of Kamal Jit Singh v. Minister for Home Affairs, the Court of Appeal of Singapore {{stated that}} {{validity}} of detention is {{not dependent on}} the subjective satisfaction of the authorities. Therefore, a court is entitled to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> are objective grounds for the Minister's satisfaction that a person {{has been associated with}} criminal activities and that his or her detention is necessary. On the other hand, it was held by the High Court in Re Wong Sin Yee that the judicial process is unsuitable for reaching decisions on questions of public safety, peace and good order. Therefore, the court will not quash the Minister's decision to detain a person unless it is so outrageous in its defiance of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the studies of canine personality, {{there has been some}} research to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> are breed differences in aggression. In a study published in 2008, aggression was divided into four categories: aggression directed at strangers, owner, strange dogs and rivalry with other household dogs. This study found that the Doberman Pinscher ranked relatively high on stranger-directed aggression, but extremely low on owner-directed aggression. The Doberman Pinscher ranked as average on dog-directed aggression and dog rivalry. Looking only at bites and attempted bites, Doberman Pinschers rank as far less aggressive towards humans, and show less aggression than many breeds without a reputation (e.g., Cocker Spaniel, Dalmatian, and Great Dane). This study concluded that aggression has a genetic basis, that the Doberman shows a distinctive pattern of aggression depending on the situation, and that contemporary Doberman Pinschers are not an aggressive breed overall. In regards to Dobermans attacking owners, it is rare and usually in the case of over discipline. Dobermans accept physical punishment to an extent. However, when they consider it to no longer be punishment, but an attack on themselves, they will defend themselves.|$|E
25|$|Administration of the Supreme Court {{is managed}} by its registry, which handles {{matters such as}} {{receiving}} and storing court documents filed in the court, and ensuring they are transmitted to judges for use during hearings. The Registry is headed by the Registrar who is assisted by the Deputy Registrar, Senior Assistant Registrars and Assistant Registrars. These officers are appointed by the President on the Chief Justice's recommendation, and {{are members of the}} Judicial Branch of the Singapore Legal Service. In addition to their administrative responsibilities, registrars deal with certain types of court proceedings in chambers, such as the assessment of damages, hearings of bankruptcy petitions and applications, interlocutory matters and pre-trial conferences. Registrars are also appointed as district judges or magistrates, which enables them to conduct preliminary inquiries to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> are enough grounds for trying accused persons for criminal offences in the High Court. The Registry is also staffed by commissioners for oaths, interpreters, clerks and process servers. Justices' law clerks, who work directly under the Chief Justice's charge, assist Judges and Judicial Commissioners with legal research, particularly for Court of Appeal matters.|$|E
