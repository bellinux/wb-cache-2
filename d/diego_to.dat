5|$|October 2, 1858: The 1858 San Diego {{hurricane}} approached {{very close}} to southern California.

5|$|The highway {{replaced}} a 1912 plank road {{across much}} of Imperial County. The winding two-lane road through the Cuyamaca Mountains {{was one of the}} factors that led to a four-hour journey from San <b>Diego</b> <b>to</b> El Centro. During the 1930s, the road was realigned through the mountains, but several curves remained. In the 1950s, work began on constructing what would become Interstate 8 (I-8) to replace the old highway in San <b>Diego</b> <b>to</b> bypass the cities of San Diego, La Mesa, and El Cajon. This started with the construction of the Alvarado Canyon road as well as Mission Valley Road through the San Diego area, as well as construction a replacement for the old highway across the Viejas Grade. The construction continued across the rest of the route through the next two decades. US 80 was gradually decommissioned after 1964 as I-8, through San Diego and Imperial counties, was completed. In 2006, the highway was designated by the California State Legislature as Historic U.S. Route 80.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, San Diego {{officials}} {{believed that a}} normal school should be established to help the town grow and increase certification of teachers. The tuition and travel for out-of-town normal schools were large and San Diegans desired to have a closer school. San Diego had to compete with Fresno, Los Angeles, and several other cities for a school, and its first attempt to establish one in 1895 was vetoed by California governor James Budd. On March 13, 1897 Governor Budd changed course and signed legislation appropriating $50,000 {{to allow for the}} establishment of a state normal school in San <b>Diego,</b> <b>to</b> be located in University Heights. By 1905, total funds appropriated to the school totaled $333,300.|$|E
5|$|State Route 67 (SR67) is a {{state highway}} in San Diego County, California. It begins at Interstate8 (I-8) in El Cajon and {{continues}} to Lakeside as the San Vicente Freeway before becoming an undivided highway through {{the eastern part of}} Poway. In the town of Ramona, the route turns into Main Street before ending at SR78.

5|$|The {{following}} week, {{the team}} played the Bengals in the playoffs, {{this time at}} Paul Brown Stadium, and secured a 24–14 victory over Cincinnati. That victory meant that the Jets would travel to San <b>Diego</b> <b>to</b> play the Chargers, who had won eleven straight games, in the divisional round. Strong performances by Sanchez, running back Shonn Greene, and the Jets defense helped the Jets to a 17–14 win over the Chargers. New York played the top-seeded Colts in the AFC Championship Game and secured an early 17–6 lead. They had little luck {{in the second half}} as the Colts went to the Super Bowl with a 30–17 victory.|$|E

5|$|When Hubbard {{arrived in}} Portland, the USS PC-815 {{was in the}} last stages of its construction. The ship, a 173ft (53 m) steel-hulled subchaser of the PC-461 class, had been laid down on October 10, 1942 at the Albina shipworks. She was {{commissioned}} on April 21, 1943 with Hubbard in command and Lt (jg) Thomas Moulton, an officer {{with whom he had}} studied in Florida, as the ship's executive officer. The ship left Portland on May 18 to travel down the Columbia River to Astoria, Oregon, where she took on ammunition. After participating for a day in an air-sea rescue operation, USS PC-815 was ordered to sail to San <b>Diego</b> <b>to</b> commence its shakedown cruise.|$|E
5|$|During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4, Saratoga and Lexington {{were able}} to launch an airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday, 7 February 1932, without being detected. The two {{carriers}} were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward. Blue Fleet and Saratoga were tasked to attack Hawaii and the West Coast defended by Lexington and the Black Fleet. On 15 March, Lexington caught Saratoga with all of her planes still on deck and was ruled to have knocked out her flight deck and have badly damaged the carrier, which was subsequently judged sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers. Captain George W. Steele assumed command on 11 July 1932. While en route from San <b>Diego</b> <b>to</b> San Pedro, the ship briefly ran aground off Sunset Beach, California on 17 August. Captain Rufus F. Zogbaum, Jr. (son of the famous illustrator) relieved Steele, who was ordered to immediately retire, on 1 January 1933.|$|E
5|$|I-8 {{is part of}} the California Freeway and Expressway System and is {{eligible}} for the State Scenic Highway System from I-5 to the western junction of SR98, though it is not an official state scenic highway. It is officially known as the Border Friendship Route from San <b>Diego</b> <b>to</b> the Arizona state line. The Interstate is signed as the Ocean Beach Freeway west of I-5. For the entire length within San Diego County and into Imperial County, it is signed as the Kumeyaay Highway, after the local Native American tribe and their traditional trade route which the Interstate follows. Between Old Town and El Cajon, I-8 is called the Mission Valley Freeway. In 2014, I-8 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 11,800vehicles between Bonds Corner Road and SR115, as well as between SR98 and Imperial Highway, and 239,000vehicles between I-805 and I-15, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway in California.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, the County Board of Supervisors {{agreed to}} submit the Campo road for {{consideration}} as a secondary state highway. The state considered {{the inclusion of}} the Campo road into the system in 1932. The California State Legislature defined Route200 in 1933 as a route from San <b>Diego</b> <b>to</b> west of Jacumba, going through the town of Campo. The San Diego Chamber of Commerce sent a representative to ask the state for funding for paving the Campo highway in 1935, and the road was paved that year. The Chamber also asked for the war department to declare the road a military highway to receive federal assistance for its improvement. Signs were posted for SR94 in 1937, and by 1938, SR94 was signed along Broadway and Lemon Grove Boulevard (later Federal Boulevard) before continuing east to Campo.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the team's poor 2003 record, Johnson {{retained}} Edwards as head coach and extended his contract through 2007. With a healthy Pennington at quarterback, the Jets began their season at 5–0 {{for the first time}} and then lost two of their next three games. During the team's second meeting with the Bills, Pennington suffered a tear in his rotator cuff that caused him to miss three starts. Pennington returned in a 29–7 rout of the Houston Texans. The team struggled toward the end of the regular season, winning only one of its final four games. Despite a final-game loss to the St. Louis Rams, the Jets reached the playoffs. The team traveled to San <b>Diego</b> <b>to</b> play the Chargers in the wild card round and upset them 23–20 on a Doug Brien field goal in overtime. The win sent the Jets to the divisional round against the 15–1 Pittsburgh Steelers. The Jets again took their opponent to overtime, as Brien missed a field goal with two minutes remaining and the score tied. He missed a second field goal in overtime. Pittsburgh kicker Jeff Reed proved more accurate, and the Steelers beat the Jets, 20–17.|$|E
5|$|Much of Alvarado Canyon Road from San <b>Diego</b> <b>to</b> La Mesa was {{originally}} built between 1947 and 1950, a bypass {{of the old}} US 80 routing along El Cajon Boulevard and La Mesa Boulevard. Work began to convert the original US 80 divided highway into a freeway in 1960, and the freeway was complete west of El Cajon by April 1962. Priority was given to planning US 80 in 1962 by the California Chamber of Commerce. In 1964, I-8 was officially designated by the California State Legislature, and the US 80 designation was removed. By 1965, I-8 from Fairmount Avenue to El Cajon Boulevard {{was one of the}} first freeway stretches in the county to have a center barrier installed in the median.|$|E
