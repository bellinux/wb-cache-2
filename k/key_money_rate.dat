40|$|Several {{programs}} have been introduced by U. S. fiscal and monetary authorities {{in response to the}} financial crisis. We examine the responses involving Treasury debt—the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), the Supplemental Financing Program, increases in Treasury issuance, and open market operations—and their impacts on the overnight Treasury general collateral repo <b>rate,</b> a <b>key</b> <b>money</b> market <b>rate.</b> Our contribution is to consider each policy in light of the others, both to help guide policy responses to future crises and to emphasize policy interactions. Only the TSLF was designed to directly address stresses in short-term money markets by temporarily changing the supply of Treasury collateral in the marketplace. We find that the TSLF is uniquely effective relative to other policies and that, while changes in Treasury collateral do affect repo rates, the impacts are not equivalent across sources of Treasury collateral.

Result from Granger causality test evidences bidirectional relationship between call <b>money</b> <b>rates</b> and exchange rates. It is also identified that call <b>money</b> <b>rates</b> and exchange rates Granger cause stock returns and did not find reverse causality from stock returns to call <b>money</b> and exchange <b>rates.</b> To explore, lead-lag interaction among the variables studied we employed VAR models. Results suggest that there is substantial lead-lag relationship from call <b>money</b> <b>rates</b> to exchange rates and stock returns. Similar relationship also found from exchange <b>rates</b> to call <b>money</b> <b>rates</b> and stock returns. However, {{there is no evidence of}} lead-lag causation from stock returns to call <b>money</b> and exchange <b>rates.</b> Findings of this study are useful for the investors and policy makers. In investors' standpoint, they can utilize this historical information of call <b>money</b> <b>rates</b> and exchange rates for predicting the movements of stock returns. Similarly, policy makers can stabilize the stock market fluctuations by adopting appropriate policies towards interest rates and exchange rates for time to time.

At the second stage, long-run properties of the data were incorporated while trying to investigate the efficacy of operational policy of BB in the indirect policy regime by separating the short-run and long-run effects. As the variances of the error terms are not constant, OLS estimation provides a false sense of precision. A GARCH model is therefore estimated which suggests that the operational policy of BB is effective in influencing the rate volatility in Bangladesh. The empirical evidence of this study will assist in better understanding the interest rate channel of monetary transmission, overnight money market behavior, and operational policy of BB...|$|R

If this Classical Dichotomy is false monetary policy may induce hysteresis because the natural rate of interest would depend upon the <b>money</b> <b>rate</b> of interest. We use data for Israel to test Wicksell's Classical Dichotomy. We proxy the natural rate of interest by the forward yield to maturity on indexed-linked treasury bonds. If the null hypothesis is false it is difficult to suggest persuasive instruments that would identify the causal effect of the <b>money</b> <b>rate</b> on the natural rate of interest. Our identification strategy is therefore built around quasi-experimentation and event analysis.

40|$|This Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix paper {{analyzes}} monetary transmission in Croatia. The evidence {{analyzed in}} this paper supports the view that monetary policy in Croatia is not an effective tool for aggregate demand management. One of the main conclusions is that financial conditions in the economy are only weakly correlated with the monetary policy stance. Monetary policy can exercise some control over money-market interest rates, but its influence on lending rates is uncertain and comes with long lags. The paper also examines determinants of lending rates and domestic spreads in Croatia.

40|$|The {{influence}} of monetary policy upon real output and {{the inflation rate}} is well established. The influence is exercised through the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. This study has examined the pass-through of Treasury Bill <b>rate</b> to <b>money</b> market <b>rate</b> (Call <b>Money</b> <b>rate),</b> Banks’ Deposit rate and Banks’ Lending rate. The broader conclusion is that pass-through from Treasury Bill <b>rate</b> to Call <b>money</b> <b>rate</b> is completed during the first month. However pass-through from Treasury Bill rate to Deposit rates and the Lending rate takes much longer, that is, these rates exhibit rigidity. The results are in conformity with the empirical evidence in the relevant literature for other countries. In practice, the pass-through to the deposit and the lending rates {{is expected to be}} quicker than evidenced in this study. The reason is that the study uses weighted average deposit and lending rate. Given that the weighted average rate takes into account outstanding deposit/loans contracted at previous rates as well, (besides the fresh deposit/loans contracted at new rates) this tends to tone down the pass-through. ...|$|R

The motivation for the study is that the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism hinges upon the speed and extent of the pass-through of the policy rate to the individual elements of the transmission mechanism. Call <b>money</b> <b>rate,</b> banks’ deposit rate, and banks’ lending rate, being important elements of the monetary transmission mechanism, the examination of the pass-through to these rates will shed light on the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has deeply affected money markets and thus, potentially, the proper {{functioning of the}} interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission. Therefore, we analyze the effectiveness of monetary policy in steering euro area <b>money</b> market <b>rates</b> looking at, first, the predictability of <b>money</b> market <b>rates</b> {{on the basis of}} monetary policy expectations, and second the impact of extraordinary central bank measures on <b>money</b> market <b>rates.</b> We find that during the crisis <b>money</b> market <b>rates</b> up to 12 months still respond to revisions in the expected path of future rates, even though to a lesser extent than before August 2007. We attribute part of the loss in monetary policy effectiveness to <b>money</b> market <b>rates</b> being driven by higher liquidity premia and increased uncertainty about future interest rates. Our results also indicate that the ECB's non-standard monetary policy measures as of October 2008 were effective in addressing the disruptions in the euro area money market. In fact, our estimates suggest that non-standard monetary policy measures helped to lower Euribor rates by more than 80 basis points.
