50|$|The Scanning SQUID Microscopy (SSM) {{data are}} current density images and current peak images. The current density images give the {{magnitude}} of the current, while the current peak images reveal the current path with a ± 3 μm resolution. Obtaining the SSM data from scanning advanced wire-bond packages is only half the task; fault localization is still necessary. The critical step is to overlay the SSM current images or current path images with CAD files such as bonding diagrams or RTX images to pinpoint the faultlocation. To make alignment of overlaying possible, an optical two-point reference alignment is made. The package edge andpackage fiducial are the most convenient package markings to align to. Based on the data analysis, fault localization by SSM shouldisolate the short in the <b>die,</b> <b>bond</b> wires or package substrate. After all non-destructive approaches are exhausted, the finalstep is destructive deprocessing to verify SSM data. Depending on fault isolation, the deprocessing techniques include decapsulation, parallel lapping or cross-section.|$|E

During the fab transfer qualification of a GaAs RF power amplifier, we encountered <b>die</b> <b>bond</b> voiding issues using a matching backside metal stack process and assembly method. The problem manifested only when the process was run at the alternate Fab. The process was transferred using a copy smart approach where the thicknesses were matched, but processing tools were different. During the pre-qualification process, die voiding issues were encountered which did not meet manufacturing indices specifications. During pre-qualification reliability failures were also encountered. Experiments were run to optimize the back metal layers to achieve passing <b>die</b> <b>bond</b> criteria specifications and reach manufacturability. In addition, reliability was validated by using a JEDEC standard battery of tests on the optimized process. BACKGROUND Freescale utilizes a metal stack specialized for high power GaAs power amplifiers which are assembled using PbSn based soft solder [1]. The process was transferred to a different Fab. The metal stack shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, and Table 1 was duplicated at the new Fab, but processing tools were not {{identical to the original}} Fab. This required validation of the new process using assembly process indices and JEDEC standard reliability testing. Special attention was paid to <b>die</b> <b>bond</b> coverage, which plays an important reliability role. <b>Die</b> <b>bond</b> coverage has been, historically, a key factor to maintain reliability and Freescale’s high quality standards...|$|E

40|$|Well-logging and {{aerospace}} applications require electronics capable of withstanding elevated temperature operation. A {{key element of}} high temperature packaging technology is the Si die attach material, and a comparative study of two die attach systems for use in harsh environment has been performed. <b>Die</b> <b>bond</b> sample packages, using commercial adhesives and an Au-Si eutectic solder, have been manufactured and were subsequently thermally exposed for various times at 250 and 300 °C respectively. The adhesive <b>die</b> <b>bond</b> packages comprised a high temperature co-fired ceramic (HTCC) substrate with W, Ni and Au metallisations whereas the Au-Si <b>die</b> <b>bond</b> packages used thick film Au metallised on a Al₂O₃ substrate. Optimisation of the eutectic die bonding parameters was successfully performed for the Au-Si system by an experimental design method, which improved mean and spread of maximum bonded areas and consequently, the shear load to failure. Bonded area was systematically assessed by scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) followed by digital image analysis (DIA). Accelerated testing comprised thermal cycling and thermal shock and although showing some degradation, Au- 2 wt%Si die bonds were surprisingly robust, showing excellent subsequent stability during industrial device testing investigations.

40|$|In {{the era of}} {{high power}} electronics, voices asking for high {{performance}} miniaturized electronic devices are full of our minds. One of the keys in responding to these strong needs {{is the use of}} highly electrical conductive <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> materials. Those with a strong ability to conduct heat generated during applications are of special interest as overheating of devices is avoided. Currently, tin-lead solders and electrically conductive adhesives are two commonly used <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> materials in interconnecting components in circuit board. Although solder has a relatively higher conductivity, it has adverse environmental impacts upon disposal, and stringent regulations from European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive require it to be progressively faded out. Developing high performance <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> alternatives is an urge and is of great importance. Conductive adhesives especially silver epoxy has been used for decades as <b>die</b> <b>bonding</b> materials since its first application in 1951. It is considered {{as one of the best}} ways to replace the leading role of solder in electronic packaging industry due to its ability to devices miniaturization. Its wide applications are limited by its comparably lower conductivities. Enhancement of silver epoxy by incorporation of conductive nano fillers such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and nano-silver particles has been found promising recently. However, the addition of nano particles leads to drastic increase in the viscosity of the adhesive or decrease in processability. To ensure an effective use of these nano fillers without changing the process abilities during practical applications, understanding of the microrheological properties of the nano filler/silver epoxy adhesives becomes paramount. In this study, we systematically investigated the effect of matrix viscoelasticity on CNTs dispersion using optical microscopy (OM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic rheometry. We discovered that the best dispersion system is a ternary mixture of silver epoxy containing nano Ag@CNTs and acid treated CNTs. This is the first report so far which has not been reported in literature before. Systematic investigations were also carried out on the effect of CNTs concentration and CNTs structure on the rheological properties of silver epoxy composites. The CNT structure effects refer to as-received CNTs, nano Ag@CNTs and acid treated CNTs, respectively. There is a clear correlation between flow-induced CNTs aggregation and steady shear viscosity of the composite. The ternary systems exhibit highest critical concentration for CNTs aggregation. Up to 7 wt% of CNTs can be homogeneously dispersed inside the silver epoxy composite without any notable formation of aggregates. The highest concentration of homogenous dispersion of CNTs in literatures is less than 2 wt %...|$|R

40|$|Solder thermal {{interface}} {{materials are}} often used in power semiconductors to enhance heat dissipation from silicon die to the heat spreader. Nonetheless, the presence of voids in the <b>die</b> <b>bond</b> layer impedes heat flow and thus increases the chip junction temperature. Such voids which form easily in the solder joint during solder reflow process at manufacturing stage are primarily occasioned by out-gassing phenomenon. Three-dimensional finite element analysis is employed to investigate the thermal effects of lead-free solder void percentages and configurations on packaged semiconductor device. The thermal resistance for each voiding case is calculated to evaluate the thermal response of the resultant electronic package. The results show that for equivalent void percentage, thermal resistance increases more for large coalesced type voids {{in comparison to the}} small distributed void configurations. The results would assist packaging and design engineers in setting criteria for assessments of the thermal impacts of different solder void patterns...|$|E
40|$|High-power {{light-emitting}} diodes (LED) have extremely broad applications. However, {{with the job}} requirements of high-brightness and high color temperature from {{light-emitting diodes}}, it must be followed to enlarge the operating current, thus heating up more rapidly.

So {{in order to enhance}} the high-power LED luminous brightness and life to cope with the future development needs of high-power LED components, it is necessary to replace the use of conductive silver paste to stick thermally conductive Cu slug fixing grain and lead frame heat dissipation aluminum sheet.

Therefore the topic points at the crux of the LED heat dissipation difficulty, puts forward of copper and aluminum bonding technology in the ordinary temperature and pressure, method to effectively improve thermal conductivity performance between LED <b>die</b> <b>bond</b> Cu slug and joining aluminum cooling module.
