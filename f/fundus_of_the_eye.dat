25|$|A {{number of}} {{examinations}} {{can be used}} {{to determine the extent of}} the syndrome and its severity. Fluorescein angiography is quite useful in diagnosing the disease, and the use of ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are helpful in confirming the disease. Neuro-ophthalmic examinations reveal pupillary defects (see Marcus Gunn Pupil). Funduscopic examinations, examinations of the <b>fundus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> allow detection of arteriovenous malformations. Neurological examinations can determine hemiparesis and paresthesias. Malformations in arteriovenous connections and irregular functions in the veins may be distinguished by fluorescein angiographies. Cerebral angiography examinations may expose AVMs in the cerebrum. MRIs are also used in imaging the brain and can allow visualization of the optic nerve and any possible atrophy. MRI, CT, and cerebral angiography are all useful for investigating the extent and location of any vascular lesions that are affecting the brain. This is helpful in determining the extent of the syndrome.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT A 42 -year-old {{woman was}} {{admitted}} to our clinic with a complaint of glare in both eyes.

50|$|Mutations in {{this gene}} are {{a cause of}} {{autosomal}} recessive posterior microphthalmos. The clinical features of this condition include extreme hyperopia due to short axial length with essentially normal anterior segment, steep corneal curvatures, shallow anterior chamber, thick lenses and thickened scleral walls. The palpebral fissures appear narrow because of relatively deep set eyes. Visual acuity is mildly to moderately reduced, and anisometropic or strabismic amblyopia is common. The <b>fundus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> shows crowded optical discs, tortuous vessels and an abnormal foveal avascular zone.|$|E
5000|$|Christian Ruete was {{a pioneer}} of German ophthalmology, and made several {{significant}} contributions in this field.

In 1857 he constructed an improved version of his earlier prototype. He made modifications to Hermann von Helmholtz's ophthalmoscope by implementing a concave focusing mirror, and thereby introduced [...] "indirect ophthalmoscopy" [...] to allow for a stereoscopic and wider view of the <b>fundus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> Ruete also conducted extensive research of ophthalmic disorders that included strabismus and hypermetropia.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Choroidal <b>Eye</b> Oximeter is an {{electro-optical}} {{instrument that}} noninvasively measures <b>the</b> oxygen saturation <b>of</b> choroidal blood in <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>eye</b> by a spectrophotometric method.

30|$|While the pre-laser {{peripheral}} vitreous condensations {{may have}} represented pre-existing intermediate uveitis, no cells, flare nor keratic precipitates in <b>the</b> anterior segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> either <b>eye,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>fundus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contralateral <b>eye</b> were observed.

With <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> head trauma, force threatening chorioretinal integrity was probably imparted to <b>the</b> fellow <b>eye</b> as well. In any event, this clinical sign was not felt to signify inflammation as in fact, it was initially signed out as benign vitreous condensations. Save for the established, self-limiting complications as in panretinal photocoagulation, no severe “blinding” complication was anticipated [1]. In retrospect, this sign may thus have been a cause to favor conservative management or, at least, more measured laser therapy.|$|R
30|$|A 32 -year-old female {{presented}} with gradual diminution <b>of</b> vision in <b>the</b> left <b>eye</b> for 4  months. Visual acuity in <b>the</b> left <b>eye</b> was 3 / 200.

50|$|Dilated fundus {{examination}} or dilated-pupil fundus examination (DFE) is {{a diagnostic}} procedure that employs {{the use of}} mydriatic eye drops (such as tropicamide) to dilate or enlarge the pupil {{in order to obtain}} a better view of the <b>fundus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> Once the pupil is dilated, examiners use ophthalmoscopy (funduscopy) to view the eye's interior, allowing assessment of the retina, optic nerve head, blood vessels, and other features. They also often use specialized equipment such as a fundus camera. DFE {{has been found to be}} a more effective method for evaluation of internal ocular health than non-dilated examination. It is frequently performed by ophthalmologists and optometrists as part of an eye examination.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vascular}} tunic (or uvea) {{is made up}} of the choroid, the ciliary body, and the iris. The choroid has a {{great deal}} of pigment, and is almost entirely made of blood vessels. It forms the tapetum lucidum when it crosses over the <b>fundus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> causing the yellowish-green eye shine when light is directed into the animal's eyes at night. The tapetum lucidum reflects light back onto the retina, allowing for greater absorption in dark conditions. The iris lies between the cornea and the lens, and not only gives the eye its color, (see [...] "eye color," [...] below) but also allows varying amounts of light to pass through its center hole, the pupil.|$|E

Implementing a wave front sensor into a conventional confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (cSLO), therefore, is the first step to set up a compact adaptive-optical cSLO.

Funduscopic examinations, examinations of the <b>fundus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> allow detection of arteriovenous malformations. Neurological examinations can determine hemiparesis and paresthesias. Malformations in arteriovenous connections and irregular functions in the veins may be distinguished by fluorescein angiographies. Cerebral angiography examinations may expose AVMs in the cerebrum. MRIs are also used in imaging the brain and can allow visualization of the optic nerve and any possible atrophy. MRI, CT, and cerebral angiography are all useful for investigating the extent and location of any vascular lesions that are affecting the brain.

40|$|The {{control of}} the {{temperature}} increase {{is an important issue}} in retinal laser treatments. Within the <b>fundus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> heat, generated by absorption of light, is transmitted by diffusion in the retinal pigment epithelium and in the choroid and lost by convection due to the choroidal blood flow. The temperature can be spatially and tempo-rally determined by solving the heat equation. In a for-mer analytical model this was achieved by assuming uni-form convection for the whole <b>fundus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> A numerical method avoiding this unrealistic assumption by considering convective heat transfer only in the chor-oid is used here to solve the heat equation. Numerical results are compared with experimental results obtained by using a novel method of noninvasive optoacoustic ret-inal temperature measurements in rabbits. Assuming glo-bal convection the perfusion coefficient was evaluated to 0. 07 s 1, whereas a value of 0. 32 s 1 – much closer to values found in the literature (between 0. 28 and 0. 30 s 1) – was obtained when choroidal convection was assumed, showing the advantage of the numerical method. The modelling of retinal laser treatment is thus improved and could be considered in the future to optimize treatments by calculating retinal temperature increases under var-ious tissues and laser properties...|$|E
