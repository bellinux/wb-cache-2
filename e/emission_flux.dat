Aircraft measurements of methane mixing ratio profiles are input to the model, from which influence functions are obtained; these are the footprints of potential contributing emissions. Inversion techniques and statistical analysis enable the determination of confidence intervals for methane emissions. Results are compared with prior emissions data obtained by other methods. For two case studies in the Manawatu region of New Zealand in June 1995 and April 1997, methane <b>emission</b> <b>fluxes</b> of 54732 and 56754 mgm 2 d 1 are obtained (95 % confidence intervals).

It {{can increase the}} soil organic carbon and fertility, but straw returning also increase the CH 4 and CO 2 emissions. The effects of continuous flooding in no rice growing season on CH 4 and CO 2 emission in rice season with straw returning is not clear. This {{study was conducted with}} two different water managements in no rice growing season, one was the middle rice-natural drainage (RD) and another was the middle rice-continuous flooding (RW). The aim was to investigate the characteristic of CH 4 and CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>flux</b> in rice season under different water management with straw returning, and to provide data support for accurate assessment of paddy greenhouse gas emissions. The results showed that RD significantly reduced the CH 4 accumulation <b>emission</b> <b>flux</b> in rice growing season compared with the RW, and 80 % total CH 4 <b>emission</b> <b>flux</b> in rice growing season was emission before the first drainage whether RD or RW. RW could cutdown the CO 2 accumulation <b>emission</b> <b>flux</b> in rice growing season compared with RD, and about 60 % total CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>flux</b> in rice growing season was emission after the first drainage whether RD or RW. RW reduced the soil NO 3 - -N, NH 4 + -N and DOC concentration in rice growing season, and decreased the Eh value at 10 cm soil layer, but increased the acetic acid concentration.

The maximum emission rates for the two trees were observed in summer with values of about 232 and 213 mu g g(- 1) dw h(- 1), respectively. The measured <b>emission</b> <b>fluxes</b> were used to evaluate "Guenther" emission algorithm.

Due to their complexity, the future interactions between climate change, wildfire activity, emission release, and atmospheric aerosol processes are still uncertain.

The modeled fire <b>emission</b> <b>fluxes</b> and fire radiative power serve as input for the aerosol-climate model ECHAM 6 -HAM 2, which has been extended by a semiempirical plume height parametrization. Our results indicate a general increase in extratropical {{and a decrease in}} tropical wildfire activity {{at the end of the}} 21 st century. Changes in <b>emission</b> <b>fluxes</b> are most pronounced for the strongest warming scenario RCP 8. 5 (+ 49 % in the extratropics, − 37 % in the tropics). Tropospheric black carbon (BC) concentrations are similarly affected by changes in <b>emission</b> <b>fluxes</b> and changes in climate conditions with regional variations of up to − 50 % to + 100 %. In the Northern Hemispheric extratropics, we attribute a mean increase in aerosol optical thickness of + 0. 031 ± 0. 002 to changes in wildfire emissions. Due to the compensating effects of fire intensification and more stable atmospheric conditions, global mean emission heights change by at most 0. 3 km with only minor influence on BC long-range transport. The changes in wildfire <b>emission</b> <b>fluxes</b> for the RCP 8. 5 scenario, however, may largely compensate the projected reduction in anthropogenic BC emissions by the end of the 21 st century...|$|R

We assess here the contribution of different sources of error to overall model data mismatch using the example of MOZAIC/IAGOS carbon monoxide (CO) profiles collected over the European regional domain in a time window of 5 yr (2006 to 2011). The different sources of error addressed in the present study are: 1) mismatch in modelled and observed mixed layer height; 2) bias in <b>emission</b> <b>fluxes</b> and 3) spatial representation error (related to unresolved spatial variations in emissions). The modelling framework combines a regional Lagrangian transport model (STILT) with EDGARv 4. 3 emission inventory and lateral boundary conditions from the MACC reanalysis. The representation error was derived by coupling STILT with <b>emission</b> <b>fluxes</b> aggregated to different spatial resolutions. We also use the MACC reanalysis to assess uncertainty related to uncertainty sources 2) and 3). We treat the random and the bias components of the uncertainty separately and found that 1) and 3) have a comparable impact on the random component for both models, while 2) is far less important. On the other hand, the bias component shows comparable impacts from each source of uncertainty, despite both models being affected by a low bias of a factor of 2 to 2. 5 in the <b>emission</b> <b>fluxes.</b> In addition, we suggested methods to correct for biases in <b>emission</b> <b>fluxes</b> and in mixing heights.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} experiments to determine marine aerosol emission from the coastal zone. A relation between aerosol flux and wave energy dissipation was found. The <b>emission</b> <b>fluxes</b> calculated for the distribution of aerosol concentration are proportional to the dissipation of wave energy {{to the power of}} 3 / 4. The calculations were carried out using the experimental data obtained during the TABEX and BAEX experiments...|$|R
