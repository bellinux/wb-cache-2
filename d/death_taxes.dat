A potential Michelle Obama candidacy was supported by both Samuel L. Jackson and James Clyburn.

A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders. Another poll from that month found 71% of Americans believed that Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving.

2500|$|In 1853, {{a new tax}} was introduced, [...] "Succession duty." [...] This {{not only}} {{resulted}} in tax being payable on all forms of inheritance, but also removed several loopholes to avoid paying inheritance taxes. In 1881 [...] "Probate Duty" [...] became payable on all personal property bequeathed at death. The wording personal property meant {{that for the first}} time not only the house and its estate were taxed but also the contents of the house including jewellery – these were often of greater value than the estate itself. By 1884 Estate Duty taxed property of any manner bequeathed at death, but even when the Liberal government in 1894 reformed and tidied the complicated system at 8% on properties valued at over one million pounds, they were not punitive to a social class able to live comfortably off inherited wealth far below that sum. Death duties, however, slowly increased and became a serious problem for the country estate throughout the first half of the 20th century, reaching a zenith when assisting in the funding of World War II. This proved to be the deciding factor for many families when in 1940 death duties were raised from 50% to 65%, and following the cessation of hostilities they were twice raised further between 1946 and 1949. Attempts by some families to avoid paying death duties were both helped and hindered by war. Some estate owners gave their properties to their heirs thereby escaping duties; when subsequently that heir was killed fighting, death duties were not payable because a soldier's or sailor's (and later airman's) estate was not subject to the tax. However, if the heir had died single and intestate, the former owner would become the owner again, and when that owner died, the <b>death</b> <b>taxes</b> would have to be paid.

40|$|This {{study will}} examine how a {{modification}} to Thailand’s Real Property Tax and Capital Gains Tax systems, {{along with the}} implementation of a <b>Death</b> <b>Tax</b> scheme will provide the needed resources to help support the economic function of government in Thailand and help mitigate the widening economic disparity among the social classes. A major reform in Thailand’s tax system will create more benefits, provide resources and opportunities, and assist in reducing or (even completely) eliminating the motivation of Thailand’s working class to engage in acts of corruption. If we stop corruption from the “bottom” of Thailand’s social class by removing the “need” of the working class to engage in acts of corruption, we can then begin to change the culture of how corruption is viewed in Thailand. Because without this change in culture, Thailand’s anti-corruption laws can never be truly effective regardless of how perfect the law is drafted. This research will also delve into how implementing a <b>Death</b> <b>Tax</b> system in Thailand can act not only as a means to preventing the undue accumulation of excessive wealth but also serve as a way of taking back the ill-gotten gains from those who acquired their wealth through acts of corruption; so that the wealthy corrupt do not get to keep it all. Finally, this study will look to the tax laws and systems used in United States and the Philippines and provide a comparative analysis to what is currently in place in Thailand. Chapter 1 of this study provides the history, country statistics, and cursory overview of Thailand, the U. S., and the Philippines legal systems. Chapter 2 is a review of the literature, providing definitions and examples involving the <b>Death</b> <b>tax,</b> Capital Gains tax and Property tax. It also looks to the opinions of leading experts regarding the justification for the <b>Death</b> <b>tax</b> and whether the tax is still viable today. It then examines opinions of Thailand’s leading experts regarding this tax. Chapter 3 explores the current Estate Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Real Property Tax rules of the U. S. and the Philippines and compares them to Thailand’s existing system. Chapter 4 presents the analysis of how the addition of a <b>Death</b> <b>tax</b> and reformation of Thailand’s Capital Gains and Property Tax systems can serve as a catalyst to helping combat corruption in Thailand.

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{system of}} land tenancies and land ownership in Malabar, known as janmi, {{had resulted in}} {{a small number of}} families owning most of the land. The EIC had determined to use a slightly modified form of the existing janmi administrative processes to collect revenue. Under this modified system, the janmis were granted leases on land and were responsible for collecting revenue — almost entirely based on a proportion of agricultural produce — on behalf of the EIC. The janmis, such as the Kavalapparas, sublet to tenants known as kanakkarans, who had some security of tenure, and both could sublet to verumpattakkars, who were tenants-at-will. Thus, in 1794, the EIC granted the Kavalappara family a quinquennial lease on lands but it also disbarred from the feudal privileges of collecting <b>death</b> <b>taxes</b> from the Mappilas and some festival offerings from the ryots. All revenue collecting responsibilities were lost in 1796 when they were transferred to direct control of the EIC, although the EIC did return a portion of the funds collected by the system of malikhana that recognised the loyalty of certain ruling families. In common with many of his peers, the Kavalappara chieftain had amassed considerable arrears in revenue monies that he was supposed to hand over {{and as a result of}} the transfer of revenue collection he now became nothing more than a landed aristocrat without political influence.
