We have obtained 1. 3 and 2. 7 mm dust continua with an angular resolution down to 0. 13 arc second.

HL Tau has a circumstellar disk mass of 0. 13 solar mass, a characteristic radius of 79 AU, an inclination of 40 degree, and a position angle of 136 degree. Although a thin disk model is preferred by our two wavelength data, a thick disk model is needed to explain the high mid- and far-infrared emission of the HL Tau spectral energy distribution. This could imply large dust grains settled down on the mid plane with fine dust grains mixed with gas. The HL Tau disk is likely gravitationally unstable and can be fragmented between 50 and 100 AU of radius.

The dust induced changes in these parameters were obtained by fitting simulated images of composite systems (containing a disk and a bulge) produced using radiative transfer calculations.

We find that dust is biasing the derived exponential scale-length of decomposed disks towards smaller values than would be otherwise derived if the galaxy were to have no bulge. Similarly, the derived bulge-to-disk ratio is biased towards smaller values. However, the derived axis-ratio of the disk is not changed in the decomposition process. The derived effective radius of decomposed disks of systems having exponential bulges is found to be less affected by dust when fits are done with two variable-index Sérsic functions.

40|$|Can {{traditional}} DBMS's {{respond to}} queries and perform updates faster {{with the use}} of indexes in RAM? That is the question asked in this thesis. The idea is {{to take advantage of the}} large amount of main memory to store indexes, instead of storing <b>indexes</b> on <b>disk.</b> This means that all the data are still stored on disk, in a traditional DBMS, but attributes are indexed in main memory. Rindex, a plattform for storing indexes in RAM on top of an existing DBMS is used to test this hypothesis. Rindex was initially developed by Tomas Are Haavet and Kjell-Magne Øierud. Before the work done on this thesis, Rindex stored indexes as a sorted list, and supported only queries, and not updates. The work done on this thesis consisted in giving Rindex support for updates. Two different approaches were tested, resulting in two new Rindex versions. The first is using the old index-structure, and the second is using CSB+-trees to store the indexes. CSB+-trees stands for Cache Sensitive B+-trees, and is a variant of B+-trees optimized for residing in memory. It allows for both quick searches and fast updates. The two implementations are then tested against each other, and against a DBMS with internal indexes. Althoug Rindex is still at very early stage, the results seem to confirm the initial hypothesis. Particularly for updates, the use of Rindex with CSB+-trees to store indexes is much faster than the use of internal <b>indexes</b> on <b>disk.</b> The thesis is written in Norwegian...|$|R

In this paper, we present a novel query processing technique that, though maintaining high scalability and accuracy, manages to reduce the latency considerably in answering LBSQs. Our approach is based on peer-to-peer sharing, which enables us to process queries without delay at a mobile host by using query results cached in its neighboring mobile peers.

First, a scaled nonlinear function is introduced for the CNF control law, in which a parameter is scaled by the error between the amplitude of the target reference and the initial value of the system controlled output. The closed-loop system under the scaled function has robust transient performance to the variation of the amplitude of the target reference. Then, {{the parameters of the}} selected nonlinear function are tuned by optimal tuning methods. More specifically, the parameter-tuning problem is formulated as an optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently via numerical methods.

The proposed control scheme utilizes the concept of the conventional composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) scheme to achieve fast and smooth seeking. In order to be advantageous over the conventional CNF control, the UCS consists of both linear and nonlinear time-dependent components, which are independent of absolute seeking error. Simulation and implementation results show that, during track-seeking mode, the proposed scheme has a significantly better performance robustness against variations in seek length as compared to the conventional CNF control. For track-following, disturbance and noise models are involved in the problem formulation and sub-optimal method is used to design the controller so as to achieve high head-positioning accuracy.
