The SAE (<b>gross)</b> <b>system</b> excluded many accessory drives and often used non-standard induction and exhaust systems and so was replaced by the more accurate SAE (net) system in 1972, long after the 420/Sovereign had gone out of production. Reference states that the DIN horsepower rating of the 1977 USA specification 4.2-litre Series II XJ6 was equivalent to 180 bhp. The DIN system yields horsepower ratings which, for most technical purposes, are the same as those that would be obtained using the SAE (net) system. However, the 1977 test would have included power-sapping emissions equipment not present on the 420/Sovereign. Therefore, the SAE (net) power rating of the 420/Sovereign must have lain somewhere between 180 bhp and 245 bhp.|$|E

In contrast to previous models, an economy with two assets is described: eligible as collateral and not eligible, with the aim of being able to determine the implications of the requirement of these guarantees on banks' portfolio decisions—which affects their return—and on the probability and the consequences of a systemic crisis. This allows for comparison of the effects on social welfare of each of the two systems for different sets of parameters that characterize social risk aversion, opportunity set of banks, and the functioning of each settlement model.

40|$|Physical {{systems are}} by nature continuous, but often display {{nonlinear}} behaviors {{that makes them}} hard to analyze. Typically, these nonlinearities occur at a time scale that is {{much smaller than the}} time scale at which <b>gross</b> <b>system</b> behavior needs to be described. In other situations, nonlinear e ects are small and of a parasitic nature. To achieve e ciency and clarity in building complex system models, and to reduce computational complexity in the analysis of system behavior, modelers often abstract away anypara sitic component parameter e ects, and analyze the system at more abstract time scales. However, these abstractions often introduce abrupt, instantaneous changes in system behavior. To accommodate mixed continuous and discrete behavior, this paper develops a hybrid modeling formalism that dynamically constructs bond graph model fragments that govern system behavior during continuous operation. When threshold values are crossed, a meta-level control model invokes discontinuous state and model con guration changes. Discontinuities violate physical principles of conservation of energy and continuity of power, but the principle of invariance ofstategoverns model behavior when the control module is active. Conservation of energy and continuity ofpower again govern behavior generation as soon as a new model con guration is established. This allows for maximally constrained continuous model fragments. The two primary contributions of this paper are an algorithm for inferring the correct new mode and state variable values in the hybrid modeling framework, and a veri cation scheme that ensures hybrid models conform to physical system principles based on the principles of divergence of time and temporal evolution in behavior transtions. These principles are employed in energy phase space analysis to verify physical consistency of models...|$|E

40|$|Background Professional nursing {{practice}} {{is informed by}} biological, social and behavioural sciences. In undergraduate pre-registration nursing programs, biological sciences typically include anatomy, physiology, microbiology, chemistry, physics and pharmacology. The current {{gap in the literature}} results in a lack of information about the content and depth of biological sciences being taught in nursing curricula. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish what priority is given to the teaching of science topics in these programs in order to inform an understanding of the relative importance placed on this subject area in contemporary nursing education. Method This study employed a cross-sectional survey method. This paper reports on the first phase of a larger project examining science content in nursing programs. An existing questionnaire was modified and delivered online for completion by academics who teach science to nurses in these programs. This paper reports on the relative priority given by respondents to the teaching of 177 topics contained in the questionnaire. Results Of the relatively small population of academics who teach science to nursing students, thirty (n = 30) completed the survey. Findings indicate strong support for the teaching of science in these programs, with particular priority given to the basic concepts of bioscience and <b>gross</b> <b>system</b> anatomy. Of concern, most science subject areas outside of these domains were ranked as being of moderate or low priority. Conclusion While the small sample size limited the conclusions able to be drawn from this study, the findings supported previous studies that indicated inadequacies in the teaching of science content in nursing curricula. Nevertheless, these findings have raised questions about the current philosophy that underpins nursing education in Australia and whether existing practices are clearly focused on preparing students for the demands of contemporary nursing practice. Academics responsible for the design and implementation of nursing curricula are encouraged to review the content of current programs in light of the findings of this research...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the next}} few years, {{we will see a}} {{pronounced}} increase in the speed at which payment transactions are executed and in the share of cross-border transactions, particularly in the euro area. Counterparty risks and liquidity needs connected with the transfer of funds continue to evolve and to provoke discussion. The fact that funds transfers occur and systems operate on a real-time and gross basis will significantly alter the operational character and technical solutions in this field. Systems following a daily timetable are being replaced by continuously operating systems, which will {{have a significant impact on}} banks' liquidity management. The trend toward immediate real-time payment transactions seems inevitable in the light of present trends. It is generally presumed that RTGS systems operating on a gross basis require more liquidity than netting systems. Liquidity needs depend on payment system structures and payment flows. An even flow of payments requires less liquidity than an uneven flow. Liquidity needs can be significantly reduced by choosing an appropriate payment system structure, taking measures to even out payment flows and agreeing on market practices. The pricing, collateral and reserve requirement policies of the central bank affect also the efficiency of alternative payment systems. Thus the overall efficiency of a gross or net system depends on many factors. Factors arguing for a <b>gross</b> <b>system</b> are differences in counterparty risks, lack of reciprocity, steady interday payment flows and stable liquidity needs, both within and between days. Factors favouring net systems are the existence of small and varying counterparty risks and structurally unsteady payment flows that result in large interday variations in liquidity, even though overnight variations may be moderate. Current, daily-oriented practices have focused on overnight liquidity needs. In a continuously operating environment, liquidity needs are continuously monitored across time-period borders. This means that banks' liquidity management will in the future operate under a new and broader time perspective. Significant liquidity needs and large counterparty risks are inherent parts of Finland's present funds-transfer solutions. Liquidity can be freed for other uses and counterparty risks reduced by changing the structures. The necessary changes have been agreed and soon we will see fundamental changes in Finnish payment systems. payment system settlement; gross settlement; RTGS; payment system counterparty risks; payment system liquidity needs...|$|E

40|$|The {{solar power}} sector grew quickly in Japan {{during the decade}} 1994 to 2003. During this period, annual {{installations}} increased 32 -fold from 7 MW in 1994 to 223 MW in 2003, and annual production increased 22 -fold, from 16 MW in 1994 to 364 MW in 2003. Over these years, the growth of Japan's solar power sector outpaced the global industry's growth, which is puzzling because Japan was in a recession during this period. At the same time, the U. S. was experiencing considerable economic expansion, yet the U. S. solar industry's growth was significantly slower than Japan's. This thesis focuses on the rapid development of Japan's solar power sector {{in order to address}} the central question, "Why did the solar power sector develop quickly in Japan?" To address this question, this thesis develops two comparative case studies: (1) Japan's solar power sector: 1994 to 2003 and (2) U. S. solar power sector: 1994 to 2003. These case studies provide detailed descriptions of the historical development of the solar power sectors in Japan and the U. S. based on data collected from International Energy Agency's PVPS program, Japan's New Energy Development Organization and the U. S. Energy Information Administration, among other sources. (cont.) A comparative analysis of these cases suggests that the rapid growth of Japan's solar power sector was enabled by interplay among (a) decreasing <b>gross</b> <b>system</b> prices price, (b) increasing installations, (c) increasing production and (d) decreasing costs. The second-order explanation for this interplay is that a mosaic of factors led to (a) decreasing prices, (b) increasing installations, (c) increasing production and (d) decreasing costs. This mosaic included the extrinsic setting (solar resource, interest rate, grid price), industrial organization (including the structure of the electric power sector and the structure within the solar power sector), demand-side incentives that drove down the "gap" with and provided a "trigger" for supply-side growth, and supply-side expansion that enabled significant cost reductions and price reductions that more than offset the decline in demand-side incentives. Within this complex interplay of numerous factors, roadmapping and industry coordination efforts played an important role by shaping the direction of Japan's solar power sector. This thesis concludes with "lessons learned" from Japan's solar power sector development, how these lessons may be applicable in a U. S. context and open questions for further research. by Michael G.
