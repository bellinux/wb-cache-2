5|$|A {{study of}} {{orangutan}} symbolic capability was conducted from 1973 to 1975 by zoologist Gary L. Shapiro with Aazk, a juvenile female orangutan at the Fresno City Zoo (now Chaffee Zoo) in Fresno, California. The study <b>employed</b> <b>the</b> techniques of psychologist David Premack, who used plastic tokens to teach linguistic {{skills to the}} chimpanzee, Sarah. Shapiro continued to examine the linguistic and learning abilities of ex-captive orangutans in Tanjung Puting National Park, in Indonesian Borneo, between 1978 and 1980.|$|E

5|$|Although early humans {{gathered}} uncultivated {{plant materials}} {{for food and}} <b>employed</b> <b>the</b> medicinal properties of vegetation for healing, most modern human use of plants is through agriculture.

Principal photography began in Philadelphia on May 15, 1984, with a budget of $12 million. The script required that a total of 24 locations be used for filming in Philadelphia and Santa Clara, California.
