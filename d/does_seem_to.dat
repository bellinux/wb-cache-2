5|$|There are controlled-release {{versions}} of levodopa. Older controlled-release levodopa preparations have poor and unreliable absorption and bioavailability {{and have not}} demonstrated improved control of PD motor symptoms or a reduction in levodopa-related complications when compared to immediate release preparations. A newer extended-release levodopa preparation <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{be more effective in}} reducing fluctuations but in many patients problems persist. Intestinal infusions of levodopa (Duodopa) can result in striking improvements in fluctuations compared to oral levodopa when the fluctuations are due to insufficient uptake caused by gastroparesis. Other oral, longer acting formulations are under study and other modes of delivery (inhaled, transdermal) are being developed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the heart}} of lungfish, the septum extends part-way into the ventricle. This allows for some degree of {{separation}} between the de-oxygenated bloodstream destined for the lungs and the oxygenated stream that is delivered {{to the rest of}} the body. The absence of such a division in living amphibian species may be partly due to the amount of respiration that occurs through the skin; thus, the blood returned to the heart through the venae cavae is already partially oxygenated. As a result, there may be less need for a finer division between the two bloodstreams than in lungfish or other tetrapods. Nonetheless, in at least some species of amphibian, the spongy nature of the ventricle <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> maintain more of a separation between the bloodstreams. Also, the original valves of the conus arteriosus have been replaced by a spiral valve that divides it into two parallel parts, thereby helping to keep the two bloodstreams separate.|$|E

5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.|$|E

Her work <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have matured throughout her career; her early works are simple and clean, while her later works are more virtuosic, complex, and melodramatic.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{learning}} and memory functions are impaired by centrally administered oxytocin. Also, systemic oxytocin administration can impair memory retrieval in certain aversive memory tasks. However, oxytocin <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> facilitate {{learning and}} memory specifically for social information. Healthy males administered intranasal oxytocin show improved memory for human faces, in particular happy faces.|$|E

25|$|With the {{repetition}} of responsibility to the desperation of the lower class, Plautus establishes himself firmly {{on the side of}} the average Roman citizen. While he makes no specific reference to the possible war with Greece or the previous war (that might be too dangerous), he <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> push the message that the government should take care of its own people before attempting any other military actions.|$|E
25|$|In {{his current}} incarnation, Krypto's {{abilities}} are essentially identical; however, he possesses normal canine intelligence, though {{as shown in}} the storyline with Atlas, Krypto <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have a general understanding of speech, and can take initiatives of his own, such as vowing to protect Metropolis from Atlas because of his knowledge of the fact that Superman himself protects and cares for the city, as well as vowing to hurt Atlas for hurting Superman.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than the}} formal definition, {{it is more}} {{understandable}} with some historical context. The British generally seemed to be most consistent between theory and practice, although the minimum-effort theory, which worked in Malaya, {{did not seem to}} apply to Northern Ireland. French doctrine {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, involving working with locals, did not seem to be the heart of doctrine in Algeria and Indochina. France <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> manage cooperation with former colonies, now clients.|$|E

25|$|Jinx {{returns in}} the 2004 direct-to-video {{animated}} film , voiced by Venus Terzo. Her original background with the Blind Master is not mentioned, instead she is training along with Kamakura under Snake Eyes, and likes to rib Kamakura for his lesser experience. Because {{of the nature}} of the movie, it is hard to determine if she is an apprentice for the first time, or is learning a new level of skills, as she <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be a very seasoned ninja.|$|E
25|$|Count Dracula (1970), {{directed}} by Jesus Franco starring Christopher Lee as Dracula. In {{spite of its}} star, Franco's film is {{not a part of}} the Hammer series, and was shot on a small budget. Lee is made up to look like the description of the Count from Stoker's novel, and he <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> grow younger as the story progresses, but the film otherwise takes some huge liberties with the plot. The international cast includes Herbert Lom as Van Helsing and Klaus Kinski as Renfield.|$|E
25|$|These snakes produce {{cytotoxic}} venom that {{is strongly}} hemorrhagic and tissue toxic, but {{devoid of any}} neurotoxins (Ernst, 1992; Van Mierop, 1976). The venom was basis {{for the development of}} the drug eptifibatide which is used to prevent clotting during a heart attack. The venom is somewhat different in that it contains substantial amounts of serotonin and related tryptamine compounds (Welsh, 1967). Antivenin does not appear to be effective in the treatment of these bites, although CroFab <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> do a better job than ACP, at least in some animal models. (Consroe et al., 1995).|$|E

25|$|Awareness {{in species}} is {{difficult}} to determine. Learned behaviors that have been demonstrated in laboratories have provided good evidence that animals have instinct and a reward system. The behavior of laboratory animals demonstrates a mental experience wherein the animal's instincts tell it if it carries out a certain action, it will then receive what it needs. For example, the lab rat will push the lever because it knows food will {{fall out of the}} hole in the wall. It doesnâ€™t need awareness, but it <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> work on a reward system. The lab rat learned the action needed to be fed.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} has been hailed by several SCOTUS correspondents as striking a fair balance between the need to respect the copyrights of artists, {{and the benefits of}} allowing and promoting technological innovation. Indeed, the decision <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> leave sufficient leeway for developers in creating new products, as it establishes guidelines to compliance with existing copyright law, and holds liable the distributors rather than developers for copyright infringement. Conversely, others have criticized the new test for its apparent vagueness, contending that it permits financially powerful organizations such as the RIAA and MPAA to effectively hinder development of new technology by active pursuit of litigation against the developers and distributors.|$|E
25|$|The diet {{consists}} {{of a variety of}} small vertebrates, including mammals, lizards, and other snakes, as well as invertebrates such as centipedes. Mammals and reptiles make up the bulk of their diet. Adults feed mainly on rodents, while juveniles usually prey on reptiles: more often lizards in western populations and snakes in eastern ones. Frogs also constitute {{an important part of the}}ir diet: Ruthven (1928) mentioned that in Michigan they made up the main portion of their diet. According to Klauber (1956), S. catenatus feeds on frogs more frequently than any other rattlesnake. In general, however, frogs are not an important part of the diet, although this <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be more typical in certain northern and eastern populations.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there is}} not any {{official}} definition {{of what constitutes a}} Cinderella team, there <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be a consensus that such teams represent small schools, are usually low-seeded in the tournament, and achieves at least one unexpected win in the tournament. A recent example of this is Florida Gulf Coast University, a relatively new school that held its first classes in 1997 and became Division I postseason eligible in 2011. They made their first ever appearance in the 2013 tournament, winning two games to become the first ever #15 seed to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. The term was popularized as a result of City College of New York's successful run in the 1950 tournament.|$|E
25|$|This poem, {{traditionally}} placed at Amores 3.5, is considered spurious. The poet describes {{a dream to}} an interpreter, saying that he sees while escaping from the heat of noon a white heifer near a bull; when the heifer is pecked by a crow, it leaves the bull for a meadow with other bulls. The interpreter interprets the dream as a love allegory; the bull represents the poet, the heifer a girl, and the crow an old woman. The old woman spurs the girl to leave her lover and find someone else. The poem {{is known to have}} circulated independently and its lack of engagement with Tibullan or Propertian elegy argue in favor of its spuriousness; however, the poem <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be datable to the early empire.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} this and other events, {{historian}} B. A. Saletare has described Tipu Sultan as a defender of the Hindu dharma, who also patronised other temples including one at Melkote, for which he issued a Kannada decree that the Shrivaishnava invocatory verses there should be recited in the traditional form. The temple at Melkote still has gold and silver vessels with inscriptions indicating that they were presented by the Sultan. Tipu Sultan also presented four silver cups to the Lakshmikanta Temple at Kalale. Tipu Sultan <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have repossessed unauthorised grants of land made to Brahmins and temples, but those which had proper sanads (certificates) were not. It was a normal practice for any ruler, Muslim or Hindu, on his accession or on the conquest of new territory.|$|E

40|$|Records of the {{percentages}} of various types of gram-negative rods resistant to six antibiotics are presented for the years 1961 to 1969 with additional notes on 1970. Gross amounts of each antibiotic used {{in each of the}} years are also depicted. Resistance-factor transference <b>does</b> not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be an important factor but levels of antibiotic usage <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> affect {{the percentages}} of resistant strains found. In the case of kanamycin, extensive use of neomycin appears to have produced much cross-resistance. Free use of polymyxins <b>does</b> not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> increase resistant percentages...|$|R
