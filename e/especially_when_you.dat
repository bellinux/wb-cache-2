Wenger conceded {{afterwards}} {{his team}} were paying {{for their participation}} in the UEFA Cup, as [...] "…the recovery time is too short. We only had two and a half days, which is not enough, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are travelling". Arsenal beat their rivals Tottenham a week later. Henry, Grimandi and Kanu each scored in Arsenal's 3–0 victory against Coventry City. After 30 games, Arsenal were in fourth position, two points behind Liverpool in third and 13 away from leaders Manchester United.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} critics cited the album as {{a return to}} the band's roots. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said, [...] "Nearly 15 years after Ten, Pearl Jam finally {{returned}} to the strengths of their debut with 2006's Pearl Jam, a sharply focused set of impassioned hard rock." [...] Vedder said, [...] "It's easily the best stuff we've done but also some of the hardest stuff. It's very aggressive, because again, it's kind of a product of what it's like to be an American these days. It's pretty aggressive, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> turn it loud." [...] Gossard added that after many experimental albums, Pearl Jam was [...] "like a coming together again in terms of accepting our natural strengths and also incorporating the best of our experiments".|$|E
500|$|A Herald Sun reviewer, however, {{thought she}} gave the final season of Will & Grace the [...] "send-off it deserved." [...] Rachel Browne of The Sun Herald said the problem with Spears' {{performance}} is that [...] "it's impossible to accept her in any role other than her own headline-hugging self." [...] Browne, however, thought her appearance was [...] "fun to watch". The Sunday Mail was also positive about Spears' performance, commenting that she [...] "does well, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> remember the dismal Crossroads." [...] Trent Vanegas of Pink is the New Blog said that doing the show was a [...] "great move" [...] for Spears. Television researcher Tim Brooks, the co-author of the 1979 book The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, commented that Spears' role was a [...] "very {{good way to get}} her chops into comedy", in part because it is [...] "very out of type. She's not just playing herself as a celebrity." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{retrospective}} feature by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's program Good Game highlighted Red Alarm {{as one of}} the Virtual Boy's most visually impressive games due to its polygonal graphics. The outlet praised it as one of {{the most}} entertaining titles on the console. Video game database AllGame gave the game a two and a half out of five rating, noting how the graphics made it difficult to play. The review stated that the design of the graphics [...] "makes structures hard to see because there is empty space between the lines defining them. Add multiple enemy fighters and ground defenses into the mix, and it can be very difficult to navigate your ship, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are trying to fight back!" [...] The review concluded that the developers [...] "have created a very detailed setting for which to fight in. Walls have faces stretching out of them like a scene from The Abyss, there are several interesting bosses to combat, and you'll even hear some speech. Deep down there is a fine shooter that is simply hard to enjoy due to the limitations of the hardware... and that is truly a shame." [...] In 2008, Kolan called it [...] "a really competent shooter" [...] with strong visuals and gameplay. The following year, Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer summarized Red Alarm as [...] "pretty good fun to play", although inferior to Star Fox. However, Wireds Chris Kohler later opined that the game [...] "kind of sucked".|$|E

500|$|An {{ensemble}} of 20 actors {{make up the}} bulk of the series' cast. Hawley found ensembles enticing because they presented [...] "a lot of really good moving pieces". At Paleyfest 2015, the Fargo creator commented: [...] "It's sort of like a horse race in a way, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know that everyone is on this collision course. It's like, 'Who's going to make it?' And you can put people together in unexpected pairings." [...] Offerman played Karl Weathers, an alcoholic and the only lawyer in Luverne, and Cristin Milioti was assigned the part of Betsy Solverson, Lou's terminally ill wife. Hawley felt that Milioti was the right choice because her personality was similar to her character's. Garrett portrays Joe Bulo, and Bokeem Woodbine appears as Mike Milligan, a role he was offered two days after auditioning. For the role of Hanzee Dent, Hawley hired Zahn McClarnon two weeks after his audition. Six others play members of the Gerhardts: Kieran Culkin as Rye, Rachel Keller as Simone, Michael Hogan as Otto, Allan Dobescu as Charlie, Angus Sampson as Bear, and Jeffrey Donovan as Dodd. When asked about his decision to cast Donovan, Hawley told the actor, [...] "I don't know. You just come off with a sense of power. I think Dodd comes off with a sense of power, and I thought that you have the chops to find the humor in it." [...] Donovan gained 30 pounds in preparation for his role. Other major supporting roles in Fargo second season include: Bruce Campbell as Ronald Reagan, Keir O'Donnell as Ben Schmidt, and Elizabeth Marvel as Constance Heck.|$|E
500|$|As a mascot character, Crash {{has drawn}} {{numerous}} comparisons to competing mascots such as Mario and Sonic by reviewers. Dave Halverson of GameFan praised Crash's animations, appearance and mannerisms as [...] "100% perfection". A reviewer for Game Revolution praised Crash's [...] "quirky mannerisms" [...] as [...] "always refreshing", and John Broady of GameSpot described Crash as [...] "disarmingly cute and fuzzy". Doug Perry of IGN {{was critical of}} the character, seeing him as [...] "insanely capitalistic", negatively comparing his voice to Luigi of the Mario series and accusing him of being [...] "the most see-through, copycat mascot that ever existed." [...] Louis Bedigian of GameZone also disliked Crash's voice, remarking [...] "it is really annoying to hear a child say, 'Whoa!' every time you fall in the water, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> realize that the child's voice {{is supposed to be}} Crash". Crash's animations, particularly in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, have been praised as humorous by reviewers. Ryan Davis of GameSpot analyzed Crash's [...] "overextended running style and self-punishing attacks" [...] as establishing him as an [...] "empty-headed but enthusiastic character", and compared his facial contortions to those of comedian Red Skelton. In a poll held by MSN in late 2008 to determine the most iconic video game character, Crash ranked at #8. In the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition from 2011, he was voted as the eleventh best video game character. However, he also ranked eighth on IGN's top 10 list of video game characters who should die, adding {{that it would be a}} mercy killing. IGN editor Colin Moriarty stated that his games add little to innovate the series over the years, rendering the character useless.|$|E

We've {{done it for}} years...But in contrast to other wealthy countries, we don't ration medical care {{on the basis of}} need or anticipated benefit. In this country, we mainly ration on the ability to pay. And that is <b>especially</b> evident <b>when</b> <b>you</b> examine the plight of the uninsured in the United States." ...|$|R

Who wouldn't want to see Helen Mirren with a sniper rifle?" [...] Also in December 2009 Summit Entertainment announced a release date of October 22, 2010. The same month James Remar was cast in an unspecified role, in addition to Karl Urban as [...] "Cooper". In January 2010 {{it was reported that}} John Malkovich had signed to star opposite Bruce Willis, replacing John C. Reilly, who exited the role in late December.|$|E
2500|$|Nintendo Power {{awarded the}} game a perfect 5 star rating, stating that [...] "Advance Wars treads on new ground, taking the {{strategy}} genre {{to a place}} where gamers of all tastes will be gung-ho for it." [...] The Electric Playground called the game [...] "a deep, quite cartoony and consummately Japanese turn-based wargame with depth, character and replayability to burn." [...] IGN called the game [...] "incredibly intense and amazingly addictive... <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> learn every little nuance of the game design." [...] Gaming Age stated, [...] "There is a perfect blend of simplicity and complexity that makes this game so highly addictive." [...] GameSpot stated that the game is [...] "deep and easy to learn, and it contains a level of replay rarely witnessed in handheld gaming." [...] Total Video Games noted, [...] "For a handheld, the AI of your computer-controlled opponents is surprisingly diverse and complex." [...] AllGame commented, [...] "Ingeniously designed, Advance Wars manages to be both in-depth, and instantly accessible, simply because it presents the game in easily manageable chunks." ...|$|E

5000|$|TV critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz wrote favorably about Recess {{in their}} 2016 book TV (The Book), {{stating that the}} series is [...] "Easily one of the smartest, most prankishly playful adult {{cartoons}} ever passed off as children's entertainment.... Recess is a highly ritualized bit of entertainment that strikes the same notes over and over again, but always in infinite variation and with a surprising eye for psychological grace notes, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> characters <b>you</b> thought of as brusque and one-dimensional reveal their fears and dreams to one another." ...|$|R
2500|$|Morricone finally {{received}} a second Oscar nomination for The Mission. Morricone's original score lost out to Herbie Hancock's coolly arranged jazz on Bertrand Tavernier's Round Midnight. It was {{considered as a}} surprising win and a controversial one, given {{that much of the}} music in the film was pre-existing. Morricone stated the following during a 2001 interview with The Guardian: [...] "I definitely felt that I should have won for The Mission. <b>Especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> consider that the Oscar-winner that year was Round Midnight, which was not an original score. It had a very good arrangement by Herbie Hancock, but it used existing pieces. So there could be no comparison with The Mission. There was a theft!" [...] His score for The Mission was ranked at number 1 in a poll of the all-time greatest film scores. The top 10 list was compiled by 40 film composers such as Michael Giacchino and Carter Burwell. The score is ranked 23rd on the AFI's list of 25 greatest film scores of all time.|$|E

And to install this stuff on anyone's computer and not notify them about, it is just begging for a world of pain." [...] Robert Richardson, Director of the Computer Security Institute, said: [...] "It's incredible that they didn't realize they were playing with fire." [...] Technology journalist Robert X. Cringely wrote in InfoWorld: [...] Is there any reason why you'd need to take two weeks' worth of photos to locate a missing laptop, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> already have other ways of tracking it?

40|$|Combining {{forecasts}} To improve forecasting accuracy, combine forecasts {{derived from}} methods that differ substantially and draw from different sources of information. When feasible, use {{five or more}} methods. Use formal procedures to combine forecasts: An equal-weights rule offers a reasonable starting point, and a trimmed mean is desirable if you combine forecasts resulting from five or more methods. Use different weights if you have good domain knowledge or information on which method should be most accurate. Combining forecasts is <b>especially</b> useful <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are uncertain about the situation, uncertain about which method is most accurate, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> want to avoid large errors.
