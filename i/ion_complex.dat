5000|$|The {{most common}} methods for {{nanoparticle}} synthesis {{fall under the}} category of wet chemistry, or the nucleation of particles within a solution. This nucleation occurs when a silver <b>ion</b> <b>complex,</b> usually AgNO3 or AgClO4, is reduced to colloidal silver {{in the presence of a}} reducing agent. When the concentration increases enough, dissolved metallic silver ions bind together to form a stable surface. The surface is energetically unfavorable when the cluster is small, because the energy gained by decreasing the concentration of dissolved particles is not as high as the energy lost from creating a new surface. [...] When the cluster reaches a certain size, known as the critical radius, it becomes energetically favorable, and thus stable enough to continue to grow. This nucleus then remains in the system and grows as more silver atoms diffuse through the solution and attach to the surface [...] When the dissolved concentration of atomic silver decreases enough, it is no longer possible for enough atoms to bind together to form a stable nucleus. At this nucleation threshold, new nanoparticles stop being formed, and the remaining dissolved silver is absorbed by diffusion into the growing nanoparticles in the solution.|$|E
50|$|Although TR-FRET can be {{accomplished}} {{with a variety of}} fluorophore combinations, lanthanide metals are particularly useful. Certain life science applications take advantage of the unique fluorescence properties of lanthanide ion complexes (Ln(III) chelates or cryptates). These are well-suited for this application due to their large Stokes shifts and extremely long emission lifetimes (from microseconds to milliseconds) compared to more traditional fluorophores (e.g. fluorescein, allophycoyanin, phycoerythrin, and rhodamine). The biological fluids or serum commonly used in these research applications contain many compounds and proteins which are naturally fluorescent. Therefore, the use of conventional, steady-state fluorescence measurement presents serious limitations in assay sensitivity. Long-lived fluorophores, such as lanthanides, combined with time-resolved detection (a delay between excitation and emission detection) minimizes prompt fluorescence interference. This method (commonly referred to as time-resolved fluorometry or TRF) involves two fluorophores: a donor and an acceptor. Excitation of the donor fluorophore (in this case, the lanthanide <b>ion</b> <b>complex)</b> by an energy source (e.g. flash lamp or laser) produces an energy transfer to the acceptor fluorophore if they are within a given proximity to each other (known as the Förster's radius).

40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} and collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) {{behavior of a}} series of complexes containing cyclic or linear diketone ligands and alkali, alkaline earth, or transition metal ions are investigated. Electrospray ionization (ESI) is utilized for introduction of the metal <b>ion</b> <b>complexes</b> into a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The proximity of the carbonyl groups is crucial for {{formation and}} detection of <b>ion</b> <b>complexes</b> by ESI. For example, no metal <b>ion</b> <b>complexes</b> are observed for 1, 4 -cyclohexanedione, but they are readily detected for the isomers, 1, 2 - and 1, 3 -cyclohexanedione. Although the diketones form stable doubly charged complexes, the formation of singly charged alkaline earth complexes of the type (nL + M 2 + − H+) + where L = 1, 3 -cyclohexanedione or 2, 4 -pentanedione is the first evidence of charge reduction. CAD investigations provide further evidence of charge reduction processes occurring in the gas-phase complexes. The CAD studies indicate that an intramolecular proton transfer between two diketone ligands attached to a doubly charged metal ion, followed by elimination of the resulting protonated ligand, produces the charge reduced complex. For transition metal complexation, the preference for formation of doubly charged versus singly charged complexes correlates with the keto-enol distribution of the diketones in solution...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHydrogen {{bonds are}} among the most {{important}} interactions involved in selective complexation in host—guest chemistry. In this study a variety of hydrogen-bonded crown ether/ammonium <b>ion</b> <b>complexes</b> are generated in the gas phase by association reactions between an amine substrate and a polyether, one of which is initially protonated, and stabilized by many collisions in the chemical ionization source of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer or in a quadrupole ion trap. The nature of the hydrogen-bonding interactions of the <b>ion</b> <b>complexes</b> are evaluated by comparison of their collision-activated dissociation spectra. After collisional activation, those complexes that are weakly bound dissociate to form intact protonated polyether molecules and/or ammonium ions by simple cleavages of the hydrogen-bond association interactions. In contrast, those complexes strongly bound by multiple hydrogen bonds dissociate not only to the protonated polyether and/or ammonium ions but also by extensive covalent bond cleavage of the protonated ether skeleton. This latter type of dissociation behavior suggests that the polyether/ammonium <b>ion</b> <b>complexes</b> may be sufficiently strongly bound that surpassing the high barrier to decomposition results in formation of internally excited polyether molecules that may then undergo subsequent fragmentation by skeletal cleavages. Moreover, complexes involving multiple hydrogen bonds may have slower dissociation kinetics, allowing competition from fast dissociation processes that have substantial energy barriers...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the mechanism of}} the generation of hydroxyl radicals (・OH) from the Maillard reaction products {{in the presence of}} Cu^ ions. Human serum albumin exposed to 25 mM-glucose in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4) at 37 ℃ led to the fragmentation of the protein and the generation of ・OH under anaerobic conditions, if Cu^ ions were present in the incubation medium. In addition, fructoselysine also produced ・OH under the same conditions. These results can not be accounted for by the conventional concept that the generation of ・OH from the products of the Maillard reaction occurs only by Fenton reaction. Thus, we attempted to elucidate the mechanism for ・OH generation in the presence of Cu^ ions, using 1 -deoxy- 1 -n-butylamino-D-fructose (DBF) as a model of Amadori compounds. The following results were obtained: (a) DBF coordinated easily with Cu^ ions to form the DBF・Cu^ <b>ion</b> <b>complex</b> in phosphate buffer (pH 7. 4), but not with Fe^ ions; (b) the complex was unstable and degradated spontaneously with the liberation of Cu^+ ions; (c) the degradation of the complex was always accompanied by the production of ・OH even under anaerobic conditions; (d) the production of ・OH was inhibited about 73 % by the addition of catalase under aerobic conditions, but was not entirely affected under anaerobic conditions; and (e) the complex was not formed {{in the presence of a}} chelator such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and ・OH were not produced. These results showed that DBF generated ・OH by both Fenton and non-Fenton reactions under aerobic conditions, and by non-Fenton reactions under anaerobic conditions via the DBF・Cu^ <b>ion</b> <b>complex.</b> It can therefore be presumed that the fructoselysine residue formed in the glycated protein in vivo might also produce ・OH by both Fenton and non-Fenton reactions via it's Cu^ <b>ion</b> <b>complex...</b>|$|E

The structural, chemical compositions and morphology of as-fabricated SrCS were systematically investigated. Cell proliferation test, RT-PCR and preliminary animal studies were conducted to evaluate the clinical potential of SrCS on OA treatment. The materials characterization results verified that the Sr was successfully integrated into CS by replacing sodium in the original structure and formed a new polysaccharide-metal <b>ion</b> <b>complex.</b> The cell proliferation results indicated that the SrCS has excellent biocompatibility for both chondrocyte and osteoblast. The RT-PCR results showed that the SrCS can significantly increase the expression of COLII and ACAN, decrease MMP 1 and MMP 13 in chondrocyte and decrease the IL- 6 and IL- 1 beta in both chondrocyte and osteoblast. Preliminary animal studies demonstrated that SrCS can effectively simulate the articular cartilage formation in SD-rats after modified Hulth's OA modeling surgery.
