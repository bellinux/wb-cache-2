5|$|Landing on the island, Johnny and Zatch {{lead the}} attack on the royal city, taking down Chi's henchmen and freeing Mac. Johnny confronts Colonel Chi, {{successfully}} defeating him by knocking him into a body of water with the help of Adam and his Game Gear. With Chi's rule undone, peace is restored to Patusan. Johnny is seated as the heralded warrior prince with Ro-May as his princess and Adam as a prince. Johnny declares the monarchy to be dissolved and announces that Patusan will operate as a democracy. His reason for <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> for the people to finally be free of rule, good or evil.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by toad, that usually kill the cane toad's predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce the cane toad population. One way of <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get rid of them. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants aggression, workers will pour out of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest.|$|E
5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E

Additionally, acyclic FSAs can be minimized in linear time.|$|E
25|$|Unstable sorting {{algorithms}} can be specially {{implemented to}} be stable.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{that it is possible to}} form a reactive barrier by adding something to the soil which will cause the uranium to become fixed. One method of <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to use a mineral (apatite) while a second method is to add a food substance such as acetate to the soil. This will enable bacteria to reduce the uranium (VI) to uranium (IV) which is much less soluble. In peat-like soils the uranium will tend to bind to the humic acids, this tends to fix the uranium in the soil.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of homological algebra was closely {{intertwined with the}} emergence of category theory. By and large, homological algebra is the study of homological functors and the intricate algebraic structures that they entail. One quite useful and ubiquitous concept in mathematics is that of chain complexes, which can be studied both through their homology and cohomology. Homological algebra affords the means to extract information contained in these complexes and present it in the form of homological invariants of rings, modules, topological spaces, and other 'tangible' mathematical objects. A powerful tool for <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> provided by spectral sequences.|$|E

25|$|For {{the normal}} distribution, {{the lack of}} an {{analytical}} expression for the corresponding quantile function means that other methods (e.g. the Box–Muller transform) may be preferred computationally. It is often the case that, even for simple distributions, the inverse transform sampling method can be improved on: see, for example, the ziggurat algorithm and rejection sampling. On the other hand, it is possible to approximate the quantile function of the normal distribution extremely accurately using moderate-degree polynomials, and in fact the method of <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> fast enough that inversion sampling is now the default method for sampling from a normal distribution in the statistical package R.|$|E
25|$|The kernel has {{full access}} to the system's memory and must allow {{processes}} to safely access this memory as they require it. Often {{the first step in}} <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> virtual addressing, usually achieved by paging and/or segmentation. Virtual addressing allows the kernel to make a given physical address appear to be another address, the virtual address. Virtual address spaces may be different for different processes; the memory that one process accesses at a particular (virtual) address may be different memory from what another process accesses at the same address. This allows every program to behave as if it is the only one (apart from the kernel) running and thus prevents applications from crashing each other.|$|E
25|$|Visitors to a Shinto shrine {{follow a}} {{purification}} ritual before presenting {{themselves to the}} kami. This ritual begins with hand washing, and swallowing and later spitting {{a small amount of}} water in front of the shrine to purify the body, heart, and mind. Once this is complete they turn their focus to gaining the kami’s attention. The traditional method of <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to bow twice, clap twice and bow again, alerting the kami to their presence and desire to commune with them. During the last bow, the supplicant offers words of gratitude and praise to the kami; if they are offering a prayer for aid they will also state their name and address. After the prayer and/or worship they repeat the two bows, two claps and a final bow in conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Governments use {{different}} kinds of taxes and vary the tax rates. They do this in order to distribute the tax burden among individuals or classes of the population involved in taxable activities, such as the business sector, or to redistribute resources between individuals or classes in the population. Historically, taxes on the poor supported the nobility; modern social-security systems aim to support the poor, the disabled, or the retired by taxes on those who are still working. In addition, taxes are applied to fund foreign aid and military ventures, to influence the macroeconomic performance of the economy (a government's strategy for <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> called its fiscal policy; see also tax exemption), or to modify patterns of consumption or employment within an economy, by making some classes of transaction more or less attractive.|$|E
25|$|The only {{remedy for}} {{this loss of}} control is to desaturate the CMGs by {{removing}} the excess angular momentum from the spacecraft. The simplest way of <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to use Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters. In our example of saturation along the forward axis, the RCS will be fired to produce an anticlockwise torque about that axis. The CMG control program will then command the rotor spin axes to begin fanning out away from the forward direction, producing gyroscopic torques whose resultant is clockwise about the forward direction, opposing the RCS {{as long as it}} is still firing and holding the spacecraft steady. This is continued until a suitable amount of forward angular momentum has been drained out of the CMG rotors; it is transformed into the moment of momentum of the moving matter in the RCS thruster exhausts and carried away from the spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|Anna plays only a {{very minor}} role {{in the story of}} the first game, {{appearing}} as a sub-boss character for Nina. Her story was further expanded in later games. In Tekken 2, as in the first tournament, the 20-year-old Nina was once again hired to assassinate the sponsor of the current tournament, Kazuya Mishima. Whether at Kazuya's discretion or Anna's own volition, Anna became a bodyguard for Kazuya, along with Ganryu and Bruce Irvin, who were all charged with Kazuya's protection. Nina was later captured by Mishima Zaibatsu forces and used in Dr. Bosconovitch's cryonics research. Learning about this, Anna volunteered to be another test subject, requesting that she be woken in the future {{at the same time as}} Nina. Her reason for <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> unknown, but the two most reasonable explanations would be because she didn't want to feel lonely without Nina, and she didn't wanted her sister's age preserved in a cryonic sleep while she herself continues to age.|$|E
