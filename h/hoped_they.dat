5|$|After his much publicized {{problems}} on the base paths the previous season, Kemp arrived at spring training early to work with new Dodger coach Davey Lopes on his base running. Kemp announced his intention to steal 40 bases this season and Lopes <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> would be high percentage steals. At {{the end of the}} season, Kemp had the 40 steals and was only caught 11 times, a significant improvement in percentage from the previous year, and his work with Lopes was credited for much of the improvement.|$|E
5|$|Tudor's {{plan was}} to export ice as a luxury good to wealthy members of West Indies and the {{southern}} US states, where he <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> would relish the product during their sweltering summers; conscious of the risk that others might follow suit, Tudor hoped to acquire local monopoly rights in his new markets {{in order to maintain}} high prices and profits. He started by attempting to establish a monopoly on the potential ice trade in the Caribbean and invested in a brigantine ship to transport ice bought from farmers around Boston. At the time, Tudor was regarded by the business community at best as something of an eccentric, and at worst a fool.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1915, Tom Crisp Jr. left the vessel to join the Royal Navy. A few weeks later the U–boat threat {{expected}} so many months before arrived, as submarines surfaced among the undefended fishing fleets and used dynamite to destroy dozens of them after releasing the crews in small boats. This offensive {{was part of a}} wider German strategy to denude Britain of food supplies and took a heavy toll on the fishing fleets of the North Sea. George Borrow was among the victims, sunk in August, although it is not known if Crisp was aboard at the time. While temporarily working in a net factory following the loss of his vessel, he was scouted by a Navy officer recruiting experienced local fishing captains to command a flotilla of tiny fishing vessels, which were to be secretly armed. The boats were intended to be working fishing vessels fitted with a small artillery piece with which to sink enemy submarines as they surfaced alongside. In this manner it was <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> would protect the fishing fleets without the diversion of major resources from the regular fleet, {{in the same manner as}} Q-ships deployed in the commercial sea lanes.|$|E

He released a follow-up entitled I <b>Hope</b> <b>They</b> Hear Me Vol. 1.5 in December 2010. It combined several new songs {{with a collection of}} tracks from the original mixtape. Vol. 1.5 served as a prequel to his next mixtape, I <b>Hope</b> <b>They</b> Hear Me Vol. 2, which {{was released}} on March 1, 2011. Prior to its release, Dee-1 leaked a track online, available for free download, in early February titled [...] "It's My Turn". The track has received positive criticism from various notable hip-hop websites, including XXL and 2dopeboyz.|$|R

5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Cairo, Clarke began to build a network of useful contacts. He befriended Lieutenant-Colonel Raymund Maunsell, who {{operated}} Security Intelligence Middle East (SIME), the agency in charge of counter-espionage in the region. Maunsell later worked closely with Clarke, helping to feed misinformation to the enemy via double agents. Clarke's first deception was a scheme to mislead Italian forces into expecting an invasion of Italian Somaliland instead of Eritrea, the real Allied target. Operation Camilla fooled the Italian leadership completely but instead of diverting troops as the British <b>hoped,</b> <b>they</b> withdrew their forces into Eritrea. From this failure Clarke learned a first lesson, one he would teach to many other deception officers during the war: {{that the key to}} deception was not to make your enemy think what you wish but to get them to do what you want.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks later}} MacLachlan learned {{he was to}} be {{relocated}} to Malta. Twelve pilots and 207 men boarded HMS Argus in the River Clyde just off Greenock on 7 November 1940 and set sail for the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations. The convoy sent to Malta constituted a part of Operation Collar. The operation was to supply aircraft for the Island's defence. In June 1940 Italy had declared war on France when the country {{was on the verge of}} collapse at the hands of the German Wehrmacht. The Italians <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> could take advantage of the weakened Allies by joining the Axis Powers. It was the Italian intent to launch a series of air, naval and land offensives throughout the Mediterranean and in particularly in North Africa. Malta lay across Italian sea communications between Sicily and Italian-held Libya. The island had the potential to be a useful base from which the British could disrupt Axis supplies to and from North Africa and the ensuing North African Campaign. The Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force) resolved to eliminate the island by bombing shipping bringing in supplies and attacking the island directly. With air power crucial to both sides, the island was reinforced.|$|E
5|$|When Ladislaus of Naples {{sold his}} {{rights to the}} Kingdom of Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice and retreated from the Balkans in 1409, many local nobles allied {{themselves}} with the Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund and accepted Ostoja as the King of Bosnia. This seriously weakened the position of Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, a Grand Duke of Bosnia, whose niece Katarina was a second wife of Sandalj Hranić, a Grand Duke of Hum. In such circumstances Sandalj decided to ally with emperor Sigismund in mid 1411 and to establish closer connections with Sigismund's important ally Stefan Lazarević. In December 1411 Sandalj divorced his wife Katarina and married Stefan's sister Jelena {{at the end of}} the same year. Jelena married Sandalj because she wanted to strengthen the position of her son. With this marriage Sandalj, the most dangerous enemy of Balša III, became his stepfather and protector. Although it spoiled Sandalj's relations with Hrvoje, it also strengthened traditionally close relations with the Lazarević family. Although Jelena was in her forties, Sandalj <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> would have children and in 1413 deposited some money at a transactional account with the city of Dubrovnik for the child they would eventually have.|$|E

5|$|On 7 January 2011, {{the parts}} {{announced}} that they had reached a compromise. Stabæk would remain at Telenor Arena {{for at least the}} 2011 season. In addition, the club held an option to take over the responsibility for events at the venue. Stabæk Fotball had until 30 June to accept the option, which would allow the club to remain at the venue on a permanent basis. This would require them to invest NOK20 million in an event administration, which would increase event revenue, {{but at the same time}} move the risk from Stabæk Holding to Stabæk Fotball. If the club declined the option, they would not be allowed to play at the venue from the 2012 season. On 30 June, Stabæk {{announced that they}} would not fulfill the option to continue renting the stadium. The necessary NOK35 million would entail a risk the club was not willing to take. The club stated that they <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> could remain at the stadium by establishing a foundation which could purchase the venue form Ulrichsen. If this does not work out, the club will have to relocate from the 2012 season. The club is then considering relocating back to Nadderud, to Ullevaal or to Marienlyst. The club estimates that any relocation would result in the club losing half their revenue. Stabæk played its last match at Fornebu Arena on 20 November 2011, losing 1–2 against Haugesund. Subsequently, the pitch was removed, and Stabæk returned to Nadderud from the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|On July 3, Pemberton sent {{a note to}} Grant {{regarding}} the possibility of negotiations for peace. Grant, {{as he had done}} at Fort Donelson, first demanded unconditional surrender. But Grant reconsidered, not wanting to feed 30,000 hungry Confederates in Union prison camps, and offered to parole all prisoners. Considering their destitute state, dejected and starving, he never expected them to fight again; he <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> would carry home the stigma of defeat {{to the rest of the}} Confederacy. In any event, it would have occupied his army and taken months to ship that many prisoners north. Pemberton officially surrendered his army on July 4. Most of the men who were paroled on July 6 were exchanged and received back into the Confederate Army on August 4, 1863, at Mobile Harbor, Alabama. They were back in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by September and some fought in the Battles for Chattanooga in November and against Sherman's invasion of Georgia in May 1864. The Confederate government protested the validity of the paroles on technical grounds and the issue was referred to Grant who, in April 1864, was general in chief of the Army. The dispute effectively ended all further prisoner exchanges during the war except for hardship cases.|$|E
25|$|Wilder's {{force of}} some 4,000 men was paroled and {{directed}} to Bowling Green, where Bragg <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> {{would be a}} drain on Buell's supplies. The delay caused by the Confederate victory at Munfordville may well have cost them a much more important prize– Louisville.|$|E

25|$|A {{theory is}} called {{categorical}} {{if it has}} only one model, up to isomorphism. This term was introduced by , and for some time thereafter mathematicians <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> could put mathematics on a solid foundation by describing a categorical first-order theory of some version of set theory. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem dealt a first blow to this hope, as it implies that a first-order theory which has an infinite model cannot be categorical. Later, in 1931, the hope was shattered completely by Gödel's incompleteness theorem.|$|E

25|$|During {{the process}} of seeking Parliamentary authorisation, the Caledonian {{observed}} that the Clydesdale Junction Railway was being promoted. The Caledonian acquired that line during its construction, and it opened in 1849. It gave an alternative, and shorter access to another Glasgow passenger terminal, named South Side, and to the Clyde Quays at General Terminus (over the connected General Terminus and Glasgow Harbour Railway). The South Side station was already {{being used by the}} Glasgow, Barrhead and Neilston Direct Railway, worked by the Caledonian. One day, they <b>hoped,</b> <b>they</b> might extend that line into Ayrshire. Meanwhile, the line was leased (for 999 years) to the Caledonian in 1849.|$|E
25|$|Nicias, {{exhausted}} and suffering from illness, now believed {{it would be}} impossible to capture Syracuse. He wrote a letter to Athens, not trusting messengers to give an accurate report, and suggested that they either recall the expedition or send out massive reinforcements. He <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> would choose to recall him, if not the whole expedition, but instead they chose to send reinforcements, under Demosthenes and Eurymedon. Eurymedon left immediately with ten ships, and Demosthenes left sometime later with a much larger force. Meanwhile, in early 413 BC Sparta acted on Alcibiades's advice to fortify Decelea, and the Athenian force sent to relieve it was destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli forces {{landed at}} Entebbe on 3 July at 23:00 IST, with their cargo bay doors already open. A black Mercedes car {{that looked like}} President Idi Amin's vehicle and Land Rovers that usually {{accompanied}} Amin's Mercedes were brought along. The Israelis <b>hoped</b> <b>they</b> could use them to bypass security checkpoints. When the C-130s landed, Israeli assault team members drove the vehicles to the terminal building {{in the same fashion}} as Amin. As they approached the terminal, two Ugandan sentries, aware that Idi Amin had recently purchased a white Mercedes, ordered the vehicles to stop. The commandos shot the sentries using silenced pistols, but did not kill them. As they pulled away, an Israeli commando in one of the following Land Rovers killed them with an unsuppressed rifle. Fearing the hijackers would be alerted prematurely, the assault team quickly approached the terminal.|$|E

On December 7, 2010, Kristin Dos Santos stated that Murray and Burton would definitely not be back for Brooke's wedding, but that they were still expected to return. In January 2011, Burton confirmed that she would not be returning. In August 2011, The CW revealed that Murray would return for a guest appearance in the final season. Burton did not return, as she was not asked back that time around.|$|E
