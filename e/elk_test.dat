It appears to have received a brand-new platform, although the multi-link suspension at both ends strongly resembled that of the 1991 Mazda Sentia, with minor changes such as replacing the lower I-arm with an A-arm for front wheel drive. It was the only production car in the world to employ a Miller cycle engine (The current Demio/Mazda2 features Miller Cycle on one of its engines). Yaw-sensitive four-wheel steering was available as an option in Japan; Mazda claimed that with this feature, the Millenia was capable of passing the <b>elk</b> <b>test</b> at speeds comparable to the BMW 850i and Nissan 300ZX.|$|E

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the {{physiology}} and diseases of the North American elk (Cervus canadensis) were investigated, toward the goal of uncovering influences responsible for declining productivity among some elk herds in Oregon. A newly developed drug, Etorphine, together with its antagonistic companion, Dip renorphine, was used to immobilize elk. Substantial {{differences were found in}} the amounts required and animal responses dependent upon age, physical condition and life history. Whole blood samples were obtained from 60 living elk for hematological studies. The parameters examined included hemoglobin levels, packed cell volume, erythrocyte and leukocyte counts, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, and the percentage distribution of neutrophils, band cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Respiration rate, heart rate, and body temperature were measured for nine drugged elk. Sickling of erythrocytes was found in the blood of two female elk. Serum was separated from the blood of 72 living elk and 22 recently shot elk of mixed ages and sexes. Serum proteins were differentiated by electrophoretic analysis. Values obtained for total protein, albumin, total globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, and for the alpha 1, alpha 2, beta and gamma globulins, were grouped and summarized to facilitate comparisons based on age and sex, as well as between living and dead, and captive and free-living elk. Total serum protein concentrations were markedly higher in the older age groups of both captive and freeliving elk. An apparent tendency to higher albumin levels was found among males of this species. Values for serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen, Chlorides, Cholesterol, glucose, direct bilirubin, total bilirubin, creatinine, and uric acid, as well as activity levels of alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase were obtained. Sodium/ potassium and calCium/phosphorus ratios were calculated. Urine speciments were obtained from seven elk and analyzed for the presence of glucose. Young elk, both captive and free-living, had higher serum values for sodium, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, glucose and alkaline phosphatase than did the older age group. Mature elk, both captive and free-living, had higher serum values for calcium/phosphorus ratio, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid and serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase than did those under two years of age. Differences in serum Chemistry were also found between captive and free-living <b>elk.</b> Serological <b>tests</b> on sera from 67 <b>elk</b> <b>tested</b> were negative for brucellosis and bluetongue virus. Tests for leptospirosis on sera from 29 elk by the macroscopic agglutination method were all negative. Of 38 free-living <b>elk</b> <b>tested</b> for leptospirosis by the microscopic agglutination test, 16 showed positive reactions to one or more serotypes at a significant titer of 1 : 100 or greater. Another eight showed positive reactions at the 1 : 50 level. This is believed to the first report of serological reactivity to leptospirosis reported for elk. Internal organs from 39 elk were examined for the presence of adult helminths, and fecal pellets from 82 elk were examined for the presence of parasite eggs. Lethal numbers of Dictyocaulus viviparus were recovered from the respiratory organs of two yearling male elk. Two nematodes of the Trichostrongylus axei and Ostertagia circumcincta, were found that have not been previously reported from Roosevelt elk. Fascioloides magna and Oesophagostomum venulosum were also found. The common winter tick, Dermacentor albipictus and Ixodes pacificus were collected from Roosevelt elk. This latter species has not been previously reported in elk. Increased gannna globulin values and concomitant decreases in albumin were observed in tick-infested elk...|$|R
40|$|In 2009, Mycobacterium bovis {{infection}} {{was detected}} in {{a herd of}} 60 [*]elk (Cervus elaphus) and 50 fallow deer (Dama dama) in Nebraska, USA. Upon depopulation of the herd, the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) was estimated at ∼ 71 – 75 %, based upon histopathology and culture results. Particularly with elk, gross lesions were often severe and extensive. One year ago, {{the majority of the}} <b>elk</b> had been <b>tested</b> for TB by single cervical test (SCT), and all were negative. After initial detection of a tuberculous elk in this herd, 42 of the 59 <b>elk</b> were <b>tested</b> by SCT. Of the 42 SCT-tested elk, 28 were TB-infected with only 3 / 28 reacting upon SCT. After SCT, serum samples were collected from the infected elk and fallow deer from this herd at necropsy and tested by three antibody detection methods including multiantigen print immunoassay, cervidTB STAT-PAK, and dual path platform VetTB (DPP). Serologic test sensitivity ranged from 79 to 97 % depending on the test format and host species. Together, these findings demonstrate the opportunities for use of serodiagnosis in the rapid detection of TB in elk and fallow deer...|$|R
40|$|One of the ‘chronic ’ {{obstacles}} {{within the}} field of medical image processing is the lack of reference image datasets for research and development (R&D) groups, in order to evaluate new methods and applications so that the results are comparable in a reliable, i. e. quantitative way. Whereas the development of basic image processing methods over many years frequently have been evaluated on the famous Lena image [1][2], there have been only few attempts to establish appropriate reference data for the medical field [6][7]. One important reason for this is the much more difficult task: for medical image processing purposes reference datasets from only some representative images to those with up to thousands of images are required for to cover at least the most important medical imaging domains. The recently initiated Working Group on Medical Image Processing of the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI WG MIP) has as one of its goals to develop first parts of a Reference Image Database for Medical Image Processing R&D groups (RID-MIP) during the next three years. The concept of RID-MIP is based on three kinds of datasets: clinical trial datasets, <b>elk</b> <b>test</b> datasets, modality simulator datasets. Due to a draft roadmap the following milestones have to be rolled up: identification and specification of important datasets to be provided, selection and preparation of three highly relevant <b>elk</b> <b>test</b> datasets, dissemination, evaluation of impact on R&D. 1...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{developers}} of multi-wheeled vehicles (MWV) show {{growing interest in}} electromechanical drive in the «motor-axis» implementation. However, in designing the traction electric drive (TED) based on such approach the problems arise, primarily, {{from a lack of}} creating experience and of ready algorithmic solutions to control the traction motors. The use of methods to implement the individual TED is impossible {{because of the presence of}} cross-axle differential in the leading axle drive, which does not allow the input torque control of each wheel singly. The paper offers a law to control a traction electric drive of MWV leading axles that comprises the law to control the tractive effort torque and braking moment on the leading axles as well as algorithms of anti-lock brake and traction control systems. An analysis of simulation modeling results shows an efficiency of the developed law that allows control of the traction electric drive of MWV leading axles. The control law includes an algorithm to control the tractive effort torque and braking moment on the driving-wheels, as well as algorithms of anti-lock brake and traction systems. At stationary (constant speed rotation) and non-stationary (<b>elk</b> <b>test)</b> maneuvering there was no spin of vehicle wheels. Angular speeds of the wheels vary smoothly. Partial loss of vehicle stability when making maneuvers on ice may be reduced through development of algorithms for dynamic stabilization, which will improve the MWV road-holding and trajectory ability. Fullscale tests of MWV with traction electric drive implemented using a “motor-axis" approach are required to have a final answer on the performance and effectiveness of the developed control law. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} {{theory on}} the vehicle stability in curve is explained in this paper; {{it allows the}} calculation of the force on the wheels during the motion in curve, supposing unchanging {{the position of the}} rolling centre; moreover it does not take in account the turn of the wheels and the behaviour of the tires, so that the theory can be applied to 2 WS and 4 WS vehicles for vertical loads calculation. The virtual simulations of 2 WS and 4 WS vehicles are executed, extracting all the data interesting the vehicle stability; it needs the distinction between manoeuvrability and handling. The simulations of two different tests are executed: the <b>elk</b> <b>test</b> like manoeuvrability test and a similar one at low speed as handling test. The values of vertical forces are compared one another and with the results by the simplified theory of the above. The results of horizontal (longitudinal and transversal) forces and the self alignment moment are compared with those obtained by magic formulae of Pacejka. All the comparisons are very satisfactory for both 2 WS and 4 WS vehicles, indicating that 4 WS vehicle has a greater stability in curve, in every situation and that the theoretical formula of the weight displacement gives good results. Moreover the better performances of 4 WS vehicle in terms of the slip angle, of the weight displacement and of the forces give in general a substantial contribute to the safety of the vehicles, well as an increase of driveability. 4 WS has lower yaw-rate in high speed, smaller slip angle and lateral acceleration, so it has better robustness. Besides 2 WS loses stability in advance when steering angles of front wheels are greater...|$|E
40|$|Aspen {{has been}} declining in Jackson Hole for many years, a {{condition}} generally attributed {{to the fact that}} lightning fires have been aggressively suppressed since the early 1900 s. It is also believed that burning will successfully regenerate aspen stands despite high <b>elk</b> numbers. To <b>test</b> this hypothesis, I evaluated 467 burned and 495 adjacent, unburned aspen stands at eight different locations within Jackson Hole. Aspen suckering was stimulated by burning, but most aspen stands still failed to produce new stems greater than 2 m tall where ungulate use was moderate or high. Only when elk use was low were burned aspen stands able to successfully regenerate. At those locations, however, unburned aspen stands also successfully regenerated. Evidence suggests that a combination of fire and continued elk use may eliminate many aspen clones...|$|R
40|$|Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal {{prion disease}} of wild and captive cervids in North America. Prions are {{infectious}} agents {{composed of a}} misfolded version of a host-encoded protein, termed PrPSc. Infected cervids excrete and secrete prions, contributing to lateral transmission. Geographical distribution is expanding and case numbers in wild cervids are increasing. Recently, the first European cases of CWD {{have been reported in}} a wild reindeer and two moose from Norway. Therefore, methods to detect the infection early in the incubation time using easily available samples are desirable to facilitate effective disease management. We have adapted the real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay, a sensitive in vitro prion amplification method, for pre-clinical detection of prion seeding activity in <b>elk</b> feces. <b>Testing</b> fecal samples from orally inoculated elk taken at various time points post infection revealed early shedding and detectable prion seeding activity throughout the disease course. Early shedding was also found in two elk encoding a PrP genotype associated with reduced susceptibility for CWD. In summary, we suggest that detection of CWD prions in feces by RT-QuIC may become a useful tool to support CWD surveillance in wild and captive cervids. The finding of early shedding independent of the elk's prion protein genotype raises the question whether prolonged survival is beneficial, considering accumulation of environmental prions and its contribution to CWD transmission upon extended duration of shedding...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 676 elk (Cervus elaphus) were genotyped at 16 {{tetranucleotide}} microsatellite loci to evaluate genetic differences among 3 subspecies of elk in California: tule (C. e. nannodes), Roosevelt (C. e. roosevelti), and Rocky Mountain (C. e. nelsoni) elk. Of the 13 populations analyzed, 5 represented tule elk herds, 3 were Roosevelt elk, 2 were Rocky Mountain elk, and 3 were of uncertain taxonomic status. Overall, populations averaged between 7 and 8 alleles per locus, with observed heterozygosity values ranging from 0. 33 to 0. 58 per population. Tule elk, which experienced a severe bottleneck in the 1870 s, had consistently less genetic diversity {{than the other}} subspecies. All 3 subspecies were significantly differentiated, with the greatest genetic distance seen between the tule and Roosevelt subspecies. Assignment of individuals to subspecies using microsatellite data was nearly 100 % accurate. Despite the past population bottleneck, {{significant differences were found}} among the tule <b>elk</b> herds. Assignment <b>testing</b> of <b>elk</b> from Modoc, Siskiyou, and Shasta counties to determine subspecific status of individuals suggested that these populations contained both Roosevelt and Rocky Mountain elk and their hybrids, indicating that these elk subspecies interbreed where subspecies coexist.

40|$|Mineralized tissues, such as {{bone and}} antler, are complex {{hierarchical}} materials that have adapted over millennia to optimize strength and fracture resistance for their in vivo applications. As a structural support, skeletal bone primarily {{acts as a}} rigid framework that is resistant to fracture, and able to repair damage and adapt to sustained loads during its lifetime. Antler is typically deciduous and subjected to large bending moments and violent impacts during its annual cycle. To date, extensive characterization of the quasi-static mechanical properties of these materials has been performed. However, very little {{has been done to}} characterize their dynamic properties, {{despite the fact that the}} majority of failures in these materials occur under impact loads. Here, an in depth analysis of the dynamic mechanical behavior of these two materials is presented, using equine bone obtained post-mortem from donors ranging in age from 6 months to 28 years, and antler from the North American <b>Elk.</b> Specimens were <b>tested</b> under compressive strain rates of 10 ⁻³, 10 ⁰, and 10 ³ sec⁻¹ in order to investigate their strain rate dependent compressive response. Fracture toughness experiments were performed using a four-point bending geometry on single and double-notch specimens in order to measure fracture toughness, as well as observe differences in crack propagation between dynamic (2 ̃x 10 ⁻⁵ MPa·m¹/²/s) and quasi-static (0 ̃. 25 MPa·m¹/²/s) loading rates. After testing, specimens were analyzed using a combination of optical, electron and confocal microscopy. Results indicated that the mechanical response of these materials is highly dependent on loading rate. Decreasing quasi- static fracture toughness is observed with age in bone specimens, while dynamic specimens show no age trends, yet universally decreased fracture toughness compared to those tested quasi-statically. For the first time, rising R- curve behavior in bone was also shown to exist under both quasi-static and dynamic loading. Antler demonstrated itself to be extremely resistant to impact loading, often requiring multiple impacts to fracture a specimen. Microscopy observations of deformation and crack propagation mechanisms indicate that differences in mechanical behavior between bone and antler, and at varying strain rates, are the result of subtle differences in bulk composition and active microstructural toughening mechanism...|$|R
