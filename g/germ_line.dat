5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of reproductive heritability and {{the origin of}} new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis. In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation of elements (later known as genes). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory. August Weismann made the important distinction between germ cells {{that give rise to}} gametes (such as sperm and egg cells) and the somatic cells of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> only. Hugo de Vries connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cells structure. De Vries {{was also one of the}} researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and Mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} divergence has generally the following pattern: Human-Chimp < Human-Gorilla << Human-Orangutan, highlighting the close kinship {{between humans and}} the African apes. Alu elements diverge quickly due to their high frequency of CpG dinucleotides which mutate roughly 10 times more often than the average nucleotide in the genome. The mutation rate is higher in the male <b>germ</b> <b>line,</b> therefore the divergence in the Y chromosome—which is inherited solely from the father—is higher than in autosomes. The X chromosome is inherited twice as often through the female <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> as through the male <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> and therefore shows slightly lower {{sequence divergence}}. The sequence divergence of the Xq13.3 region is surprisingly low between humans and chimpanzees.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{estimates}} of microsatellite mutation {{rates have been}} made in numerous organisms, from insects to humans. In the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria, the microsatellite mutation rate was estimated at 2.1 x 10−4 per generation per locus. The microsatellite mutation rate in human male <b>germ</b> <b>lines</b> is five to six times higher than in female <b>germ</b> <b>lines</b> and ranges from 0 to 7 x 10−3 per locus per gamete per generation. In the nematode Pristionchus pacificus, the estimated microsatellite mutation rate ranges from 8.9 × 10−5 to 7.5 × 10−4 per locus per generation.|$|R

25|$|<b>Germ</b> <b>line</b> {{mutations}} in DNA repair genes cause only 2–5% {{of colon cancer}} cases. However, altered expression of microRNAs, causing DNA repair deficiencies, are frequently associated with cancers and {{may be an important}} causal factor.|$|E
25|$|A gene in a {{somatic cell}} of an {{individual}} may forego replication to promote the transmission of its copies in the <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> cells. It ensures the high value of p = 1 due to their constant contact and their common origin from the zygote.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{in cancer}} cells, chromothripsis has also be {{reported}} in patients with developmental and congenital defects, i.e. <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> cells. Using multiple molecular techniques of these <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> cells that have appeared to have undergone a chromothripsis like process, as {{well as in}}versions and translocations, duplications and triplications were also seen and hence increases in copy number. This {{can be attributed to}} replicative processes that involve the restoration of collapsed replication forks such as fork stalling and template switching model (FoSTeS) or microhomology mediated break induced replication (MMBIR). This makes it seem that it would be more appropriate to name the phenomenon 'chromoanasynthesis' which means chromosome reconstitution rather than chromothripsis. However most samples displaying chromothripsis that are analysed have low copy states and hence have paired end joining predominating repair mechanisms.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} {{epigenetic}} mechanisms can be perturbed {{in different types}} of cancer. Epigenetic alterations of DNA repair genes or cell cycle control genes are very frequent in sporadic (non-germ line) cancers, being significantly more common than <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> (familial) mutations in these sporadic cancers. Epigenetic alterations are important in cellular transformation to cancer, and their manipulation holds great promise for cancer prevention, detection, and therapy. Several medications which have epigenetic impact are used in several of these diseases. These aspects of epigenetics are addressed in cancer epigenetics.|$|E
25|$|The second {{way is the}} {{addition}} of methyl groups to the DNA, mostly at CpG sites, to convert cytosine to 5-methylcytosine. 5-Methylcytosine performs much like a regular cytosine, pairing with a guanine in double-stranded DNA. However, {{some areas of the}} genome are methylated more heavily than others, and highly methylated areas tend to be less transcriptionally active, through a mechanism not fully understood. Methylation of cytosines can also persist from the <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> of one of the parents into the zygote, marking the chromosome as being inherited from one parent or the other (genetic imprinting).|$|E
50|$|In plants, genetic {{changes in}} somatic lines {{can and do}} result in genetic changes in the <b>germ</b> <b>lines,</b> because the <b>germ</b> cells are {{produced}} by somatic cell lineages (vegetative meristems), which may be old enough (many years) to have accumulated multiple mutations since seed germination, some of them subject to natural selection. Likewise, basal animals such as sponges (Porifera) and corals (Anthozoa) contain multipotent stem cell lineages, {{that give rise to}} both somatic and reproductive cells. Weismann barrier appears to be of a more recent evolutionary origin.|$|R
40|$|The alpha-crystallin-related {{heat shock}} (stress) protein hsp 27 is {{expressed}} in absence of heat shock during Drosophila melanogaster development. Here, we describe the tissue distribution of this protein using an immunoaffinity-purified antibody. In embryos, hsp 27 translated from maternal RNA is uniformly distributed, except in the yolk. During the first, second, and early third larval stages, hsp 27 expression is restricted to the brain and the gonads. These tissues are characterized by {{a high level of}} proliferating cells. In late third instar larvae and early pupae, in addition to the central nervous system and the gonads, all the imaginal discs synthesize hsp 27. The disc expression seems restricted to the beginning of their differentiation since it disappears {{during the second half of}} the pupal stage: no more hsp 27 is observed in the disc-derived adult organs. In adults, hsp 27 is still present in some regions of the central nervous system, and is also expressed in the male and female <b>germ</b> <b>lines</b> where it accumulates in mature sperm and oocytes. The transcript and the protein accumulate in oocytes since the onset of vitellogenesis with a uniform distribution similar to that found in embryos. The adult <b>germ</b> <b>lines</b> transcribe hsp 27 gene while no transcript is detected in the late pupal and adult brain. These results suggest multiple roles of hsp 27 during Drosophila development which may be related to both the proliferative and differentiated states of the tissues...|$|R

25|$|Epigenetics {{can affect}} {{evolution}} when epigenetic changes are heritable. A sequestered <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> or Weismann barrier is specific to animals, and epigenetic inheritance {{is more common}} in plants and microbes. Eva Jablonka, Marion J. Lamb and Étienne Danchin have argued that these effects may require enhancements to the standard conceptual framework of the modern synthesis and have called for an extended evolutionary synthesis. Other evolutionary biologists have incorporated epigenetic inheritance into population genetics models and are openly skeptical, stating that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification are genetically inherited under the control of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|After {{fertilization}} of the oocyte, {{the early}} embryo (or syncytial embryo) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until about 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By {{the end of}} the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, gastrulation starts.|$|E
25|$|The ovaries {{are made}} up of a number of egg tubes, called ovarioles, which vary in size and number by species. The number of eggs that the insect is able to make vary by the number of ovarioles with the rate that eggs can be {{developed}} being also influenced by ovariole design. In meroistic ovaries, the eggs-to-be divide repeatedly and most of the daughter cells become helper cells for a single oocyte in the cluster. In panoistic ovaries, each egg-to-be produced by stem germ cells develops into an oocyte; there are no helper cells from the <b>germ</b> <b>line.</b> Production of eggs by panoistic ovaries tends to be slower than that by meroistic ovaries.|$|E
40|$|In eukaryotes, diploid cells {{give rise}} to haploid cells via meiosis, a program of two cell {{divisions}} preceded by one round of DNA replication. Although key molecular components of the meiotic apparatus are highly conserved among eukaryotes, the mechanisms responsible for initiating the meiotic program have diverged substantially among eukaryotes. This raises a related question in animals with two distinct sexes: Within a given species, are similar or different mechanisms of meiotic initiation used in {{the male and female}} <b>germ</b> <b>lines?</b> In mammals, this question is underscored by dramatic differences in the timing of meiotic initiation in males and females. Stra 8 is a vertebrate-specific, cytoplasmic factor expressed by germ cells in response to retinoic acid. We previously demonstrated that Stra 8 gene function is required for meiotic initiation in mouse embryonic ovaries. Here we report that, on an inbred C 57 BL/ 6 genetic background, the same factor is also required for meiotic initiation in germ cells of juvenile mouse testes. In juvenile C 57 BL/ 6 males lacking Stra 8 gene function, the early mitotic development of germ cells appears to be undisturbed. However, these cells then fail to undergo the morphological changes that define meiotic prophase, and they do not display the molecular hallmarks of meiotic chromosome cohesion, synapsis and recombination. We conclude that, in mice, Stra 8 regulates meiotic initiation in both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Taken together with previous observations, our present findings indicate that, in both the male and female <b>germ</b> <b>lines,</b> meiosis is initiated through retinoic acid induction of Stra 8...|$|R
40|$|There are {{at least}} four {{conceivable}} factors which could {{be responsible for the}} maintenance of anisogamous sex: (1) long-term group selection, (2) short-term ecological, natural selection, (3) trade-offs between female sexual fertility and parthenogenetic fertility and (4) female dependence on a male gametic contribution. There is evidence for the action of each of the first three factors, while the fourth seems to be evolutionarily impossible, at first sight. But selection on male and female gamete production physiology could, in principle, produce female <b>germ</b> <b>lines</b> which depend on male gametes for their perpetuation. There is circumstantial evidence that this has in fact occurred in the Mammalia, and critical experiments to test this hypothesis are proposed. 1...|$|R
25|$|The human Y {{chromosome}} {{is particularly}} exposed to high mutation rates {{due to the}} environment in which it is housed. The Y chromosome is passed exclusively through sperm, which undergo multiple cell divisions during gametogenesis. Each cellular division provides further opportunity to accumulate base pair mutations. Additionally, sperm are stored in the highly oxidative environment of the testis, which encourages further mutation. These two conditions combined put the Y chromosome at a greater risk of mutation {{than the rest of the}} genome. The increased mutation risk for the Y chromosome is reported by Graves as a factor 4.8. However, her original reference obtains this number for the relative mutation rates in male and female <b>germ</b> <b>lines</b> for the lineage leading to humans.|$|R
25|$|Genetic {{disorders}} may be hereditary, {{passed down}} from the parents' genes. In other genetic disorders, defects {{may be caused by}} new mutations or changes to the DNA. In such cases, the defect will only be passed down if it occurs in the <b>germ</b> <b>line.</b> The same disease, such as some forms of cancer, may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people, by new mutations in other people, and mainly by environmental causes in other people. Whether, when and to what extent a person with the genetic defect or abnormality will actually suffer from the disease is almost always affected by the environmental factors and events in the person's development.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetics {{describes}} {{a variety of}} features {{of the human genome}} that transcend its primary DNA sequence, such as chromatin packaging, histone modifications and DNA methylation, and which are important in regulating gene expression, genome replication and other cellular processes. Epigenetic markers strengthen and weaken transcription of certain genes but do not affect the actual sequence of DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation is a major form of epigenetic control over gene expression {{and one of the most}} highly studied topics in epigenetics. During development, the human DNA methylation profile experiences dramatic changes. In early <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> cells, the genome has very low methylation levels. These low levels generally describe active genes. As development progresses, parental imprinting tags lead to increased methylation activity.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Evans and Kaufman {{published}} {{results for}} experiments {{in which they}} described how they isolated embryonic stem cells from mouse blastocysts and grew them in cell cultures.

He then genetically modified it and implanted it into adult female mice {{with the intent of}} creating genetically modified offspring, the forbearers of the laboratory mice that are considered so vital to medical research today. The availability of these cultured stem cells eventually made possible the introduction of specific gene alterations into the <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> of mice and the creation of transgenic mice to use as experimental models for human illnesses.|$|E
40|$|Natural environments are {{considerably}} more variable than laboratory settings and often involve transient exposure to stressful conditions. To fully understand how organisms {{have evolved to}} respond to any given stress, prior experience must therefore be considered. We investigated the effects of individual and ancestral experience on C. elegans reproduction. We documented ways in which cultivation at 15 °C or 25 °C affects developmental time, lifetime fecundity, and reproductive performance after severe heat stress that exceeds the fertile range of the organism but is compatible with survival and future fecundity. We found that experience modulates multiple aspects of reproductive physiology, including {{the male and female}} <b>germ</b> <b>lines</b> and the interaction between them.

40|$|Apoptosis is a {{critical}} process for regulating both the size {{and the quality of}} the male and female <b>germ</b> <b>lines.</b> In this review, we examine the importance of this process during embryonic development in establishing the pool of spermatogonial stem cells and primordial follicles that will ultimately define male and female fertility. We also consider the importance of apoptosis in controlling the number and quality of germ cells that eventually determine reproductive success. The biochemical details of the apoptotic process as it affects germ cells in the mature gonad still await resolution, as do the stimuli that persuade these cells to commit to a pathway that leads to cell death. Our ability to understand and ultimately control the reproductive potential of male and female mammals depends upon a deeper understanding of these fundamental processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{through which}} pristane or mineral oil can induce plasmacytomas in BALB/c or NZB mice {{are not fully}} understood, but involvement of interleukin 6 (IL- 6), a growth factor for plasmacytomas and myelomas, has been strongly suggested. To clarify the role of IL- 6 in plasmacytomagenesis, a human IL- 6 cDNA was introduced into mouse <b>germ</b> <b>lines</b> under the transcriptional control of the murine major histocompatibility complex class I (H- 2 Ld) promoter. IL- 6 transgenic mice of C 57 BL/ 6 origin developed a massive plasmacytosis but not plasmacytomas. However, introduction of BALB/c genetic background into IL- 6 transgenic mice could generate monoclonal transplantable plasmacytomas with the chromosomal translocation t(12; 15). These results provide firm evidence of the critical role of IL- 6 in the plasmacytoma development...|$|R
25|$|Members of the Argonaute (Ago) protein {{family are}} central to RISC function. Argonautes are needed for miRNA-induced {{silencing}} and contain two conserved RNA binding domains: a PAZ domain that can bind the single stranded 3' end of the mature miRNA and a PIWI domain that structurally resembles ribonuclease-H and functions {{to interact with the}} 5' end of the guide strand. They bind the mature miRNA and orient it for interaction with a target mRNA. Some argonautes, for example human Ago2, cleave target transcripts directly; argonautes may also recruit additional proteins to achieve translational repression. The human genome encodes eight argonaute proteins divided by sequence similarities into two families: AGO (with four members present in all mammalian cells and called E1F2C/hAgo in humans), and PIWI (found in the <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> and hematopoietic stem cells).|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that because snowball Earth would {{undoubtedly}} have decimated the population size of any given species, the extremely small populations that resulted would all have been descended from a small number of individuals (see founder effect), and consequently the average relatedness between any two individuals (in this case individual cells) would have been exceptionally high as a result of glaciations. Altruism is known to increase from rarity when relatedness (R) exceeds the ratio of the cost (C) to the altruist (in this case, the cell giving up its own reproduction by differentiating), to the benefit (B) to the recipient of altruism (the <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> of the colony, that reproduces {{as a result of the}} differentiation), i.e. R > C/B (see Hamilton's rule). The evolutionary pressure of the high relatedness in the context of a post-glaciation population boom may have been sufficient to overcome the reproductive cost of forming a complex animal, for the first time in Earth's history.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{stem cells}} {{are not able to}} proliferate and {{differentiate}} as effectively in vitro as they are able to in vivo. Adult stem cells can come from many different tissue locations, {{but it is difficult to}} isolate them because they are defined by behavior and not surface markers. A method has yet to be developed for clearly distinguishing between stem cells and the differentiated cells surrounding them. However, surface markers can still be used to a certain extent to remove most of the unwanted differentiated cells. Stem cell plasticity is the ability to differentiate across embryonic <b>germ</b> <b>line</b> boundaries. Though, the presence of plasticity has been hotly contested. Some claim that plasticity is caused by heterogeneity among the cells or cell fusion events. Currently, cells can be differentiated across cell lines with yields ranging from 10% to 90% depending on techniques used. More studies need to be done in order to standardize the yield with transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiation of multipotent stem cells is a potential means for obtaining stem cells that are not available or not easily obtained in the adult.|$|E

Female Drosophila yakuba and D. teissieri germ cells in a D. melanogaster ovary produced functional oocytes that, when fertilized by D. melanogaster sperm, gave rise to sterile yakuba-melanogaster and teissieri-melanogaster male and female hybrids. However, the erecta-melanogaster and orena-melanogaster hybrids were lethal, since female D. erecta and D. orena germ cells in a D. melanogaster ovary failed to form oocytes with the capacity to develop normally.
