5000|$|A dipole speaker {{works by}} {{creating}} air movement (as sound pressure waves) {{directly from the}} front and back surfaces of the driver, rather than by impedance matching one or both outputs to the air. As a result, diaphragm motion is constrained primarily by the driver's restoring force (e.g., <b>diaphragm</b> <b>suspension)</b> and not by acoustic loading from an enclosure. This implies that cone motion will be larger at the same output level than in a more usual enclosure, and that power handling will be accordingly limited. Especially at lower frequencies, dipole drivers tend to be large and flat, and necessarily open at both front and back. Common examples include electrostatic or ribbon drivers, though a conventional cone driver mounted in an open baffle also works as a dipole loudspeaker. All of these variations are characterised by a [...] "figure-of-eight" [...] radiation pattern in which the loudness falls towards the sides of the enclosure where interference between front and back waves is maximized. Sometimes the enclosure is modified into an [...] "H-frame" [...] with the driver located on a wall dividing two open compartments. Such enclosures require some control over the radiated sound {{from the rear of the}} enclosure to achieve the desired response. This is usually done by mounting two drivers, one over the other, in a push-pull configuration.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative device for self-aligning in a V-groove and a self-latching vertical {{mirror on the}} <b>suspension</b> <b>diaphragm</b> using the out of plane fiber-optical switch array technique. The self-aligning offers integrating the optical fiber and mirror within the same optical switch. The self-latching vertical mirror is supported on the <b>suspension</b> <b>diaphragm</b> by four cantilever beams. The theoretical analysis includes a dynamic simulation using the ANSYS software and corner compensation using the IntelliCAD software. The fabrication process consists of wet etching micromachining, lithography, and excimer laser ablation. This proposed process is simpler than those proposed in other works. An electrostatic driving voltage is used to operate the optical switch. The mirror is made of a photoresist coating with gold film as the switching element. The reflectivity of the gold film mirror is higher than 85 % using a wavelength of 1310 nm. The micro-optical switch has a maximum displacement of 48 mum and the switching time is below 0. 4 ms with a driving voltage of 100 VDC...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} a novel {{concept of a}} coupling platform integrated with an out-of-plane optical switch and micro-ball lens array. The micro-ball lens array is batch-fabricated with the micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) technique and batch-assembled onto the platform. The out-of-plane optical switch consists of a self-latching vertical mirror on a <b>suspension</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> It can reduce the large motion space required for in-plane optical switches. The optical platform design enables control of {{the distance between the}} fiber, micro-ball lens and out-of-plane optical switch and increases their coupling efficiency. An electrostatic driving voltage is used to actuate the optical switch. Not only does this fabrication process provide an accurate coupling distance, it also reduces the micro-assembly cost...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a high power electromagnetic microactuator fabrication method that combines the hard magnetic Fe/Pt process, Ni/Fe permalloy magnetic circuit design, bulk micromachining, and excimer laser ablation. The hard magnetic material Fe/Pt is deposited under low temperature less than 300 â—¦C by sputter onto a <b>suspension</b> <b>diaphragm</b> {{to produce a}} perpendicular magnetic anisotropic field. The magnetic circuit with closed loop design is applied to concentrate the magnetic flux and increase the magnetic force. The magnetic field induced by the planar coil and Ni/Fe permalloy enhances the interaction with Fe/Pt to induce attractive and repulsive displacement, provide a large output force, and operate at high frequency. This high power electromagnetic microactuator is demonstrated with minimum dimensions with a magnetic force two times greater than conventional magnetic micro-actuators. 1...|$|R
2500|$|Its {{construction}} {{was that of}} a triple-sized modern telephone. The hollow ear piece was made in such a form to focus the sound waves direct to the operator's ear. A thin metal diaphragm was secured to the opposite end, a pair of magnets with a pivoted armature was secured to the frame of the armature, and connected with the diaphragm by means of a strut, thus keeping the armature from contracting poles of the magnets, which were energized by a battery current. When the current was closed, the armature held the <b>diaphragm</b> in magnetic <b>suspension.</b> The slightest change in the current manifested upon the diaphragm and upon all those on the same line. It was decided best to move everything in connection with developing and manufacturing this project to House's shop in Bridgeport, [...] also taking Royal House (who was then over 70 years old) and his wife with them.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the 3 D {{finite element model}} of the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Suspension Bridge located In Istanbul, Turkey. All the towers and the deck are modeled with four node thin shell finite elements with the inclusion of internal <b>diaphragms.</b> The main <b>suspension</b> cable, the back-stay cable, and the hanger cables are modeled with two node beam finite elements. An initial nonlinear static analysis utilizing the geometric stiffness is performed {{in order to obtain}} the correct pre-stressing forces in the cables. An eigenvalue analysis of the bridge is performed once a converged solution is obtained by the non-linear static analysis. The results of the eigenvalue analysis are compared with the available ambient vibration test measurements and the results of the finite element model of the bridge with only beam elements. The results show that the 3 D numerical model utilizing thin shell finite elements can accurately represent the modal periods of the suspension bridge...|$|R
