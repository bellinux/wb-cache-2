40|$|Abstract Background Adiponectin has insulin-sensitizing and anti-atherosclerotic effects, partly {{mediated}} {{through its}} action on monocytes. We aimed to determine adiponectin levels and expression of its receptors (AdipoR 1 and AdipoR 2) in peripheral monocytes from overweight and obese patients with {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD). Methods Fifty-five overweight/obese patients, suspected for CAD, underwent coronary angiography: 31 were classified as CAD patients (stenosis ≥ 50 % {{in at least one}} main vessel) and 24 as nonCAD. Quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry were used for determining mRNA and protein surface expression of adiponectin receptors in peripheral monocytes. A high sensitivity multiplex assay (xMAP technology) was used for the determination of plasma adiponectin and interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) secreted levels. Results Plasma adiponectin levels were decreased in CAD compared to nonCAD patients (10. 9 ± 3. 1 vs. 13. 8 ± 5. 8 μg/ml respectively, p = 0. 033). In multivariable analysis, Matsuda index was the sole independent determinant of adiponectin levels. AdipoR 1 and AdipoR 2 protein levels were decreased in monocytes from CAD compared to nonCAD patients (59. 5 ± 24. 9 vs. 80 ± 46 and 70. 7 ± 39 vs. 95. 6 ± 47. 8 Mean <b>Fluorescence</b> Intensity <b>Arbitrary</b> <b>Units</b> respectively, p Conclusions Overweight patients with CAD compared to those without CAD, had decreased plasma adiponectin levels, as well as decreased surface expression of adiponectin receptors in peripheral monocytes.

Fluorescence intensities reported in <b>arbitrary</b> <b>fluorescence</b> <b>units</b> (AFU) were correlated with standard five day Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD 5) values which were used as an indicator of the amount of biodegradable organic material present. Tryptophan-like fluorescence, which has been found to relate to the activity of the biological community, showed the strongest correlation with BOD 5. Fluorescence analysis of the tryptophan-like peak (excitation/ emission wavelength region 275 / 340 nm) is found to provide an accurate indication of the presence, and relative proportions of bioavailable organic material present (natural or anthropogenic). It therefore provides an insight relating to its oxygen depleting potential. Thus fluorescence spectroscopy is recommended as a portable or laboratory tool for the determination of the presence of biodegradable organic matter with intrinsic oxidising potential in natural waters. The novel application of eographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to the data illustrates that strong local relationships exist between the two parameters and that site specific character may be a strong factor in the strength of the tryptophan-like fluorescence/BOD 5 relationship...|$|R

To understand {{the basis of}} this abnormality, we examined the pattern of creatine kinase (CK) gene expression and the relative content of CK protein subunits in pig hearts with proximal left circumflex coronary artery ligation. At 2 months after infarct, both Northern and Western blot analyses were performed on left ventricular myocardium remote from the infarct zone in ligation animals (n = 8). Results were compared with data from the left ventricular myocardium from similar sized normal (control) pigs (n = 7). Steady-state levels of mitochondrial CK mRNA decreased 46 % in left ventricular remodeled (LVR) heart samples (93. 40 +/- 18. 60 <b>arbitrary</b> <b>units)</b> compared with controls (172. 85 +/- 37. 20 <b>arbitrary</b> <b>units),</b> whereas CK-M subunit mRNA levels remained unchanged between the control and LVR groups (319. 50 +/- 35. 25 and 352. 50 +/- 62. 18 <b>arbitrary</b> <b>units,</b> respectively). The mean control group CK-M protein subunits (2. 04 +/- 0. 31 <b>arbitrary</b> <b>units)</b> decreased 53 % (P < 0. 05) compared with the LVR group (0. 95 +/- 0. 25 <b>arbitrary</b> <b>units).</b> Similarly, the mean control group (n = 4) mitochondrial CK protein subunits (1. 12 +/- 0. 04 <b>arbitrary</b> <b>units)</b> decreased 30 % (P < 0. 05) compared with the LVR group (n = 4; 0. 79 +/- 0. 06 <b>arbitrary</b> <b>units).</b> Mean CK-B protein subunits in LVR pig hearts (0. 84 +/- 0. 23 <b>arbitrary</b> <b>units)</b> increased 77 % compared with control (0. 48 +/- 0. 05 <b>arbitrary</b> <b>units).</b> The total CK activity did not change significantly between control hearts at 164 +/- 11 IU/mg and LVR at 212 +/- 32 IU/mg.

As many essential proteins and most transcription factors are produced at a low copy number, analytical tools with superior sensitivity to enable the analysis of low abundance proteins in single cells are in high demand. β-galactosidase (β-gal) has been the standard cellular reporter for gene expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Here we report {{the development of a}} high-throughput method for the single-cell analysis of low copy number β-gal proteins using a laboratory-built high-sensitivity flow cytometer (HSFCM). Upon fluorescence staining with a fluorogenic substrate, quantitative measurements of the basal and near-basal expression of β-gal in single Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3) cells were demonstrated. Statistical distribution can be determined quickly by analyzing thousands of individual cells in 1 - 2. min, which reveals the heterogeneous expression pattern that is otherwise masked by the ensemble analysis. Combined with the quantitative fluorometric assay and the rapid bacterial enumeration by HSFCM, the β-gal expression distribution profile could be converted from <b>arbitrary</b> <b>fluorescence</b> <b>units</b> to protein copy numbers per cell.

All normal and MGUS and 21 / 29 (72. 4 %) MM BM had diploid modal DNA content and 8 / 29 (27. 6 %) MM BM had both diploid and hyperdiploid cell populations. In normal and MGUS BM, the level of the p 21 oncoprotein was low and uniform in all G 0 /G 1, S and G 2 cells (median <b>fluorescence</b> values in <b>arbitrary</b> <b>units</b> were 6. 1 and 7. 5, respectively). The level of p 21 was increased both in different aliquots of G 0 /G 1 cells and in the S and G 2 cells in diploid MM (median value for G 0 /G 1 cells was 20), and especially in MM with hyperdiploid clones (median value for hyperdiploid cells was 40. 5, P less than 0. 005 with respect to normal and MGUS BM and less than 0. 005 with respect to diploid MM BM). The p 21 expression was greater in patients with advanced (stage III) than in earlier MM (stages I + II) (P less than 0. 005), and it was directly related to the BMPC infiltration (r = 0. 7; P less than 0. 005). Since p 21 expression is greater in MM than in both normal and MGUS BM, Ha-ras could be involved in the malignant plasma cell transformation that distinguishes MM from MGUS...|$|R

The DNA microarray, composed of 18 DNA {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) amplicons printed on glass slides and arranged in 3 subarrays, was developed. These target DNA included 1 or multiple fragments of the outer membrane lipoprotein, apx toxin, capsular polysaccharide, and disulfide bound formation protein E (dsbE) -like genes of A. pleuropneumoniae. These arrayed target DNA retained their expceted hybridization properties.

Cy 3 -probes of A. pleuropneumoniae strains labeled with multiplex PCR were hybridized to the DNA microarray. A total of 51 different A. pleuropneumoniae strains representing serotype 1 to 12 reference strains and clinical isolates were detected and typed by the DNA microarray. Twelve reference serotypes produced 11 distinct target DNA hybridization patterns, and hybridization patterns of serotypes 1 (n = 7), 3 (n = 5), and 7 (n = 6) field isolates were identical to hybridization patterns of reference serotypes 1, 3, and 7, respectively.

The present effort aimed to generate fluorescent platelets in rats and assess their dynamics in a rat model of arterial injury. We generated CD 41 -ZsGreen 1 transgenic rats, in which green fluorescence protein ZsGreen 1 was expressed specifically in megakaryocytes and thus platelets. The transgenic rats exhibited normal hematological and biochemical values {{with the exception of}} body weight and erythroid parameters, which were slightly lower than those of wild-type rats. Platelet aggregation, induced by 20 μM ADP and 10 μg/ml collagen, and blood clotting times were not significantly different between transgenic and wild-type rats. Saphenous arteries of transgenic rats were injured with 10 % FeCl 3, and the formation of fluorescent thrombi was evaluated using confocal microscopy. FeCl 3 caused time-dependent increases in the mean fluorescence intensity of injured arteries of vehicle-treated rats. Prasugrel (3 mg/kg, p. o.), administered 2 h before FeCl 3, significantly inhibited fluorescence compared with vehicle-treated rats (4. 5 ± 0. 4 vs. 14. 9 ± 2. 4 <b>arbitrary</b> <b>fluorescence</b> <b>units</b> at 30 min, respectively, n = 8, P = 0. 0037).

40|$|Background] Scientific {{interest}} in Enterococcus faecalis has increased greatly over recent decades. Some strains {{are involved in}} food fermentation and offer health benefits, whereas others are vancomycin-resistant and cause infections {{that are difficult to}} treat. The limited availability of vectors able to express cloned genes efficiently in E. faecalis has hindered biotechnological studies on the bacterium’s regulatory and pathogenicity-related genes. The agmatine deiminase (AGDI) pathway of E. faecalis, involved in the conversion of agmatine into putrescine, is driven by a response inducer gene aguR. [Results] This study describes that the exposure to the induction factor (agmatine) results in the transcription of genes {{under the control of the}} aguB promoter, including the aguBDAC operon. A novel E. faecalis expression vector, named pAGEnt, combining the aguR inducer gene and the aguB promoter followed by a cloning site and a stop codon was constructed. pAGEnt was designed for the overexpression and purification of a protein fused to a 10 -amino-acid His-tag at the C-terminus. The use of GFP as a reporter of gene expression in E. faecalis revealed that under induction with 60 mM agmatine, <b>fluorescence</b> reached 40 <b>arbitrary</b> <b>units</b> compared to 0 in uninduced cells. [Conclusion] pAGEnt vector can be used for the overexpression of recombinant proteins under the induction of agmatine in E. faecalis, with a close correlation between agmatine concentration and fluorescence when GFP was used as reporter.

40|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors (GnRHR) mediate {{activation}} {{and nuclear}} translocation of the extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK) by phosphorylation on the TEY motif. This {{is necessary for}} GnRH to initiate transcriptional programmes controlling fertility, but mechanisms that govern ERK targeting are unclear. Using automated microscopy to explore ERK regulation in single cells, we find that GnRHR activation induces marked redistribution of ERK to the nucleus and that this effect can be uncoupled from the level of TEY phosphorylation of ERK. Thus, 5 min stimulation with 100 nM GnRH increased phospho-ERK levels (from 89 ± 34 to 555 ± 45 <b>arbitrary</b> <b>fluorescence</b> <b>units)</b> and increased the nuclear:cytoplasmic (N:C) ERK ratio (from 1. 36 ± 0. 06 to 2. 16 ± 0. 05) in the whole cell population, but it also significantly increased N:C ERK in cells binned according to phospho-ERK levels. This phosphorylation unattributable component of the ERK translocation response occurs at {{a broad range of}} GnRHR expression levels, in the presence of tyrosine phosphatase and protein synthesis inhibitors, and in ERK mutants unable to undergo catalytic activation. It also occurred in mutants incapable of binding the DEF (docking site for ERK, F/Y-X-F/Y-P) domains found in many ERK binding partners. It was however, reduced by MEK or PKC inhibition and by mutations preventing TEY phosphorylation or that abrogate ERK binding to D (docking) domain partners. We therefore show that TEY phosphorylation of ERK is necessary, but not sufficient for the full nuclear localization response. We further show that this "phosphorylation unattributable" component of GnRH-mediated ERK nuclear translocation requires both PKC activity and association with partner proteins via the D-domain...|$|R
