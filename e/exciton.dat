5|$|If {{appropriate}} {{electrical contacts}} {{are attached to}} a nanotube, electron-hole pairs (excitons) can be generated by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts. Subsequent <b>exciton</b> recombination results in electroluminescence (EL). Electroluminescent devices have been produced from single nanotubes and their macroscopic assemblies. Recombination appears to proceed via triplet-triplet annihilation giving distinct peaks corresponding to E11 and E22 transitions.|$|E
5|$|Semiconducting single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} emit near-infrared light upon photoexcitation, described interchangeably as fluorescence or photoluminescence (PL). The excitation of PL usually {{occurs as}} follows: an electron in a nanotube absorbs excitation light via S22 transition, creating an electron-hole pair (<b>exciton).</b> Both electron and hole rapidly relax (via phonon-assisted processes) from c2 to c1 and from v2 to v1 states, respectively. Then they recombine through a c1−v1 transition resulting in light emission.|$|E
5|$|ZnO has wide direct {{band gap}} (3.37 eV or 375nm at room temperature). Therefore, its most common {{potential}} applications are in laser diodes and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger <b>exciton</b> binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by wet chemical etching. Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. ZnO is the most promising candidate {{in the field of}} random lasers to produce an electronically pumped UV laser source.|$|E

40|$|Magneto‐optical data {{obtained}} from photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation measurements performed {{in the presence of}} applied magnetic fields were used to determine the diamagnetic shifts of free <b>excitons.</b> The samples studied were coupled InxGa 1 −xAs–GaAs quantum wells. In all cases the <b>excitons</b> associated with antisymmetric wave functions were found to have larger diamagnetic shifts than the <b>excitons</b> associated with symmetric wave functions. This suggests that the <b>excitons</b> associated with antisymmetric wave functions have a smaller binding energy than <b>excitons</b> associated with symmetric wave functions.

25|$|The {{active region}} of an organic device {{consists}} of two materials, one electron donor and one electron acceptor. When a photon is converted into an electron hole pair, typically in the donor material, the charges tend to remain bound {{in the form of}} an <b>exciton,</b> separating when the <b>exciton</b> diffuses to the donor-acceptor interface, unlike most other solar cell types. The short <b>exciton</b> diffusion lengths of most polymer systems tend to limit the efficiency of such devices. Nanostructured interfaces, sometimes in the form of bulk heterojunctions, can improve performance.|$|E
25|$|In a {{semiconductor}} heterostructure, {{where a small}} bandgap {{material is}} sandwiched between two layers of a larger bandgap material, the Stark effect can be dramatically enhanced by bound excitons. This is because the electron and hole which form the <b>exciton</b> are pulled in opposite directions by the applied electric field, but they remain confined in the smaller bandgap material, so the <b>exciton</b> is not merely pulled apart by the field. The quantum-confined Stark effect is widely used for semiconductor-based optical modulators, particularly for optical fiber communications.|$|E
25|$|As {{electrons}} and holes are fermions with half integer spin, an <b>exciton</b> may {{either be in}} a singlet state or a triplet state {{depending on how the}} spins of the electron and hole have been combined. Statistically three triplet excitons will be formed for each singlet <b>exciton.</b> Decay from triplet states (phosphorescence) is spin forbidden, increasing the timescale of the transition and limiting the internal efficiency of fluorescent devices. Phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes make use of spin–orbit interactions to facilitate intersystem crossing between singlet and triplet states, thus obtaining emission from both singlet and triplet states and improving the internal efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Quasi-equilibrium relaxational {{thermodynamics}} {{is developed}} to understand LA-phonon-assisted thermalization of Bose-Einstein distributed <b>excitons</b> in quantum wells. We study the quantum-statistical {{effects in the}} relaxational dynamics of the effective temperature of <b>excitons</b> T = T(t). When T {{is less than the}} degeneracy temperature T_ 0, well-developed Bose-Einstein statistics of quantum well <b>excitons</b> leads to nonexponential and density-dependent thermalization. At low bath temperatures T_b → 0 the thermalization of quantum-statistically degenerate <b>excitons</b> effectively slows down and T(t) ∝ 1 / t. We also analyze the optical decay of Bose-Einstein distributed <b>excitons</b> in perfect quantum wells and show how nonclassical statistics influences the effective lifetime τ_opt. In particular, τ_opt of a strongly degenerate gas of <b>excitons</b> is given by 2 τ_R, where τ_R is the intrinsic radiative lifetime of quasi-two-dimensional <b>excitons.</b> Kinetics of resonant photoluminescence of quantum well <b>excitons</b> during their thermalization is studied within the thermodynamic approach and taking into account Bose-Einstein statistics.

25|$|In {{almost all}} {{inorganic}} semiconductors, such as silicon, gallium arsenide, etc., {{there is very}} little interaction between electrons and holes (very small <b>exciton</b> binding energy), and therefore the optical and electronic bandgap are essentially identical, and the distinction between them is ignored. However, in some systems, including organic semiconductors and single-walled carbon nanotubes, the distinction may be significant.|$|E

25|$|Pope's group {{reported}} in 1965 {{that in the}} absence of an external electric field, the electroluminescence in anthracene crystals is caused by the recombination of a thermalized electron and hole, and that the conducting level of anthracene is higher in energy than the <b>exciton</b> energy level. Also in 1965, W. Helfrich and W. G. Schneider of the National Research Council in Canada produced double injection recombination electroluminescence for the first time in an anthracene single crystal using hole and electron injecting electrodes, the forerunner of modern double-injection devices. In the same year, Dow Chemical researchers patented a method of preparing electroluminescent cells using high-voltage (500–1500 V) AC-driven (100–3000Hz) electrically insulated one millimetre thin layers of a melted phosphor consisting of ground anthracene powder, tetracene, and graphite powder.

25|$|During operation, {{a voltage}} is applied across the OLED {{such that the}} anode is {{positive}} {{with respect to the}} cathode. Anodes are picked based upon the quality of their optical transparency, electrical conductivity, and chemical stability. A current of electrons flows through the device from cathode to anode, as electrons are injected into the LUMO of the organic layer at the cathode and withdrawn from the HOMO at the anode. This latter process may also be described as the injection of electron holes into the HOMO. Electrostatic forces bring the electrons and the holes towards each other and they recombine forming an <b>exciton,</b> a bound state of the electron and hole. This happens closer to the emissive layer, because in organic semiconductors holes are generally more mobile than electrons. The decay of this excited state results in a relaxation of the energy levels of the electron, accompanied by emission of radiation whose frequency is in the visible region. The frequency of this radiation depends on the band gap of the material, in this case the difference in energy between the HOMO and LUMO.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} many-body theory for Frenkel <b>excitons</b> which {{takes into account}} their {{composite}} nature exactly. Our approach is based on four commutators {{similar to the ones}} we previously proposed for Wannier <b>excitons.</b> They allow us to calculate any physical quantity dealing with N <b>excitons</b> in terms of ``Pauli scatterings'' for carrier exchange in the absence of carrier interaction and ``interaction scatterings'' for carrier interactions in the absence of carrier exchange. We show that Frenkel <b>excitons</b> have a novel ``transfer assisted exchange scattering'', specific to these <b>excitons.</b> It comes from indirect Coulomb processes between localized atomic states. These indirect processes, commonly called ``electron-hole exchange'' in the case of Wannier <b>excitons</b> and most often neglected, are crucial for Frenkel <b>excitons,</b> as they are the only ones responsible for the excitation transfer. We also show that {{in spite of the fact}} that Frenkel <b>excitons</b> are made of electrons and holes on the same atomic site, so that we could naively see them as elementary particles, they definitely are composite objects, their composite nature appearing through various properties, not always easy to guess. The present many-body theory for Frenkel <b>excitons</b> is thus going to appear as highly valuable to securely tackle their many-body physics, as in the case of nonlinear optical effects in organic semiconductors...|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{mentioned}} that a quantum well is basically a potential well that confines particles to move in two dimensions instead of three, forcing them to occupy a planar region. In coupled quantum wells there are two possible ways for electrons and holes to be bound into an exciton: indirect <b>exciton</b> and direct <b>exciton.</b> In indirect <b>exciton,</b> electrons and holes are in different quantum wells, in contrast with direct <b>exciton</b> where electrons and holes {{are located in the}} same well. In a case where the quantum wells are identical, both levels have a two-fold degeneracy. Direct <b>exciton</b> level is lower than the level of indirect <b>exciton</b> because of greater Coulomb interaction. Also, indirect <b>exciton</b> has an electric dipole momentum normal to coupled quantum well and thus a moving indirect <b>exciton</b> has an in-plane magnetic momentum perpendicular to its velocity. Any interactions of its electric dipole with normal electric field, lowers one of indirect <b>exciton</b> sub-levels and in sufficiently strong electric fields the moving indirect <b>exciton</b> becomes the ground excitonic level. Having in mind these procedures, one can select velocity to have an interaction between magnetic dipole and in-plane magnetic field. This displaces the minimum of the dispersion law away from the radiation zone. The importance of this, lies on the fact that electric and in-plane magnetic fields normal to coupled quantum wells, can control the dispersion of indirect <b>exciton.</b> Normal electric field is needed for tuning the transition: direct <b>exciton</b> --> indirect <b>exciton</b> + phonon into resonance and its magnitude can form a linear function with the magnitude of in-plane magnetic field. We note that the mathematical analysis of this scheme considers of longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonons instead of transverse acoustic (TA) phonons. This aims to more simple numerical estimations. Generally, the preference in transverse acoustic (TA) phonons is better because TA phonons have lower energy and the greater life-time than LA phonons. Therefore, their interaction with the electronic subsystem is weak. In addition, simpler quantitative evaluations require a pumping of direct <b>exciton</b> level performed by a laser irradiation.|$|E
