This Research was conducted in Sub District Purbalingga and Padamara, Purbalingga regency with respondent SMEs food processing. Analysis of the determination of marketing mix that includes product, price, advertising and distribution using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Sampling was purposive random sampling method with a population of 64 SMEs so drawn sample of 20 respondents. Result of the study showed the marketing mix priority which were: (1) advertising priority for the new <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> grease product with an ads that could attract the attention of consumers in order to made the consumers interested, tried, and bought the new <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> lubricating grease products. (2) Price priority for the new <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> grease products which was by determining the moderate prices to compete the competitors' prices while still maintained a high quality. (3) Product priority for new <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> grease product which was producing a qualified product which could withstand the wear of the engine, green colour of the product, a 350 g size packs with a rectangular shape packaging labels. (4) Distribution priority for the new <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> grease product which was a short distribution channels through mobile vendors so that the consumers were able to save costs, and got the product fast and easil...|$|R

In Exp. 1 during the experimental period (d 0 to 14), pigs fed plasma had increased ADG and ADFI compared to pigs fed the control diet. Pigs fed the irradiated AP 920, as well as source 1 and source 2 regular (nonirradiated) <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> plasma had increased ADG compared to the control diet. Furthermore, pigs fed irradiated AP 920, regular AP 820, regular and irradiated source 1 <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> and regular source 2 <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> animal plasma had improved ADFI compared to pigs fed the control diet. No differences in F/G were observed between treatments. No differences were detected between pigs fed diets that contained irradiated plasma compared to those fed it in the regular form. For the overall experiment (d 0 to 24), pigs fed irradiated AP 920 had a tendency for improved F/G compared to pigs fed the control diet. In Exp. 2 during the experimental period (d 0 to 14), pigs fed diets containing plasma had improved ADG and F/G compared to pigs fed the control diet. Pigs fed irradiated AP 820 <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> plasma had higher ADG compared to pigs fed regular AP 820. For the overall experiment (d 0 to 24), pigs fed diets containing irradiated AP 820 had increased ADG, final body weight, and ADFI compared to pigs fed regular AP 820. Since irradiation of <b>food</b> <b>grade</b> plasma (low initial bacteria) did not improve growth performance while irradiation of feed grade plasma (initially high bacteria) improved performance, the initial bacteria level of animal plasma appears to influence growth performance of nursery pigs...|$|R

50|$|<b>Food</b> <b>grade</b> {{mineral oil}} has an E number of E905a, {{although}} it is not approved in food products in the European Union, and incidental amounts in foods are carefully regulated.

Rubbing a small amount of mineral oil into a wooden kitchen item periodically will prevent absorption of food odors and ease cleaning, as well as maintain the integrity of the wood, which is otherwise subjected to repeated wetting and drying in the course of use. The oil fills small surface cracks that may otherwise harbor bacteria.|$|R
