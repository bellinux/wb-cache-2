50|$|Both the Type 93 and Type 100 {{consisted}} of a fuel unit, fuel hose, <b>and</b> <b>flame</b> <b>gun.</b> A modification {{in the design of}} the <b>flame</b> <b>gun</b> is the only difference between the two types.The fuel unit {{consisted of}} three 38 cm long, 15 cm diameter cylinders: two outer fuel cylinders and a central nitrogen pressure cylinder. The total fuel capacity was 12.3 liters. Fuel was a mixture of gasoline and tar. Pressure was controlled by a manually operated needle valve, one on the top of each of the two fuel cylinders. This tank assembly was fitted with straps to permit it to be carried on the operator's back like an infantry pack.|$|R
50|$|E1Designated as Experiment 1 in {{the fall}} of 1940, the initial model {{consisting}} of four main components: fuel storage system, compressed gas storage system, igniter, <b>and</b> <b>flame</b> <b>gun.</b> The E1 had a single fuel tank vertical cylinder with two compartments, an upper and lower compartment. The upper compartment contained pressurized nitrogen that pushed the five gallons of fuel oil in the lower compartment through the barrel <b>and</b> into the <b>flame</b> <b>gun.</b> The fuel system for the E1 consisted of either diesel oil, fuel oil, or blends of gasoline and oil. An igniter, consisting of a compressed hydrogen cylinder and battery, was attached to the <b>flame</b> <b>gun.</b> The <b>flame</b> <b>gun</b> had two triggers, dispense fuel and ignition of fuel as it exited the metal barrel.Weighing in at 70 pounds when filled, the E1 was capable of ranges from fourteen to twenty-one yards. Issues - engineer board tests identified that the fuel-compressed gas reservoir was impractical, prone position firing was difficult, and as the E1 was firing, gas pressure decreased in the upper compartment tank lowering gas pressure to push the fuel in the lower compartment through the <b>flame</b> <b>gun,</b> thereby reducing weapon range. Additional issues were identified with the dependability, weight, and maneuverability of the E1 flame thrower system. E1R1The E1 was redesigned by the Chemical Warfare Service and labeled Experiment 1 Revision 1 and was ready for testing in March 1941. The compressed nitrogen was separated away from the fuel reservoir, a feature carried forward in all subsequent models. Additional improvements included the <b>flame</b> <b>gun,</b> valves, <b>and</b> ignition system. The E1R1's filled weight was reduced to 57 pounds and was capable of sustaining 15 to 20 yards for 15 to 20 seconds; the E1R1 weighed 28 pounds when empty. Issues - Weight, easily damaged parts, and access to the control valves were identified during testing as being problematic. M1Test board results {{led to the development of}} the M1 production model, consisting of a heavier weight, the M1 was more rugged and had a longer range as standardized for production in March 1942. The M1 system made it to the South Pacific theater by the end of the year. M1A1The invention of napalm led to its evaluation as a flamethrowing agent. Gasoline and oil mixtures sprayed as it left the barrel of the <b>flame</b> <b>gun,</b> whereas napalm thickened fuel left the barrel in a compact stream capable of ricocheting off of and into openings and subsequently sticking to flat surfaces. Initial tests showed that the current M1 platform was incapable of providing the ideal range with napalm. The Chemical Warfare Service was asked to adapt the napalm fuel system to the M1 platform to avoid procurement issues, thus facilitating the development of the M1A1 platform. Modifications included the fuel system, pressure regulator, valves, <b>and</b> the <b>flame</b> <b>gun</b> to facilitate the higher pressures required to achieve ideal ranges with the napalm. The M1A1 was capable of reliably firing to distances fifty yards away versus the M1's ideal firing range of twenty yards.|$|R
40|$|WC- 12 %Co powder of 53 µm – 63 µm {{particle}} size were thermally sprayed by using {{high velocity oxygen fuel}} gun (HVOF) MicroJet <b>and</b> modified gas <b>flame</b> <b>gun</b> TopJet/ 2. Gas ratio during the spraying time was sistematically varied to define influence of spraying parameters {{on the quality}} of coatings. Adhesive strength test were carried out by pull-off the pin method using an original device. Surface morphology investigation of the WC- 12 %Co coatings, sprayed by the MicroJet <b>gun</b> <b>and</b> modified gas <b>flame</b> <b>gun</b> TopJet/ 2, showed that the increase of the fuel gas flow rate resulted in reduction of the surface roughness and porosity as well as improved sintering of the particles. Adhesive strength of the coatings sprayed by the MicroJet gun varies from 46. 5 MPa to 59. 7 MPa. Fuel gas flow rate increase resulted to sudden increase of the adhesive strength. The adhesive strength of coating sprayed by modified TopJet/ 2 gun was smaller...|$|R
40|$|Atomization is {{the most}} common method for {{producing}} powders from metal. There are three atomization methods in powder fabrication : water atomization, gas atomization, and centrifugal atomization. Atomization was being developed to increase powder quality and process productivity. A new atomization method is possible to find by using another energy resources. Oxy-acetylene can be used as an energy resource in atomization. In this research, powders are made by oxy-acetylene atomization method. Material in wire form is melted in oxy-acetylene flame, which has operating temperature around 3480 oC, and atomized to form a fine spray. The fine molten droplets rapidly solidify forming a powders. This research investigate the variation of wire diameter <b>and</b> <b>flame</b> <b>gun</b> attacking angle on atomization process efficiency and production rate. Wire material which used in this research is commercial steel wire with 0. 75 mm; 1. 25 mm; 1. 50 mm in diameter. <b>Flame</b> <b>gun</b> attacking angle is varied 25 o, 30 o, 35 o, 40 o, and 45 o. Result shows that oxy-acetylene atomization method can be used to produce metal powders. The characteristic of powders which produced by this  atomization method have spherical shape, 75 m – 90 m in size, oxidized, and carburized. The efficiency and production rate of the atomization process are around 12. 2 % and 0. 1429 gram/minute. This efficiency and production rate are influenced by wire diameter. Bigger wire diameter results higher efficiency, but lower production rate. For 1. 25 mm diameter of commercial wire steel, an optimum efficiency of atomization process, 15. 1 %,  are resulted by 30 o of <b>flame</b> <b>gun</b> attacking angle...|$|R

During the 1960s, the weapon was manufactured by the People's Republic of China. It was replaced in Soviet service by the single shot RPO and RPO-A Shmel incendiary rocket launchers in the 1980s.|$|R

The Camel Corps, hurrying along the shore, slipped past the fatal point of interception, and saw safety and the zeriba before them.|$|R
