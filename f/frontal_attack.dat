5|$|Ever {{since the}} victory against an Egyptian army at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the {{standard}} British tactic against an entrenched position was an approach march {{at night in}} close order to maintain cohesion, followed by deployment into open order within {{a few hundred yards}} of the objective and a <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> with the bayonet at first light. Methuen planned to bombard the Boer positions with artillery from 16:50 to 18:30 on 10 December. Following the barrage, the newly arrived Highland Brigade under Major General Wauchope was to make a night march that would position them to launch a <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> on the Boers at dawn the following day. Wauchope had argued for a flanking attack along the Modder River, but had been unable to convince his superior.|$|E
5|$|At about 10:30, Rybka {{launched}} a <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> across the Unac supported {{by at least}} one MG42 machine gun firing into the mouth of the cave. The Germans reached the base of the hill, fifty metres from the cave, but suffered severe casualties in the assault. They were also running low on water. Prior to this attack, Tito and around 20 staff had taken refuge in the cave.|$|E
5|$|On July 23 the 7th and 9th Regiments of the NK 3rd Division {{began their}} {{attack on the}} Yongdong {{defensive}} positions held by the 1st Cavalry Division. They made their first penetration southwest of Yongdong, establishing a roadblock behind the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, {{and at the same}} time other North Korean units heavily engaged the 1st Battalion northwest of Yongdong in <b>frontal</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E

50|$|After regrouping, Jean Andoche Junot's {{infantry}} {{gained the}} rear of the troops defending the flèches, but it was overthrown shortly after, and Ney's and Davout's <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks</b> were also parried.|$|R
50|$|Counter: The defender preempts {{the enemy}} attack, thus doing damage while {{protecting}} oneself from harm. However, {{if it fails}} the defender receives more damage. Can only be used against <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks</b> and costs 20 FP.|$|R
5|$|The Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiments {{advanced}} north along a Roman road, {{across a}} narrow plain between the Judean Hills to the west, but exposed to artillery {{fire on the}} eastern side across the Jordan River. The Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment's objective was to capture the Damieh crossing from the north east, while the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment's objectives were to make a <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> on El Makhruk, capture the headquarters of the Ottoman 53rd Division, and cut the Nablus road.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was a British success, {{and resulted in}} {{the withdrawal of the}} Continental Army to Harlem Heights, ceding control of New York City on {{the lower half of the}} island. However, General Washington established strong positions on Harlem Heights which he proved determined to defend in a fierce skirmish between the two armies the following day. General Howe, unwilling to risk a costly <b>frontal</b> <b>attack,</b> did not attempt to advance further up the island for another two months.|$|E
5|$|As the US Eighth Army stopped its {{advance on}} the {{afternoon}} of November 25, 1950, the PVA 13th Army commenced the Second Phase Campaign. A massive <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> was launched against the entire UN line from Yongsan-dong to Yongwon. To the west, the ROK 1st Infantry Division of the US I Corps was attacked by the PVA 66th Corps at Yongsan-dong. In the center, strong probing actions by the PVA 39th and 40th Corps were carried out against the US IX Corps at Ipsok and Kujang-dong. In the east, the PVA 38th and 42nd Corps broke through ROK II Corps' line at Tokchon and Yongwon. The Home-by-Christmas Offensive was completely stalled on the morning of November 26.|$|E
50|$|In January 1915, Treviño again {{held off}} {{a force of}} Villistas {{commanded}} by General Manuel Chao. Treviño is credited with constructing good defensive breastworks at El Ebano while Chao {{has been criticized for}} conducting unimaginative <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 3 July 1915 John Churchill {{reported}} “The 29th Div is down {{to small}} numbers now … These continual <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks</b> are terrible, and I fear the generals will be called butchers by the troops. HW already has that name with the 29th.” ...|$|R
25|$|The {{next several}} days saw the 9th engaged but not part {{of any of the}} costly <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks.</b> By the 12th Grant began the next set of {{movements}} that would bring the army to Petersburg. The 9th covered the XVIII Corps withdraw to White House and then Bermuda Hundred.|$|R
5|$|In {{planning}} its new offensive, the North Korean command decided {{any attempt}} to flank the UN force was impossible due to {{the support of the}} UN navy. Instead, they opted to use <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle. Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city. As part of this mission, the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu.|$|E
5|$|The ramparts of Le Quesnoy clearly made a <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> {{undesirable}} {{and artillery}} {{could not be}} used on the town, due to the presence of the civilian population. Instead, it was intended that under the cover of a smokescreen, the town be enveloped from the north and south, thereby encircling it. Two New Zealand brigades were to be involved; Hart's Rifle Brigade was tasked with the capture of the town, while the 1st Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier General Charles Melvill, was to push into the Mormal Forest. The division's flanks were held by the 62nd Division and the 37th Division, on the left and right respectively and these formations were to make corresponding movements forward.|$|E
5|$|During the {{previous}} night, the German and Ottoman force evacuated Katia and was moving towards Oghratina when Chauvel ordered the Anzac Mounted Division {{to continue the}} attack. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades and the 5th Mounted Brigade were ordered to capture Oghratina. Despite attempts by these two brigades to turn the enemy flank, {{they were forced to}} make a <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> on strongly entrenched rearguards in positions which favoured the defenders and which were supported by carefully positioned artillery. Meanwhile, the two infantry divisions moved to garrison Katia and Abu Hamra and Lawrence moved his headquarters forward from Kantara to Romani. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right advanced towards Badieh, but could only make small progress, against positions securely held by German and Ottoman forces.|$|E
50|$|By November, the British {{had at last}} {{assembled}} a large army on the frontier of the Punjab, under the Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Hugh Gough. Gough had been criticised for his unvarying <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks</b> during the First Anglo-Sikh War, which had led to heavy British casualties and some near disasters.|$|R
50|$|The Castilian vanguard {{consisted}} of harquebusiers and crossbowmen who mowed the attacking Guanche ranks with their projectiles. The Castilian pikemen and horsemen then attacked the Guanches who were fleeing the crossbow and harquebus fire. This first engagement lasted several hours, and {{consisted of}} continual <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks</b> by Bencomo's forces.|$|R
50|$|The {{next several}} days saw the 9th engaged but not part {{of any of the}} costly <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks.</b> By the 12th Grant began the next set of {{movements}} that would bring the army to Petersburg. The 9th covered the XVIII Corps withdraw to White House and then Bermuda Hundred.|$|R
5|$|The NK 3rd Division used {{essentially}} the same tactics it employed against the 24th Infantry Division at Taejon that it did against the 1st Cavalry Division at Yongdong. In both fights, the North Koreans opened with a direct <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> to hold the US division's elements in combat, and then {{the bulk of the}} North Korean force enveloped the American left flank and established strongly held roadblocks behind the front positions and forced the Americans in them to retreat from the untenable positions. The NK 3rd Division entered Yongdong the night of July 25. At least one North Korean unit was in the town by 20:00. The North Koreans expected a counterattack and immediately took up defensive positions at {{the eastern edge of the}} town. However, the US troops had withdrawn. The 1st Cavalry Division troops set up another delaying action around Hwanggan and hit the North Korean advance a second time in the Battle of Hwanggan several days later.|$|E
5|$|With {{the guerrillas}} {{requiring}} supplies, Koos de la Rey lead {{a force of}} 3,000 Boers against Brakfontein, on the Elands River in Western Transvaal. The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 Australians and 200 Rhodesians. The attack began on 4 August 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties. During the night the defenders dug in, enduring shelling and rifle fire. A relief force was stopped by the Boers, while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved. The siege lasted 11 days, during which more than 1,800 shells were fired into the post. After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders, and not prepared to risk a <b>frontal</b> <b>attack,</b> the Boers eventually retired. The Siege of Elands River {{was one of the}} major achievements of the Australians during the war, with the post finally relieved on 16 August.|$|E
5|$|Appointed Generalmajor (brigadier general) on 2 May 1796, Vukassovich soon {{fought in}} the Battle of Lodi on 10 May. At Lodi, he led a rear guard {{consisting}} of two battalions of the Carlstädter Grenz Infantry Regiment. After the Grenzers fell back to {{the east end of}} the bridge, they were employed in the first line of defense. Subjected to continual cannon fire and a <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> by skirmishers and a column of elite troops, the Austrians were defeated. Such was his notoriety that the French falsely claimed to have killed him during the fighting. He commanded a 2,400-man brigade at the Battle of Borghetto on 30 May and during the Siege of Mantua. When the siege was lifted on 1 August, he led 2,000 men from the garrison to reinforce the main army before the Battle of Castiglione. During the second attempt to relieve the Siege of Mantua, he joined Paul Davidovich's Tyrol Corps. He was badly injured in a fall the night before the Battle of Rovereto, which occurred on 4 September. Nevertheless, he led his brigade during the day's fighting. His troops bravely tried to stop Masséna's advance, but they were finally routed by superior numbers.|$|E
50|$|As a brigadier general, Fane {{commanded}} a brigade in Wellesley's army at the Battle of Vimeiro in August 1808. His brigade, {{which included the}} 1/50th West Kent, 5/60th Royal Americans, and four companies of the 2/95th Rifles Foot, took a key part in repelling the French <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks</b> on Vimeiro village.|$|R
50|$|<b>Frontal</b> <b>attacks</b> on the Japanese {{positions}} failed {{with heavy}} losses. On 29 February 1943, Lieutenant General Noel Irwin, {{the commander of}} Eastern Army, dismissed Major General Lloyd and took personal command of the division. Japanese reinforcements attacked the division's exposed left flank, overrunning several units and forcing the remainder to make a disorderly withdrawal.|$|R
50|$|Whether {{this was}} a {{conscious}} adaptation to circumstances or a blind urge on McClernand's part to gather more and more force {{is a matter of}} speculation. Although McClernand's men eventually drove the Confederates from the field in a series of <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks,</b> Port Gibson does not stand out as an example of effective offensive tactics.|$|R
5|$|As {{the raiders}} {{approached}} from the south, the advance elements formed a battle line {{and launched a}} <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> and an unsuccessful flanking movement against {{the east side of}} the Legion's works. Reinforcements and artillery soon arrived with the main body of Confederate troops, giving the attackers a strong numerical superiority. With the support of the artillery, a pincer movement caused the Legion to abandon their position to avoid being surrounded. A large part of the Legion were captured as they attempted to escape from the town, while Col. Jordon and others regrouped downtown. Confederates then seized the Legion's commissary supplies on the edge of town, and fired two warning shots into the downtown from their artillery, convincing Jordan that continued resistance was futile and leading him to surrender his force and Corydon. Although the short battle cost the cavalry twice as many casualties as the outnumbered militia units, the battle resulted in a Confederate victory, which enabled Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan to secure supplies and money before continuing his raid through Indiana and into Ohio. The delay, however, proved critical in helping the pursuing Union army overtake and later capture Morgan and his forces.|$|E
5|$|At the conference, {{in light}} of the little {{information}} available on Egyptian dispositions and intentions, and due to a shortage of infantry and artillery, the commanders agreed they could not relieve the surrounded strongpoints on the canal in the near future. There was a general consensus to attack Egyptian forces throwing them off balance, but disagreed on how to do so. Southern Command expected to have 640 tanks on Monday October 8, of which 530 tanks would be distributed among three divisions: 200 tanks under Adan, 180 under Sharon, and 150 under Mandler after part of his losses were replaced. Estimates put the number of Egyptian tanks at 400, when there were in fact 800 tanks across the canal by Sunday evening. In light of the apparent superiority, Gonen recommended a <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> at night with Adan's 162nd Division crossing to the west bank at El-Qantarah and Sharon's 143rd Division crossing into Suez City. Adan however, lacking infantry, urged a cautious approach until more reserves reached the front.|$|E
5|$|Beyond a wide gap of open plain {{which did}} not favour a <b>frontal</b> <b>attack,</b> and on the extreme right of the XXI Corps, the 54th (East Anglian) Division {{attacked}} northwards with the 7th Battalion, 1st Tirailleurs Algériens, 9th Battalion, 2nd Tirailleurs Algériens, 1st and 2nd Battalions Arméniens of the Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie ({{also known as the}} French contingent or the French detachment) on their right. This force secured the right flank, pivoting to cover the infantry divisions as they advanced towards Tulkarm and Tabsor. All objectives were won despite these British and French units fighting against the German Asia Corps (Eighth Army) also known as the Left Wing Group which included three German battalions from Pasha II. On their right the Battle of Nablus was being fought. Here the XX Corps' 10th and 53rd Divisions were supported by Corps Troops' 1/1st Worcester Yeomanry, the XCVII Brigade RGA, the 103rd Brigade RGA, the 39th Indian Mountain Battery, and the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Battery were opposed by the Seventh Army. This subsidiary battle began at 19:45 in the evening of 19 September after the Nairn Ridge was captured.|$|E
50|$|The trypilon {{was built}} {{in a way that}} limits <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks</b> on the city and such that the Dionysian walls limited {{line-of-sight}} {{to the right of the}} gate, as well as attacks with battering rams. The side towers and the fortificatios also limit the effectiveness of an attack. The gate is linked to a gallery which allows movement between ditch D and H.|$|R
50|$|With Tilly mortally wounded, {{the morale}} of the Imperial army quickly {{dissolved}} and the army withdrew before the arrival of the Swedish cavalry. Thus, Tilly's death possibly saved his army from annihilation. Nonetheless, both armies suffered considerable losses (3,000 on the Imperial side, 2,000 on the Swedish), mostly due to <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks</b> and counterattacks against fortified positions with strong natural defenses.|$|R
50|$|The {{game has}} {{several types of}} enemies, each with {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Some monsters are immune to <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks,</b> some are more vulnerable to fire and so on. Ten different bosses are to be fought too. Defeating a boss will give the player a key {{that is used to}} unlock doors to other boss areas. In-game saving is provided by giving player an encoded password.|$|R
5|$|In mid-1893, Cao Thang {{proposed}} a full-scale {{attack on the}} provincial seat of Nghệ An and the surrounding posts. The plan proposed to Phan included diversions {{to the south and}} the training of almost 2,000 men in conventional military tactics. Unconvinced of its viability, Phan reluctantly approved the plan. The troops were eager, but after overpowering several small posts en route, the main force was pinned down while attacking the French fort of No on September 9, 1893. Along with his brother, Cao Thang was mortally wounded while leading a risky <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> with 150 men, and the forces retreated in disarray. Phan regarded the loss of Cao Thang as a significant one, admitting as much in delivering the eulogy and funeral oration. According to the historian David Marr, there was evidence that Phan clearly realised the advantages and limitations of prolonged resistance. Although Phan had previously stated that he was not expecting ultimate success, the guerrilla leader thought {{that it was important to}} keep pressuring the French in order to demonstrate to the populace that there was an alternative to what he felt was a defeatist attitude from the Huế court.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{operation}} was to take Salla, and then to proceed eastward along the railway to capture Kandalaksha, and to cut the Murmansk Railway line which connected Murmansk with Russia. To accomplish this, the German-Finnish forces advanced in two main groups: one led by the XXXVI Corps in the north, and one by the Finnish III Corps in the south. For XXXVI Corps part, the 169th Division advanced in a three-pronged, <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> against the defense line along the Tenniö River. Further south the Finnish 6th Division attempted a flanking operation into the Soviet rear from Kuusamo. They had to advance through difficult terrain to the northeast and capture the towns of Alakurtti and Kayraly (Kairala). Finnish III Corps was placed {{under the command of}} Army High Command Norway for {{the operation}}. There they would meet up with the German divisions. Both divisions were supported by the 6th SS Mountain Division that advanced in the centre along the Salla – Kandalaksha road in a frontal assault against the defensive line.|$|E
5|$|In {{coordination}} with the Chinese assaults against Seoul {{in the western}} sector of the Third Phase Campaign, the North Koreans deployed the KPA II, III and V Corps—an estimated total of 61,500 soldiers—against the UN forces on the central front. The North Korean plan was a <b>frontal</b> <b>attack</b> at Wonju by Major General Pang Ho San's KPA V Corps, while Major General Ch'oe Hyon's KPA II Corps would infiltrate the US X Corps rear as guerrillas and block Route 29. The aim of the offensive was to push the US X Corps back {{in concert with the}} Chinese attacks on Seoul, thereby isolating the South Korean forces in the Taebaek Mountains. As part of the Chinese attacks against Seoul, the Chinese 42nd and 66th Corps were deployed near Chuncheon in support of the KPA V Corps during the opening phase of the battle. Meanwhile, the KPA III Corps would act as reinforcements for the KPA II and V Corps. However, like the South Koreans they were facing, the North Korean forces were also badly depleted and understrength. Although the North Koreans fielded more than 10 infantry divisions for the battle, most were only equivalent in strength to an infantry regiment. In contrast with the professional mechanized army that had existed {{at the start of the}} Korean War, the newly rebuilt North Korean formations were poorly trained and armed. Nevertheless, the start date of the Third Phase Campaign was set for New Year's Eve in order to take advantage of the full moon and the low alertness of the UN soldiers during the holiday.|$|E
25|$|The communists began human wave <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks</b> on the Royalists as the fog cleared. Close {{air support}} struck the PAVN, inflicting heavy casualties. With eight Royal Lao Air Force T-28 Trojans {{stationed}} nearby at Pakse, 88 tactical air strikes hit the communist forces that day, including 14 by one pilot. One attacking tank was also {{destroyed by the}} defenders' artillery. Nevertheless, the besieged Royalists were radioing for help.|$|R
50|$|By that time, the Taliban <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks</b> {{had failed}} with heavy loss, and their supply lines were being interdicted by D {{squadron}} HCR, who operated in Mobile Operations Groups in the desert. For a time, the insurgents {{were forced to}} fall back on long-distance strikes with mortars and rockets. On September 1, one such mortar attack killed Ranger Anare Draiva, and mortally wounded Corporal Paul Muirhead of the Royal Irish Regiment.|$|R
50|$|The British {{pressed on}} and were engaged by Smith's brigade and Barney's and Peters's guns. Thornton's light brigade made several <b>frontal</b> <b>attacks</b> over the creek, but were repulsed three times by {{artillery}} fire, and were counter-attacked by Barney's detachment. Thornton was badly wounded and his light infantry were driven back with heavy casualties. However, as the 1/44th threatened Smith's open left flank, Winder ordered Smith to retreat also.|$|R
