40|$|Radial load is {{of great}} {{significant}} influence on friction characteristic and fatigue life of rolling bearings. A frictional torque analysis {{was performed on the}} radially loaded SKF- 6205 deep-groove ball bearings. The frictional torque formula was proposed as the sum of the frictional torques caused by elastic hysteresis, elastic hydrodynamic lubrication, differential slip, spinning <b>friction</b> of <b>balls,</b> <b>friction</b> between the <b>balls</b> and the cage pockets, and friction between the cages and the guiding lands. The experiments were carried out with the bearing with lubrication and the other one without lubrication under different radial loads and rotational speeds. In order to avoid the frictional torque measurement errors caused by the unequal length of arms, a positiveâ€“negative test method is employed to test bearing frictional torque. The experimental results showed that the frictional torque caused by radial loads played a leading role in all the frictional torque components of the bearing. Ultimately, a special theoretical model of frictional torque for deep-groove ball bearings was verified through comparing with the experimental results and SKF torque model. A reasonable correlation exists between the experiment results and the theoretical model...|$|R
5000|$|A {{ball head}} {{utilizes}} a ball joint to allow movement of all axes of rotation {{from a single}} point. Some ball heads also have a separate panoramic rotation axis {{on the base of}} the head. The head has two main parts, the ball, which attaches to the camera and the socket, which attaches to the tripod. The camera is attached to the ball via quick release plate, or a simple UNC 1/4"-20 [...] screw. The socket is where the ball rotates in, and also contains the controls for locking the ball. The socket has a slot on the side, to allow the camera to be rotated to the portrait orientation. Ball heads come in varying styles of complexity. Some have only one control for both ball and pan lock. While others have individual controls for the ball, pan, and also ball <b>friction.</b> <b>Ball</b> heads are used when a free-flow movement of the camera is needed. They are also more stable and can hold heavier loads, than pan-tilt heads. However, ball heads have the disadvantage that only one control is available to allow or prevent movement of all axes of rotation, so if the camera is tilted on one axis, there may be a risk of tilting on the other axes as well. When a movement of one, or two axes or rotation is needed, a pan-tilt head is used.|$|E

Sockets are driven by being attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the square drive). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/2", 2-1/2" [...] and 3-1/2" [...] square drive sizes (a de facto international standard with no metric equivalents) along with some lesser used drivers such as 5/8" [...] square drive, and both #4 and #5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of square drive sizes provides {{for a wide variety of}} socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with o-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or <b>friction</b> <b>ball.</b> Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets.The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600 ft-lbs of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.|$|E

While designed to indent the pipe surface, {{it has been found}} that some balls skid instead which reduces the connection integrity. This work was aimed at finding important features which relate to rolling and skidding of precision balls on the surface of pipes. A skidded ball is associated with a failure and a rolled ball is associated with success. Experiments simulating the activation were performed and compared with analytical models. Several features such as <b>friction,</b> <b>ball</b> size, material hardness and surface finish were identified as important for understanding the transition of the ball from roll into skid. The results of the surface and subsurface analysis correlated well with the model output. Once the important features are verified, progress can be made to achieve production of more robust connectors (from successful activations) leading to better customer confidence in buying mechanical pipeline connector products. ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityFriction {{is defined}} as a force acting against the {{direction}} of motion and resulting in a dissipation of energy in an irreversible manner. The only frictionless motions in nature exist if particles or bodies move on a selected geodesic curve (a geodesic curve is a curve in which there are no forces acting on the particle) which does not give rise to a space dependent change of the field. Coulomb friction is independent from the speed of motion while viscous friction is proportional to the speed of motion. An instrument {{is defined as}} a device which transduces one physical quantity into another. Instruments may be classified into control - or measuring instruments. A better way to classify instruments is according to the physical qualities which are transduced. This thesis restricts itself to instruments in which a mechanical motion is present. An ideal instrument is defined as giving accurate and instantaneous readings. In such an instrument the directive force acting on the pointer should be proportional to the second time derivative of the quantity to be measured. Such an instrument has cumulative errors and is therefore impractical. The practical instrument requires a restoring force when the pointer is off the desired point. Such a restoring force causes vibrations of the pointer. Therefore, it is necessary to add a dampening force. The ideal dampener would bring the pointer to rest on the desired point in a minimum time. It would require a complicated computer. In practical instruments a dampener using viscous friction is used. The optimum value of the viscous dampener depends on the instrument error, which is caused by other effects. A formula relating optimum viscous dampening and instrument error is given. (See graph, Figure 5) The static errors of instruments caused by Coulomb friction are shown. The effect of Coulomb friction on gyro-gimbal suspension is discussed. Empirical facts about friction in bearings are collected. They are classified into the following categories: oil film separation, boundary layer lubrication, dry surfaces and ball or roller bearings. The effect of surface grain structure and grain direction on the sliding friction is demonstrated in practical examples. The mechanism of sliding friction with oil film separation is analyzed using hydrodynamic theory. The mechanism of air bearings is treated using thermodynamic theory. Oiling devices to avoid dry friction are described. A hypothesis for the mechanism of friction in surfaces with boundary layer lubrication is made, according to which such friction is caused by a vibration of the crystal-lattice. This hypothesis could be tested experimentally by X-ray diffraction or by artificially excited vibrations with magnetostriction oscillators which should effect the coefficient of friction. It is shown that the major part of rolling friction in bearings is caused by sliding friction. Designs for low <b>friction</b> <b>ball</b> and roller bearings are suggested. The effect of centrifugal force on high speed ball bearings is discussed. Instruments without bearings are described. The high sensitivity of optical and electrical instruments is pointed out.

Lack of sliding {{friction between the}} nut and screw lends itself to extended lifespan of the screw assembly (especially in no-backlash systems), reducing downtime for maintenance and parts replacement, while also decreasing demand for lubrication. This, combined with their overall performance benefits and reduced power requirements, may offset the initial costs of using ball screws.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the impact phenomena of a tennis ball striking a hard surface. Stroboscopic photography was used to collect the ball's impact images from seven angles of incidence, ranging from - 23 degrees to - 70 degrees with zero, top and back initial spin respectively. Through digitization, the image data were converted and calculated into the experimental parameters which were composed of the input/output of the translational and angular velocities, and into the system parameters which included the coefficient of restitution, coefficient of sliding <b>friction,</b> <b>ball's</b> dwell time, and ball's dwell distance. Mathematical models derived from both the differentiation and integration approach were developed to explore the impact phenomena. A - 23 degree angle of incidence for the data sets (zero spin, topspin, backspin) was selected to carry out the mathematical analysis using both experimental and system parameters. The results were: 1. The successive differentiation approach did not lend itself well to the investigation of tennis ball impact phenomena. 2. The successive integration approach based on the Damped Sin Pulse Model, could be used successfully to describe both the horizontal and vertical forces, velocities and positions of ball impact on a surface. 3. In the case of - 23 degree incident angle, the effect of top-spin will produce a high value for the coefficient of restitution, which provides the ball a chance to rebound higher. 4. The horizontal component velocity will influence a shallow angle impact with backspin ball on a surface to have a smaller sliding friction. 5. The findings of this study will provide the instructor of tennis skills with information to fully explain the effects of utilizing the racquet to impart spin to the tennis ball. 6.
