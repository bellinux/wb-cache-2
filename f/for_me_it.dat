He stated: [...] "I was really lucky because there's a real phonetic coherence of the episode that brought them all together on an emotional level. <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> was just a question that they dovetailed and didn't feel random and you understood why these three stories were all in the same show." ...|$|E
