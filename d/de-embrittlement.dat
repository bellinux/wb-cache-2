5000|$|If {{the metal}} {{has not yet}} started to crack, {{embrittlement}} can be reversed by removing the hydrogen source and causing the hydrogen within the metal to diffuse out through heat treatment. This <b>de-embrittlement</b> process, known as [...] "baking", is used to overcome the weaknesses of methods such as electroplating which introduce hydrogen to the metal, but is not always entirely effective. In the case of welding, often pre- and post-heating the metal is applied to allow the hydrogen to diffuse out before it can cause any damage. This is specifically done with high-strength steels and low alloy steels such as the chrome/molybdenum/vanadium alloys. Due to {{the time needed to}} re-combine hydrogen atoms into the hydrogen molecules, hydrogen cracking due to welding can occur over 24 hours after the welding operation is completed.|$|E
