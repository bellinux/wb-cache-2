Windle was usually regarded as the fittest and hardest-working member of the Australian swimming team. In retirement, Windle stayed in the United States for a few more years, working for Allis-Chalmers, an agricultural equipment corporation. He returned home after being transferred to the Australian division of the firm's operations. Windle was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1987 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1990.|$|E

[...] Elsewhere Asimov went on to further explain, [...] "Campbell championed far-out ideas... He pained very {{many of the men}} he had trained (including me) in doing so, but felt it was his duty to stir up the minds of his readers and force curiosity right out to the border lines. He began a series of editorials... in which he championed a social point of view that could {{sometimes}} be described as far right (he expressed sympathy for George Wallace in the 1968 national election, for instance). [...] There was bitter opposition to this from many (including me – <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> ever read a Campbell editorial and keep my temper)." ...|$|E

500|$|The Oak Bedroom is at {{the rear}} of the house, on the western side between King William Bedroom and the Great Room. The {{marriage}} of the first Earl Spencer and Margaret Georgiana took place in secret here on 20 December 1755, during a ball which was taking place at Althorp to celebrate John's 21st birthday. Georgiana later recalled, [...] "We both behaved very well, spoke distinctly and loudly but I trembled so much <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> stand". As of 1998 it was furnished with deep red wall paper, rug and chairs, with oak floors, bed and chairs. There are several portraits on the wall, one of them very large above the fireplace. The Spencer [...] "S" [...] features on the blue velvet bed cover, and above the king-sized bed and by the fireplace.|$|E
500|$|Some film {{scholars}} consider 1939 to be {{the high}} point of the golden age of Classical Hollywood, producing classics in many genres, including the Western. Warner Bros. produced Michael Curtiz's sprawling Technicolor adventure Dodge City, Flynn and deHavilland's first Western film. Set during the American Civil War, the film is about a Texas trailblazer who witnesses the brutal lawlessness of Dodge City, Kansas, and becomes sheriff to clean up the town. DeHavilland played Abbie Irving, whose initial hostility towards Flynn's character Wade Hatton is transformed by events, and the two fall in loveby now a proven formula for their on-screen relationships. Curtiz's action sequences, Sol Polito's cinematography, Max Steiner's expansive film score, and perhaps the [...] "definitive saloon brawl in movie history" [...] all contributed to the film's success. Variety described the film as [...] "a lusty western, packed with action". For deHavilland, playing yet one more supporting love interest in a limited role, Dodge City represented the emotional low point of her career to that point. She later said, [...] "I was in such a depressed state that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> remember my lines." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{their long}} {{national}} tour, the Music Machine {{returned to the}} studio to record their debut album, (Turn On) The Music Machine. Much to the disapproval of Bonniwell, his original material had to compete with dispensable cover versions of [...] "Cherry, Cherry", [...] "Taxman", [...] "See See Rider", and [...] "96 Tears", all chosen by their record label with an expectation that the well-known songs would increase record sales. One interpretation voluntarily selected by the band was a slow, moody, fuzz-laden arrangement of [...] "Hey Joe" [...] which bears a strong resemblance to Jimi Hendrix's later version. Bonniwell first heard the folk standard in 1962 at a club in Hermosa Beach, and was convinced the tune's tempo was too fast, as he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Wayfarers to record a slower version. He revisited the concept with altered lyrics after hearing Tim Rose's regionally successful rendition in early 1966. The throaty vocals, most evidently on [...] "Hey Joe", Bonniwell blames on recording [...] "the Turn On album after a 30-day tour. [...] Mark's fingers were literally bleeding. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>hardly</b> even speak, much less sing". Despite the album's shortcomings, (Turn On) The Music Machine managed to reach number 75 on the Billboard 200. On January 21, 1967, a song taken from the album, [...] "The People in Me", was issued as the group's second single but stalled at number 66 nationally after the band's management angered radio executives for initially making the song exclusively available to a rival station.|$|E
