40|$|Ecological {{agriculture}} is a developing sector in Romania, the farms’ profitability depending directly on their physical and economic size. Large ecological farms are fewer in this sector, {{but due to}} their size they succeed in dealing better with high investments costs and in managing more effectively the process of production, animal husbandry or crop cultivation. The methodology used in this paper {{is based on the}} data gathered from an agricultural business of 750 hectares {{in the southern part of}} Romania and includes calculations specific to economic-financial rate of return, starting from the company’s <b>economic</b> <b>outturn</b> <b>account.</b> The analysis performed and presented in this paper contributes to increasing the knowledge and importance of the information provided by this ecological farm’s economic-financial rate of return...|$|E

30|$|As an <b>outturn</b> <b>account,</b> budget balance (the {{difference}} between public budget expenditures and public budget revenues) can be positive (a surplus), null, or negative (a deficit). For both nonzero cbb, constraints exist. The positive one is capped by the society’s availability to finance other countries {{instead of using}} their own budget resources for internal needs. The negative one encounters {{the sensitivity of the}} potential lenders concerning the dimension of public debt (PD) compared with national output (pdg[*]=[*]PD/GDP). The existence of a ceiling for cbb (noted cbbr) seems therefore admissible.|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the issue of deferred tax. The theoretical part explains the nature and importance of deferred tax in the Czech legislation. It discusses every single method of calculation of deferred tax and the process of its accounting. The theoretical part contains examples to clarify the issue. The objective of the theoretical part is that a reader clearly understands the concept of deferred tax after they have read it. The practical part contains the analysis of deferred tax in the closing financial statements of particular accounting entities. The analysis {{deals with the}} height of deferred tax reported in the balance sheet and profit and loss account, and also its impact on disposable <b>economic</b> <b>outturn.</b> Furthermore, the titles leading to the formation of deferred tax are analysed in order to identify the most common and important title...|$|R
40|$|The {{cost of debt}} is {{referred}} to as the key factor determining profitability. It is a decisive factor in decision making of the management, especially in strategy development. The purpose of this paper is to establish the relationship between the volume of debt and the <b>economic</b> <b>outturn</b> of industrial enterprises. Using artificial neural networks, the relationship between interest costs and three profit categories is examined. Data of 5622 Czech processing enterprises in the years 2015 - 2017 are used. Multilayer perceptron neural networks and neural networks of basic radial functions are used for processing. A total of 10, 000 neural structures are generated for each cost-interest relationship and the corresponding profit, of which 5 are retained, showing the best results. The results indicate that in all cases of profit there is no dependence between the interest and the amount of profit generated. Profiting companies do not get debt cheaper than other businesses...|$|R

We assess the magnitude of the differences between budgetary and national accounts balance data and between the latter and a balance obtained with currently available data on a broad definition of public sector activity.

Excluding 2001, when {{the economy has been}} affected by the global economic slowdown, Ireland has in general consistently enjoyed favorable surprises in its public finances.

40|$|Fiscal Responsibility Laws (FRLs) {{appear to}} be more popular in middle-income {{countries}} than advanced countries, even though their success is limited. The reasons why few advanced countries have a FRL include: the existing legal framework for the budget system is adequate; supranational rules and political agreements in EU countries; failed attempts to include quantitative fiscal rules in laws; lack of consensus or interest in attaining the goals of FRL-type legislation; and lack of need for a law to regulate fiscal transparency, accountability and macro-fiscal stabilization. Without commitment to fiscal discipline, adoption of a FRL may not contribute to attaining fiscal consolidation goals.

This paper examines the experience of OECD countries in introducing such reforms and assesses whether the same reform strategy be applied to non-OECD countries. It examines how emerging economies should begin such reforms, and how they should be sequenced thereafter. Based on a thorough review of the technical assistance provided by the IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) to middle-income countries, this paper will be useful to policymakers and administrators in emerging economies who are contemplating such reforms.
