In addition, triangle tests were performed at different times during wine aging (among 1 and 9 months) to determine the sensory differences between wines with and without glutathione inactive <b>dry</b> <b>yeast</b> preparations. Descriptive sensory analysis with a trained panel was carried out when sensory differences in the triangle test were noticed.
