5|$|Lochner {{seems to}} <b>have</b> <b>prepared</b> on paper before {{approaching}} his underdrawings; {{there is little}} evidence of reworking, even when positioning large groups of figures. Infrared reflectography of the underdrawings for the Last Judgment panels show letters used to denote the final colour to be applied, for example g for gelb (yellow) or w for weiss (white), and there are few deviations in the finished work. He often rearranged drapery fold lines or to denote perspective, enlarged or diminished the size of figures. The underdrawings reveal a draughtsman of skill, dynamism and confidence; the figures appear fully formed with little evidence of reworking. Many are extremely detailed and precisely modelled, for example St Ursula's brooch in the Altarpiece of the City Patron Saints, which contains closely detailed garlands and diadems.|$|E
5|$|Piattoli, as Poniatowski's {{secretary}} and {{a resident of}} the Royal Castle in Warsaw, has been credited with winning the King over to the idea of social reforms and with playing a part in the drafting of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. The exact nature of Piattoli's role in regard to the Constitution remains uncertain; modern historians disagree to what degree he was an executor, a mediator, or an initiator. He played a role in convincing the King to collaborate with the leaders of the Patriotic Party on drafting a constitution. He might <b>have</b> <b>prepared</b> or expanded drafts of the document, based on discussions among the principal authors, including the King, Hugo Kołłątaj (another politically active Roman Catholic priest) and Ignacy Potocki. At a minimum, he seems to have helped catalyze the process. Historian Emanuel Rostworowski describes him as a vital secretary-editor, who certainly participated in related discussions and influenced both Potocki and the king, and calls Piattoli's quarters in the Royal Palace a “creche” of the constitution. Piattoli was, finally, involved in the final preparations for the vote that took place during the Sejm session on May 3.|$|E

5|$|Other {{scientists}} {{working for}} Davros, now {{aware of his}} plans, free the Doctor and give him enough time to rig the Dalek incubation room with explosives which would end {{the threat of the}} Daleks. As he is about to touch the two exposed wire ends to set them off, the Doctor questions if he has the right to make that decision and forgoes setting the explosions off. Just then, he learns that Davros has agreed to stop and allow the Kaled leaders to vote on the continuation of the project. As the leaders gather for this vote, the Doctor is able to recover the Time Ring and destroy the recordings he made, while learning that the Thals and Mutos <b>have</b> <b>prepared</b> the means to destroy the bunker. As the vote is called, Davros reveals this was all a decoy, giving the Daleks he sent to the Thal time to return to the bunker and exterminate the remaining Kaleds. Harry and Sarah escape the chaos, while the Doctor returns to set off the incubator room's explosives, but a Dalek inadvertently completes the circuit and sets it off itself. The Doctor escapes in time before the Thal and Mutos' bomb caves in the bunker, trapping Davros and the Daleks. Inside, Davros realises the Daleks have gained a will of their own, and attempts to stop the production line, but a Dalek incapacitates him.|$|E

25|$|The {{stone is}} a light grey and finely grained granite, and it is 2.30 m tall and 1.73 m wide. The runemaster {{does not appear to}} <b>have</b> <b>prepared</b> the surface much and so the surface is quite coarse, but still the runes are legible. It was made by the same runemaster as the Ingvar runestone U 439 and {{probably}} the Ingvar runestone U 661. It is the only Ingvar runestone that talks of the construction of a bridge. The excavation had established that the stone had been located beside a road, and there was once a creek at the location across which the bridge had passed. The reference to bridge-building in the runic text is fairly common in rune stones during this time period and are interpreted as Christian references related to the soul passing the bridge into the afterlife. At this time, the Catholic Church sponsored the building of roads and bridges through the use of indulgences in return for intercession for the soul. There are many examples of these bridge stones dated from the 11th century, including runic inscriptions Sö 101, U 489, and U 617.|$|E

25|$|Within a {{month of}} Baldwin's arrival, Marie left Constantinople for Western Europe, {{assuming}} they followed the instructions of Blanche of Castille, Marie's great-aunt, who had arranged for her visit and had given Baldwin 20,000 livres in exchange for two promises: not to sell his properties at Namur, and to send Marie to visit her within a month after his return to Constantinople. Baldwin is said to <b>have</b> <b>prepared</b> four armed ships to take Marie and her escort abroad. Marie arrived in Cyprus while Louis IX and the Crusaders were there, only {{to have a strong}} wind blow her ship free of its anchor, taking it and all its cargo to Acre, leaving Marie with only the clothes on her back and a cloak. The Crusaders there took care of her. Presumably soon after leaving Cyprus, Marie arrived in Negropont 30 January 1249, from where she reached France in May. According to the Chronique de Flandres, Marie stayed with her great-aunt until Blanche died in 1252, after which, it reports, Marie went to live in her husband's estates at Namur. For the next years Marie contested unsuccessfully with Henry of Luxembourg for control of those properties—which were the source of income for both Emperor and Empress—until her cession of these lands and castles 17 June 1258 to Margaret of Flanders. Despite this, the Castle of Namur refused to surrender to Henry of Luxembourg, the vassal of Margaret of Flanders, until St. Vincent's Day (21 January 1259). After this she had gone to the court of Castile where she successfully raised the money to ransom her son Peter, who was held hostage by bankers in Venice and who was released at some date between June 1258 and 1 May 1261.|$|E
