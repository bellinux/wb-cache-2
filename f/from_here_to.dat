5|$|After {{leaving the}} main line {{immediately}} south of Hellingly, the railway passed over gated level crossings at Park Road and New Road. Farm Siding, a single siding on {{the west of the}} line beyond the crossings, was a collection point for the farm's agricultural produce {{in the early years of}} the railway, but later fell out of use. The line climbed most of the way <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> the hospital at 1 in 50. About halfway between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House Siding, which served the hospital's Park House annexe.|$|E

5|$|On 20 October 2008, Thackeray {{was arrested}} in Ratnagiri after Mumbai police had {{received}} a non-bailable warrant issued by a Jamshedpur court against the MNS chief.

Irate supporters went on the rampage torching public transport and telling office goers to return home. Many shops and commercial establishments, especially those run or managed by non-Maharashtrians, chose not to open at all to avoid trouble.

5|$|The ACLU lost an {{important}} press censorship case when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher Samuel Roth for distributing adult magazines. As late as 1953, {{books such as}} Tropic of Cancer and <b>From</b> <b>Here</b> <b>to</b> Eternity were still banned. But public standards rapidly became more liberal though the 1960s, and obscenity was notoriously difficult to define, so by 1971 prosecutions for obscenity had halted.|$|E
5|$|The {{basis of}} the musical is the 1951 novel <b>From</b> <b>Here</b> <b>to</b> Eternity by James Jones. In 1941, Jones was serving with the US Army in Hawaii, {{at the time of}} Pearl Harbor, and the novel was loosely based on his {{experiences}} in the 27th Infantry Regiment. It focuses on the lives of a group of soldiers {{in the months leading up}} to the attack, in particular Private Prewiit, a boxer who no longer wants to fight having blinded an opponent, and Sergeant Milt Warden, who has an affair with the wife of his commanding officer.|$|E

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> Finch Avenue, {{the freeway}} follows the {{boundary}} line between Toronto and Mississauga. It encounters the third multi-level junction along its length, with Highway409, which {{provides access to}} the airport {{as well as the}} southbound to eastbound movement that cannot be performed at the interchange with Highway401 to the south. Highway427 continues straight north and narrows again to six lanes. After crossing the Kitchener GO line, it passes west of Woodbine Racetrack and beneath Rexdale Boulevard, Morning Star Drive, and Finch Avenue West, the first and last interchange with the route. The freeway bends slightly eastward, diverging from the Mississauga–Toronto boundary, and crosses the West Humber River where it drains from Claireville Reservoir. Approaching the fourth and final sprawling interchange, it crosses Steeles Avenue and enters Vaughan. It passes beneath Highway407 and crosses through an undeveloped area before terminating at its final interchange with Highway7. The mainline continues north as a four lane arterial road to Zenway Boulevard and is designated as York Regional Road99.|$|E
5|$|Sinatra {{forged a}} highly {{successful}} career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for <b>From</b> <b>Here</b> <b>to</b> Eternity, he starred in The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), and received critical acclaim for his performance in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). He appeared in various musicals such as On the Town (1949), Guys and Dolls (1955), High Society (1956), and Pal Joey (1957), winning another Golden Globe for the latter. Toward {{the end of his}} career, he became associated with playing detectives, including the title character in Tony Rome (1967). Sinatra would later receive the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, The Frank Sinatra Show began on ABC in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Sinatra was also heavily involved with politics from the mid-1940s, and actively campaigned for presidents such as Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, though before Kennedy's death Sinatra's alleged Mafia connections led to his being snubbed.|$|E

5|$|State Route 160 {{begins in}} eastern Antioch at SR 4. After two interchanges, the highway rises onto the two lane Antioch Bridge over the San Joaquin River. It cuts north across {{the center of}} Sherman Island, {{reaching}} the Sacramento River on the opposite shore. <b>From</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> Sacramento, SR 160 never strays far from the river, first following the east levee over the 1949 Three Mile Slough Bridge (a lift bridge), past Brannan Island State Recreation Area, and across SR 12 opposite the river from Rio Vista. After passing Isleton, the highway crosses the river on the Isleton Bridge, a bascule bridge built in 1923, and runs along the west shore on Grand Island, where it meets {{the east end of}} SR 220. The Walnut Grove Bridge carries County Route J11 east across the river to Walnut Grove, and, {{at the north end of}} the island, SR 160 crosses the 1924 Steamboat Slough Bridge onto Sutter Island and then the 1923 Paintersville Bridge across the Sacramento River to the mainland, both bascule bridges.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins at}} the Calexico East Border Station, which is open from 6 am to 10 pm, seven days a week. Just north of the border, the highway splits into two roads {{to pass through the}} customs checkpoints before the two roads merge back together; the fork to the west is for cars, and the fork to the east is for {{commercial}} vehicles. SR 7 takes the western fork, which passes over the other fork at the northern end and merges into that highway. <b>From</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> I-8, SR 7 is an expressway known as Orchard Road. Before reaching I-8, SR 7 travels north and has an at-grade intersection with SR 98 and a few other roads. At its northern end, SR 7 turns into County Route S32 (still Orchard Road) as it intersects with I-8. The entire route runs through the Sonoran Desert and is built to expressway standards.|$|E
5|$|The towpath {{continues}} to Rotherham Lock, where the Rotherham cut starts, but <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> Conisbrough, {{the only way}} to see the navigation is from a boat or from one of the bridges which cross it. To the north of the cut are the remains of the Greasbrough Canal, now culverted under the embankment of the A633 road. Eastwood lock marks the end of the Rotherham Cut, to be followed by Aldwarke Lock, {{in the shadow of the}} A6123 road bridge, and Kilnhurst flood lock, which marks the start of the Kilnhurst Cut. In Swinton, the stub of the Dearne and Dove Canal turns off to the left, and there are three more locks before the cut ends. Immediately following this, the River Dearne flows into the Don, and the towpath resumes, where the Dearne Way footpath ends.|$|E
