5|$|In Romain Gary's {{original}} novel, {{this was}} not the story that was told--the dog started to attack white people because a black man embittered by white racism deliberately retrained <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|David Childs, one of Silverstein's {{favorite}} architects, {{joined the}} project after Silverstein urged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> He developed a design proposal for One World Trade Center, initially collaborating with Daniel Libeskind. In May 2005, Childs revised the design to address security concerns. He is {{the architect of}} the tower, and is responsible for overseeing its day-to-day design and development.|$|E
5|$|On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates {{posted a}} video of himself on Facebook {{in which he is}} seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg {{challenged}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).|$|E
60|$|Tom <b>did</b> {{not return}} <b>to</b> Utah in the spring; his uncle {{strongly}} advised <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Panchen Lama, who was {{the abbot}} of Tashilhunpo Monastery, and Prince Lhazang, the younger brother of the Po Gyalpo Wangyal, persuaded <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R

5|$|State Democratic Party leaders accused Daniels and the Republicans {{of passing}} {{controversial}} legislation only to enhance Daniels' image {{so he could}} seek the presidency. Daniels, however, denied the charges, saying he would have enacted the same agenda years earlier had the then-Democratic majority permitted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|Westerman's brother, Jawann, {{walked onto}} the Rutgers {{football}} team as a wide receiver after Westerman encouraged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> His other brother, Jabar Westerman, was a first round draft pick of the BC Lions in the 2012 Canadian Football League college draft and is currently a starter at defensive end for the team.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kant≈ç earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bathalda will {{accompany}} you. I {{have already}} given <b>him</b> orders <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> He will {{bring down a}} message from you, when you know what course has been decided on." ...|$|R
5|$|This paper displeased Kronecker, and Cantor {{wanted to}} {{withdraw}} it; however, Dedekind persuaded <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> and Weierstrass supported its publication. Nevertheless, Cantor never again submitted anything to Crelle.|$|R
25|$|Blackadder {{also claims}} that Baldrick has never changed his trousers, and implores <b>him</b> never <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> for they are, Blackadder claims, akin to Pandora's Box, {{containing}} all {{the evils of}} the world.|$|R
5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt {{made it impossible for}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in all cases, {{and most of the time}} these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.|$|E
5|$|Hurley {{confesses to}} Libby {{that he has}} an eating disorder, and shows her a stash of Dharma food. Hurley expresses {{interest}} in getting rid of it, and she encourages <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Just after Hurley destroys his supplies, other survivors go into the jungle. Following them, Hurley and Libby see that an enormous package of food parachuted from the sky. After Hurley panics {{at the suggestion of}} again being in charge of the supplies, he sees Dave, and tries to follow him as he goes into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1949, Nixon {{embarked}} on a putatively nonpolitical speaking tour of Northern California, where he was less well known, to see if his candidacy would be well received if he ran. With many of his closest advisers urging <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> Nixon decided in early October to seek the Senate seat. He hired a professional campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, who had helped to run successful campaigns for both Governor Warren and Senator Knowland and had played a limited role in Nixon's first congressional race.|$|E
60|$|You can see by the story, {{that the}} London Company had set for Captain Newport {{a very great}} task when they {{commanded}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what <b>so</b> many people had failed in before him.|$|R
50|$|In September 2008, Carl Malamud of Public.Resource.Org made {{headlines}} by scanning safety and building codes of California, {{which have been}} copyrighted by the commission and did not give <b>him</b> license <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> on public.resource.org/bsc.ca.gov/.|$|R

5|$|In summer 2002, Gascoigne went {{on trial}} with American club D.C. United, but {{rejected}} a contract. In February 2003, {{he signed a}} nine-month contract with China League One club Gansu Tianma in both a playing and coaching role. Gascoigne scored in his first match in China, and in total scored two goals in four league games but his mental state meant {{that he had to}} return to America for treatment against drink and depression in April, and he never returned despite the club ordering <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Robbie Jones) {{is one of}} the Hellcats' {{bases and}} is an easy-going guy who has a love for action. He was once a star on the Lancer {{football}} team but quit when he discovered a scandal of players being paid by the college. He tried out for the Hellcats team when his then-girlfriend Alice encouraged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in order to gain scholarship money after the football scandal, and instantly became hooked. He has an instant attraction to Marti. They later start dating.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish {{commander}} Sulzbach made {{a tactical}} error in not attacking either Schack or Eberstein {{before they could}} join up, even though his generals urged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Instead, he chose to withdraw to Nyborg. The Swedish king was not pleased and immediately sent Gustaf Otto Stenbock to relieve Sulzback of his command. When Stenbock arrived he found the city's defenses wanting and sent a note to the king {{that he could not}} guarantee that he would hold the city.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} very hard in this. The match was to be broken off without any notice to him; and when he requested, at any rate, to hear this decision {{from the mouth of}} the only person competent to make it, he was told that it was indelicate for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> wish <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> This put his back up.|$|R
60|$|The bishop {{thought he}} would like to talk to those two {{ordination}} candidates, but they prevailed upon <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> He lay for the best part of one night confiding remarkable things to two imaginary ordination candidates.|$|R
60|$|This {{they had}} heard {{from some of the}} neighbours. Ned himself had not stirred out since he {{returned}} from the cloisters; for his aunt had implored <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> as it would only be running useless risk.|$|R
5|$|After the war, Beauregard was {{reluctant}} to seek amnesty as a former Confederate officer by publicly swearing an oath of loyalty, but both Lee and Johnston counseled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> which he did before the mayor of New Orleans on September 16, 1865. He {{was one of many}} Confederate officers issued a mass pardon by President Andrew Johnson on July 4, 1868. His final privilege as an American citizen, the right to run for public office, was restored when he petitioned the Congress for relief and the bill on his behalf was signed by President Grant on July 24, 1876.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe made clear to Ramsey that he wanted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E
5|$|Finally, she {{rebels and}} leaves, {{making her way}} into town. There she watches the act of another street entertainer, Il Matto ("The Fool"), a talented high wire artist and clown (Richard Basehart). When Zampan√≤ finds her there, he {{forcibly}} takes her back. They join a ragtag travelling circus where Il Matto already works. Il Matto teases the strongman at every opportunity, though he cannot explain what motivates <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> After Il Matto drenches Zampan√≤ with a pail of water, Zampan√≤ chases after his tormentor with his knife drawn. As a result, he is briefly jailed and both men are eventually fired from the travelling circus.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the other}} conspirators, John Plunkett and George Kelly were also arrested and were punished by being {{deprived}} of their estates. Lord North and Grey {{was known to be}} involved, but those who could have implicated <b>him</b> refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Morvan and Pilatus were a {{frequent}} target of rumours and allegations of on-stage lip-synching {{and not having}} sung on the album. Shaw told a reporter the truth about Milli Vanilli, but recanted after Farian paid <b>him</b> $150,000 <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> [...]|$|R
50|$|When Oswald {{attempts}} to pound someone, another guy tricks <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> and therefore uses {{the trick to}} pound and win that girl. In another attempt, Oswald manages to pound a lady <b>to</b> adoring <b>him,</b> only <b>to</b> find her unattractive.|$|R
5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than G√∂ring, who mainly adopted that {{attitude}} because party politics required <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But G√∂ring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish property {{as part of the}} Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Akira Toriyama {{had created}} the popular manga Dr. Slump; within roughly six months, he wanted to end the series but his {{publisher}} Shueisha would only allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> if he agreed to start another serial for them shortly after. He worked with his editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, on several one-shots but none were successful. Torishima then suggested that as Toriyama enjoyed kung fu films, he should create a kung fu sh≈çnen manga. This led to the two-part , published in the August and October 1983 issues of Fresh Jump. It follows a boy, adept at martial arts, who escorts a princess on a journey back to her home country. Dragon Boy was very well-received and evolved to become Dragon Ball.|$|E
5|$|Josip Broz Tito and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, then {{located in}} Zagreb, {{along with the}} Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia, sent a {{delegation}} to 4th Army headquarters in Bjelovar urging them to issue arms to workers to help defend Zagreb. Pavle Gregoriƒá, {{who was a member}} of both Central Committees, went to the headquarters twice, and was able to speak briefly with Nedeljkoviƒá, but could not convince <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> On the same day, Maƒçek, who had returned to Zagreb after briefly joining the post-Yugoslav coup d'√©tat government of Du≈°an Simoviƒá, agreed to send an emissary to the 108th Infantry Regiment urging them to obey their officers, but they did not respond to his appeal.|$|E
