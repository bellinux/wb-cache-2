25|$|In {{humans and}} other mammals, sucrose is {{broken down into}} its {{constituent}} monosaccharides, glucose and fructose, by sucrase or isomaltase glycoside hydrolases, which {{are located in the}} membrane of the microvilli lining the duodenum. The resulting glucose and fructose molecules are then rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream. In bacteria and some animals, sucrose is digested by the enzyme <b>invertase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{thought that}} succinic acid {{inverted}} sucrose. In 1860, Marcellin Berthelot isolated <b>invertase</b> {{and showed that}} succinic acid did not invert sucrose. Pasteur believed that fermentation was only due to living cells. Hans Buchner discovered that zymase catalyzed fermentation, showing that fermentation was catalyzed by enzymes within cells. Eduard Buchner also discovered that fermentation could take place outside living cells.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is {{obtained}} by fermentation using glucose produced from sugar from the hydrolysis of starch, {{in the presence}} of yeast and temperature of less than 37Â°C to produce ethanol. For instance, such a process might proceed by the conversion of sucrose by the enzyme <b>invertase</b> into glucose and fructose, then the conversion of glucose by the enzyme complex zymase into ethanol (and carbon dioxide).|$|E
30|$|In rice, eight neutral <b>invertases</b> (NINs), nine {{cell wall}} <b>invertases</b> (CWINs) and two vacuolar <b>invertases</b> (VINs) have been {{identified}} (Ji et al. 2005). Till date, CWINs {{have been found to}} play a primary role in assimilate partitioning, thus regulating the grain weight in crops including rice (Cheng et al. 1996; Hirose et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2008; Tang et al. 2017; Li et al. 2013). For example, two rice CWIN isogenes, OsCIN 1 and OsCIN 2, play a role in determination of sink strength by regulation of assimilate partitioning, where OsCIN 1 was found to play a role during the early grain filling stages, and OsCIN 2 in the regulation of grain size and weights (Hirose et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2008).|$|R
30|$|Cleavage of sucrose, a major photoassimilate in plants, {{plays an}} {{important}} role in carbon allocation, not only by osmotically controlling the flux, but also by generating hexose-based signals to regulate genes involved in carbon metabolism in the sink organs (Herbers and Sonnewald 1998; Smeekens 2000; Koch 2004). The enzymes that thus, catalyze sucrose cleavage are considered to be potential molecular contributors to sink strength (Herbers and Sonnewald 1998). One such class of enzymes are the <b>invertases</b> (EC 3.2. 1.26) that catalyze the irreversible cleavage of sucrose into glucose and fructose. Based on their sub-cellular localization, solubility and optimum pH of function, they are classified into insoluble acid (cell wall), soluble acid (vacuolar) and soluble neutral (cytosolic) <b>invertases.</b> The entry of sucrose into different utilization pathways is regulated by various isoforms of <b>invertases</b> (Sturm 1999).|$|R
50|$|Sucrose is a disaccharide, a {{molecule}} derived from two simple sugars (monosaccharides). In sucrose, the monosaccharide building blocks are fructose and glucose. The splitting of sucrose is a hydrolysis reaction. The hydrolysis can be induced simply by heating an aqueous solution of sucrose, but more commonly, catalysts {{are added to}} accelerate the conversion. The biological catalysts that are added are called sucrases (in animals) and <b>invertases</b> (in plants). Sucrases and <b>invertases</b> are types of glycoside hydrolase enzymes. Acid, such as lemon juice or cream of tartar, can also accelerate the conversion of sucrose to invert sugar.|$|R
25|$|Digestive enzyme {{supplements}} may {{significantly reduce}} the amount of flatulence caused by some components of foods not being digested by the body and thereby promoting the action of microbes in the small and large intestines. It has been suggested that alpha-galactosidase enzymes, which can digest certain complex sugars, are effective in reducing the volume and frequency of flatus. The enzymes alpha-galactosidase, lactase, amylase, lipase, protease, cellulase, glucoamylase, <b>invertase,</b> malt diastase, pectinase, and bromelain are available, either individually or in combination blends, in commercial products.|$|E
25|$|The glandular system {{contains}} four glands: the mandibular, maxillary, labial, and postpharyngeal glands. The postpharyngeal is {{well developed}} in the queen, while the other glands are larger in workers. The postpharyngeal gland functions as a vacuum to absorb fatty acids and triglycerides, {{as well as a}} gastric caecum. The functions of the other glands remain poorly understood. In one study discussing the enzymes of the digestion system of adult ants, lipase activity was found in the mandibular and labial glands, as well as <b>invertase</b> activity. The Dufour's gland found in the ant acts as a source of trail pheromones, although scientists believed the poison gland was the source of the queen pheromone. The neurohormone pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide is found in the ant that activates the biosynthesis of pheromones from the Dufour's gland. The spermatheca gland is found in queens, which functions in sperm maintenance. Males appear to lack these glands, but those associated with its head are morphologically similar to those found in workers, but these glands may act differently.|$|E

However, 1 % (w/v) (NH 4) (2) HPO 4 inhibited enzyme production around 80 %. The extracellular form was purified until electrophoretic homogeneity (10. 5 -fold with 33 % recovery) by DEAE-Fractogel and Sephacryl S- 200 chromatography.

40|$|Sucrose is {{the main}} form of assimilated carbon which is {{produced}} during photosynthesis and then transported from source to sink tissues via the phloem.

Furthermore, CWI, but not VI, was strongly protected against inhibition by sucrose.

2500|$|Leaving the hive, {{foraging}} bees collect sugar-rich flower nectar {{and return}} to the hive where they use their [...] "honey stomachs" [...] to ingest and regurgitate the nectar repeatedly until it is partially digested. Bee digestive enzymes â <b>invertase,</b> amylase, and diastase â along with gastric acid hydrolyze sucrose to a mixture of glucose and fructose. The bees work together as a group with the regurgitation and digestion for as long as 20 minutes until the product reaches storage quality. It is then placed in honeycomb cells left unsealed while still high in water content (about 20%) and natural yeasts, which, unchecked, would cause the sugars in the newly formed honey to ferment. The process continues as hive bees flutter their wings constantly to circulate air and evaporate water from the honey to a content around 18%, raising the sugar concentration, and preventing fermentation. The bees then cap the cells with wax to seal them. As removed from the hive by a beekeeper, honey has a long shelf life and will not ferment if properly sealed.|$|E

40|$|About 15 % of {{flowering}} plant species synthesize fructans. Fructans serve mainly as reserve carbohydrates and {{are subject to}} breakdown by plant fructan exohydrolases (FEHs), among which 1 -FEHs (inulinases) and 6 -FEHs (levanases) can be differentiated. This paper describes the unexpected finding that 6 -FEHs also occur in plants that do not synthesize fructans. The purification, characterization, cloning and functional analysis of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) 6 -FEH are described. Enzyme activity measurements during sugar beet development suggest a constitutive expression of the gene in sugar beet roots. Classical enzyme purification followed by in-gel trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry (quadruple-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF) MS) led to peptide sequence information used in subsequent RT-PCR based cloning. Levan-type fructans (beta- 2, 6) are the best substrates for the enzyme, while inulin-type fructans (beta- 2, 1) and sucrose are poorly or not degraded. Sugar beet 6 -FEH is more related to cell wall <b>invertases</b> than to vacuolar <b>invertases</b> and has a low iso-electric point (pI), clearly different from typical high pI cell wall <b>invertases.</b> Poor sequence homology to bacterial or fungal FEHs makes an endophytic origin highly unlikely. The functionality of the 6 -FEH cDNA was further demonstrated by heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris. As fructans are absent in sugar beet, the role of 6 -FEH in planta is not obvious. Like chitinases and beta-glucanases hydrolysing cell-surface components of fungal plant pathogens, a straightforward working hypothesis for further research might be that plant 6 -FEHs participate in hydrolysis (or prevent the formation) of levan-containing slime surrounding endophytic or phytopathogenic bacteria. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Invertases</b> cleave sucrose in glucose and fructose, using {{water as}} an acceptor. Fructosyltransferases {{catalyse}} {{the transfer of}} a fructosyl residue between sucrose and/or fructan molecules. Plant fructosyltransferases (FTs) evolved from vacuolar <b>invertases</b> by small mutational changes, leading to differences in substrate specificity. The S-type of enzymes (<b>invertases,</b> sucrose:sucrose 1 -fructosyltransferases or 1 -SSTs, and sucrose:fructan 6 -fructosyltransferases or 6 -SFTs) prefer sucrose as the donor substrate while F-type enzymes (fructan:fructan 1 -fructosyltransferases or 1 -FFTs and fructan:fructan 6 (G) -fructosyltransferases or 6 (G) -FFTs) preferentially use fructan as the donor substrate. Recently, a functional Asp/Arg or Asp/Lys couple in the Hypervariable Loop (HVL) was suggested to be essential to keep Asp in a favourable orientation for binding sucrose as the donor substrate in S-type enzymes. However, the F-type enzyme 1 -FFT of Triticum aestivum (Ta 1 -FFT) also contains the Asp/Arg couple in the HVL, although it prefers fructan as the donor substrate. In this paper, mutagenesis studies on Ta 1 -FFT are presented. In Ta 1 -SST, Tyr 282 (the Asp 281 homologue) seems to be essential in creating a tight H-bond Network (HBN) in which the Arg-residue of the Asp/Arg couple is held in a fixed position. This tight HBN is disrupted in Ta 1 -FFT, leading to a more flexible Arg-residue and a dysfunctional Asp/Arg couple. A single D 281 Y mutation in Ta 1 -FFT restored the tight HBN and introduced typical S-type characteristics. Conclusively, in wheat FTs Asp 281 (and its homologues) is involved in donor substrate specificity. status: publishe...|$|R
