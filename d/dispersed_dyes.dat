40|$|Abstract. The dyeing {{properties}} of the polylactic acid (PLA) fiber with four different disperse dyes was studied. In the disperse dyeing process, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis was applied to test and analyze the changes of the glass-transition and melting temperature of the dyed and pure PLA fiber. The results indicated that not only {{the structure of the}} <b>dispersed</b> <b>dyes</b> and the dyeing conditions affected the dyeing performance of PLA fiber, but also the degree of the crystallinity of PLA fiber contributed to the final dyeing results.

40|$|Substituted terthiophenes act as {{excellent}} chromophores for linear polarizers {{based on}} oriented polyethylene thin films. The dispersibility in the polymer matrix exerts a determining {{role on the}} optical performances. The modulation of the crystallization of the dye by attaching to the chromophoric moiety different linear or branched alkyl chains and by varying the polyethylene disordered phase (from UHMWPE to LLDPE) allows to obtain different extent of molecular dispersion. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray microanalysis help in determining the detailed morphology of the binary blend films. After uniaxial stretching, the films from molecularly <b>dispersed</b> <b>dyes</b> show excellent dichroic properties in absorption with dichroic ratios up to 60. On the contrary, the anisotropy in emission of the same films is lower than for the corresponding films from more aggregated dyes owing to the more effective depolarization phenomena...|$|E
40|$|Horseradish {{peroxidase}} (HRP) {{was introduced}} as a tracer protein in 1957 {{to study the}} role of “hyaline droplets” in the reabsorption of proteins by kidney cells [1]. The work on hyaline droplets was inspired by Jean Oliver who had made a detailed histologic investigation of these cell granules. Since {{the beginning of the}} century, it had been a matter of controversy among pathologists as to whether the “hyaline droplets” of kidney cells were signs of secretion, absorption, or of cellular degeneration [2]. Oliver concluded from his observations that the “droplets” function in the reabsorption and disposal of proteins [3 – 7]. Similar granules had been shown previously by Gerard and Cordier [8] and by Lambert [9] {{to be involved in the}} reabsorption of proteins in kidney cells of amphibians.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} of oligomeric <b>dispersed</b> <b>dyes</b> based on a-naphthol-formaldehyde (NF) oligomer by coupling of various diazonium salt to a-NF oligomer. a-NF oligomer was prepared by the condensation of a-naphthol with formaldehyde in presence of oxalic acid. To achieve suitable oligomer in the present study, several variables namely molar ratios of reactants, temperature, time and catalyst have been optimized in the synthesis. A series of oligomeric azo dyes have been prepared by coupling various diazonium salts of aromatic amines to a-NF oligomer. Their dyeing on polyester, nylon and wool resulted in attractive hues an fibres. In this study of oligomeric azo-NF dyes the dyeing of the fibres completed in short time and most important is that no patches were observed on the fibres, while earlier reported oligomeric dyes form patches on the fibre. They were characterized {{in terms of their}} softening points, yield, colour, solubility and UV-visible spectra.

These nonionic surfactants, obtained from natural substances, are 100 % biodegradable and very suitable for washing. They are highly soluble, only slightly sensitive to electrolytes and rarely influenced by water hardness. This paper analyses the behaviour of APG and linear alkyl sulfonate, separately and in mixtures of different proportions, {{in order to show}} how dyed polyester fabric changed colour during washing and how dye transfers to white textile items (diacetate, polyamide, cotton, acrylic and wool). Before this process, the polyester was <b>dyed</b> with <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes.</b> <b>Disperse</b> <b>dyes</b> can become deposited on white polyester fabric during washing due to various mechanical, chemical, electrical or adsorption-related causes.

40|$|Background: There are no data {{showing that}} <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes,</b> used to patch test patients, are {{currently}} being used for dyeing synthetic garments. It is unknown whether <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes,</b> which are currently routinely patch tested, are in fact present in synthetic textiles on the market. Objectives: To determine whether eight <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes,</b> hitherto most widely cited as allergenic, are still used in textiles that are sold in various countries. Methods: Textiles from 13 countries in Europe, Asia and the United States were analysed. The procedure used for dye identification was thin-layer chromatography.

Results: Of 121 analysed items, three showed positive results {{for some of the}} investigated <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes.</b> Four dyes in these items could be detected and confirmed by the use of high-performance liquid chromatography. A pair of light brown ladies' tights manufactured and purchased in Italy contained Disperse Yellow 3, Disperse Blue 124, and Disperse Blue 106, and a set of black bra and panties purchased in India contained Disperse Orange 1.

40|$|Over {{the course}} of time, the dyeing {{industry}} {{has become one of}} the greater polluters of water worldwide. The sheer volume of water and the high concentration of additives used in textile colouration are staggering, which have already caused unrepairable damage to environment and continue to directly impact on the sustainability of textile colouration industry. “Supercritical CO 2 dyeing” uses supercritical CO 2 as the dyeing medium, enabling the reduction and even elimination of the creation of textile colouration wastewater. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) has a low critical point and is non-flammable. It can be recycled, providing a promising environmentally friendly substitute for aqueous media. Reactive <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes</b> that have both reactivity towards natural fabrics and high solubility in scCO 2 would offer great promise for colouring natural fabrics. In this study, the isocyanate group, as a reactive group, was introduced to <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes</b> to create reactive <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes</b> suitable for supercritical dyeing. Thus, a series of reactive <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes,</b> containing both isocyanate groups and alkyl groups were successfully synthesised.

A new synthesis route was developed to create an azo-based <b>disperse</b> reactive <b>dye</b> containing the vinyl sulphonyl reactive group, which was used to dye natural fibres using scCO 2 as the dyeing medium. Using relatively moderate, optimal conditions in the scCO 2 dyeing processes, uniform dyeing with high colour strength and fastness properties that were similar to those from conventional aqueous dyeing were achieved on natural fabrics that were dyed with the synthesised dyes. Furthermore, there are opportunities to modify a wide range of <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes</b> following this synthesis route. ...|$|R
