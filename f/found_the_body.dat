5|$|On 1 January 1776, the British started {{collecting}} {{bodies of}} the deceased and soon <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of a high-ranking officer of the American colonial army. After being brought to General Carleton, an American prisoner confirmed that the body was that of Richard Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, Pluto was discovered. After initial {{observations}} led to {{the belief}} it was larger than Earth, the object was immediately accepted as the ninth planet. Further monitoring <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> was actually much smaller: in 1936, Raymond Lyttleton suggested that Pluto may be an escaped satellite of Neptune, and Fred Whipple suggested in 1964 that Pluto may be a comet. As it was still larger than all known asteroids and seemingly did not exist within a larger population, it kept its status until 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Haraldskær Woman (or Haraldskjaer Woman) is a bog {{body of a}} woman found {{naturally}} {{preserved in}} a bog in Jutland, Denmark, and dating from about 490 BC (pre-Roman Iron Age). Workers <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in 1835 while excavating peat on the Haraldskær Estate. The anaerobic conditions and acids of the peat bog contributed to the body's excellent preservation. Not only was the intact skeleton found, but so were the skin and internal organs. Scientists settled disputes about the age and identity of this well preserved body in 1977, when radiocarbon dating determined conclusively that the woman's death occurred around the 5th century BC.|$|E
50|$|In {{subsequent}} investigations they, authorities <b>found</b> <b>the</b> mutilated <b>bodies</b> of Guerrero and Martinez, near a {{farm where}} the Solís siblings were arrested.

5|$|Cunningham still flew on operations. Flying the new Beaufighter II {{powered by}} Merlin engines on an {{interception}} in July, {{he was hit}} by return fire from a He 111. The engines spluttered and one caught fire. Already far out to sea he flew back to base, extinguished the fire and made a wheels-down landing. The following month he had greater success. On the night of the 22 August 1941 he intercepted two He 111s. One was claimed as damaged but the second was confirmed. The Heinkel He 111, an H-5 model, Werknummer 4081, coded F8+BS belonging to 8./Kampfgeschwader 40 (KG 40), fell into the sea north-west of Wells, Somerset at 22.05. Gefreiter G. Dohmen, H. Hädrich, and K. Dändel were never <b>found.</b> <b>The</b> <b>body</b> of Rudolf Faath was washed ashore at Burnham Overy on 31 August. On 1 September Cunningham caught and downed a Ju 88—his 15th victory. He was awarded a bar to his DFC on 19 September, by which time he was an acting wing commander.|$|E
5|$|Excavators <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, {{consisting of a}} leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state {{as if she had}} died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of 17 December Milstein and Trassjonsky became {{increasingly}} concerned as Gardstein's condition worsened, and they sent for a local doctor, explaining that their patient had been wounded accidentally by a friend. The doctor thought the bullet was still in the chest—it was later found to be touching the right ventricle of the heart. The doctor wanted to take Gardstein to the London Hospital, but he refused; with no other course open to him, the doctor sold them pain medication and left. The Russian was dead by 9:00am that morning. The doctor returned at 11:00am and <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> He had not heard of the events at Exchange Buildings the night before, and so reported the death to the coroner, not the police. At midday the coroner reported the death to the local police who, led by Divisional Detective Inspector Frederick Wensley, went to Grove Street and discovered the corpse. Trassjonsky was in the next room when they entered, and she was soon found by the police, hastily burning papers; she was arrested and taken to the police headquarters at Old Jewry. Many of the papers recovered linked the suspects to the East End, particularly to the anarchist groups active in the area. Wensley, who had extensive knowledge of the Whitechapel area, subsequently acted as a liaison officer to the City of London force throughout the investigation.|$|E

25|$|According to {{one account}} of the Celtic pagan {{tradition}} of the festival of Imbolc, cold ashes from the fireplace should be spread on the hearth. In the morning, markings in the ash will indicate that the goddess Brigid has visited the home and has blessed the people living there. If no markings are <b>found,</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of a rooster must be buried at the confluence of three streams and incense burned on the fire the next evening.|$|E
25|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses taught that if, in the land, they <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of a murder victim lying in the open, and they could not determine the killer, then the elders and judges were to measure the distances from the corpse to the nearby towns. The elders of the nearest town were to take a heifer that had never worked down to an ever-flowing wadi and break its neck. The priests were to come forward, and all the elders were to wash their hands over the heifer.|$|E

50|$|On 30 June, search teams <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> of <b>the</b> three missing {{teenagers}} {{in a field}} north-west of Hebron. They had apparently been shot dead shortly after the abduction. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a tough response to the killings.|$|R
25|$|The inquiry {{recommended}} that the grave be <b>found,</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> exhumed, and its DNA compared to relatives of Sydney personnel. A 2001 search by the RAN failed to find the grave, but they were more successful during a second search in 2006. During an autopsy, a metal fragment was found embedded in the skull, which was believed to have killed the man through brain trauma: although seized upon by believers in the massacre of Sydneys sailors, the fragment {{was found to be}} German shell shrapnel. While DNA comparison testing did not produce definite results, as of September 2010 it remained on-going.|$|E
25|$|On 30 October, police <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of a 16-year-old boy, named Vadim Gromov, at Donleskhoz station. The wounds upon Gromov's body {{immediately}} linked {{his murder}} to the manhunt: the youth had been strangled, stabbed 27 times and castrated, {{with the tip}} of his tongue severed and his left eye stabbed. Gromov had been killed on 17 October, 10 days {{before the start of the}} initiative. The same day Gromov's body was found, Chikatilo lured another 16-year-old boy, Viktor Tishchenko, off a train at Kirpichnaya station, another station under surveillance from undercover police, and killed him in a nearby forest. Tishchenko's body—bearing 40 separate knife wounds—was found on 3 November.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 3:00am, Chief Nevins {{attempted}} {{his first}} sally into the vestibule of the theatre; {{no one had}} been in there since District Chief Farley's departure more than three hours prior. His first attempts failed, but eventually he worked his way into the vestibule. Outside the doors leading into the lobby, he <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of a woman, legs partially burned away, face and arms disfigured. She was sitting upright with her back against the south wall. Nevins decided that at that point there were likely many more bodies to be found. He kept the news confined to his senior District Engineers, not wishing to incur a stampede into the fragile theatre of people seeking loved ones.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{documented}} examples of predators exhibiting surplus killing.

25|$|The marbles {{generally}} {{were very}} dirty...from a deposit {{of dust and}} soot....I <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of the marble beneath the surface white....The application of water, applied by a sponge or soft cloth, removed the coarsest dirt....The use of fine, gritty powder, with the water and rubbing, though it more quickly removed the upper dirt, left much embedded in the cellular surface of the marble. I then applied alkalies, both carbonated and caustic; these quickened the loosening of the surface dirt...but they fell far short of restoring the marble surface to its proper hue and state of cleanliness. I finally used dilute nitric acid, and even this failed....The examination has made me despair {{of the possibility of}} presenting the marbles in the British Museum in that state of purity and whiteness which they originally possessed.|$|E
25|$|Her {{battered}} {{body was}} found 18 March 2004, in a rolled-up carpet {{on the grounds of}} Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire. It weighed only six stone (84 lb or 36kg), and was covered with burns and bruises. There were a total of 60 separate injuries. Her ear was scarred and swollen, had split in half, and become infected; her mouth was injured so much that her bottom lip had detached. She had eleven broken ribs. The ultimate cause of death had been thrombosis from a blood clot in her brain, brought on by septicaemia, dehydration and repeated assaults. The injuries were such that police at first thought they had <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of a young boy. Police took weeks to identify her, launching an appeal on the BBC TV programme Crimewatch and consulting Interpol. She was 20 years old.|$|E
25|$|In 757, Prince Li Heng, who {{had taken}} the throne as Emperor Suzong, recaptured Chang'an and welcomed ex-Emperor Xuanzong, then Taishang Huang (retired emperor) back to the capital. Emperor Xuanzong went through Mawei {{on his way back}} to Chang'an. He wanted to locate Consort Yang's body and rebury her with honor. The {{official}} Li Kui spoke against it, pointing out that the imperial guard might again mutiny if he did so. However, Emperor Xuanzong secretly sent eunuchs to rebury her with a coffin. When they <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> it had decomposed, but the fragrance bag buried with her was still fresh. The eunuchs returned with the fragrance bag, and upon its presentation to Emperor Xuanzong, he wept bitterly. When he returned to Chang'an, he had a painter create a picture of Consort Yang in a secondary palace, and often went there to view the portrait.|$|E

His mother <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in the morning by their apartment building on Bohdan Khmelnytsky Street. Yelena Shram, a 28‑year-old night guard, was then murdered around the corner on Kosiora Street. According to Sayenko's taped confession, as Shram walked towards them, Suprunyuk struck her with the hammer he had been hiding under his shirt and struck her several more times after she fell down. She had been carrying a bag filled with clothes. The men picked up the bag, used the clothes to clean the hammer, and threw the bag out.
