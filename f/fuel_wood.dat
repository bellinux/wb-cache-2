In 2008, 47.6% of Croatia's primary energy production structure comprised use of natural gas (47.7%), crude oil (18.0%), <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> (8.4%), hydro power (25.4%) and other renewable energy sources (0.5%). In 2009, net total electrical power production in Croatia reached 12,725GWh and Croatia imported 28.5% of its electric power energy needs. The bulk of Croatian imports are supplied by the Krško Nuclear Power Plant, 50% owned by Hrvatska elektroprivreda, providing 15% of Croatia's electricity.|$|E
25|$|In an {{alternative}} method, {{a large piece}} of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> or log can be placed on the ground next to the tinder pile. Then kindling is placed with one end propped up by the larger piece of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood,</b> and the other resting on the ground, so that the kindling is leaning over the tinder pile. This method is useful in very high winds, as the piece of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> acts as a windbreak.|$|E

40|$|High {{fossil fuel}} prices and ambitions to reduce {{greenhouse}} gas emissions have increased demand for renewable energy and are changing <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> market structures. <b>Wood</b> <b>fuels</b> are to a rapidly growing degree used in industrial proportions and traded in commercial markets. <b>Wood</b> <b>fuels</b> {{are seen as a}} key component to achieve policy goals related to climate change, especially in the EU. In the six papers that form the basis for this thesis, prices of <b>wood</b> <b>fuels</b> in Northern Europe are analyzed by means of time series analysis to increase understanding about the factors that govern market development. In Paper I, it is found that whereas the Austrian and German residential-quality wood pellet markets are integrated, Sweden is a separate market. The conclusion from Paper II is that despite a long history of trade in <b>wood</b> <b>fuels</b> between Estonia and Sweden, the two markets cannot be considered integrated. The results from Paper III indicate that refined and unrefined <b>wood</b> <b>fuels</b> should be seen as two separate markets, and that forest chips prices follow different trajectories depending on whether they are used in district heating or in forest industries. In Paper IV, it is acknowledged that although high and volatile oil prices are an important driver for the growth in demand for <b>wood</b> <b>fuels,</b> no significant spillover from oil price developments into Swedish <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> prices could be discerned in the time period 1993 - 2010. In Paper V, the conclusion is that prices of industrial roundwood and unrefined <b>wood</b> <b>fuels</b> followed a common trend in Sweden {{in the first decade of}} the 21 st century. Paper VI shows that there is a significantly higher level of market maturity and internationalization in the Danish wood pellet market compared to the wood chip market in the country. In conclusion, this thesis uncovers some of the mechanisms that affect <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> markets, including the differences between unrefined <b>wood</b> <b>fuels</b> – such as wood chips – and the dynamic market for wood pellets. Whereas unrefined <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> markets still are mainly national, wood pellet markets are becoming internationalized. As for external impacts on <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> prices, the influence of forest products markets seem hitherto have been more important than oil price fluctuations. <b>Wood</b> <b>fuels</b> can be an important part of the future European energy system, but the complexities of the markets must be understood more thoroughly to ensure efficient resource utilization...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} work was to {{describe}} the <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> market of Ukraine and the Republic of Belarus, to estimate <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> potential and to research opportunities of <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> trading. Nowadays the wood waste, wood residues and by-products {{are becoming more and}} more potential raw materials for energy production. Against the background of unstable prices of traditional energy sources and environmental degradation, European States are planning to get 12 % of energy from alternative sources already in 2010. Wastes of wood-working and agricultural productions are such sources. At present time the most popular wood biofuels are wood pellets, briquettes, wood chips and logs. Ukraine and the Republic of Belarus have a rather big potential of <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> resources. But <b>wood</b> <b>fuels</b> markets of these countries are on the entry level and quite disorganized. There is almost no domestic usage of wood biofuel.

The most promising directions of <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> trading are developed <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> markets of Northern countries, Austria, Germany as well as actively developing markets of Poland and Hungary.

40|$|Sri Lanka {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} producers and exporters of quality tea in the world. The tea industry plays a key role in the economy and there is a great interest of continuously improving it in order to stay competitive. The process of drying tea requires thermal energy which currently is supplied through combustion of <b>fuel</b> <b>woods</b> on which the industry is highly dependent. With the rising prices on <b>fuel</b> <b>woods</b> over the past recent years it has become increasingly urgent to find substitutes, or complements to this source of energy. One potential solution would be to utilize solar thermal energy by implementing solar collectors in the tea manufacturing process. Sri Lanka is located close to the equator and has ideal conditions for harnessing solar energy, why solar applications would be highly suitable in this context. This report aims to study an existing simple system of flat plate solar collectors at the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. The solar collectors are built using local inexpensive material. The objectives are to calculate the collector efficiency and perform a cost analysis in order to determine the potential economic benefits of utilizing solar thermal power as opposed to <b>fuel</b> <b>woods.</b> Finally the report will present suggestions on improvements for the existing collector design, taking the practical and economic feasibility into consideration. The collector efficiency of the existing design was calculated to be approximately 35 % and the energy produced by the flat plate solar collectors was found to be less expensive than combustion of <b>fuel</b> <b>woods,</b> despite the many imperfections of the collector design. Suggestions on refinements include improving the selectivity of the absorber surface with a black chrome coating, equipping the collector with a sun-tracking system, adding obstacles in the collector air duct, using a v-corrugated absorber plate, shifting to downward air blowing, changing heat transfer fluid and using multiple sheets of glass as glazing. Through these relatively simple and cost-effective improvements on the system the collector efficiency could increase substantially, thereby reducing energy costs. Moreover the implementation of solar collectors in the Sri Lankan tea manufacturing process would be beneficial from an environmental perspective...|$|R
