50|$|A bridge has {{probably}} stood on this site {{as early as}} 1782, when the road linking the two towns was surveyed. It is not known how many bridges have stood there; the bridge destroyed by the 1927 flooding was a Town lattice truss bridge. Following that flooding, temporary bridges were hastily assembled at this site; they were washed away during thaw floods in January 1928. The present bridge was built in spring 1928. The Berlin Construction Company, who built it, was in some ways a successor to the Berlin Iron Bridge Company, having been formed by employees of that company after its acquisition by the American Bridge Company.

5000|$|A <b>high</b> <b>water</b> mark is a {{point that}} {{represents}} the maximum rise of {{a body of water}} over land. Such a mark is often the result of a <b>flood,</b> but <b>high</b> <b>water</b> marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the <b>high</b> <b>water</b> mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for <b>flood</b> surges. <b>High</b> <b>water</b> marks from <b>floods</b> have been measured for planning purposes since at least {{as far back as the}} civilizations of ancient Egypt. It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the <b>highest</b> <b>water</b> marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this <b>high</b> <b>water</b> mark was set.

40|$|The Rhine in the French {{alluvial}} plain has {{been deprived of}} the main parts of its hooded areas. One of the consequences is {{the high level of}} nitrate in groundwater due to intensive agriculture except under forested areas. The {{purpose of this study is}} to show the role played by the forest ecosystem in influencing groundwater quality in relation to the hydrological regime, vegetation and soil characteristics. Phosphate and nitrogen levels in groundwater are compared in three forested sectors. Two are on a calcareous substrate, one of which is still <b>flooded</b> with summer <b>high</b> <b>waters,</b> whereas the other has not been hooded for 30 years. The third sector is on a decarbonated substrate which is <b>flooded</b> with <b>high</b> <b>water</b> in winter or early spring. In all the sectors phosphate, nitrate and ammonia are very low in the groundwater as compared to the surface water. Nitrate concentrations in groundwater differ widely between the three forested sites, whereas ammonia and phosphate remain relatively constant. Nitrate levels were the lowest in the sector with silty/clayey soils, whereas they were largely influenced in the loamy soil by hydrological conditions, whether flooded or not...|$|R
