5000|$|It {{recorded}} and played back black-and-white [...] "skip-field" [...] video in analog on specially modified disk pack drives (supplied by Memorex, {{and which were}} commonly used to store data digitally on mainframe computers of the time) that were the size of washing machines. The audio was recorded digitally using PCM, and was recorded by being inserted in the [...] "back porch" [...] of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> interval <b>pulses</b> of the video. This audio was somewhat poor, due to {{a large amount of}} jitter occurring from the signal being played back from the disk packs. The video was also of less than stellar quality, due to it being recorded in skip-field mode (which was done to extend recording time on the disk packs). But all of this did not matter, since the 600's main purpose was solely for off-line editing, in order to create an Edit Decision List (EDL) for later on-line editing.|$|R
50|$|Player/Missile pixels {{are only}} {{rendered}} within the visible {{portions of the}} GTIA's pixel engine. Player/Missile objects are not rendered during the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blank</b> or the vertical blank. However, an object can be partially within the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blank.</b> The objects' pixels that fall outside of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blank</b> are then within the visible portion of the display and can still register collisions. The horizontal position range of visible color clocks is $22hex/34dec to $DDhex/221dec.|$|R
50|$|Player/Missile {{collisions}} {{can only}} occur when Player/Missile object pixels occur within the visible {{portions of the}} display. Player/Missile objects are not rendered during the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blank</b> or the vertical blank. The range of visible color clocks is 34 to 221, and the visible scan lines range from line 8 through line 247. Player/Missile data outside of these coordinates are not rendered and will not register collisions. An object can be partially within the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blank.</b> The objects' pixels that fall outside of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blank</b> are within the visible portion of the display and can still register collisions.|$|R
5000|$|Blank line - 8 {{instructions}} to display from 1 through 8 <b>horizontal</b> <b>blank</b> lines ...|$|R
50|$|In a {{composite}} video signal (CVS) {{there are two types}} of blanking: horizontal and vertical. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> is between lines and vertical blanking is between fields (half frames). In a poorly tuned TV receiver the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> can be seen at the right or left of the image and the vertical blanking can be seen at the top or bottom of the image. VIT signals are inserted in the vertical blanking.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the demand}} for {{real-time}} processing in real-time automatic target recognition (RTATR) systems, fast connected components analysis (CCA) is significant to RTATR performance improvement. Conventional single-pass CCA algorithms need <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> periods to resolve the equivalence, which are difficult to be applied when the streamed data is transmitted without <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> periods. In this paper, a real-time single-pass CCA algorithm is proposed. Unlike the conventional ones, we adopt the pixel as a scan unit while the line as a labeling unit and manage the correspondence of labels between adjacent rows by designing a multi-layer-index structure. Equivalence is resolved when the image is scanning, without extra processing time. The proposed algorithm is suitable for hardware acceleration, and the streamed image data can be processed during image transmission without <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> periods. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} hardware acceleration of algorithm achieves real-time CCA in RTATR system.|$|R
5000|$|In the NTSC {{television}} standard, <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> occupies [...] (17.2%) out {{of every}} [...] scan line. In PAL, it occupies [...] (18.8%) {{out of every}} [...] scan line.|$|R
50|$|The {{parameters}} {{defined by}} standard include <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> and vertical <b>blanking</b> intervals, <b>horizontal</b> frequency and vertical frequency (collectively, pixel clock rate or video signal bandwidth), and horizontal/vertical sync polarity.|$|R
50|$|A raster {{interrupt}} (also {{called a}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>blank</b> interrupt) {{is a computer}} interrupt signal that is used for display timing purposes. It is usually, though not always, generated by the system's graphics chip.|$|R
50|$|Some {{graphics}} {{systems can}} count <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanks</b> and change how the display is generated during this blank {{time in the}} signal; {{this is called a}} raster effect, of which an example are raster bars.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> {{interval}} {{refers to}} {{a part of the}} process of displaying images on a computer monitor or television screen via raster scanning. CRT screens display images by moving beams of electrons very quickly across the screen. Once the beam of the monitor has reached the edge of the screen, the beam is switched off, and the deflection circuit voltages (or currents) are returned to the values they had for the other edge of the screen; this would have the effect of retracing the screen in the opposite direction, so the beam is turned off during this time. This part of the line display process is the <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Blank.</b>|$|R
50|$|In fact, spikes do occur, both {{horizontally}} and vertically, and {{the corresponding}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> interval and vertical blanking interval give the deflection currents settle time to retrace and settle to their new value. This happens during the blanking interval.|$|R
30|$|Single-pass CCA {{algorithms}} [10 – 12]. D.G. Baily et al. {{have proposed}} another CCA method, {{in a more}} goal-directed way: Single-pass CCA algorithm, which accumulates the feature data (such as the area, center of gravity, and perimeter) while the pixels are being scanned and labeled, does not generate a labeled image. Essentially, the single-pass CCA algorithms are label-equivalence-based too, which resolve equivalence in each row during the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> periods as well as merge accumulated data. These algorithms {{eliminate the need for}} producing a labeled image and spare the second re-labeling pass, hence suitable for processing streamed image data on FPGA. Furthermore, an optimized single-pass CCA algorithm [12] is proposed, which applies a label recycling scheme between adjacent rows to save the memory resources. Such methods will be of great benefit to the RTATR systems: streamed images can be processed in the transmission from detector to processing unit and this will save the processing time and shorten the delays of closed-loop control. However, these methods require <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> periods to resolve equivalence, which will be a bottleneck when the streamed data is transmitted without <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> periods.|$|R
50|$|Most {{consumer}} VCRs use {{the known}} black {{level of the}} vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>pulse</b> to set their recording levels. The Macrovision copy protection scheme inserts pulses in the VBI, where the recorder expects a constant level, to disrupt recording to videotapes.|$|R
50|$|Many {{graphics}} chips {{can trigger}} an interrupt, specifically called a raster interrupt, when the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> interval or the vertical sync begins; thus, an interrupt handler can precisely time and perform {{the task of}} updating CLUT entries for raster bars and other colour-changing effects.|$|R
50|$|SMPTE 344M {{defines a}} 480p59.94 {{standard}} with twice the data rate of BT.601, using 704 × 480 active pixels with 16 x 480 <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> pixels. ITU-R Rec. 601 is the specification for component digital interlaced video (480i) {{commonly used in}} standard definition television production.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a version that {{encrypted}} the audio using a digital audio stream in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> interval like the VCII system. One US network used that for its affiliate feeds and would turn off the analog sub carriers on the satellite feed.|$|R
50|$|In video games, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> {{interval}} {{was used}} to create some notable effects. Some methods of parallax scrolling use a raster effect to simulate depth in consoles that do not natively support multiple background layers or do not support enough background layers to achieve the desired effect. One {{example of this is}} in the game Castlevania: Rondo of Blood, which was written for the PC Engine CD-ROM which does not support multiple background layers. The Super NES's Mode 7 used the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> interval to vary the scaling and rotation of one background layer on a scanline by scanline basis to create many different effects. The most famous and hyped effect of Mode 7 was to turn the background layer into a planar texture map.|$|R
50|$|Most VCR {{circuits}} use the {{amplitude of}} the vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>pulse</b> {{to operate the}} AGC. Video copy control schemes such as Macrovision exploit this, inserting spikes in the pulse which will be ignored by most television sets, but cause a VCR's AGC to overcorrect and corrupt the recording.|$|R
5000|$|Ancillary packets {{located in}} the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> region (after EAV but before SAV), {{regardless}} of line, are known as horizontal ancillary data, or HANC. HANC is commonly used for higher-bandwidth data, and/or for {{things that need to}} be synchronized to a particular line; the most common type of HANC is embedded audio.|$|R
5000|$|VITC is 90 bits long: 32 bits of time code, 32 bits of user data, 18 {{synchronization}} bits, and 8 bits of checksum. It {{is transmitted}} using non-return-to-zero encoding at a bit rate of 115 times the line rate. (The unused 25 bit times are to {{leave room for}} the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> interval.) ...|$|R
50|$|A gated and {{filtered}} signal {{derived from the}} color subcarrier, called the burst or colorburst, {{is added to the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> interval of each line, excluding the vertical sync interval, as a synchronizing signal and amplitude reference for the chrominance signals. The burst signal is inverted in phase (180° out of phase) from the reference subcarrier.|$|R
50|$|DAC {{word length}}s range usually from 6 to 10 bits. The SRAM's word length {{is three times}} the DAC's word length. The SRAM acts as a color lookup table (CLUT). It usually has 256 entries (and thus an 8-bit address). If the DAC's word length is also 8 bits, we have a 256 x 24-bit SRAM which allows a {{selection}} of 256 out of 16777216 (16,7 million) possible colors for the display. The contents of this SRAM can be altered when no pixel needs to be generated for transmission to the display. A synchronization pulse is required to maintain vertical picture stability. Therefore, a vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>pulse</b> is generated for every frame. This vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>pulse</b> is not visible on the display, nor is any pixel sent. Therefore, the D/A is idle and can allow the user to modify the SRAM color lookup table.|$|R
30|$|Due to its {{preferable}} pipeline {{and parallel}} architecture, {{the implementation of}} proposed algorithm can perform real-time analysis by the original pixel clock, and no extra periods (like <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> periods in [10] and [12]) are required, {{which means that the}} time consumption of the hardware acceleration is only relevant to the frequency of pixel clock and equals to the transmission period of images.|$|R
50|$|The {{sampled sound}} engine piggybacked {{on the video}} circuit. As the raster scan {{returned}} from {{the right side of}} the screen to the left, one byte of data was placed into a PWM generator instead of the screen. This provided 8-bit sampled monaural sound sampled at the 22.25 kHz <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> rate. A general-purpose 6522 output could mute the sampled sound.|$|R
50|$|For DV-NTSC only 480 {{lines are}} used. The {{digitally}} transmitted horizontal resolution is usually 720 samples (which includes 16 samples for the horizontal sync and <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking)</b> or 704 visible pixels with an aspect ratio of 4:3 (with vertically rectangular pixels) {{and therefore a}} display resolution of 640 × 480 (VGA); that is standard-definition television (SDTV) with a 4:3 aspect ratio (with square pixels).|$|R
50|$|A {{vertical}} blank interrupt (or VBI) is {{a hardware}} feature {{found in some}} computer systems that generate a video display. Typical video display circuits generate vertical blanking and vertical sync' pulses when the display picture has completed and the raster is being returned {{to the start of}} the display. With VBI, the vertical <b>blank</b> <b>pulse</b> is also used to generate an interrupt request for the computer's microprocessor.|$|R
50|$|A {{synchronization}} packet occurs {{immediately before}} the first active sample on every line, and immediately after the last active sample (and {{before the start of}} the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> region). The synchronization packet consists of four 10-bit words. The first three words are always the same—0x3FF, 0, 0; the fourth consists of 3 flag bits, along with an error correcting code. As a result, there are 8 different synchronization packets possible.|$|R
50|$|The {{frames are}} doubled (from a 25 frame source) on {{broadcast}} (to avoid flicker) for display devices that lack {{any kind of}} frame doubling ability. Widescreen 16:9 material has only the width scaled down to fit 720 pixels instead of an unscaled 1024 width. SMPTE 344M defines a 576p50 standard with twice the data rate of BT.601, using 704 × 576 active pixels with 16 x 576 <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> pixels.|$|R
50|$|The {{front porch}} {{is a brief}} (about 1.5 microsecond) period {{inserted}} {{between the end of}} each transmitted line of picture and {{the leading edge of the}} next line sync pulse. Its purpose was to allow voltage levels to stabilise in older televisions, preventing interference between picture lines. The front porch is the first component of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> interval which also contains the horizontal sync pulse and the back porch.|$|R
5000|$|A similar {{effect can}} be {{generated}} vertically, although it often does not extend into the border area. To generate vertical bars, the same line of video memory is repeatedly output every scanline. At {{the top of the}} frame, the video memory is typically <b>blank,</b> and every <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> interval it is updated with a new [...] "bar" [...] in a slightly different position, creating a [...] "stepped" [...] effect.|$|R
50|$|Two timing {{intervals}} {{are defined}} - {{the front porch}} {{between the end of}} displayed video and the start of the sync pulse, and the back porch after the sync pulse and before displayed video. These and the sync pulse itself are called the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> (or retrace) interval and represent the time that the electron beam in the CRT is returning {{to the start of the}} next display line.|$|R
40|$|When pulsed {{interference}} is mitigated {{by means of}} <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking,</b> interference is reduced significantly. However, {{at the same time}} certain fractions of the useful orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal are erased. Consequently, only moderate improvements are achieved with <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking.</b> When representing the <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> operation as multiplication with a rectangular window exhibiting notches at the positions where blanks are inserted, it becomes obvious, that <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> mainly leads to inter-carrier interference (ICI). In this paper, the compensation of the impact of <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> is proposed by reconstructing and subtracting ICI. The required shape of the subcarrier spectra is derived from the <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> window. For an estimation of the transmitted data symbols and the channel coefficients of each subcarrier an iterative receiver structure is proposed. Simulation results at hand of a realistic interference scenario show that with perfect channel estimation and known data symbols the impact of <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> can be reduced to a small loss in signal-to-noise ratio resulting from the energy loss due to erasing a certain fraction of the OFDM signal. With real channel estimation and estimated data symbols, the ideal case with perfect channel estimation and known data symbols is approached by 1. 2 dB after only three iterations...|$|R
30|$|To {{suppress}} {{the effect of}} impulsive noise on an OFDM receiver, an interference mitigation method based on <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> is first proposed in [4 – 6]. However, when using this method to an actual system, two problems should be considered, the threshold of <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> and the compensation of inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking.</b> To calculate the blanking threshold, an optimal threshold of <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking</b> is derived based on an expression for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the blanking nonlinearity [7]. With maximizing the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) criterion, an adaptive blanking threshold for the OFDM receiver is also proposed in [8]. To eliminate the ICI caused by <b>pulse</b> <b>blanking,</b> an iterative reconstructing and subtracting ICI method is proposed in [9, 10], and a frequency-domain ICI compensation scheme based on finite impulse response equalizer is proposed in [11].|$|R
50|$|APAC used a Display List Interrupt, or DLI, {{after each}} {{line of the}} screen was drawn to {{alternate}} between GTIA Graphics Mode 11 (15 hues) and 9 (15 shades of grey) of the GTIA chip. The hues and luminances would blend together on the screen (usually a television) to create {{the effect of a}} palette of 256 visible colors, with the artifact of a thinner, <b>horizontal</b> <b>blank</b> line in between each visible line.|$|R
25|$|A {{synchronization}} packet (commonly {{known as}} the timing reference signal or TRS) occurs immediately before the first active sample on every line, and immediately after the last active sample (and {{before the start of}} the <b>horizontal</b> <b>blanking</b> region). The synchronization packet consists of four 10-bit words, the first three words are always the same—0x3FF, 0, 0; the fourth consists of 3 flag bits, along with an error correcting code.
