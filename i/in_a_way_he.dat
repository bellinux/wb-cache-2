5|$|By {{the time}} Space Travel was fully ported to the PDP-7, Thompson had {{expanded}} his software suite to a full, basic operating system, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> {{had been unable}} to with the Multics project and the GE 635. The operating system he designed spread to other users in the company, and formed the core of what would be named in 1970 the Unix operating system. Space Travel was one of the early mainframe games developed before the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early history of video games, and was never distributed beyond its initial locations. As a result, it had no effect on future video games, and its primary legacy is that of sparking the creation of Unix.|$|E
25|$|For So Blonde Ince was {{contacted}} by Wizarbox, whose crew {{had already done}} some concept work of the main character, some of the locations, and they had an idea for the story. They brought Ince in to develop the story, but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> became {{the public face of}} the game, and he went to Leipzig and Paris on promotional tours.|$|E

He laid the foundations of county cricket economy. The sweep of his energy, his authority, and prowess, his personal presence, caused cricket to expand beyond a game. His bulk and stride carried cricket into the highways of our national life. He became a representative Victorian, a father figure.|$|E

25|$|With Lord Fitzwilliam, in Grosvenor Square, for {{the purpose}} of {{discussing}} the subject of a coalition with him, and of endeavouring to prevail on him to speak to Fox—Lord Fitzwilliam's sentiments perfectly right—he said his opposition never had been to the constitution of the country, but to the Government when it acted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> thought contrary to the constitution; that, therefore, when that was in danger he ceased to be in opposition. On going over the matter it became evident that the great obstacle would arise from Fox's being too much entangled with Grey, Lambton, and that set of men who had lately separated themselves from the party, in order to form a party of their own, and who publicly professed doctrines and opinions in direct opposition to what he and I considered to be for the good and welfare of the public. That this would indeed be very hard and unreasonable, that for the sake of these very men, who both in their public and private capacity had been as inimical as possible, an arrangement should be broken off so salutary and so advisable. Lord Fitzwilliani and myself agreed on every point; he, however, went beyond me in insisting on the indispensable necessity of Pitt resigning the Treasury for another Cabinet office. He acquiesced in the wisdom of trying to bring Fox to be less attached to these false friends, and said Tom Grenville was the best man to speak to him. Lord Fitzwilliam expressed his dislike to Sheridan, said he might have a lucrative place, but never could be admitted to one of trust and confidence. On my wishing him not to leave town, he said he could safely trust his conscience with the Duke of Portland, and was at the same time ready to return at the shortest notice.|$|E
500|$|Scenes {{filmed in}} the One Eyed Jacks casino and brothel were shot on {{location}} {{at a house}} on the shore of California's Malibou Lake; footage for several episodes were shot on the same day by different directors so as to scatter the scenes throughout the episodes that required them. Deschanel has expressed regret over the use of a [...] "house style" [...] in the series' direction and cinematography, feeling that he lit certain scenes in this episode <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> would not usually have done; preferring to have employed a chiaroscuro use of shadow as opposed to the reddish tints used throughout.|$|E
500|$|As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates {{to shoot}} Dale, Daryl takes {{the gun and}} inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions and care about these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, you can do the things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step in and take that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate to do the same thing with Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and does what he needs to do." ...|$|E

Robert Carlyle owned the character <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> never has before. His flourishes and 'dearies' didn't seem out of place and he even played with them a bit." [...] Ratcliffe also positively received Peter Pan's introduction, saying [...] "I appreciate how they've flipped Peter Pan from a lighthearted boy to a master manipulator with questionable intentions.

2500|$|In 2011, O'Neal {{performed}} {{as one of}} the comedians for The Comedy Central Roast of Charlie Sheen as he expressed his respect for the actor and wished to tell him in person. The show aired on September 19, 2011 with O'Neal the last comic to perform. It acquired 6.4 million viewers, still the highest rated edition of the Comedy Central roasts. O'Neal's appearance on the roast was to be his final television appearance prior to his untimely death two months later. After the taping, O'Neal met William Shatner and his wife, who was also in attendance, in the garage and the couple offered their support to O'Neal regarding his diabetes, after which the three cried. Shatner recalled, [...] "He knew that he was dying, that he was a dying man, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> wanted to die ... That's what I saw. That's why we cried." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Run This Town" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Following the leak of the song, Tom Breihan, Pitchfork gave a positive review. [...] "The new Jay-Z/Kanye West/Rihanna track from 'The Blueprint 3', leaked this morning, and it bangs. Jay's 'D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)' left {{the impression that}} The Blueprint 3 might be a cantankerous grumpy-old-man rap album, but 'Run This Town' totally obliterates that. Thanks to a molten motivational Rihanna chorus, it's pop-friendly as hell, without compromising Jay's fundamental hardness. And Jay is actually rapping like he cares, something he's only done intermittently {{over the last few}} years. Still, Kanye gets the hottest line on the song: 'What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' RAV 4?'" [...] Following the album's release, Pitchfork made another review of the song, again praising the track. [...] "There's something for everybody: Jay [...] sounds engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> rarely has since unretiring, Rihanna coos those [...] "ay ay"s the radio loves, and Kanye West, as you may have read, once again upstages the guy he's producing. Rihanna's hook may not be Auto-Tune'd, but it's definitely autopilot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Along {{with the}} {{scenario}} basis, the {{clue to the}} phenomenal success {{of the project was}} the work of Ivan Okhlobystin himself: his doctor, Andrei Evgenievich Bykov, the head of the therapeutic department of the hospital {{and the head of the}} internship department, is the central figure of the entire movie, and the importance of this personality is so big that the rest of the hospital employees and, in fact, the interns themselves, seem to be a kind of [...] "Bykov's army", corresponding to one of several traits of his character. Okhlobystin, through a [...] "paradoxical and ironic rationalism with which he tends to percept the reality," [...] according to a TV critic Valery Zaitsev, creates around him a special, [...] "Okhbystin" [...] space. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> reminds very much Hugh Laurie, the British actor playing the main role in the American television series Doctor House. [...] However, the similarity ends there: the character of Okhlobystin, as well as the mentality of all the TV series shot by TNT, is purely Russian, full of love, respect and tenderness as to the profession of the doctor and human suffering. It's no accident that Dr. Bykov regularly [...] "mocks" [...] at a foreign colleague, and in one of the first episodes, having learned that the tiresome intern Levin, just like House, is going to treat rare and complex illnesses, he comes back with a question: who is going then to treat ordinary patients, filling up the hospitals? ...|$|E
2500|$|Star Trek went to {{series on}} the basis of the second pilot, but still fearing {{blacklash}} against Spock's ears, and issues with selling the show to stations in the Bible Belt, NBC airbrushed out the pointed tips in an advertising brochure about the series. Spock's role was used as audition material for new cast members. Nichelle Nichols was intrigued by the role when she read his lines, and asked why the character could not be female. The producers response was that Nimoy would not like it. It was during the filming of the first non-pilot episode to be shot, [...] "The Corbomite Maneuver", that under the direction of Joseph Sargent, Nimoy was directed to remain aloof during a tense moment and said the catchphrase [...] "fascinating" [...] for the first time. This moment was subsequently given by the writing staff as an example of how the character should act. Nimoy liked Spock's newly logical nature, observing that the character is [...] "struggling to maintain a Vulcan attitude, a Vulcan philosophical posture and a Vulcan logic, opposing what was fighting him internally, which was human emotion". Nimoy stated that after [...] "The Naked Time", in which a disease causes Spock to cry, [...] "I knew that we were not playing a man with no emotions, but a man who had great pride, who had learned to control his emotions and who would deny that he knew what emotions were. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> was more human than anyone else on the ship." ...|$|E
