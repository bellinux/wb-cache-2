5|$|A year later, at {{the height}} of the 1975 Australian {{constitutional}} crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals. As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, stating that she would not interfere <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general. The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of ministerial discretion, it has been {{established}} in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (1943) that it is not unlawful for a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of the minister, even where a statute confers discretion on a minister. Parliament will expect only that the power is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in case law about whether a minister should be required to personally exercise discretion <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> that affect a person's liberty, the courts have usually been reluctant to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.|$|E

In his fight with Matt Arroyo, Cramer executed a takedown and attempted punches on the ground while avoiding the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu brown-belt's submissions during the first two rounds, while the third and final round saw Arroyo taking Cramer's back on the ground and unsuccessfully going for a rear naked choke. Two of the three judges scored the bout 29–28 for Cramer while the remaining third judge saw it 28–29 for Arroyo, giving Cramer the split-decision victory.|$|E

5|$|At {{least one}} Baron sat {{to hear a}} case, with {{convention}} insisting on a maximum of four Barons after the rule of Edward IV; as a mere convention, it was occasionally broken. When one Baron was ill or otherwise unable to sit it was felt appropriate to appoint a fifth, as in 1604 when Baron Sotherton was ill, and in 1708, when Baron Smith was called to Edinburgh to be a temporary Chief Baron of the Scottish Exchequer. In 1830 a fifth Baron was permanently added to relieve court congestion; at the same time, a fifth judge {{was added to the}} Court of Common Pleas and King's Bench. The First Baron was the Chief Baron of the Exchequer; if the Chancellor and Treasurer were unavailable, he {{was the head of the}} court. When he was also absent the Second Baron took charge, and so on; in one case in 1659, the Fourth Baron was the only judge available. The Second, Third and Fourth Barons were known as puisne Barons; initially treated as individual offices, after the time of James I the order was determined by the judges' seniority. Unlike in the Court of King's Bench, the different positions did not equate to different degrees of power; each Baron had an equal vote <b>in</b> <b>decisions.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{participation}} of employee architects <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> making <b>in</b> architectural firms is investigated. This is {{with a view to}} identifying the organisational contexts that enhance employee participation <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> making. The impact of such participation on the performances of the firms was also assessed. This study was carried out through a questionnaire survey of employers of architects in Nigeria. In agreement with findings of previous studies, participation of the employees of the architectural firms in the study <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> making is low. Employee participation <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> making <b>in</b> the firms was dependent on the staffing strategy and proportion of junior staff in many cases. The positive impact of employee participation <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> making on firm performance varied with the nature of the decision. This study concludes that there is need for employers in architectural firms to identify the categories of decision that employees should be involved in and to modify their firm contexts to encourage participation where desired...|$|R

His decision-making procedures ensured that his colleagues were informed and actively participated <b>in</b> <b>decisions</b> or if they disagreed, gave leave for cabinet members to absent themselves from meetings to preserve cabinet solidarity. In this respect Bruce earned the quick respect and approval of his colleagues, and in many respects came to dominate cabinet through his industriousness and knowledgability.

An analysis of 135 Swedish technology-based firms suggests that board involvement <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> control may influence corporate innovation. The empirical results show that board involvement <b>in</b> strategic <b>decision</b> control is positively associated with process innovation, while board involvement <b>in</b> financial <b>decision</b> control is positively associated with organizational innovation.

40|$|Consistency is {{believed}} to be the foundation of understanding, predicting, and influencing human behavior (Lee, Amir, 2 ̆ 6 Ariely, 2009). However, inconsistency <b>in</b> <b>decision</b> making does exist and could be influenced by a variety of factors such as culture.
