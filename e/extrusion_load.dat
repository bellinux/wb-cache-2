Statistic significance was defined for all calculations as p <  0. 05. Results: The cohort included 87 women and 56 men with an average age of 53 years +/− 9. 7 years. Kellgren-Lawrence grade distribution was as follows: 56 with grade 0, 46 with grade 1, 25 with grade 2, 13 with grade 3, and 3 with grade 4. 23 % had medial meniscus tears and 16 % had lateral meniscus tears.

40|$|The elastic {{behaviour}} of {{the forming}} die {{has a direct}} influence {{on the quality of}} the formed component. Simulation of material flow and of die deflection during forward extrusion was conducted using elastic and plastic considerations to establish the influence of die-elasticity on the form of the component under different processing conditions. The simulations show that the dimensions of the work-material are affected by die-elasticity during both, loading and unloading of the die. The change of the die-geometry does not produce obvious differences in the dimensions of the extrudate; however, it influences the geometric errors of the workpiece which is retained in the die. Larger values of friction in the injection chamber result in the corresponding increase of punch pressure which results in larger radial deflection of the die during <b>extrusion</b> (<b>loading),</b> the consequence being a greater variation in extrudate geometry. High levels of friction reduce the elastic contraction of the die during punch retraction (unloading), and hence, larger form-errors are sustained after unloading. The contraction of the die during unloading phase of the process causes plastic deformation of the work-material remaining in the injection-chamber; this plastic deformation is significant to the overall form-error of the component...|$|R

40|$|The {{pressure}} required for certain extrusion and coining operations may be approximately estimated from {{a knowledge of}} that required to perform the analogous operations under conditions of plane strain, and these pressures may be closely over-estimated {{by the use of}} a principle due to Hill or a Limit Theorem of Drucker, Greenberg, and Prager. Numerous examples are presented of a graphical or primarily non-analytical approach for closely over-estimating <b>extrusion</b> or coining <b>loads</b> required. The solutions presented give insight into the mechanics of certain metal-working operations and give good approximate results for problems generally solved by the lengthy numerical procedures {{associated with the use of}} slip-line fields...|$|R
50|$|When Petter {{returned}} he {{was furious}} with Mensford. He knew Westland {{would not have the}} resources to develop and build both the fighter and the bomber. Also, to avoid the delays in production of the bomber he wanted Mensforth to give him full powers of a chief engineer responsible for every department concerned with its construction. He believed that in his absence the management had conspired to eliminate his project. As a result of this conflict he resigned in June, leaving the company in September 1944. He took with him the B1/44 design proposal and his large database of <b>extrusions</b> with their <b>load</b> capacities.|$|R
40|$|Angiotensin II (AII) stimulates active Na+ <b>extrusion</b> from Na+ <b>loaded</b> renal cortex slices. Specific high {{affinity}} [125 I]-AII binding {{sites in}} partially purified basolateral and brush-border epithelial membranes exhibit a KD of 0. 88 nM and Bmax of 321. 13 fmol mg- 1 protein. Separation and purification of brush-border membranes yielded high affinity [125 I]-AII binding sites with KD of 1. 02 nM and Bmax of 56. 6 fmol mg- 1 protein. Angiotensin II receptors {{of the same}} affinity are present on renal cortex brush-border and basolateral membranes but a greater proportion are located on the latter. These receptors {{may be involved in}} the direct control of Na+ and water transport by AII...|$|R
