5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of {{research has been done}} at Mount Baker over the past decade, and it is now among the most-studied of the Cascade volcanoes. Recent and ongoing projects include gravimetric and GPS-based geodetic monitoring, <b>fumarole</b> gas sampling, tephra distribution mapping, new interpretations of the Schriebers Meadow lava flow, and hazards analyses. Mapping of Carmelo and Sherman craters, and interpretations of the eruptive history, continues, as well. The Mount Baker Volcano Research Center maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work, and an extensive references list, as well as photos.|$|E
25|$|North of Norris, Roaring Mountain is a large, acidic {{hydrothermal}} area (solfatara) {{with many}} <b>fumaroles.</b> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the number, size, {{and power of}} the <b>fumaroles</b> were much greater than today. The <b>fumaroles</b> are most easily seen in the cooler, low-light conditions of morning and evening. Artists' Paintpots is a small hydrothermal area south of Norris Junction that includes colorful hot springs and two large mudpots.|$|R
50|$|Mount Pelée {{began its}} eruptions on April 23, 1902. In early April, excursionists noted the {{appearance}} of sulfurous vapors emitting from <b>fumaroles</b> near the mountaintop. This was not regarded as important, as <b>fumaroles</b> had appeared and disappeared in the past.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 76 - 84). <b>Fumaroles</b> {{occur when}} groundwater is heated by geothermal sources at a shallow depth, forcing steam and volcanic gases {{out of the}} Earth's surface. <b>Fumaroles</b> are ubiquitous geothermal features, yet {{little is known about}} the microbial communities inhabiting these hyperextremophilic environments. From the few environmental surveys of <b>fumaroles</b> located on the Big Island of Hawaii, a surprisingly wide diversity of both Bacteria and Archaea has been revealed. These islands are geologically young and geographically isolated from other geothermal environments, begging the question: where did these microbes come from? I hypothesize that current microbial communities in <b>fumaroles</b> of the Big Island of Hawaii constitute a mixed-community due to multiple colonizations from a variety of different sources...|$|R
5|$|In late 1984, geologists {{noticed that}} seismic {{activity}} in the area had begun to increase. Increased <b>fumarole</b> activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new magma had finished ascending into Nevado del Ruiz's volcanic edifice.|$|E
5|$|Various {{parts of}} the main volcano have been {{subjected}} to hydrothermal alteration. The Azufrera stage edifice was subject to the most alteration; especially in the summit area and between the Angulo and Azufrera summits lie sulfur rich talus deposits. The central part of the complex is heavily altered by <b>fumarole</b> activity. Hydrothermal alteration may be driven by the formation of a deep magma reservoir and resulting hydrothermal circulation in overlying rocks.|$|E
5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased <b>fumarole</b> activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E
5000|$|Native {{vanadium}} is {{the mineral}} {{form of the}} metal vanadium, with the accepted name [...] "vanadium". This exceedingly rare mineral was found among <b>fumaroles</b> of the Colima volcano. <b>Fumaroles</b> of Colima are known of being vanadium-rich, depositing other vanadium minerals, that include shcherbinaite (V2O5) and colimaite (K3VS4).|$|R
50|$|Mount Griggs, {{formerly}} known as Knife Peak Volcano, is a stratovolcano, which lies 10 km behind the volcanic arc defined by other Katmai group volcanoes. Although no historic eruptions have been reported from Mount Griggs, vigorously active <b>fumaroles</b> persist in a summit crater and along the upper southwest flank. The <b>fumaroles</b> on the southwest flank are the hottest, {{and some of the}} flank <b>fumaroles</b> can roar so loudly that they can be heard from the valley floor. The slopes of Mount Griggs are heavily mantled by fallout from the 1912 eruption of Novarupta volcano.|$|R

Bu-ot <b>fumarole</b> field, Bum-bag <b>fumarole</b> fields, and Sugu-oc <b>fumarole</b> field, all have hot sulfurous water springs. Along the Pasil River {{upstream}} from Bu-ot, six hot sulfurous water springs and one <b>fumarole</b> {{are said to be}} located.|$|E
25|$|The Bu-ot <b>Fumarole</b> Field (Balatoc dialect) {{is located}} on Balatoc tribal land, along the Pasil River on the steep western valley slope, with the path going up to Balatoc village {{immediately}} {{to the right of}} the <b>fumarole</b> field.|$|E
25|$|The Sugo-oc <b>fumarole</b> field {{could be}} seen and photographed from the {{southern}} side of Binuluan in Bunog River valley, along the Tinglayan-Tulgao road.

At Balatoc, {{you might be able}} to arrange a local guide to take you to Bum-bag <b>fumarole</b> firld. Most of the walk is on tribal lands or private property. Walk from Balatoc to Bum-bag is only for the fit and takes about 5 hours one way. There are no accommodations near Bum-bag <b>fumarole</b> field although there are some very basic huts at the Bum-bag rice terraces. Bum-bag fields are located on private property and permission is required from the owner.|$|E

25|$|In Tulgao or Sumadel, {{you need}} to {{negotiate}} to find a local guide willing {{to take you to}} the Sugo-oc <b>fumarole</b> field. The trek from the village to the <b>fumarole</b> field is steep, difficult, at higher elevation, along carabao (water buffalo) tracks. As of 2008, tourists do not visit Sugo-oc and special arrangements need to be made. There is no western style accommodation in the villages of Tulgao or Sumadel, and no accommodation at all at Sugo-oc. There is a little used foot track from Sumadel to the plateau on the southern flank of Binuluan but requires some months of planning and negotiation and a high level of fitness.|$|E

25|$|In active {{volcanic}} zones such as Yellowstone National Park, {{water may}} be heated by coming {{into contact with}} magma (molten rock). The high temperature gradient near magma may cause water to be heated enough that it boils or becomes superheated. If the water becomes so hot that it builds steam pressure and erupts in a jet above {{the surface of the}} Earth, it is called a geyser. If the water only reaches the surface in the form of steam, it is called a <b>fumarole.</b> If the water is mixed with mud and clay, it is called a mud pot.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} phreatic or steam eruption {{was reported}} from Mount Binuluan in 1952, during which a sulfur-rich debris flow killed a dozen people. Details about the eruption in 1952 are still scant. In 2007 and 2008, some 90- and 100-year-old elders in Brgy. Tulgao in Tinglayan said {{the loss of}} life in 1952 was caused by an eruption during a typhoon followed with the collapse of a natural earth bank below Sugo-oc <b>fumarole</b> field, high on the northern side of the Bunog River. The consequent mudslide buried a few houses below near the villages of Dananao and Sumadel, Tinglayan, killing maybe 12 people or thereabouts.|$|E
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{sources of the}} CO2 are {{degassing}} of intruded magma and gas release from limestone-rich metasedimentary rocks that are heated by magmatic intrusions. The remarkable uniformity in chemical and isotopic composition of the CO2 and accompanying gases at different locations around Mammoth Mountain indicates that there may actually be a large reservoir of gas deep below the mountain from which gas escapes along faults to the surface. Measurements of helium emissions support {{the theory that the}} gases emitted in the tree kill area have the same source as those discharged from Mammoth Mountain <b>Fumarole.</b> There is evidence that the rate of CO2 discharge has been declining, with emissions peaking in 1991.|$|E
