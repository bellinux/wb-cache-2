40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedIt {{is well known}} that the presence of mud deposits on the continental shelf can cause dramatic damping of ocean surface wave, but quantitative field observations are very scarce. Wave prediction models currently lack a physics-based representation of the mud-induced dissipation process, and hence the accuracy of wave predictions in muddy littoral environments is unknown. This thesis presents a comprehensive field data set for comparison with the operational wave model SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore). During February to March 2008, an extensive array of 16 wave measuring instruments were deployed on the muddy shelf of Western Louisiana in depths ranging from 13 to 4 m. Box cores were collected at all instrument sites to characterize bottom sediment properties (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2008). Analysis of local wind sea events along two cross-shore transects shows a <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> <b>waves</b> from the deeper to the shallower instruments, with the strongest decay at the muddiest site. The wave spectra evolution shows strong decay of high-frequency wind sea spectral levels and weaker decay at the lower swell frequencies.

40|$|The {{response}} of a wind-sea spectrum to sudden changes in wind directions of 180 ° and 90 ° is investigated. Numerical simulations using the third-generation wave spectral model SWAN have been undertaken at micro timescales of 30 s and fine spatial resolution {{of less than}} 10 m. The results have been validated against the wave data collected during the field campaign at Lake George, Australia. The newly implemented ‘ST 6 ’ physics in the SWAN model has been evaluated using a selection of bottom-friction terms and the two available functions for the nonlinear energy transfer: (1) exact solution of the nonlinear term (XNL), and (2) discrete interactions approximation (DIA) that parameterizes the nonlinear term. Good agreement of the modelled data is demonstrated directly with the field data and through the known experimental growth curves obtained from the extensive Lake George data set. The modelling results show that of the various combinations of models tested, the ST 6 /XNL model provides the most reliable computations of integral and spectral wave parameters. When the winds and waves are opposing (180 ° wind turn), the XNL is nearly twice as fast in the aligning the young wind-sea with the new wind direction than the DIA. In this case, the young wind-sea gradually decouples from the old waves and forms a new secondary peak. Unlike the 180 ° wind turn, there is no decoupling in the 90 ° wind turn and the entire spectrum rotates smoothly in the new direction. In both cases, the young wind-sea starts developing in the new wind direction within 10 min of the wind turn for the ST 6 while the directional {{response of}} the default physics lags behind with a response time that is nearly double of ST 6. The modelling results highlight the differences in source term balance among the different models in SWAN. During high wind speeds, the default settings provide a larger contribution from the bottom-friction dissipation than the whitecapping. In contrast, the whitecapping dissipation is dominant in ST 6 while the bottom-friction generated by the new model with ripple formation provides a significant contribution during strong winds only. During low wind speeds and non-breaking wave conditions, a separate swell or nonbreaking dissipation source term continues the <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> <b>waves</b> that cannot be dissipated by the whitecapping dissipation function...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Breaking {{waves are}} {{critical}} to the exchange of momentum, gasses, and heat between the atmosphere and ocean. In open water, these exchanges control the growth and <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> <b>waves,</b> and have implications for global heat and gas budgets. However, local geophysical properties can significantly alter these exchanges. At river inlets, strong currents influence swell that has grown over a long ocean fetch, dramatically increasing surface fluxes. The reverse effect {{is seen in the}} presence of ice, where ocean wave properties are decoupled from atmospheric forcing, decreasing exchanges across the air/sea interface. Here, measurements of ocean waves and near surface turbulence are presented to show the modification of surface boundary processes from ice and currents. Measurements from free drifting buoys at the Mouth of the Columbia River are used to evaluate wave breaking parameterizations, where breaking occurs in intermediate depths and in the presence of vertically sheared currents. Breaking waves were identified using images collected with cameras onboard the buoys, and the breaking activity is well-correlated with wave steepness. Vertical shear in the currents produces a frequency-dependent effective current that modifies the linear dispersion relation. Accounting for these sheared currents in the wavenumber spectrum is essential in calculating the correct wave steepness; without this, wave steepness can be over (under) estimated on opposing (following) currents by up to 20 %. The observed bulk wave steepness values suggest a limiting value of 0. 4. The observed fraction of breaking waves is in good agreement with several existing models, each based on wave steepness. Further, a semi-spectral model designed for all depth regimes also compares favorably with measured breaking fractions. In this model, the majority of wave breaking is predicted to occur in the higher frequency bands (i. e., short waves). There is a residual dependance on directional spreading, in which wave breaking decreases with increasing directional spread. Observations at the Columbia River Mouth are also used to investigate the source and vertical structure of turbulence in the surface boundary layer. Turbulent velocity data collected onboard SWIFT buoys were corrected for platform motions to estimate turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and TKE dissipation rates. Both of these quantities are correlated with wave steepness, which has been previously shown to determine wave breaking within the same dataset. Estimates of the turbulent length scale increase linearly with distance from the free surface, and roughness lengths estimated from velocity statistics scale with significant wave height. The vertical decay of turbulence is consistent with a balance between vertical diffusion and dissipation. Below a critical depth, a power law scaling commonly applied in the literature works well to fit the data. Above this depth, an exponential scaling fits the data well. These results, which are in a surface-following reference frame, are reconciled with results from the literature in a fixed reference frame. A mapping between free-surface referenced and mean-surface reference coordinates suggests 30 % of the TKE is dissipated above the mean sea surface. Lastly, wind, wave, turbulence, and ice measurements from the Arctic Marginal Ice Zone are used to evaluate the response of the ocean surface to a given wind stress, with a focus on the local wind input to waves and subsequent ocean surface turbulence. Observations are from the Beaufort Sea in the summer and early fall of 2014, with fractional ice cover of up to 50 %. Observations showed strong damping and directional modification of short waves, which, in turn, decreased the wind energy input to waves. Near-surface turbulent dissipation rates were also greatly reduced in partial ice cover. The reductions in waves and turbulence were balanced, suggesting that a wind-wave equilibrium is maintained in the marginal ice zone, though at levels much less than in open water. These results suggest that air-sea interactions are suppressed in the marginal ice zone relative to open ocean conditions at a given wind forcing, and this may act as a feedback mechanism in expanding a persistent marginal ice zone throughout the Arctic...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the stability of}} complex numbers called resonances in certain open chaotic systems. In the context of waves scattered by a potential, scattering resonances are complex numbers that quantize exponential decay rates of the local energy. In the context ofhyperbolic dynamical systems, Pollicott [...] Ruelle resonances quantize exponential decay rates of statistical correlations. We will show that resonances occurring in these two situations are stochastically stable. This theoretical result supports the possibility of observing resonances in experimental physics. This dissertation consists of two independent chapters, based on two papers of the author. Chapter 1 focuses on scattering resonances. We give a simple model for waves propagating through a localized disordered crystal with small typical scale of heterogeneity. Roughly speaking, our results show that resonances (hence propagating waves) are only weakly perturbed by the crystal. This chapter is organized as follows: - We describe our model and state our theorems in S 1. 1. We relate these results to previous study in the idealized case of deterministic highly oscillatory perturbations, whose understanding {{is very important for}} the proofs. - In S 1. 2, we give an overview of the theory of scattering resonances. We define them using the stationary Schrodinger resolvent and we relate them to local energy <b>decay</b> <b>of</b> <b>waves.</b> This makes Chapter 1 essentially self-contained. - S 1. 3 studies the general perturbation theory of scattering resonances. We work with a parameter that typically quantifies the degree of oscillations of a random potential. When this parameter is small enough, we characterize locally scattering resonances asthe zero set of a holomorphic function. - In S 1. 4, we give a version of the Hanson [...] Wright inequality. This is a large deviation estimate for a quadratic form evaluated at random vectors with many entries. It is crucial {{in the rest of the}} proof. We also derive a modified version of the central limittheorem, based on Lindeberg's theorem. - S 1. 5 is the core of the chapter. The tools of S 1. 4 show that the general theory developed in x 1. 3 applies to random highly oscillatory potentials. In particular, we can write their resonances as the zeroes of a random holomorphic function. We show that this randomfunction can (roughly speaking) be written as a rescaled Gaussian [...] modulo negligeable terms. The variance of the Gaussian arises from large deviation effects, while the average of the Gaussian comes from constructive interference among oscillatory terms(an effect that was thoroughly studied in the context of deterministic highly oscillatory potentials). - In S 1. 6, we prove the stochastic stability theorems. These are valid with high probability. We conclude by exhibiting an example (that appears with small probability) where the conclusions of the theorems do not hold. Chapter 2 is a study of hyperbolic dynamical systems perturbed by a white noise. These form stochastic processes called kinetic Brownian motion. We use a recent microlocal approach to define Pollicott [...] Ruelle resonances via kinetic Brownian motion. This is a form of stochastic stability. The presentation is as follows: - In S 2. 1, we state our stochastic stability result: the eigenvalues of the generator of the kinetic Brownian motion approach Pollicott [...] Ruelle resonances in the small white noise regime. We give an overview of recent results for random perturbations of the geodesic equation, and we describe related facts about the hypoelliptic Laplacian of Bismut. - In S 2. 2, we recall a modern perspective on Pollicott [...] Ruelle resonances. It consists of seeing them as spectral quantities rather than dynamical one. This requires the semiclassical construction of anisotropic Sobolev spaces, which improve regularity in the contracting direction of the flow and lower it in the expanding direction. We give an axiomatic introduction to microlocal and semiclassical analysis. - S 2. 3 presents the kinetic Brownian motion as a perturbation of the geodesic equation. We also describe its lift to the orthonormal frame bundle (a step required in S 2. 4). - In S 2. 4, we prove a subelliptic estimate for the generator of the kinetic Brownian motion. An informal probabilistic statement is as follows: the white noise perturbation is not too large compared to the kinetic Brownian motion itself. - S 2. 5 reformulates the subelliptic estimate in the context of anisotropic Sobolev spaces that are needed to define Pollicott [...] Ruelle resonances. - In S 2. 6, we show that the subelliptic estimate allows to control high frequencies of the white noise perturbation; and that the low frequencies of the white noise perturbations can be treated as an absorbing potential. This enables us to prove the main theorem...|$|E
