25|$|Kirchhoff in 1860 {{introduced}} the theoretical {{concept of a}} perfect black body with a completely absorbing surface layer of infinitely small thickness, but Planck noted some severe restrictions upon this idea. Planck noted three requirements upon a black body: the body must (<b>i)</b> <b>allow</b> radiation to enter but not reflect; (ii) possess a minimum thickness adequate to absorb the incident radiation and prevent its re-emission; (iii) satisfy severe limitations upon scattering to prevent radiation from entering and bouncing back out. As a consequence, Kirchhoff's perfect black bodies that absorb all the radiation that falls on them cannot be realized in an infinitely thin surface layer, and impose conditions upon scattering of the light within the black body {{that are difficult to}} satisfy.|$|E

Wollstonecraft considered her suicide attempt deeply rational, writing after her rescue, I have only to lament, that, when the bitterness of death was past, I was inhumanly brought back to life and misery. But a fixed determination is not to be baffled by disappointment; nor will <b>I</b> <b>allow</b> that to be a frantic attempt, {{which was one of the}} calmest acts of reason. In this respect, I am only accountable to myself. Did I care for what is termed reputation, it is by other circumstances that I should be dishonoured.|$|E

2500|$|The Imperial Academy of Arts, closely {{supervised}} by Nicholas, supported {{studies of the}} Orient and specifically Byzantium, but Nicholas himself despised Byzantine architecture. Ivan Strom, one of {{the architects of the}} cathedral of Saint Vladimir in Kiev, recalled Nicholas saying [...] "I cannot stand this style, yet, unlike others, <b>I</b> <b>allow</b> it" [...] (...) [...] Royal approval was made possible by the academic studies of the architecture of Kievan Rus in the 1830s–1840s that, for the first time, attempted to reconstruct the initial shape of Kievan cathedrals and established them as the missing link between Byzantium and the architecture of Veliky Novgorod.|$|E
2500|$|But the Church of the East {{was with}} Babai. In 604, the Catholicos Mar Sabrisho I died {{and a new}} Catholicos had to be elected. The choice fell between two men named Gregory: Bishop Gregory of Nisibis and Professor Gregory of Seleucia. King Khosrau II, the Sassanid emperor, stated only that his {{preferred}} candidate was Gregory, possibly meaning the bishop. [...] The king's influential wife Shirin, however, disliked Gregory of Nisibis and preferred Gregory of Seleucia, {{who had once been}} her steward. The Synod (council) rejected the king's initial candidate, taking advantage of the ambiguity of name, and chose Gregory of Seleucia, who became Mar Gregorius I. The king was accordingly displeased, and reluctantly supported the elected candidate (after applying a hefty fine to him), and said, [...] "Patriarch he is and patriarch he shall be – but never again do <b>I</b> <b>allow</b> another election." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bakunin {{thought that}} [...] "Does it follow that I reject all {{authority}}? Far from {{me such a}} thought.

For such or such special knowledge I apply to such or such a savant. But <b>I</b> <b>allow</b> neither the bootmaker nor the architect nor savant to impose his authority upon me. I listen to them freely and with all the respect merited by their intelligence, their character, their knowledge, reserving always my incontestable right of criticism and censure. I do not content myself with consulting a single authority in any special branch; I consult several; I compare their opinions, and choose that which seems to me the soundest. But I recognise no infallible authority, even in special questions; consequently, whatever respect I may have for the honesty and the sincerity of such or such individual, I have no absolute faith in any person." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Battle of Jiangling in 209, Cao Cao left Li Dian, Zhang Liao and Yue Jin {{to defend}} Hefei, a {{strategic}} location {{at the border}} between Cao Cao and Sun Quan's territories. Around 214, when Sun Quan led his forces to attack Hefei, Zhang Liao wanted to lead their troops {{out of the city}} to resist the enemy. However, Zhang Liao was aware that the three of them could not get along with each other and he was worried that they would not comply with his orders. Zhang Liao said, [...] "Our lord is away at war. By the time his reinforcements reach here, we're already done for. So he's actually instructing us {{to take advantage of the}} situation, when the enemy has just arrived and not fully gathered yet, to attack them and devastate their morale so as to calm our men and strengthen our defences. Victory or defeat, it all depends on this battle. Why are the two of you still hesitating?" [...] Li Dian was moved and he said, [...] "This is a national crisis. We'll see how your strategy works out. How can <b>I</b> <b>allow</b> my personal issues take precedence over my official duties?" [...] Zhang Liao, Li Dian and Yue Jin then worked together and succeeded in defeating and driving away Sun Quan's much larger army. Li Dian was rewarded with an additional 100 taxable households in his marquisate, bringing the total number of households to 300.|$|E
