5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} to simply drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, although it may be acceptable <b>for</b> <b>patient</b> transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the arterial to end-tidal partial pressure gradient of carbon dioxide according to age in the supine position during general anesthesia.

The anesthetic charts of these 596 patients, all classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, were retrospectively reviewed to investigate the accuracy of PaCO 2 and ETCO 2.

40|$|Purpose:. This study {{evaluates the}} role of {{liposomal}} bupivacaine in implant-based breast reconstruction. Methods:. A prospective, randomized, single-blind trial of liposomal bupivacaine in implant-based breast reconstruction was performed. Patients in the control arm were treated with 20 [*]mL 0. 25 % bupivacaine with epinephrine 1 : 200, 000 to each breast pocket. Patients in the experimental arm were treated with 10 [*]mL 1. 3 % liposomal bupivacaine delivered to each breast pocket. Pain scores were recorded {{over the course of}} patients’ hospital stay. Consumption of pain medications, benzodiazepines, and anti-emetics was monitored. Length of stay and other direct cost data were collected. Results:. Twenty-four patients were enrolled, with 12 women randomized to each arm. Average postoperative pain scores were 3. 66 <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> in the control arm and 3. 68 <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> in the experimental arm. Opioid consumption was 1. 43 morphine equivalent dosing/h <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> in the control arm and 0. 76 morphine equivalent dosing/h <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> in the experimental arm (P = 0. 017). Diazepam consumption was 0. 348 [*]mg/h <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> in the control arm and 0. 176 [*]mg/h <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> in the experimental arm (P = 0. 011). Average length of hospital stay was 46. 7 hours <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> in the control arm and 29. 8 hours <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> in the experimental arm (P = 0. 035). Average hospital charges were $ 18, 632 <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> in the control arm and $ 10, 828 <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> in the experimental arm (P = 0. 039). Conclusions:.
