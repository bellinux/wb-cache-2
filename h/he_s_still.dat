40|$|The Hanns Heiman Manuscripts Collection at the LBI Archives {{contains}} ten original typescripts, covering {{various topics}} of German, Jewish, and leftist intellectual interest, including emigration; economics; Goethe; Heine; Humboldt; Moses Hess; and others. Hanns Heiman was born 1879 in Frankfurt and devoted himself to business {{because of his}} family's financial status. He nevertheless studied at universities and got a PhD at the University of Heidelberg with a thesis {{on the history of}} navigation on the Neckar river. Dr. Heiman worked as a corporation lawyer in Berlin until his forced emigration to Ecuador in the 1930 <b>s.</b> <b>He</b> <b>still</b> taught in Ecuadorian higher education for a short while before retirement.

In 1974, the literary estate of Hanns Heiman was presented to the Leo Baeck Institute in New York by David Bronsen, Prof. at the department of Germanic languages and literature at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Prof. Bronsen had met Hanns Heiman in Ecuador, where he was the intellectual center for a few refugees and conducted a humanities course for some of them. Heiman’s widow donated his library to Washington University. Offprints and published materials by Hanns Heiman are available in the LBI Library...|$|R

30|$|A third, {{critical}} and emancipatory approach {{was shaped by}} idealistic, somewhat utopian viewpoints, as epitomized by the German-Austrian historian Robert Jungk, the German political scientist Ossip K. Flechtheim and the Norwegian philosopher and father of peace research Johan Galtung. They were all shaped by a social philosophical and critical epistemology that was close to Critical Theory, and they were moulded by an understanding of society that focused on human beings, {{an awareness of the}} development of time in history and a historical-dialectic approach to science, which reflected the role of the scientist in the cognitive process. Moreover, this approach stemmed from a branch of the political left which aspired to emancipate human beings from the constrictive political, economic and spiritual structures of the “system”, and thus it was also tied up with emerging peace research. Jungk had published the bestseller “Die Zukunft hat schon begonnen: Amerikas Allmacht und Ohnmacht” (“Tomorrow is already here”) in 1952, in which he accused US civilization of an excessive belief in technological progress, domesticating both nature and man [50 Jungk]. In the 1960 <b>s</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> rejected atomic weapons, but was more open for the promises of the Technical Age. Similarly to Galtung and Flechtheim, he voted in a utopian mode for a “homo novus” (New Man) creating his own future and combining planning and participation [51 Jungk, p. 515; cf 52, 53 Jungk; 55 Jungk & Galtung; 91 Seefried, p 159 – 62]. Principally, this approach was inextricably linked with ideas of participation and civil society, stimulating new social movements on a transnational and global scale emerging in the 1960 s [109 Wittner; 7 Andersson].|$|R
