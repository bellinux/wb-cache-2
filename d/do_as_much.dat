5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters are sitting in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people <b>do?</b> <b>As</b> <b>much</b> as nothing. A tired, weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with the Polish Press Agency, Michael Schudrich, chief rabbi of Poland, said that never in history did anyone <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> for Christian-Jewish dialogue as Pope John Paul II, adding that many Jews had a greater respect for the late pope than for some rabbis. Schudrich praised John Paul II for condemning anti-Semitism as a sin, which no previous pope had done.|$|E

5000|$|Philip Gossetts {{contributions}} to opera scholarship {{and how they}} can influence operatic performance may best be summed up by Newsdays comment that [...] "some encomiasts claim that soprano Maria Callas <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> for Italian opera as Arturo Toscanini or Verdi. Musicologist Philip Gossett arguably has <b>done</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> for Italian opera as any of those geniuses." ...|$|R

25|$|On 9 August, {{the head}} of UNESCO, Irina Bokova deplored a NATO strike on Libyan State TV, Al-Jamahiriya, that killed 3 journalists and wounded others. Bokova {{declared}} that media outlets {{should not be the}} target of military activities. On 11 August, after the NATO airstrike on Majer (on 9 August) that allegedly killed 85 civilians, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on all sides to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible to avoid killing innocent people.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{computer}} industry, programming was done in assembly language or machine code, which encouraged powerful and easy-to-use instructions. CPU designers therefore tried to make instructions that would <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> work as feasible. With the advent of higher level languages, computer architects also started to create dedicated instructions to directly implement certain central mechanisms of such languages. Another general goal was to provide every possible addressing mode for every instruction, known as orthogonality, to ease compiler implementation. Arithmetic operations could therefore often have results as well as operands directly in memory (in addition to register or immediate).|$|E
25|$|Crossbreeding to take {{advantage}} of the increased chance that a recessive detrimental allele will only be inherited from one parent, and therefore not expressed in the phenotype of the offspring, is only one strategy breeders can use to decrease the incidences of genetic defects. Knowing the disease incidence in the breed, and the genetic history of the individual, is ultimately important in dog breeding. Having the parental dogs genetically tested for defects known to be troublesome to their breed (or breeds, in the case of mixed parentage) may <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much,</b> or more, than simply choosing dissimilar individuals with functional reproductive tracts. Genetic health must be approached from many angles.|$|E

'Now, that cottage preaching,' said Mr. Pilgrim, mixing {{himself a}} strong glass of 'cold without,' 'I {{was talking about}} it to our Parson Ely the other day, and he doesn't approve of it at all. He said it <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> harm <b>as</b> good to give a too {{familiar}} aspect to religious teaching.

25|$|Daniel Roebuck's first {{association}} with Griffith {{was working on}} the set of NBC's Matlock (at {{the end of the first}} season in 1987), having a limited scene with him as one of the young doctors who overheard Griffith's complaints that his belly ached. At that time, he didn't play Cliff Lewis. Later, Roebuck filled in as one of Matlock's lawyer assistants. Roebuck got the call from Fred Silverman, Dean Hargrove, and Andy Griffith to replace Clarence Gilyard, Jr. as Cliff Lewis for the final three seasons after Matlock moved to ABC. The show simultaneously moved from Los Angeles, California, to Wilmington, North Carolina, where Griffith did not have to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> traveling.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Aragon {{provided}} new ships {{to help maintain}} the siege: the Vice Admiral of Valencia, Jaime Escribano, arrived in mid-August with ten Aragonese galleys. These boats and another fifteen Castilian ships commanded by Admiral Egidio Boccanegra were sent to Ceuta to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> damage {{as possible to the}} fleet of the King of Morocco, who was waiting at this port for the arrival of the fleet from Granada to go to Algeciras' aid. In the first encounter, the Christians tried to surprise the Muslim fleet by sending into combat only the fifteen Castilian ships, while the Aragonese ships maneuvered as if preparing to go to the aid of the Moroccans. The strategy would have been expensive to the Moroccans had they not captured a Castilian sailor before the final encounter, who warned them of the ruse. The ships from Ceuta quickly returned to port and the Christian fleet had to return to the Bay of Algeciras. On his return back at the siege, Egidio Boccanegra sent twenty of his ships to wait at Getares, ready to intercept the Moors if they decided to attack the encirclement.|$|E
500|$|... is a manga series {{written and}} drawn by Nobuhiro Watsuki. It follows Kazuki Muto, who becomes an alchemical warrior {{in the battle}} against alchemical monsters known as homunculi. Watsuki envisioned the manga as his last shōnen manga, and then he tried to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as he could with that genre. It was {{serialized}} in Shueisha's magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from June 2003 to April 2005. The individual chapters were republished by Shueisha in ten tankōbon volumes. The series has been licensed by Viz Media for North American release.|$|E

500|$|For dream {{sequences}} in Inception, Nolan used little computer-generated imagery, preferring {{practical effects}} whenever possible. Nolan said, [...] "It's always {{very important to}} me to <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible in-camera, and then, if necessary, computer graphics are very useful to build on or enhance what you have achieved physically." [...] To this end, visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin built a miniature of the mountain fortress set and then blew it up for the film. For the fight scene that takes place in zero gravity, he used CG-based effects to [...] "subtly bend elements like physics, space and time." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of Doomfist's release, the Overwatch meta-game was favoring [...] "dive" [...] compositions, using a {{character}} that can jump over a great distance like Winston or D.Va. Players using these characters would self-sacrifice themselves by jumping into or behind an enemy front-line, and <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> damage as possible, distracting that team from a major push. About a month after Doomfist's addition, the [...] "dive" [...] strategy had become readily countered as Doomfist can quickly eliminate either the singular threat or the oncoming group particularly when coupled with crowd-control skills like Zarya's or Reinhardt's ultimates.|$|E

500|$|In October 1918, Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper {{planned a}} final, climactic {{attack on the}} British by the High Seas Fleet. The planned {{operation}} called for raids on Allied shipping in the Thames estuary and Flanders to draw out the Grand Fleet. The German fleet would then attack the Grand Fleet and <b>do</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> damage as possible {{in order to enhance}} Germany's military position in the coming peace talks. Nürnberg, [...] and [...] were assigned to the force tasked with attacking Flanders. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day.

500|$|After Orr {{signed with}} Chicago, the Black Hawks gave him {{permission}} {{to play for}} Team Canada in the 1976 Canada Cup tournament. Orr did not play in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union, and he wanted badly to play for Canada. Orr {{had been unable to}} play in the Summit Series due to knee surgery, although he did participate as a non-player. Orr's participation in the Canada Cup was considered ill-conceived and Eagleson later thought {{it may have been the}} 'last straw' that killed his career. Orr himself said that he knew before the tournament that [...] "I knew I didn't have much longer. That series didn't do it. I thought I could get the next season in, but not much after that.
