Sydney Camm and the design team immediately ruled out pilot error, which had been suspected in earlier crashes. Investigation revealed that the elevator mass-balance had torn away from the fuselage structure. Intense flutter developed, the structure failed and the tail broke away. Modification 286 to the structure and the control runs partially solved the structural problem. (The 1940 Philip Lucas test flight incident had been due to an unrelated failing.) Mod 286, which involved fastening external fishplates, or reinforcing plates, around {{the tail of the}} aircraft, and eventually internal strengthening, was only a partial remedy, and there were still failures right up {{to the end of the}} Typhoon's service life. The Sabre engine was also a constant source of problems, notably in colder weather, when it was very difficult to start, and it suffered problems with wear of its sleeve valves, with consequently high oil consumption. The 24-cylinder engine also produced a very high-pitched engine note, which pilots found very <b>fatiguing.</b>|$|E

A static <b>fatigue</b> model that captures the static relationships between <b>fatigue,</b> significant factors that cause <b>fatigue,</b> and various sensory observations that typically result from <b>fatigue</b> is first presented. Such a model provides mathematically coherent and sound basis for systematically aggregating uncertain evidences from different sources, augmented with relevant contextual information. The static model, however, fails to capture the dynamic aspect of <b>fatigue.</b> <b>Fatigue</b> is a cognitive state that is developed over time. To account for the temporal aspect of human <b>fatigue,</b> the static <b>fatigue</b> model is extended based on dynamic Bayesian networks. The dynamic <b>fatigue</b> model allows to integrate <b>fatigue</b> evidences not only spatially but also temporally, therefore, leading to a more robust and accurate <b>fatigue</b> modeling and inference.

The main outcomes were <b>fatigue,</b> chronic <b>fatigue,</b> and chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome, operationally defined. RESULTS. The incidence over 4 to 6 months was 30. 3 % for <b>fatigue,</b> 1. 1 % for chronic <b>fatigue,</b> and 0. 5 % for chronic <b>fatigue</b> syndrome.
