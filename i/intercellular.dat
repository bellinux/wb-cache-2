5|$|Examples of glycerophospholipids {{found in}} {{biological}} membranes are phosphatidylcholine (also known as PC, GPCho or lecithin), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE or GPEtn) and phosphatidylserine (PS or GPSer). In addition to {{serving as a}} primary component of cellular membranes and binding sites for intra- and <b>intercellular</b> proteins, some glycerophospholipids in eukaryotic cells, such as phosphatidylinositols and phosphatidic acids are either precursors of or, themselves, membrane-derived second messengers. Typically, {{one or both of}} these hydroxyl groups are acylated with long-chain fatty acids, but there are also alkyl-linked and 1Z-alkenyl-linked (plasmalogen) glycerophospholipids, as well as dialkylether variants in archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, {{and some}} DNAs are transported through the pore {{complexes}} {{in a process}} mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins. Steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, {{as well as other}} small lipid-soluble molecules involved in <b>intercellular</b> signaling, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There they serve as transcription factors when bound to their ligand; {{in the absence of a}} ligand, many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of tracheation of the wings begin before the wing histoblast form, {{as it is}} important to note that they develop near a large trachea. During the fourth instar, cells from the epithelium of this trachea become greatly enlarged extend into the cavity of the wing bud, with each cell having developed a closely coiled tracheole. Each trachcole is of unicellular origin, and is at first intracellular in position; while tracheae are of multicellular origin and the lumen of each is <b>intercellular</b> in position. The {{development of}} tracheoles, each coiled within a single cell of the epithelium of a trachea, and the subsequent opening of communication between the tracheoles and the lumen of the trachea, and the uncoiling and stretching out of the tracheoles, so that they reach all parts of the wing.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} pressure {{exerted by}} the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations {{such as these}} are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and <b>intercellular</b> communication.|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little <b>intercellular</b> space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{respiratory}} tract has a branching structure {{like that of}} a tree. In the embryo this structure is developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. In the development of the lungs (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes.The lung has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. Each bronchus branches into bronchioles. The branching {{is a result of the}} tip of each tube bifurcating. The branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the alveoli. The four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in the lung are the <b>intercellular</b> signalling protein – sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4. FGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. FGF10 is a paracrine signalling molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. The development of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{with high}} {{concentration}} of antibodies show <b>intercellular,</b> intraepidermal antibodies as well as along the dermoepidermal junction. Patients with low concentration of antibodies only present with them inside the cells (<b>intercellular).</b>|$|E
25|$|Water {{absorption}} at {{the colon}} typically proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. The standing gradient osmosis is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines. Cells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the <b>intercellular</b> space, raising the osmolarity of the <b>intercellular</b> fluid. This hypertonic fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives {{water into the}} lateral <b>intercellular</b> spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium ions are pumped again into the <b>intercellular</b> fluid. Although water travels down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the <b>intercellular</b> fluid. This allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.|$|E
25|$|Ensures that {{molecules}} and current {{passing through the}} gap junction do not leak into the <b>intercellular</b> space.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} {{important}} roles in development, <b>intercellular</b> signaling, and cell cycle, some human diseases {{have been associated with}} mutations in transcription factors.|$|E
25|$|At gap junctions, the <b>intercellular</b> {{space is}} between 2 and 4 nm and unit connexons in the {{membrane}} of each cell are aligned with one another.|$|E
25|$|One gap {{junction}} channel {{is composed of}} two connexons (or hemichannels), which connect across the <b>intercellular</b> space. Gap junctions are analogous to the plasmodesmata that join plant cells.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{a series}} of {{high-profile}} experiments suggests that the co-option of <b>intercellular</b> cross-talk mediated by exosome vesicles is a critical factor involved in all steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade.|$|E
25|$|Detection {{in other}} {{locations}} such as <b>intercellular</b> and areas below the epidermis (subepidermal), {{as well as}} along the dermoepidermal junction (area that joins the epidermis and dermis), suggests paraneoplastic pemphigus.|$|E
25|$|These choanoflagellates {{are capable}} of forming colonies via fine <b>intercellular</b> bridges that allow the {{individual}} cells to attach. These bridges resemble ring canals that link developing spermatogonia or oogonia in animals.|$|E
25|$|The <b>intercellular</b> {{adhesion}} molecules ICAM-1 and soluble ICAM-1 have antagonistic {{effects on}} the tight junctions forming the blood-testis barrier. ICAM-2 molecules regulate spermatid adhesion on the apical side of the barrier (towards the lumen).|$|E
25|$|Creatine {{increases}} what {{is known}} as cell volumization by drawing water into muscle cells, making them larger. This intracellular retention {{should not be confused with}} the common myth that creatine causes bloating (or <b>intercellular</b> water retention).|$|E
25|$|As an <b>intercellular</b> signal molecule, indole regulates {{various aspects}} of {{bacterial}} physiology, including spore formation, plasmid stability, resistance to drugs, biofilm formation, and virulence. A number of indole derivatives have important cellular functions, including neurotransmitters such as serotonin.|$|E
25|$|Gap {{junctions}} are {{a specialized}} <b>intercellular</b> connection between {{a multitude of}} animal cell-types. They directly connect the cytoplasm of two cells, which allows various molecules, ions and electrical impulses to directly pass through a regulated gate between cells.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other {{mycorrhizal}} relationships, such as arbuscular mycorrhiza and ericoid mycorrhiza, ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate their host’s cell walls. Instead, {{they form}} an entirely <b>intercellular</b> interface, consisting of highly branched hyphae forming a latticework between epidermal and cortical root cells, {{known as the}} Hartig net.|$|E
25|$|Those {{that live}} inside the host, {{including}} all parasitic worms (helminths), are called endoparasites. Endoparasites can exist {{in one of}} two forms: <b>intercellular</b> parasites (inhabiting spaces in the host's body) or intracellular parasites (inhabiting cells in the host's body). Coinfection by multiple parasites is common.|$|E
25|$|At {{freezing}} temperatures, {{water in}} the <b>intercellular</b> spaces of plant tissues freezes first, though the water may remain unfrozen until temperatures fall below 7nbsp&°C. After the initial formation of ice intercellularly, the cells shrink as water is lost to the segregated ice. The cells undergo freeze-drying, the dehydration being the basic cause of freezing injury.|$|E
25|$|For {{several types}} of <b>intercellular</b> {{signaling}} molecules that are unable to permeate the hydrophobic cell membrane due to their hydrophilic nature, the target receptor is expressed on the membrane. When such a signaling molecule activates its receptor, the signal is carried into the cell usually {{by means of a}} second messenger such as cAMP.|$|E
25|$|Regulation of {{immune system}} {{activity}} and inflammation: Chemokine receptors bind ligands that mediate <b>intercellular</b> communication between {{cells of the}} immune system; receptors such as histamine receptors bind inflammatory mediators and engage target cell types in the inflammatory response. GPCRs are also involved in immune-modulation and directly involved in suppression of TLR-induced immune responses from T cells.|$|E
25|$|Research {{since the}} mid-1990s has shown that astrocytes {{propagate}} <b>intercellular</b> Ca2+ waves over long distances in response to stimulation, and, similar to neurons, release transmitters (called gliotransmitters) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Data suggest that astrocytes also signal to neurons through Ca2+-dependent release of glutamate. Such discoveries have made astrocytes an important area of research {{within the field of}} neuroscience.|$|E
25|$|The {{host plant}} exerts a {{control over the}} <b>intercellular</b> hyphal {{proliferation}} and arbuscule formation. There is a decondensation of the plant's chromatin, which indicates increased transcription of the plant's DNA in arbuscule-containing cells. Major modifications are required in the plant host cell to accommodate the arbuscules. The vacuoles shrink and other cellular organelles proliferate. The plant cell cytoskeleton is reorganized around the arbuscules.|$|E
25|$|Some {{sugarcane}} {{varieties are}} capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen {{in association with the}} bacterium Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus. Unlike legumes and other nitrogen-fixing plants that form root nodules in the soil in association with bacteria, G. diazotrophicus lives within the <b>intercellular</b> spaces of the sugarcane's stem. Coating seeds with the bacteria is a newly developed technology that can enable every crop species to fix nitrogen for its own use.|$|E
25|$|The human CoV SARS binds to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE II. The ACE II is {{also called}} 'L-SIGN (liver/lymph node-specific {{intracellular}} adhesion molecules-3 grabbing non-integrin). Coronaviruses bind to macrophages via the Dendritic Cell-Specific <b>Intercellular</b> adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin (DC-SIGN) {{which is a}} trans-membrane protein encoded in humans by the CD209 gene. ACE and DC-SIGN are two trans-membrane retrovirus receptors (mannose receptors) which can bind 'the plant lectins C-type mannose binding '.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authors have}} shown that {{endogenous}} methane is produced {{not only by the}} intestinal flora and then absorbed into the blood, but also is produced - in small amounts - by eukaryotic cells (during process of lipid peroxidation). And they have also shown that the endogenous methane production rises during an experimental mitochondrial hypoxia, for example, sodium azide intoxication. They thought that methane could be one of <b>intercellular</b> signals of hypoxia and stress.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{tenacity}} of Anna Gurwitsch, {{together with the}} development of the photon counter multiplier, resulted in the confirmation of the phenomenon of biophotons in 1962. The observation was duplicated in a western laboratory by Quickenden and Que Hee in 1974. In the same year Dr. V. P. Kaznacheyev announced that his research team in Novosibirsk had detected <b>intercellular</b> communication by means of these rays. Fritz-Albert Popp claims they exhibit coherent patterns. These studies have drawn only fringe interest.|$|E
25|$|Boettcher's {{cells are}} found in the organ of Corti where they are present only in the lower turn of the cochlea. They lie on the basilar {{membrane}} beneath Claudius' cells and are organized in rows with the number of rows the number of which varies between species. The cells interdigitate with each other, and project microvilli into the <b>intercellular</b> space. They are supporting cells for the auditory hair cells in the organ of Corti. They are named after German pathologist Arthur Böttcher (1831-1889).|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} signal {{transduction}} is {{the transformation of}} a certain stimulus into a biochemical signal. The nature of such stimuli can vary widely, ranging from extracellular cues, such {{as the presence of}} EGF, to intracellular events, such as the DNA damage resulting from replicative telomere attrition. Traditionally, signals that reach the central nervous system are classified as senses. These are transmitted from neuron to neuron in a process called synaptic transmission. Many other <b>intercellular</b> signal relay mechanisms exist in multicellular organisms, such as those that govern embryonic development.|$|E
25|$|Indole is an {{aromatic}} heterocyclic {{organic compound}} with formula C8H7N. It has a bicyclic structure, consisting of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered nitrogen-containing pyrrole ring. Indole is widely distributed in the natural environment and can be produced {{by a variety of}} bacteria. As an <b>intercellular</b> signal molecule, indole regulates various aspects of bacterial physiology, including spore formation, plasmid stability, resistance to drugs, biofilm formation, and virulence. The amino acid tryptophan is an indole derivative and the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin.|$|E
25|$|All {{animals are}} {{composed}} of eukaryotic cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins. This may be calcified to form structures like shells, bones, and spicules. During development, it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized, making complex structures possible. In contrast, other multicellular organisms, like plants and fungi, have cells {{held in place by}} cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth. Also, unique to animal cells are the following <b>intercellular</b> junctions: tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.|$|E
25|$|The {{receptor}} {{is normally}} triggered via direct cell-to-cell contact, {{in which the}} transmembrane proteins of the cells in direct contact form the ligands that bind the notch receptor. The Notch binding allows groups of cells to organize themselves such that, if one cell expresses a given trait, this may be switched off in neighbouring cells by the <b>intercellular</b> notch signal. In this way, groups of cells influence one another to make large structures. Thus, lateral inhibition mechanisms are key to Notch signaling. lin-12 and Notch mediate binary cell fate decisions, and lateral inhibition involves feedback mechanisms to amplify initial differences.|$|E
25|$|For the {{treatment}} of rheumatoid arthritis, inhibition of DHFR is not {{thought to be the}} main mechanism, but rather multiple mechanisms appear to be involved, including the inhibition of enzymes involved in purine metabolism, leading to accumulation of adenosine; inhibition of T cell activation and suppression of <b>intercellular</b> adhesion molecule expression by T cells; selective down-regulation of B cells; increasing CD95 sensitivity of activated T cells; and inhibition of methyltransferase activity, leading to deactivation of enzyme activity relevant to immune system function. Another mechanism of MTX is the inhibition of the binding of interleukin 1-beta to its cell surface receptor.|$|E
