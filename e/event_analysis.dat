50|$|The first {{assumption}} is often {{but not always}} valid and should be tested {{on a case by}} case basis. The second {{assumption is}} often valid if the extreme events are observed under similar climate conditions. For example, if the extreme events on record all come from late summer thunder storms (as is the case in the southwest U.S.), or from snow pack melting (as is the case in north-central U.S.), then this assumption should be valid. If, however, there are some extreme events taken from thunder storms, others from snow pack melting, and others from hurricanes, then this assumption is most likely not valid. The third assumption is only a problem when trying to forecast a low, but maximum flow event (for example, an event smaller than a 2-year flood). Since this is not typically a goal in extreme analysis, or in civil engineering design, then the situation rarely presents itself. The final assumption about stationarity is difficult to test from data for a single site because of the large uncertainties in even the longest flood records (see next section). More broadly, substantial evidence of climate change strongly suggests that the probability distribution is also changing and that managing flood risks in the future will become even more difficult. The simplest implication of this is that not all of the historical data are, or can be, considered valid as input into the extreme <b>event</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In high-energy hadron {{reactions}} one distinguishes peripheral reactions {{with low}} multiplicity and central collisions with high multiplicity. Peripheral reactions are also {{characterized by the}} existence of a leading particle which retains {{a large proportion of the}} incoming energy. By taking the notion of peripheral literally Ref.2 suggested that in this kind of reaction the surface of the colliding hadrons is locally excited giving rise to a hot spot, which is de-excited by two processes: 1) emission of particles into the vacuum 2) propagation of “heat” into the body of the target (projectile) wherefrom it is eventually also emitted through particle production. Particles produced in process 1) will have higher energies than those due to process 2), because in the latter process the excitation energy is in part degraded. This gives rise to an asymmetry with respect to the leading particle, which should be detectable in an experimental event by <b>event</b> <b>analysis.</b> This effect was confirmed by Jacques Goldberg [...] in K− p→ K− p π+ π− reactions at 14 GEV/c. This experiment represents the first observation of local equilibrium in hadronic interactions, allowing in principle a quantitative determination of heat conductivity in hadronic matter along the lines of Ref.3 [...] This observation came as a surprise, because, although the electron proton scattering experiments had shown beyond any doubt that the nucleon had a finite size, it was a-priori not clear whether this size was sufficiently big for the hot spot effect to be observable, i. e. whether heat conductivity in hadronic matters was sufficiently small. Experiment4 suggests that this is the case.|$|E
40|$|<b>Event</b> history <b>{{analysis}}</b> seems {{ideally suited}} {{for the analysis of}} World Fertility Survey (WFS) data, which consists of full birth histories and related information. However, it has not been much used for this purpose, and most analyses of WFS data have consisted of tabulations of standard fertility rates, and regressions with children ever born as the dependent variable, both of which have disadvantages. We suggest that this is because <b>event</b> history <b>analysis</b> has practical drawbacks for WFS data, even though, in principle, it provides a superior analytic framework. These are the many partial dates, the computational burden of discrete-time <b>event</b> history <b>analysis,</b> the need to take account of five clocks at once (age, period, cohort, time since last event, and parity), and the difficulty of interpreting the coefficients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare an <b>event</b> <b>{{analysis}}</b> and a trend analysis for the detection of progression in glaucomatous visual field loss. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Excluding initial fields (Octopus, Haag-Streit AG, Köniz, Switzerland), baseline was defined as the average result of the second and third examinations. Eyes with at least 6 additional fields entered the study. The <b>event</b> <b>analysis</b> used the method of the Collaborative Normal Tension Glaucoma Study, and the trend analysis was based on a point-wise linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 251 glaucoma patients, 235 left eyes and 225 right eyes qualified for the study. Using the <b>event</b> <b>analysis,</b> 44 series suggested a progressive damage, while the point-wise regression approach disclosed only 14 progressing series. In 9 eyes, the two approaches were concordant. Among the latter, 1 - 5 additional fields were necessary in 7 series to disclose progression using the trend analysis. In one series, the <b>event</b> <b>analysis</b> showed progression 7 examinations later. CONCLUSIONS: The point-wise linear regression analysis classified fewer cases as progressing than the <b>event</b> <b>analysis</b> and determined progression later...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The goal {{of online}} <b>event</b> <b>analysis</b> is to detect events and track their {{associated}} documents {{in real time}} from a continuous stream of documents generated by multiple information sources. Unlike traditional text categorization methods, <b>event</b> <b>analysis</b> approaches consider the temporal relations among documents. However, such methods suffer from the threshold-dependency problem, so they only perform well for a narrow range of thresholds. In addition, if {{the contents of a}} document stream change, the optimal threshold (that is, the threshold that yields the best performance) often changes as well. In this paper, we propose a threshold-resilient online algorithm, called the Incremental Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (IPLSI) algorithm, which alleviates the threshold-dependency problem and simultaneously maintains the continuity of the latent semantics to better capture the story line development of events. The IPLSI algorithm is theoretically sound and empirically efficient and effective for <b>event</b> <b>analysis.</b> The results of the performance evaluation performed on the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) - 4 corpus show that the algorithm reduces the cost of <b>event</b> <b>analysis</b> by as much as 15 percent 20 percent and increases the acceptable threshold range by 200 percent to 300 percent over the baseline.
