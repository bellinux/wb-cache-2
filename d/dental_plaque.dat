25|$|The <b>dental</b> <b>plaque</b> biofilm {{can result}} in the disease dental caries if it is allowed to develop over time. An ecologic shift away from {{balanced}} populations within the dental biofilm is driven by certain (cariogenic) microbiological populations beginning to dominate when the environment favours them. The shift to an acidogenic, aciduric, and cariogenic microbiological population develops and is maintained by frequent consumption of fermentable dietary carbohydrate. The resulting activity shift in the biofilm (and resulting acid production within the biofilm, at the tooth surface) is associated with an imbalance between demineralization and remineralisation leading to net mineral loss within dental hard tissues (enamel and then dentin), the sign and symptom being a carious lesion. By preventing the <b>dental</b> <b>plaque</b> biofilm from maturing or by returning it back to a non-cariogenic state, dental caries can be prevented and arrested. This can be achieved though the behavioural step of reducing the supply of fermentable carbohydrates (i.e. sugar intake) and frequent removal of the biofilm (i.e. toothbrushing).|$|E

25|$|Tooth decay (dental caries) {{has become}} a {{prominent}} health hazard associated with the consumption of sugars, especially sucrose. Oral bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans live in <b>dental</b> <b>plaque</b> and metabolize any sugars (not just sucrose, but also glucose, lactose, fructose, and cooked starches) into lactic acid. The resultant lactic acid lowers the pH of the tooth's surface, stripping it of minerals in the process known as tooth decay.|$|E
25|$|Biofilms may form {{on living}} or non-living {{surfaces}} {{and can be}} prevalent in natural, industrial and hospital settings. The microbial cells growing in a biofilm are physiologically distinct from planktonic cells of the same organism, which, by contrast, are single-cells that may float or swim in a liquid medium. Biofilms can be present on the teeth of most animals as <b>dental</b> <b>plaque,</b> where they may cause tooth decay and gum disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{alterations}} {{in the sense}} of taste, usually a metallic taste, and sometimes smell are the only symptoms. The duration of the symptoms of dysgeusia depends on the cause. If the alteration {{in the sense of}} taste is due to gum disease, <b>dental</b> <b>plaque,</b> a temporary medication, or a short-term condition such as a cold, the dysgeusia should disappear once the cause is removed. In some cases, if lesions are present in the taste pathway and nerves have been damaged, the dysgeusia may be permanent.|$|E
30|$|Biofilms {{are formed}} by {{microbial}} cells {{embedded in a}} matrix comprised of extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) containing polysaccharide, proteins, and DNA. The presence of this extracellular matrix provides protection to microbial pathogens from antimicrobials to host immune cells/factors (Liu et al. 2016; Hall and Mah 2017). Biofilms can form on both biotic and abiotic surfaces and are common causes of chronic infections including <b>dental</b> <b>plaques</b> (Smith et al. 2011; Song et al. 2015). The protection of EPS plus the dormancy of biofilm cells render these multicellular structures extremely difficult to eradicate (Kouidhi et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2011; Song et al. 2015).|$|R

40|$|Helicobacter pylori is an {{important}} human pathogen that causes chronic gastritis and {{is associated with the}} development of peptic ulcer disease and gastric malignancies. The oral cavity has been implicated as a potential H. pylori reservoir and may therefore be involved in the reinfection of the stomach, which can sometimes occur following treatment of an H. pylori infection. The objectives of this paper were (i) to determine the presence of H. pylori in the oral cavity and (ii) {{to examine the relationship between}} oral H. pylori and subsequent gastritis. Gastric biopsies, saliva samples and <b>dental</b> <b>plaques</b> were obtained from 78 dyspeptic adults. DNA was extracted and evaluated for the presence of H. pylori using polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting methods. Persons with gastritis were frequently positive for H. pylori in their stomachs (p < 0. 0001) and there was a statistically significant correlation between the presence of H. pylori in gastric biopsies and the oral cavity (p < 0. 0001). Our results suggest a relationship between gastric infection and the presence of this bacterium in the oral cavity. Despite this, H. pylori were present in the oral cavity with variable distribution between saliva and <b>dental</b> <b>plaques,</b> suggesting the existence of a reservoir for the species and a potential association with gastric reinfection.

25|$|Practice of good {{oral hygiene}} {{including}} daily brushing, flossing {{and the use}} of appropriate mouthwash can significantly reduce the number of oral bacteria, including S. mutans and inhibit their proliferation. S. mutans often live in <b>dental</b> <b>plaque,</b> hence mechanical removal of plaque is an effective way of getting rid of them. However, there are some remedies used in the treatment of oral bacterial infection, in conjunction with mechanical cleaning. These include Fluoride, which has a direct inhibitory effect on the enolase enzyme, as well as Chlorhexidine, which works presumably by interfering with bacterial adherence.|$|E
25|$|Dental care – Carbohydrates and sugars usually {{adhere to}} the tooth enamel, where {{bacteria}} feed upon them and quickly multiply. The bacteria convert the sugar to acids that decay the teeth. Sugar substitutes, unlike sugar, do not erode teeth as they are not fermented by the microflora of the <b>dental</b> <b>plaque.</b> A sweetener that can actually benefit dental health is xylitol, which tends to prevent bacteria from adhering to the tooth surface, thus preventing plaque formation and eventually decay. Xylitol cannot be fermented by bacteria that feed on sugar, so they have difficulty thriving, thus helping to prevent plaque formation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>plaque</b> is an oral biofilm that {{adheres to}} the teeth and {{consists}} of many species of both bacteria and fungi (such as Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans), embedded in salivary polymers and microbial extracellular products. The accumulation of microorganisms subjects the teeth and gingival tissues to high concentrations of bacterial metabolites which results in dental disease. Biofilm {{on the surface of}} teeth is frequently subject to oxidative stress and acid stress. Dietary carbohydrates can cause a dramatic decrease in pH in oral biofilms to values of 4 and below (acid stress). A pH of 4 at body temperature of 37°C causes depurination of DNA, leaving apurinic (AP) sites in DNA, especially loss of guanine.|$|E

25|$|Toothpaste is a paste or gel {{dentifrice}} {{used with}} a toothbrush as an accessory to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it serves as an abrasive that aids in removing the <b>dental</b> <b>plaque</b> and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Salt and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) are among materials that can be substituted for commercial toothpaste.

25|$|All 6-carbon sugars and disaccharides {{based on}} 6-carbon sugars can be {{converted}} by <b>dental</b> <b>plaque</b> bacteria into acid that demineralizes teeth, but sucrose may be uniquely useful to Streptococcus sanguinis (formerly Streptococcus sanguis) and Streptococcus mutans. Sucrose is the only dietary sugar that {{can be converted}} to sticky glucans (dextran-like polysaccharides) by extracellular enzymes. These glucans allow the bacteria to adhere to the tooth surface and to build up thick layers of plaque. The anaerobic conditions deep in the plaque encourage the formation of acids, which leads to carious lesions. Thus, sucrose could enable S. mutans, S. sanguinis and many other species of bacteria to adhere strongly and resist removal, e.g. by flow of saliva (although they are easily removed by brushing). The glucans and levans (fructose polysaccharides) produced by the plaque bacteria also act as a reserve food supply for the bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Biofilms {{have been}} found to be {{involved}} in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body, by one estimate 80% of all infections. Infectious processes in which biofilms have been implicated include common problems such as bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infections, catheter infections, middle-ear infections, formation of <b>dental</b> <b>plaque,</b> gingivitis, coating contact lenses, and less common but more lethal processes such as endocarditis, infections in cystic fibrosis, and infections of permanent indwelling devices such as joint prostheses, heart valves, and intervertebral disc. More recently it has been noted that bacterial biofilms may impair cutaneous wound healing and reduce topical antibacterial efficiency in healing or treating infected skin wounds. Early detection of biofilms in wounds is crucial to successful chronic wound management. Although many techniques have developed to identify planktonic bacteria in viable wounds, few have been able to quickly and accurately identify bacterial biofilms. Future studies are needed to find means of identifying and monitoring biofilm colonization at the bedside to permit timely initiation of treatment.|$|E
