The public SDK enables third-party companies and other <b>interactive</b> <b>application</b> developers to “write” applications once and see them run successfully on any device that supports the smart TV platform or middleware architecture which it was written for, no matter who the hardware manufacturer is.|$|E
500|$|The Ad Council {{claimed the}} poster was {{developed}} in 1942 by its precursor, the War Advertising Committee, {{as part of a}} [...] "Women in War Jobs" [...] campaign, helping to bring [...] "over two million women" [...] into war production. In February 2012 during the Ad Council's 70th anniversary celebration, an <b>interactive</b> <b>application</b> designed by Animax's HelpsGood digital agency was linked to the Ad Council's Facebook page. The Facebook app was called [...] "Rosify Yourself", referring to Rosie the Riveter; it allowed viewers to upload images of their faces to be incorporated into the [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] poster, then saved to be shared with friends. Ad Council President and CEO Peggy Conlon posted her own [...] "Rosified" [...] face on Huffington Post in an article she wrote about the group's 70-year history. The staff of the television show Today posted two [...] "Rosified" [...] images on their website, using the faces of news anchors Matt Lauer and Ann Curry. However, Seton Hall University professor James J. Kimble and University of Pittsburgh professor Lester C. Olson researched the origins of the poster and determined that it was not produced by the Ad Council nor was it used for recruiting women workers.|$|E

For the same reason, thoroughly testing such applications is particularly important and requires a lot of effort. Automating this activity can result to significant development cost reduction and quality improvement. This paper presents a research work aiming at defining a test modeling language for <b>interactive</b> <b>applications</b> based on task trees, called TTT. The objective of the TTT language is to provide a means for expressing abstract test scenarios for <b>interactive</b> <b>applications,</b> including non-deterministic choices and action occurrence probabilities that can be used to automate the test generation...|$|R
