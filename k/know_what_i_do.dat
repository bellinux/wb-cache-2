6000|$|... "No; I feel that. Only, it's {{so hard to}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> really think--there's always such a lot {{trying to}} make one feel that only what's nice and cosey is right!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{this is so}} unusual, that--that--well, you see indeed I am so unprepared--I don't quite <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> mean. Dear me, can't you explain? Don't you {{see that}} this is a most ex----" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{all stood}} to the toast, I with my blood a-tingle and my brain awhirl, so that <b>I</b> scarce <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “Where’s the hammer? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{with the}} hammer? Great heavens! Seven of you, gaping round there, and you don’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with the hammer!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You scoundrel!" [...] he cried, [...] "have {{you been}} prying into my private affairs? Is it your {{business}} to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in France?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear, good Maynard,' she said, {{stretching}} out her little hand, and taking {{two of his}} large fingers in her grasp, while her tears flowed fast; 'I am very cross to you. But my heart is breaking. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Good-bye.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want now. I {{had made}} up my mind a minute ago, and now it's all gone again--oh yes, I remember, the red. Yes, I'll have the red. No, I don't mean the red, I mean the grey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I am ashamed," [...] replied Joan. [...] "I don't mean that. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> mean. But still I'm {{sorry for}} Kells. I {{suffered}} so much.... Those long, {{long hours of}} suspense.... And his fortunes seemed my fortunes--my very life--and yours, too, Jim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where to?" [...] I said to Bes when we {{were outside}} the palace, for I was so broken with grief that <b>I</b> {{scarcely}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{started for}} the bedroom door, Lindy making way for her. <b>I</b> {{scarcely}} <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> as <b>I</b> sprang forward and took the Vicomtesse by the arm.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Manchester, indeed!' said Coningsby; 'if you <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> about Manchester! A pretty state we {{have been}} in in London this week past with your Manchesters and Birminghams!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{very fond}} of doughnuts," [...] she confessed [...] "Aunt Martha never makes any. But Miss Susan at Ingleside does, and {{sometimes}} she lets us have a plateful in Rainbow Valley. Do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> when I'm hungry for doughnuts and can't get any, Mrs. Elliott?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Ingleby {{appeared}} reflective. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{suppose it}} doesn't. I don't {{know how you}} manage it, Hetty, but everything seems just as one would like it when you arrange it. Still, that's not quite what I mean either. I'm really not sure I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> mean--you see, I'm sleepy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rats! Hang it all! I wish I was dead. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want to do," [...] he groaned, {{and cast}} himself upon his bed. He {{was sure of}} nothing {{but the fact that}} he was unhappy. He {{considered}} suicide in a dignified manner, but not for long enough to get much frightened about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's just it. I couldn't {{accept your}} offering. After The Morning came in, my soul revolted. I ordered the Alessandra {{manuscript}} brought in. <b>Do</b> you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it {{has been}} so," [...] she said. [...] "I cannot wash out the past. <b>Knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> of myself, Sir Peregrine, I should never have put my foot over your threshold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} to the others, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> got turned about. Did you ever stem a strawberry and throw the strawberry away and pop the stem into your mouth? That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> threw the fire-stick into the water after the mullet and {{held on to the}} dynamite. And my arm went off with the stick when it went off. [...] " ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have,' said Marion, hastily {{raising her}} head. 'You don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I MUST speak to him. You {{are the best}} and truest friend {{in all the world}} for what you have said to me, but I must take this step. Will you go with me, Clemency,' she kissed her on her {{friendly}} face, 'or shall I go alone?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't go {{that day}} at all. The next day was a half holiday, and that may have weighed with me. Perhaps, too, my state of {{inattention}} brought down impositions upon me and docked the margin of time necessary for the detour. I don't <b>know.</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> know {{is that in the}} meantime the enchanted garden was so much upon my mind that I could not keep it to myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our Lady forbid!" [...] {{said the}} glover. [...] "Did you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> {{you would be}} as much afraid of {{handling}} this matter {{as if it were}} glowing iron. But, since you will needs put your fingers in the fire, truth must be spoken. And come what will, I must say, that the matter might have ended ill for me and mine, but for the opportune assistance of Henry Gow, the armourer, well known to you all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{for poor}} Sheridan's Life; [...] Your's is sure of my very best superintendence; [...] I'll expunge what might point at your sister or wife,-- [...] And I'll thus keep my priceless, unbought independence!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{tell the}} truth, <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> expect to find. We're ostensibly practising scouting, but there's {{a batch of}} Dumfries cyclists {{scouring}} the Galloway roads, and I imagine the authorities have some reason for sending us out." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Indeed I did," [...] said Talmadge. [...] "Two women {{sat behind}} {{me at the}} Auditorium the other night. They said, 'Of course she never really drove those horses herself. Somebody doubled for her.' <b>Know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>did?</b> <b>I</b> turned around and told them, 'I wish I could show you my knees, all black and blue even yet from being cracked up against the {{dashboard}} of that chariot!'" ...|$|R
60|$|DON JUAN. Senor Commander: I do {{not blame}} your disgust: a picture gallery is a dull {{place for a}} blind man. But even as you enjoy the contemplation of such romantic mirages as beauty and pleasure; so would I enjoy the contemplation of that which {{interests}} me above all things namely, Life: the force that ever strives to attain greater power of contemplating itself. What made this brain of mine, do you think? Not the need to move my limbs; for a rat with half my brains moves as well as I. Not merely the need to do, but the need to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> lest in my blind efforts to live I should be slaying myself.|$|E
6000|$|The girl {{rose from}} her chair like a tragedienne. [...] "It isn't my body, it's my mind!" [...] she cried, with poignant inflection, {{clasping}} her head with both her hands; and her look transformed her {{in the eyes of}} the young scientist. It was the tragic gaze of one who confronts insanity and death at a time when life should be at its sweetest. For an instant she stood there absorbed in her terror, then dropped her hands, and in a voice of entreaty, which melted all his distrust, hurried on. [...] "I want to know what is going on in my brain. I am losing control of my self! I want some man of science like you to study me. Your sister said you would help me, and you must! You think I deceive--you thought so last night--but I don't. I knew nothing of what went on. I didn't know that you were there. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> nor what I am. I want you men of science to investigate me. I will submit to any test you like. You may fasten me in a cage, or padlock me down--anything!--but I will not be advertised to the world as a medium, and I must have rest from this strain. Don't you understand? Can't you see how it will be?" ...|$|E
60|$|You are {{wondering}} how I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Two months ago I GOT A LETTER FROM HIM--the strangest, quaintest, and yet THE KINDEST LETTER--exactly like {{himself and the}} way he used to talk! He had just heard of his brother's death, and congratulated me on coming into the property, and said he was now perfectly happy, and should KEEP DEAD, and never, never come to life again; that he never thought things would turn out as splendidly as they had--for Sir William MIGHT have had an heir--and that now he should REALLY DIE HAPPY. He said something about everything being legally right, and that I could do what I liked with the property. As if THAT would satisfy me! Yet it was all so sweet and kind, and so like dear old Jack, that I cried all night. And then I resolved to come here, where his letter was dated from. Luckily I was of age now, and could do as I liked, and I said I wanted to travel in South America and California; and I suppose they didn't think it very strange that I should use my liberty in that way. Some said it was quite like a Dornton! I knew something of Callao from your friend Miss Avondale, and could talk about it, which impressed them. So I started off with only a maid--my old nurse. I was a little frightened at first, when I came to think what I was doing, but everybody was very kind, and I really feel quite independent now. So, you see, a girl may be INDEPENDENT, after all! Of course I shall see Mr. Dingwall in San Francisco, but he need not know anything more than that I am traveling for pleasure. And I may go to the Sandwich Islands or Sydney, if I think HE is there. Of course I have had to use some money--some of HIS rents--but it shall be paid back. I will tell you everything about my plans when I see you.|$|E
6000|$|She replied confidentially, 'Why I am so earnest {{not to be}} {{seen with}} you is that I may appear to people to be {{independent}} of you. <b>Knowing</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> of your weaknesses <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> no otherwise. You must be schooled into--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stranger," [...] said he, [...] "excuse me for troubling you, but do {{you know}} anybody in this here town named Solomon Smothers? He's my son, and I've come down from Ellenville to visit him. Be darned if <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> with his street and number." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{it is to}} have a wanton mind o' my own, too! If you on'y <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> dream {{sometimes}} o' nights quite {{against my}} wishes, you'd say I had my struggles!" [...] (Anny, too, had grown rather serious of late, her lover having jilted her.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I told you," [...] {{he said in}} {{a quieter}} voice, [...] "that my name is Ourganeff--Alexis Ourganeff. I am a Finn by birth, but I have spent my life in every part of the world. I was one who could never be still, nor settle down to a quiet existence. After I came to own my own ship there is hardly a port from Archangel to Australia which I have not entered. I was rough and wild and free, but there was one at home, sir, who was prim and white-handed and soft-tongued, skilful in little fancies and conceits which women love. This youth by his wiles and tricks stole from me the love of the girl whom I had ever marked as my own, and who up to that time had seemed in some sort {{inclined}} to return my passion. I had been on a voyage to Hammerfest for ivory, and coming back unexpectedly I learned that my pride and treasure was to be married to this soft-skinned boy, and that the party had actually gone to the church. In such moments, sir, something gives way in my head, and I hardly <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I landed with a boat's crew--all men who had sailed with me for years, and who were as true as steel. We went up to the church. They were standing, she and he, before the priest, but the thing had not been done. I dashed between them and caught her round the waist. My men beat back the frightened bridegroom and the lookers on. We bore her down to the boat and aboard our vessel, and then getting up anchor we sailed away across the White Sea until the spires of Archangel sank down behind the horizon. She had my cabin, my room, every comfort. I slept among the men in the forecastle. I hoped that in time her aversion to me would wear away, and that she would consent to marry me in England or in France. For days and days we sailed. We saw the North Cape die away behind us, and we skirted the grey Norwegian coast, but still, in spite of every attention, she would not forgive me for tearing her from that pale-faced lover of hers. Then came this cursed storm which shattered both my ship and my hopes, and has deprived me even of the sight of the woman for whom I have risked so much. Perhaps she may learn to love me yet. You, sir," [...] he said wistfully, [...] "look like one who has seen much of the world. Do you not think that she may come to forget this man and to love me?" ...|$|E

Yonder's a work now, of that famous youth The Urbinate who died five years ago. ('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it me.) Well, I can fancy how he did it all, Pouring his soul, with kings and popes to see, Reaching, that heaven might so replenish him, Above and through his art--for it gives way; [...] 110 That arm is wrongly put--and there again-- A fault to pardon in the drawing's lines, Its body, so to speak: its soul is right, He means right--that, a child may understand. Still, what an arm! and I could alter it: But all the play, the insight and the stretch-- Out of me, out of me! And wherefore out? Had you enjoined them on me, given me soul, We might have risen to Rafael, I and you! Nay, Love, you did give all I asked, I think-- [...] 120 More than I merit, yes, by many times.

Some women do so. Had the mouth there urged [...] "God and the glory! never care for gain. The present by the future, what is that? Live for fame, side by side with Agnolo! [...] 130 Rafael is waiting: up to God, all three!" [...] I might have done it for you. So it seems: Perhaps not. All is as God over-rules. Beside, incentives come from the soul's self; The rest avail not. Why do I need you? What wife had Rafael, or has Agnolo? In this world, who can do a thing, will not; And who would do it, cannot, I perceive: Yet the will's somewhat--somewhat, too, the power-- And thus we half-men struggle. At the end, [...] 140 God, I conclude, compensates, punishes. 'T is safer for me, if the award be strict, That I am something underrated here, Poor this long while, despised, to speak the truth. I dared not, do you know, leave home all day, For fear of chancing on the Paris lords. The best is when they pass and look aside; But they speak sometimes; I must bear it all. Well may they speak! That Francis, that first time, And that long festal year at Fontainebleau! [...] 150 I surely then could sometimes leave the ground, Put on the glory, Rafael's daily wear, In that humane great monarch's golden look-- One finger in his beard or twisted curl Over his mouth's good mark that made the smile, One arm about my shoulder, round my neck, The jingle of his gold chain in my ear, I painting proudly with his breath on me, All his court round him, seeing with his eyes, Such frank French eyes, and such a fire of souls [...] 160 Profuse, my hand kept plying by those hearts-- And, best of all, this, this, this face beyond, This in the background, waiting on my work, To crown the issue with a last reward! A good time, was it not, my kingly days? And had you not grown restless [...] . but I know-- 'T is done and past; 't was right, my instinct said, Too live the life grew, golden and not gray, And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun should tempt Out of the grange whose four walls make his world. [...] 170 How could it end in any other way? You called me, and I came home to your heart. The triumph was--to reach and stay there; since I reached it ere the triumph, what is lost? Let my hands frame your face in your hair's gold, You beautiful Lucrezia that are mine! [...] "Rafael did this, Andrea painted that; The Roman's is the better when you pray, But still the other's Virgin was his wife--" [...] Men will excuse me, I am glad to judge [...] 180 Both pictures in your presence; clearer grows My better fortune, I resolve to think. For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God lives, Said one day Agnolo, his very self, To Rafael's [...] . I have known it all these years [...] . (When the young man was flaming out his thoughts Upon a palace-wall for Rome to see, Too lifted up in heart because of it) [...] "Friend, there's a certain sorry little scrub Goes up and down our Florence, none cares how, [...] 190 Who, were he set to plan and execute As you are, pricked on by your popes and kings, Would bring the sweat into that brow of yours!" [...] To Rafael's!--And indeed the arm is wrong. I hardly dare [...] . yet, only you to see, Give the chalk here--quick, thus the line should go! Ay, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it out! Still, all I care for, if he spoke the truth, (What he? why, who but Michel Agnolo? Do you forget already words like those?) [...] 200 If really there was such a chance, so lost-- Is, whether you're--not grateful--but more pleased. Well, let me think so. And you smile indeed! This hour has been an hour! Another smile? If you would sit thus by me every night I should work better, do you comprehend? I mean that I should earn more, give you more. See, it is settled dusk now; there's a star; Morello's gone, the watch-lights show the wall, The cue-owls speak the name we call them by. [...] 210 Come from the window, love--come in, at last, Inside the melancholy little house We built to be so gay with. God is just. King Francis may forgive me: oft at nights When I look up from painting, eyes tired out, The walls become illumined, brick from brick Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce bright gold, That gold of his I did cement them with! Let us but love each other. Must you go? That Cousin here again? he waits outside? [...] 220 Must see you--you, and not with me? Those loans? More gaming debts to pay? you smiled for that? Well, let smiles buy me! have you more to spend? While hand and eye and something of a heart Are left me, work's my ware, and what's it worth? I'll pay my fancy. Only let me sit The gray remainder of the evening out, Idle, you call it, and muse perfectly How I could paint, were I but back in France, One picture, just one more--the Virgin's face, [...] 230 Not yours this time!
