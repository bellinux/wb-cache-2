5|$|Mauve took Van Gogh on as {{a student}} and {{introduced}} him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas. He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague. Within a month Van Gogh and Mauve fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts. Van Gogh could afford to hire only people from the street as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved. In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital. Soon after, he first painted in oils, bought with money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. He wrote that he was surprised at <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>the</b> results were.|$|E
25|$|Sega's first {{records were}} from {{artists such as}} Men at Work, Genesis, and Fleetwood Mac. He {{discovered}} trackers {{in his first year}} of college (1993) from a friend, who showed him Future Crew's Unreal demo. Sega was amazed with <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>the</b> music sounded. He eventually discovered FastTracker 1.0, and began writing MOD music for the first time. His first demo group was Psychic Monks. Through the mid-1990s he contributed music to various demo and music groups, and music disks such as Epidemic (1994), featuring other noted tracker musicians like Purple Motion and Skaven.|$|E
25|$|This ranking is {{not based}} on quality, despite the {{creation}} of a vague Charter of Excellence (comprising only eight of the eighteen Crus). Some producers make a (lesser) second or third wine that they also mark cru classé de Provence. Also, no geographic limitation is implied, so as the producers buy and sell new plots of land, sometimes far from the original winery, the wines from those vineyards become cru classé. In addition, the list cannot be changed, no new wineries can be added and a winery cannot lose the cru classé status. The 18 lucky owners just benefit from the classification, no matter <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>the</b> wine is.|$|E

25|$|NBA 2K16 again, for {{the fourth}} time in the series, {{features}} MyTeam mode. MyTeam mode was first introduced in NBA 2K13, and is based around the idea of building the ultimate basketball team, and maintaining a virtual trading card collection. Players build their own custom team, selecting the players, current and past, jerseys, coach, court, and other basketball related things, and play with their team in basketball tournament-style competitions against other players' teams. Players collect cards that unlock players, playbooks, and other items {{that can be used in}} their team or sold. Players purchase card packs with Virtual Currency (VC) which gives the player random items. Cards have different levels that indicate <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>the</b> card is. A player will commonly receive Bronze cards if they purchase cheaper card packs. However, if the player purchases high priced packs, the chances of getting Gold cards are higher. There are also rare cards, such as Amethyst and Diamond cards, that are rarer and better than other cards. The level of a card isn't always the most important factor as the abilities of the actual player, and their rating indicating how good they are, is most often more important. Players can freely customize their team on the fly; players may change the coach, players, jerseys, and anything else at any time. Customization aspects were touted as being the major improvements for the mode.|$|E
25|$|Rugby league {{was taken}} into a new {{dimension}} by the 1982 Kangaroos side. The 'Invincibles' became {{the first team to}} win every game of the tour (15 games) including the first test by 40–4 at Hull in front of 26,771 spectators at Boothferry Park. The Kangaroos only led 10–4 at half time, but unleashed a second half onslaught that left the British game stunned. Coached by Frank Stanton and captained by Max Krilich, the Kangaroos included veterans such as Craig Young, Steve Rogers, Kerry Boustead, the fiery Les Boyd, Rod Reddy and Ray Price, as well as a crop of young players on their way to superstar status in rugby league including Mal Meninga, tour vice-captain Wally Lewis, Brett Kenny, Peter Sterling, Eric Grothe and Wayne Pearce. The second test in Wigan ended 27–6 to the visitors. During the second half of that game, Kangaroos replacement Wally Lewis fired a bullet like 20 metre pass for Meninga to score in the corner. Soundly thrashed to that point of the series, the play did psychological damage to the Lions who were left wondering just <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>the</b> Australians really were if someone who could pass like Lewis couldn't even make the starting XIII. The third test was held at Headingley, Leeds which ended 32–8, though the game was in the balance until the final ten minutes when the Kangaroos superior fitness told and they ran in four late tries. The Lions scored their only try of the series in the second half at Headingley when Hull winger Steve Evans scored. This was the beginning of an era of Australian dominance.|$|E

500|$|Malaysia had {{initially}} declined to release raw data from its military radar, deeming the information [...] "too sensitive", but later acceded. Defence experts suggested that giving others access to radar information could be sensitive {{on a military}} level, for example: [...] "The rate at which they can take the picture can also reveal <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>the</b> radar system is." [...] One suggested that some countries could already have had radar data on the aircraft, but were reluctant to share any information that could potentially reveal their defence capabilities and compromise their own security.

[...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times sardonically wrote [...] "remember <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>the</b> Michael Scott Paper Company storyline was?"

He further added that when showed a copy of Wouk's novel [...] "...I was shocked at <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>the</b> writing was".

500|$|Amy Westcott is {{credited}} as the costume designer and received several award nominations. A publicized controversy arose regarding {{the question of}} who had designed 40 ballet costumes for Portman and the dancers. An article in the British newspaper The Independent suggested those costumes had actually been created by Rodarte's Kate and Laura Mulleavy. Westcott challenged that view and stated that in all only 7 costumes, among them the black and white swan, had been created in a collaboration between Rodarte, Westcott, and Aronofsky. Furthermore, the corps ballet's costumes were designed by Zack Brown (for the American Ballet Theatre), and slightly adapted by Westcott and her costume design department. Westcott said: [...] "Controversy is too complimentary a word for two people using their considerable self-publicising resources to loudly complain about their credit once they realized <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>the</b> film is." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly negative. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C" [...] {{and called it}} a [...] "muddled, tepid bit of television that never really seems to know what story it’s trying to tell". He noted, that while the episode is built around a distinctly [...] "old structure" [...] that harkens back to the show's earlier seasons, the plot becomes predictable quickly. Ultimately, however, he concluded that the episode is compromised by its story which [...] "would’ve been a dud {{even if it had}} aired back in 1993". He did, however, compliment the character of Karin Berquist, but wished the episode would have focused more on her and Mulder's relationship. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, and noted that [...] "no matter <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>the</b> effects, there's a limit to the number of times a dog with glowing red eyes pouncing on a human can be interesting." [...] The two also were critical of the romantic connection between Mulder and Karin Berquist, calling the sub-plot [...] "an attempt to instill a bit of emotion into this repetitive and formulaic tale [...] fails utterly." ...|$|E

According to LaMartina, the scripts contributed to <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>the</b> game sounded. Many people, including himself, the creative director, the producer, and the community manager, contributed to the scripts. LaMartina stated that the collaborative effort is what made Horny the character he is.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Cut" [...] of the [...] "4 Cs" [...] is {{the most}} {{difficult}} part for a consumer to judge when selecting a good diamond.
