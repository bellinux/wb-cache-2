40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{influence}} of the geometrical interaction of different detectors with the impinging optical/laser received beam {{for a wide range of}} laser sensing applications. Although different techniques apply, it is found that similar aspects of geometrical physics plays a role in direct detection of a range-resolved large M(sup 2) OPO atmospheric Lidar, <b>heterodyne</b> multi-detector <b>reception</b> of atmospheric turbulence distorted coherent lidar type laser sensing, and the distribution and summation of laser induced fluorescence signals after being spectrally resolved with a spectrometer and detected by a column summing CCD detector. In each of these systems, the focused received light is spatially and spectrally distributed due to several factors including Field-of-View considerations, laser beam quality/divergence, multi-detector aspects, and hardware and software summation (coherent and non-coherent) of multi-element or spatially integrated signals. This invited talk will present some of our recent results in these areas and show the similarities in the detector spatial and temporal summation techniques of these different laser sensing systems...|$|R

40|$|Future {{applications}} for the Optical Ground Station (OGS) on Tenerife, Spain, are currently being investigated, e. g. the use as a ground terminal in deep space missions. The impact of atmospheric effects on the sensitivity and reliability of an optical link depends heavily on the wavelength {{and the kind of}} transmission, mainly if direct or coherent detection is employed. To simulate and evaluate the link quality in the case of coherent <b>reception</b> (<b>heterodyne</b> or homodyne), measurements of the wavefront and intensity distributions have been carried out at the OGS telescope with a Shack-Hartmann sensor, using bright stars as reference sources. A representative set of normalized measurement samples has been generated and evaluated in respect of basic parameters like scintillations, tip-tilt, and wavefront error. The complex speckle patterns at the focal plane have been computed and a superposition with a local oscillator has been simulated. The outcome of these simulations (i. e. heterodyning efficiency) depending on several parameters is presented and compared with environmental conditions...|$|R

40|$|LGEP 2014 ID = 1523 International audienceThere is {{a strong}} need for {{wideband}} and sensitive receivers in the terahertz (THz) region. This chapter focuses on the detection of continuous waves (CW) in the THz, using innovative bolometric sensors working as mixers for <b>heterodyne</b> <b>reception</b> with down conversion to the GHz range, as needed for radio astronomy, remote sensing, or passive imaging. In this case, the coupling to the incident THz radiation is accomplished by means of multi-octave planar micro-antennas. After selecting the antenna shape as angular, self-complementary, and/or self-similar, various antenna geometries are studied, namely, bow tie, Sierpinski fractal, sinuous, and log-periodic. Delivered power, directivity, and radiation pattern are discussed. According to seven criteria, the log-periodic antenna is preferred...|$|E

In this paper, we evaluate the absolute field correlations for a free space optical (FSO) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) link operating in a turbulent atmosphere. Such knowledge is needed in <b>heterodyne</b> <b>reception</b> to keep all the optical detectors within the region in which a predefined correlation value is fulfilled. The variations of the absolute field correlations versus the longest distance between the detectors are found for different array, medium and receiver parameters such as the number of beamlets, the radius of the radial array, beamlet size, link length, wavelength, structure constant and the position of the detectors.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a remotely seeded flexible {{passive optical network}} (PON) with multiple low-speed subscribers but only a single optical line terminal transceiver operating at a data rate of 31. 25 Gbits/s. The scheme {{is based on a}} colorless frequency division multiplexing (FDM) -PON with centralized wavelength control. Multiplexing and demultiplexing in the optical network unit (ONU) is performed in the electronic domain and relies either on FDM with Nyquist sinc-pulse shaping or on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This way the ONU can perform processing at low speed in the baseband. Further, the ONU is colorless by means of a remote seed for upstream transmission and a remote local oscillator for <b>heterodyne</b> <b>reception,</b> all of which helps in keeping maintenance and costs for an ONU potentially low and will simplify wavelength allocation in a future software defined network architecture. To extend the reach, semiconductor optical amplifiers are used for optical amplification in the downstream and upstream. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|A {{recently}} developed high-speed digital correlator is especially {{well suited for}} processing readings of a passive microwave polarimeter. This circuit computes the autocorrelations of, and the cross-correlations among, data in four digital input streams representing samples of in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of two intermediate-frequency (IF) signals, denoted A and B, that are generated in <b>heterodyne</b> <b>reception</b> of two microwave signals. The IF signals arriving at the correlator input terminals have been digitized to three levels (- 1, 0, 1) at a sampling rate up to 500 MHz. Two bits (representing sign and magnitude) are needed to represent the instantaneous datum in each input channel; hence, eight bits are needed to represent the four input signals during any given cycle of the sampling clock. The accumulation (integration) time for the correlation is programmable in increments of 2 (exp 8) cycles of the sampling clock, up {{to a maximum of}} 2 (exp 24) cycles. The basic functionality of the correlator is embodied in 16 correlation slices, each of which contains identical logic circuits and counters (see figure). The first stage of each correlation slice is a logic gate that computes one of the desired correlations (for example, the autocorrelation of the I component of A or the negative of the cross-correlation of the I component of A and the Q component of B). The sampling of the output of the logic gate output is controlled by the sampling-clock signal, and an 8 -bit counter increments in every clock cycle when the logic gate generates output. The most significant bit of the 8 -bit counter is sampled by a 16 -bit counter with a clock signal at 2 (exp 8) the frequency of the sampling clock. The 16 -bit counter is incremented every time the 8 -bit counter rolls over...|$|E
