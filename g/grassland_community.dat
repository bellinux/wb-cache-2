25|$|The nearby meadows at Plaster's Green Meadows are {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest {{because it is an}} area of unimproved and traditionally managed species-rich meadows which support a neutral <b>grassland</b> <b>community</b> of a type which is now rare throughout Britain. The site is situated on the slopes fringing the Lias Tablelands and is underlain by Rhaetic clays and, lower down the slope Keuper Red Marl. The slowly permeable clay soils are slightly calcareous in nature and this is reflected in elements of the flora. The site is characterised by the nationally rare Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and Crested Dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and dominant grasses include Sweet Vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Crested Dog’s-tail and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus), while Quaking Grass (Briza media) and Yellow Oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) are also frequent. There is a high component of herb species throughout the meadows including Saw-wort (Serratuta tinctoria), Dyer’s Greenweed (Genista tinctoria), Common Knapweed, Pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), Devil’s-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), Betony (Stachys officinalis) and Spiny Restharrow (Ononis spinosa). The calcareous nature of the soil is reflected by the presence of Cowslip (Primula veris), Fairy Flax (Linum catharticum), Glaucous Sedge (Carex flacca), Lady’s Bedstraw (Galium verum) and occasional Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor). The meadows are bounded by hedges supporting numerous species including Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), English Elm (Ulmus procera), Hazel (Corylus avellana) and Field Maple (Acer campestre). Hedgerow trees include Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa), Holly (Ilex aquifolium) and Oak (Quercus sp).|$|E
500|$|The Itcha Range, {{also known}} as the Itchas, is a small {{isolated}} mountain range in the West-Central Interior of British Columbia, Canada. It is located [...] northeast of the community of Anahim Lake. With a maximum elevation of , it is the lowest of three mountain ranges on the Chilcotin Plateau extending east from the Coast Mountains. Two mountains are named in the Itcha Range; Mount Downton and Itcha Mountain. A large provincial park surrounds the Itcha Range and other features in its vicinity. More than 15animal species are known to exist in the Itcha Range area, as well as a <b>grassland</b> <b>community</b> that is limited only to this location of British Columbia. The Itcha Range resides in the territory of aboriginal peoples who have occupied this region for centuries. This area has a relatively dry environment compared to the Coast Mountains in the west.|$|E
500|$|The largest {{portion of}} the watershed, the Inland Empire portion, is {{dominated}} by a hot, dry desert climate that supports sparse wildlife, while the climate and vegetation of the San Jacinto River and Temescal Creek watershed {{is similar to that}} of the southern Central Valley. Downstream of the desert was once the coastal sage scrub and dry <b>grassland</b> <b>community</b> of the Orange County coastal plain, but that region has been almost entirely lost to urbanization. Rimming the arid portions of the watershed are the chaparral zones, consisting of sclerophyllous, thick, low bushes and small trees. The chaparral generally is found between elevations of [...] and , and occurs mainly closer to the coast on the windward side of the Peninsular Ranges. The scrub oak is one of the most common plants in chaparral regions, forming a dense groundcover that makes it difficult for humans and large animals such as mountain lions, coyotes, and bobcats to traverse. Chaparral growth is determined by wildfires and droughts, and depends on the semi-arid climate of the region.|$|E

2500|$|The San Mateo County populations {{occurs in}} small, {{scattered}} native grassland sites on Montara Mountain and are currently threatened with extinction by the encroaching invasive European weed grasses like Brachypodium, Vulpia, Holcus and {{two species of}} Briza or rattlesnake grass, which crowd out the plants. [...] The annual weeds like Plantago and flax and the perennial weeds like Cat's Ears and Queen Anne's Lace are also invading its habitat. [...] Nearby one population, eight different weeds cover 45% of the area, and the seven other native plants of the native <b>grassland</b> <b>community,</b> make up 55% cover. Each year, all the weeds need to be cleared away at a sufficient distance from the Hickmanii plants, and the area restored to as close to 100% native plant cover as possible, otherwise some of these populations could face extinction soon.|$|E

40|$|Semi-natural chalk {{grassland}} is an internationally important habitat characterised by high species richness at a fine scale. In both the United Kingdom and other European Countries however, significant areas of {{chalk grassland}} {{have been lost}} to intensive agriculture practices. In the United Kingdom, conservation and expansion of existing chalk grassland sites has become a high priority. Research {{that leads to a}} better understanding of the processes that structure chalk <b>grassland</b> <b>communities</b> may aid these objectives. A number of field trials have been conducted to examine the role of grazing in structuring <b>grassland</b> plant <b>communities,</b> but the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) /plant symbiosis has received less attention. In this research project the structure (presence and abundance of species) of chalk <b>grassland</b> <b>communities</b> growing on the South Downs in the United Kingdom is defined. This is achieved by detailed analysis of extensive plant survey data collected in 1991. Analysis revealed strong patterns relating to species presence and abundance in the chalk <b>grassland</b> <b>communities.</b> In particular evidence of „nestedness‟ and a frequency abundance relationship was found. From these patterns it was deduced that AMF/ plant symbiosis may have a significant role in structuring chalk <b>grassland</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R
