40|$|This thesis aims at {{assessing}} {{democratic consolidation}} in Croatia {{within the context}} of the EU accession negotiations in the past decade. It looks specifically at whether and to what extent the EU <b>enlargement</b> <b>policies</b> and political conditionality approach have been an effective tool in promoting democratic change and consolidation in Croatia, particularly in the following areas: cooperation with the ICTY, the fight against corruption, the consolidation of an independent judiciary, and fundamental rights, with special attention to freedom of expression. Thus, Croatia is referred to as an empirical case, but discussion can have wider appliance to other EU non-member states in Southeastern Europe and identify some of the advantages and shortcomings of the EU approach. Moreover, the country‟s specific features, such as the war of independence as well as Tudjman‟s personality and style of governance, have delayed taking up most of the democratic reforms and thus, have slowed down democratic change and consolidation for entire decade. In addition, the governments‟ hesitation to introduce necessary democratic reforms, due to domestic pressures of various interest groups has for a long time presented an important obstacle to any substantial changes and consolidation, as well as to Croatia‟s EU membership. Nevertheless, Croatia nowadays has achieved a stable and consolidated democracy, to which EU <b>enlargement</b> <b>policies</b> and its political conditionality have contributed significantly. Although there are still many problems to address, especially in terms of fight against corruption and war crimes issues, there is no direct threat from democratic breakdown or the erosion of democracy in the country. </p...|$|R

When Ottomans captured Plovdiv in 1363, a Byzantine garrison commander in Plovdiv fled to Serbia. He constantly advised and encouraged the Serbians and Bulgarians to attack the outnumbered Ottoman forces quickly with an allied force before the Ottomans fortified their positions.So the Serbians and Bulgarians therefore agreed to send an allied force to push the Ottomans from the Balkans. With the encouragement and efforts of the Pope Urban V, the Principality of Wallachia and the Ban of Bosnia agreed to send some troops to support that allied force. Also the Kingdom of Hungary which was fighting for leadership in the Balkans,also supported that army by sending troops led by Louis I of Hungary.|$|E

This thesis aims {{to understand}} the <b>enlargement</b> <b>policy</b> of the European Union {{in the light of}} the comparative analysis of Turkish and Croatian accession process to the Union. In order to do that, the study asks the question whether the EU’s <b>enlargement</b> <b>policy</b> is beyond the principle of political conditionality, which is to be applied to all applicant states on equal footings. The focus here is on change in conditionality policy with respect to its approach and priorities. Given the need for comparison between Croatia and Turkey, the thesis tries to find out the relations between conditionality and the enlargement process and the EU itself in terms of impact of the current policy environment on its commitment for enlargement. This study affords a picture of the problems which change in conditionality since 2004 has risen for the understanding of <b>enlargement</b> <b>policy.</b> Moreover, the thesis investigates how recent developments might have an effect on the <b>enlargement</b> <b>policy</b> of the Union. In this context, the thesis analyses the reason behind the different levels of iv commitment on the part of the EU towards Turkey and Croatia. Since they simultaneously started the accession negotiations with the EU, there appears a great opportunity to evaluate the EU’s enlargement behaviour with its similarities and differences. In conclusion, member state preferences and concerns have a greater role in the changed policy environment, which requires an approach beyond the simple analysis of political conditionality {{to understand the}} <b>enlargement</b> <b>policy</b> of the Union.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{differences}} between the European Union's (EU's) <b>Enlargement</b> <b>Policy</b> toward Turkey and the United States' (U. S. 's) Foreign Policy toward Turkey. Both actors have a strong relationship with Turkey but for different reasons. Turkey is a candidate country to the EU and {{is in the process of}} accession negotiations. It is also a key ally to the U. S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners and its secular while Muslim identity, location, use as an energy transport route, and strong democracy make Turkey particularly important. In this thesis I argue that <b>enlargement</b> <b>policy</b> and foreign policy toward Turkey are shaped by three factors, geostrategic interests, culture, and economics, but the EU and U. S. place different stress on each factor. This is based on distinctions between the EU and U. S. including that <b>enlargement</b> <b>policy</b> consists of external, internal, and bilateral elements whereas foreign policy only includes external and bilateral elements. The EU approach toward Turkey via <b>enlargement</b> <b>policy</b> focuses strongly on all three factors: geostrategic interests, culture, and economics. Each factor is analyzed with respect to Turkey by each EU member-state, making member-states' decisions dependent on how membership will affect Turkey (externally), how Turkey will affect the EU as a whole (internally) and how Turkey will affect the member-states themselves (bilaterally). However, the U. S. foreign policy approach toward Turkey is constructed mainly on geostrategic interests. This difference in the factors shaping <b>enlargement</b> <b>policy</b> and foreign policy is rooted in a distinction between the EU and U. S. : while Turkey could possibly accede to the EU, making it a full member of the Union, no such membership could ever be attained with the U. S...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, EU {{institutions}} have been increasingly concerned with the issues of unemployment reduction and job creation. The EU has recommended that member states develop welfare systems that moderate {{the negative effects of}} market relationships on the one hand, and enhance the efficiency of market performance on the other. This paper provides an overview of labour market policies to protect individuals from unemployment. It shows that in the context of EMU and EU <b>enlargement,</b> <b>policies</b> such as unemployment insurance could improve welfare, {{to the extent that it}} encourages labour mobility, but has negative effects on individuals’ job search efforts. To counter welfare and inactivity traps, member state governments are asked to reform benefit and tax systems towards more employment-friendly policies. Further, the effect of population ageing on the labour force is considered, along with options to sustain labour force supply and state pension provision. The paper concludes that measures to expand the range and quality of employment opportunities available to older workers will become increasingly important and that governments will have an important educational and coordinating role to play in facilitating these adjustments. ...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{effective}} democratization process during the 2004 enlargement the European Union has exercised what many scholars have regarded as ‘normative power’. The biggest enlargement {{in the history}} of the EU has extended the borders of the Union towards new neighbourhood of democratically and economically unstable states. Less willing to accept new members and yet willing to export its norms and values in order to secure a stable neighbourhood, the EU launched its European Neighbourhood Policy with the ambition to create well governed ‘ring of friends’. Following the success of the use of positive conditionality during the enlargement, the ENP was created based on the same logic, however, unlike the <b>enlargement</b> <b>policies,</b> the ENP lacks the membership carrot. This thesis analyzes the ability of the EU to promote and diffuse its democratic norms and values through the ENP and to have a ‘normative impact’ beyond its borders. The results of the case study on Armenia show that though the ENP has a strong rhetoric and ambition in promoting normative values, and in spite of the fact it has succeeded in norm and rule transfer, it did not succeed in norm-adoption and implementation by the target states...|$|R

The primary influences on German <b>enlargement</b> <b>policy</b> are EU-level developments, including the priority given to EMU {{and the difficulty of}} achieving necessary internal reforms, and external security considerations, especially the process of NATO expansion.
