5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while {{a thick layer of}} fog rolled onto the highway. Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> shortly after 8a.m., one following another in the dense fog, and the accumulating wreckage caught traffic travelling in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|The Pythagorean tiling is {{the unique}} tiling by squares of two {{different}} sizes that is both unilateral (no two squares have a common side) and equitransitive (each two squares {{of the same size}} can be mapped <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by a symmetry of the tiling).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} between Sable and Torrie Wilson. Sable controlled Wilson throughout the contest, as she choked her using the bottom rope and applied a criss-cross choke. After both women ran <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> Sable pinned Wilson with a schoolgirl {{to win the}} match.|$|E

60|$|The two looked <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> faces. They {{seemed to}} be transfigured, <b>each</b> to the <b>other.</b>|$|R

5|$|Fighting {{techniques}} differ {{amongst the}} bovid families and also {{depend on their}} build. While the hartebeest fight on knees, others usually fight on all fours. Gazelles of various sizes use different methods of combat. Gazelles usually box, and in serious fights may clash and fence, consisting of hard blows from short range. Ibex, goat and sheep males stand upright and clash <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> downwards. Wildebeest use powerful head butting in aggressive clashes. If horns become entangled, the opponents move in a circular manner to unlock them. Muskoxen will ram <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at high speeds. As a rule, only two bovids of equal build and level of defence engage in a fight, which is intended to determine the superior of the two. Individuals that are evidently inferior to others would rather flee than fight; for example, immature males do not fight with the mature bulls. Generally, bovids direct their attacks on the opponent's head rather than its body. The S-shaped horns, such as those on the impala, have various sections that help in ramming, holding, and stabbing. Serious fights leading to injury are rare.|$|E
5|$|Harry and Sally run <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{again in}} a bookstore five years later. They have coffee and talk about their {{previous}} relationships; Sally and Joe broke up because she wanted a family {{and he did not}} want to marry, and Harry's fiancee left him for another man. They take a walk and become friends. They have late-night phone conversations, go to dinner, and spend time together, discussing their love lives.|$|E
5|$|In {{a return}} to the format of early seasons, {{virtually}} all serials from Seasons 18 through 20 are linked together, often running directly <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Season 18 forms a loose story arc dealing with the theme of entropy. Full Circle, State of Decay, and Warriors' Gate trace the Doctor's adventures in E-Space; they were released in both VHS and DVD boxsets with the umbrella title The E-Space Trilogy.|$|E

5|$|In the semifinal, three skaters, {{including}} the defending champion, crashed <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and Bradbury moved up into second place {{to qualify for}} the final. In the final, Bradbury was substantially slower than his opponents and was safely in last place, around 15m behind with only 50m to go, when all four rivals collided and fell over, allowing him to avoid the pile-up and take the victory. The unlikely win turned Bradbury into something of a folk hero across Australia and around the world.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{home the}} next day, the {{duplicated}} Brian and real Stewie bump <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{at the bus}} terminal. Stewie realizes that the device had made clones of themselves. After deceiving each other about how their respective friend's deaths transpired, the lucky Brian and unlucky Stewie return home while the lucky Stewie and unlucky Brian greet each other coldly at the pearly gates of Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Terrestrial {{habitat types}} include forests, grasslands, {{wetlands}} and deserts. Within these broad biomes are more specific habitats with varying climate types, temperature regimes, soils, altitudes and vegetation types. Many of these habitats grade <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{and each one}} has its own typical communities of plants and animals. A habitat may suit a particular species well, but its presence or absence at any particular location depends to some extent on chance, on its dispersal abilities and its efficiency as a coloniser.|$|E

5|$|The {{screening}} {{forces of}} each side blundered <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{during the early}} morning darkness and heavy weather of 16 December. The Germans {{got the better of}} the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers, but Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned {{about the possibility of a}} massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn's light. A series of miscommunications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper's ships to avoid an engagement with Beatty's forces.|$|E
5|$|Thick as a Brick {{was viewed}} by some critics as Jethro Tull's first {{progressive}} rock album. The album has {{a variety of}} musical themes, time signature changes and tempo shifts â€“ all of which were features of the progressive rock scene. Although the finished album runs as one continuous piece, it is made up of a medley of individual songs that run <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> none of which individually lasts {{more than a couple of}} minutes. Parts of the suite blend classical and folk music into the typical rock music framework.|$|E
5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The undercarriage legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow undercarriage track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the shark}} attacks the other kids, hitting {{one of their}} boats, and causing most of them to capsize and crash <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in the ensuing panic, {{throwing}} several of them, including Mike and Sean, into the water. The other teens help {{them out of the}} water while two of them pull Mike out as the shark goes for him and head back to get help. Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore. Before the pilot can tow them, the shark attacks and sinks the chopper with the pilot at the controls. It then knocks Sean into the water, but Marge sacrifices herself to save him.|$|E
5|$|Neither Shepard nor Lovell {{expected}} {{there would}} be much difference between Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, but Apollo 13 went disastrously wrong. An oxygen tank explosion nearly resulted {{in the loss of}} the crew, and the moon landing was aborted. It became a joke between Shepard and Lovell, who would offer to give Shepard back the mission each time they bumped <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The failure of Apollo 13 delayed Apollo 14 until 1971 so that modifications could be made to the spacecraft. The target of the Apollo 14 mission was switched to the Fra Mauro formation, the intended destination of Apollo 13.|$|E
5|$|The game took {{approximately}} 21 {{months to}} complete; Rocksteady began development {{with a team}} of 40, which had expanded to around 60 by the game's completion. Combat was considered one of the greatest challenges in developing the game; the system went through three iterations. Rocksteady originally developed the game's combat as a full rhythm action game. It was later set in 2D, which involved colored circles crashing <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> during fights; the final system was based on this 2D model. Combat was designed to be unique for Batman, and was given a simple control scheme to reflect the ease with which Batman can perform the moves. Arkham Asylum was built on Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3. Eidos president Ian Livingstone said one developer spent two years programming Batman's cape, using over 700 animations and sound effects to make it move realistically.|$|E

Incompetent communications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper to avoid an engagement with the battlecruisers. On 27 December, Conqueror accidentally rammed Monarch as the Grand Fleet was returning to Scapa Flow in heavy weather and poor visibility. The latter ship required less than a month of repairs but Conqueror was not ready for service until March 1915.|$|E
5|$|The speech clearly impresses {{both the}} judges and Leslie, and Pawnee is {{ultimately}} {{selected for the}} tournament. Leslie reluctantly accepts Ben's invitation to a celebratory dinner that night, where Ben brings up his feelings for Leslie. She slips away to call Ann for advice, and she urges Leslie to act on her feelings. Just as Leslie decides to do so, she is surprised to find Chris has arrived at the dinner to congratulate the two personally. He insists they sleep {{at his home in}} Indianapolis, ruining their night. The next day, Leslie and Ben run <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> alone and Ben reveals Chris is out for the day. Ben then immediately kisses her, leaving Leslie simultaneously delighted and nervous about their future.|$|E
5|$|To the west, Hyde Park {{merges with}} Kensington Gardens. The {{dividing}} line runs approximately between Alexandra Gate to Victoria Gate via West Carriage Drive and the Serpentine Bridge. The Serpentine {{is to the}} south of the park area. Kensington Gardens has been separate from Hyde Park since 1728, when Queen Caroline divided them. Hyde Park covers 142 hectares (350 acres), and Kensington Gardens covers 111 hectares (275 acres), giving a total area of 253 hectares (625 acres). During daylight, the two parks merge seamlessly <b>into</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> but Kensington Gardens closes at dusk, and Hyde Park remains open throughout the year from 5 a.m. until midnight.|$|E
