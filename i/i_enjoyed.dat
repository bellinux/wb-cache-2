5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E

25|$|In 2009 a posthumous {{autobiography}} of Hay was published with a foreword by Ken Dodd. Hay never published an autobiography throughout his lifetime, however when ill in the 1940s, {{he had begun}} writing an autobiography, <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> every minute which was never published. However, excerpts from his unpublished autobiography {{were included in the}} 2009 book.|$|E

25|$|After he left school, {{he passed}} the {{entrance}} exam to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and, in 1909, was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Regiment of Artillery. He then joined the 138th Battery Royal Field Artillery. He {{wanted to be a}} pilot so he paid for private lessons in the Bristol Flying School at Brooklands and gained his aviators' certificate on 12 July 1912. He met Agatha Miller when he was invited to a ball on 12 October 1912 by Lady Clifford at her grand home Ugbrooke House in Chudleigh. A description of her meeting with Christie is given by Agatha in her autobiography:Christie came my way quite soon in the dance. He was a tall, fair young man, with crisp curly hair, a rather interesting nose, turned up not down, and a great air of careless confidence about him. He was introduced to me, asked for a couple of dances, and said that his friend Griffiths had told him to look out for me. We got on together very well; he danced splendidly and I danced again several more times with him. <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the evening thoroughly.|$|E
25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

500|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, Eastwood {{stated that}} he would be voting for John McCain, citing {{the fact that he had}} known McCain since he {{returned}} to the US in 1973 as a recently released POW. Eastwood said of McCain: [...] "I met him years ago when he first came back from Vietnam. This was back when (Ronald) Reagan was the governor of California and he had a big function for all of the prisoners of war who were released. I thought he was a terrific guy, a real American hero." [...] Nevertheless, Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying, [...] "Obama is my president now and I am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us." [...] Eastwood stated in 2010 of President Obama: [...] "I think he's a nice fella and <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> watching him come along and <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> watching him campaign and win the job. But I'm not a fan of what he's doing at the moment.... I just don't think he's governing. I don't think he's surrounded himself with the people he could have surrounded himself with." ...|$|E
500|$|To comics scholar Bart Beaty, Kalo's {{giving up}} cartooning for {{familial}} duties provides the protagonist {{an opportunity to}} evaluate his own life: his failed romances, his obsessive collecting, and {{his relationship with his}} family—in particular his mother, whose home is an emotional safety zone for him.

It's {{good to know that}} two ladies of soul can still be friends. We talked about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl. She's a smart lady. I really like Mariah.|$|E
500|$|The video caused [...] "a veritable stir in {{the music}} world" [...] because [...] "Boutonnat cast [...] {{as a kind of}} provocative Lolita figure". As she wears a {{transparent}} nightgown in the music video, some French television channels censored it. It was first aired on the French television programme Clip Clap in a shortened version. In an interview, Farmer deplored the censorship, saying: [...] " [...] has shocked many people. I find it pretty stupid. Jacques Dutronc said [...] "Merde in France" [...] and everyone went into raptures. As for me, I simply say that <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the controversy".|$|E

Drago won the next two in 15 minutes with breaks of 44 and 109—completing the latter in four minutes—before an 86 break gave White the victory, after which White said, [...] "Playing Tony here, I {{got a taste of}} what players have against me at the Masters when the crowd are all on my side but they were fair and <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> every minute of it." ...|$|E

In Delhi, Lennon and Harrison told the reporters {{that they had}} urgent business in London {{and they did not}} want to appear in the Maharishi's film. Back in the UK the band members said that they were disillusioned by the Maharishi's desire for financial gain. McCartney said that [...] "Rishikesh was a good experience. <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> it". Lennon said on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, [...] "We believe in meditation, but not the Maharishi and his scene", and, [...] "We made a mistake. He's human like the rest of us".

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four, {{calling it a}} disappointment. Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder's line: [...] "I'm not a psychologist"—reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself—noting that it {{undermines}} established continuity within the series including the character's background in psychology. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, praises the installment, saying, [...] "Place a devil in the plot and I'll follow you {{to see what you}} can cook up.... <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> this tale of a devil looking to be just a normal dad immensely." [...] In his view the episode showed a return to the earlier horror-based narratives the series was known for; though he praises the casting of Campbell, he writes that moments between Mulder and Scully are lacking.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: [...] "It's quite a shock to discover that this confident, fully rounded episode {{was the first to}} be made. The perfect template." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that he [...] "thought 'Evening' was a reasonably good episode." [...] and added that [...] "Still, it’s an awkward piece, and not one <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> a great deal. To be sure, 'Evening' was generally entertaining, but it's nothing special." [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 1.5/5. Another DVD review from The Digital Bits calls the behind the scenes story more interesting than the actual episode.|$|E
500|$|Biance Gracie from Idolator gave a {{positive}} review to the performance, saying that [...] "Instead of doing her usual bit of either singing 'Living for Love' or the current single 'Ghosttown', the entertainer decided to switch {{things up a}} bit—and we're so glad [...] did! Madge did a wild and super-fun version of 'Bitch I'm Madonna'." [...] The Hollywood Reporter listed the performance {{as one of the}} top five shocking moments by Madonna in 2015. Stereogums Caitlin White was amazed by Madonna's performance, saying that [...] "the fact that she can dance like... this at 56 is practically a superhuman feat, and I was surprised by how much <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the performance." [...] Bradley Stern also wrote a similar review for MuuMuse, describing the performance as [...] "one of the most all-out insane television performances of the entire Rebel Heart era... This was no basic stage performance: Instead, Madonna brought her noisy, bratty and utterly #Unapologetic banger to life." ...|$|E
