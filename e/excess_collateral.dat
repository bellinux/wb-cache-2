They just did not have the <b>excess</b> <b>collateral</b> to meet the margin calls after the Russian {{financial}} crisis hit in 1998. In an Opalesque.TV interview, fund manager Bob Treue, who started a hedge fund specifically to capitalize on the opportunities left over by LTCM's failure, says that <b>excess</b> <b>collateral</b> {{is the key to the}} survival of a fixed-income relative-value strategy, and that this is the primary reason LTCM failed. He also says that LTCM's failure has had an enormous impact on the public perception of the fixed-income relative-value space, possibly an irreversible impact, with investors fearing the strategy is too risky.|$|E

40|$|In {{the normal}} goldfish, optic axons are {{distributed}} {{between the two}} arms (brachia) of each optic tract, {{in such a way}} that each axon enters the tectum close to its retinotopic termination site. We have shown pre-viously that regenerating axons at first express little or no preference for their normal brachium. Later, however, a partial refinement of the brachia] pathway takes place, implying that some axons must have sent out divergent collateral branches and then eliminated the least appropriate. We have now studied the formation and subsequent loss of axon collaterals in regeneration using retro-gradely transported fluorescent dyes. We labelled the axons in the medial brachium with Fast Blue and those in the lateral brachium with Diamidino Yellow in a way that avoided cross-contamination. In normal fish, yellow-labelled ganglion cells dominated the dorsal retina and blue-labelled ganglion cells the ventral, with only a narrow zone of overlap. Double-labelled cells were not found. In fish labelled early hi regeneration, however, both dyes were spread over the entire retina in single- and double-labelled ganglion cells. As regeneration pro-gressed, each dye again came to dominate its appropriate retinal region; but much less strongly, confirming previous results. At the same time, double-labelled cells became harder to find. From 60 days after nerve cut onwards they were rare, and largely confined to the boundary zone between dorsal and ventral retina. Their distribution was consistent with our previous proposal that <b>excess</b> <b>collaterals</b> may be eliminated competitively. Since axons from the bound-ary zone terminate in a tectal strip equidistant from the two brachia, neither route would confer any clear competitive advantage over the other.

40|$|The authors provide {{evidence}} that transactions accounts help financial intermediaries monitor borrowers by offering lenders a continuous stream of data on borrowers’ account balances. This information is most readily available to commercial banks, but other intermediaries, such as finance companies, also have access to such information at a cost. Using {{a unique set of}} data that includes monthly and annual information on small-business borrowers at an anonymous Canadian bank, the authors find a significant relationship between loans becoming troubled and the number of prior borrowings in <b>excess</b> of <b>collateral.</b> Since the bank monitors the value of collateral (defined as accounts receivable plus inventory) at high frequency through the transactions account of the borrower, this unique access to useful information gives banks an advantage over other lenders. The authors also find that banks more intensively monitor loans that have a higher number of violations of the collateral limit.; This paper substantially revises and supersedes the paper "Checking accounts and bank monitoring".

40|$|At a {{time when}} small {{businesses}} are suffering from a credit crunch, 'niche' financial institutions are filling the void left by more traditional sources of financing, such as commercial banks. The authors argue {{that the most important}} of these niche players are community-based factor companies, which are rapidly expanding from their client base in apparel and textiles to finance a range of firms in everything from electronics to health care. The purchase of accounts receivable by factors enhances the balance sheets of their clients, making it easier for the clients to obtain bank financing. Also, because factors are more interested in the creditworthiness of a client's customers than of the client itself, they are willing to extend loans in <b>excess</b> of <b>collateral</b> to rapidly growing businesses. Because factors are becoming an increasingly important source of financing for small and start-up businesses, the authors propose that factors be encouraged to play a broader role in financing firms in distressed communities by (1) making some factors eligible for funding and assistance under legislation regulating community development financial institutions and (2) by allowing investments by banks in factors to count toward compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act...|$|R

40|$|Sepsis is a {{worldwide}} health problem {{with an enormous}} economic burden and devastatingly high mortality rate. The pathophysiology and immune dysfunctions that occur during sepsis remain largely unknown, severely limiting current treatment options for sepsis. Both the innate and adaptive parts {{of the immune system}} are known {{to be involved in the}} dysfunctions that occur during sepsis. Over the last few years adenosine has been recognized as an endogenous mediator that alters both innate and adaptive immune responses. Adenosine receptors are largely expressed on many different immune cells and may serve to limit <b>excess</b> <b>collateral</b> damage in the setting of inflammation. In this study, the pharmacological effects of an A 2 A receptor antagonist on septic mice were examined using the CLP model of sepsis that results in a polymicrobial infection. Pharmacological inactivation of the A 2 A receptor significantly increased mortality in septic mice predicted to live in comparison to those given only vehicle. Treatment with the A 2 A receptor antagonist also increased expression of CD 40, part of a pathway well known for its roles in inflammation. Our data also showed increased monocyte MHCII expression after treatment with an adenosine antagonist. Our data support the role that A 2 A receptors are involved in the immune response to sepsis, and that these receptors may serve to damage <b>excess</b> <b>collateral</b> damage ensuing from the host immune response, and that additional studies on adenosine and its related purine nucleosides would be of use for better understanding of the immune dysfunctions that occur during sepsis and other diseases...|$|E

40|$|As cancer {{takes its}} toll on human health and well-being, {{standard}} treatment techniques such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy often fall short of ideal solutions. In particular, adverse side effects due to <b>excess</b> dosage and <b>collateral</b> damage to healthy cells as well as poor patient compliance due to multiple administrations continue to pose challenges in cancer treatment. Thus, the development of appropriately engineered drug delivery systems (DDS) for effective, controlled and sustained delivery of drugs is of interest for patient treatment. Moreover, the physiopathological characteristics of tumors play {{an essential role in}} the success of cancer treatment. Here, we present an overview of the application of double­walled microparticles for local drug delivery with particular focus on the electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) technique and its fabrication challenges. The review highlights the importance of a combination of experimental data and computational simulations for the design of an optimal delivery system...|$|R

Nash found this absurd; nevertheless the album topped the Billboard 200, and its cover drawing by Joni Mitchell would indulgently appear on everything from dinner plates to pillowcases as part of the group's travel accessories. Cocaine was also another of the tour's accessories, and tales of the group's behavior have been well chronicled. The tour gross was approximately $11 million (56 million in 2015 dollars); however, with a tour staff of 86 and the various extravagances, Crosby maintains that the four principals took home a surprisingly small percentage of the proceeds.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} disequilibrium {{framework}} common in the â€œcredit crunchâ€ literature, first to examine whether the slow credit growth in Morocco during {{the rapid expansion of}} liquidity {{in the first half of}} the decade can be attributed to credit rationing, and second to investigate the role of asset price increases in the recent acceleration of credit growth. Our results do not support the credit rationing hypothesis in the first half of the decade. They do however, show that the recent increase in real estate prices stimulated credit supply and demand, with a stronger effect on the latter.
