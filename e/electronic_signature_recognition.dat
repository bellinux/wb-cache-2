40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the impact of <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> on report {{turnaround}} time. The Radiology Information System (RIS) database was interrogated to obtain a file containing all examinations recorded within a one-month period. Two sectors were specifically studied: abdominal ultrasound and chest radiography. Each of these sectors had one reader per day. The periods studied were October 2001 (before implementation of <b>electronic</b> <b>signature)</b> and February 2002 (3 months after <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> implementation). For the abdominal ultrasound examinations, the median time from transcription to final signature decreased from 11 days to 3 days with the introduction of <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> (P < 0. 001). For the chest radiographs, the median time from transcription to final signature decreased from 10 days to 5 days with the introduction of <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> (P < 0. 001). <b>Electronic</b> <b>signature</b> significantly shortens the time interval between transcription and finalization of radiology reports...|$|R

Standardization agencies like NIST or ETSI provide standards for their implementation (e.g., NIST-DSS, XAdES or PAdES).
