2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} local figures in Novgorod was the posadnik, or mayor, an official elected by the public assembly (called the Veche) from among the city's boyarstvo, or aristocracy.

2500|$|The {{murder of}} a federal judge and {{high-ranking}} <b>judicial</b> <b>official</b> like Bermúdez Zacarías was an rare occurrence in the ongoing Mexican Drug War (2006–present). The federal judge murdered before Bermúdez Zacarías was René Hilario Nieto Contreras, {{who was killed in}} October 2006 in Toluca, reportedly on orders from the Gulf Cartel. In 2010, federal judge Carlos Alberto Elorza Amores was attacked by suspected organized crime members in Nayarit. He survived the attack with minor injuries, but one of his bodyguards was killed in the shootout. In 2015, federal judge Joel Fernando Tinajero Jiménez was shot and injured in Jalisco. It is more common for police chiefs, journalists, priests, mayors, and local judges to suffer attacks from organized crime. The rarity of attacks against federal judges {{is due to the fact}} that many of them enjoy better protection from Mexico's judicial branches. According to data from the Council of the Federal Judiciary (CJF) (...) , 21 judges and magistrates had bodyguards in 2012. They also have several established security protocols. If a judge faces a threat, the CJF helps the judge and his/her family by transferring them to other cities.|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} {{aspect of}} the Muslim period in world history was the emergence of Islamic Sharia courts capable of imposing a common commercial and legal system that extended from Morocco in the West to Mongolia in the North East and Indonesia in the South East. [...] While southern India was already in trade with Arabs/Muslims, northern India found new opportunities. As the Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms of Asia were subjugated by Islam, and as Islam spread through Africa– it became a highly centralising force that facilitated {{in the creation of}} a common legal system that allowed letters of credit issued in say Egypt or Tunisia to be honoured in India or Indonesia (The Sharia has laws on the transaction of business with both Muslims and non-Muslims). In order to cement their rule, Muslim rulers initially promoted a system in which there was a revolving door between the clergy, the administrative nobility and the mercantile classes. The travels of explorer Muhammad Ibn-Abdullah Ibn-Batuta were eased because of this system. He served as an Imam in Delhi, as a <b>judicial</b> <b>official</b> in the Maldives, and as an envoy and trader in the Malabar. There was never a contradiction in any of his positions because each of these roles complemented the other. Islam created a compact under which political power, law and religion became fused in a manner so as to safeguard the interests of the mercantile class. This led world trade to expand to the maximum extent possible in the medieval world. Sher Shah Suri took initiatives in improvement of trade by abolishing all taxes which hindered progress of free trade. He built large networks of roads and constructed Grand Trunk Road (1540–1544), which connects Chittagong to Kabul. Parts of it are still in use today. The geographic regions add to the diversity of languages and politics.|$|E
