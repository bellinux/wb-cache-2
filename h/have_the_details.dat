60|$|The {{worst of}} it was that that {{bullying}} old Pumblechook, preyed upon by a devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came gaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> divulged to him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes and mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat heaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.|$|E
60|$|The {{practical}} conclusion {{from these}} premises {{is not difficult}} to draw. The authority which is most conversant with principles should be supreme over principles, while that which is most competent in details should <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> left to it. The principal business of the central authority should be to give instruction, of the local authority to apply it. Power may be localized, but knowledge, to be most useful, must be centralized; there must be somewhere a focus at which all its scattered rays are collected, that the broken and colored lights which exist elsewhere may find there what is necessary to complete and purify them. To every branch of local administration which affects the general interest there should be a corresponding central organ, either a minister, or some specially appointed functionary under him, even if that functionary does no more than collect information from all quarters, and bring the experience acquired in one locality to the knowledge of another where it is wanted. But there is also something more than this for the central authority to do. It ought to keep open a perpetual communication with the localities--informing itself by their experience, and them by its own; giving advice freely when asked, volunteering it when seen to be required; compelling publicity and recordation of proceedings, and enforcing obedience to every general law which the Legislature has laid down on the subject of local management. That some such laws ought to be laid down few are likely to deny. The localities may be allowed to mismanage their own interests, but not to prejudice those of others, nor violate those principles of justice between one person and another of which it is the duty of the state to maintain the rigid observance. If the local majority attempts to oppress the minority, or one class another, the state is bound to interpose. For example, all local rates ought to be voted exclusively by the local representative body; but that body, though elected solely by rate-payers, may raise its revenues by imposts of such a kind, or assess them in such a manner, as to throw an unjust share of the burden on the poor, the rich, or some particular class of the population: it is the duty, therefore, of the Legislature, while leaving the mere amount of the local taxes to the discretion of the local body, to lay down authoritatively the mode of taxation and rules of assessment which alone the localities shall be permitted to use. Again, in the administration of public charity, the industry and morality of the whole laboring population depends, to a most serious extent, upon adherence to certain fixed principles in awarding relief. Though it belongs essentially to the local functionaries to determine who, according to those principles, is entitled to be relieved, the national Parliament is the proper authority to prescribe the principles themselves; and it would neglect a most important part of its duty if it did not, in a matter of such grave national concern, lay down imperative rules, and make effectual provision that those rules should not be departed from. What power of actual interference with the local administrators {{it may be necessary to}} retain, for the due enforcement of the laws, is a question of detail into which it would be useless to enter. The laws themselves will naturally define the penalties, and fix the mode of their enforcement. It may be requisite, to meet extreme cases, that the power of the central authority should extend to dissolving the local representative council or dismissing the local executive, but not to making new appointments or suspending the local institutions. Where Parliament has not interfered, neither ought any branch of the executive to interfere with authority; but as an adviser and critic, an enforcer of the laws, and a denouncer to Parliament or the local constituencies of conduct which it deems condemnable, the functions of the executive are of the greatest possible value.|$|E

50|$|Cricket was {{introduced}} to Trobriand by a British missionary, Reverend Gilmour, in the early 20th century, to replace violent tribal warfare with gentlemanly sportsmanship. Although Arjun Appadurai recently classified cricket as a 'hard cultural form,' resistant to structural change, cricket in Trobriand underwent a huge transformation. Not only <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of the sport such {{as the number of}} players, balls, bats, rules, and uniforms changed, but the meanings and manner of play have changed so much that it can hardly be called as a sport any more. In fact, one gets the impression from this film that the cricket in Trobriand is in fact another form of ritualized warfare (although some people might want to say the same thing for World Cup!).|$|E

On 23 December 2013, al-Nimr's lawyer said that al-Nimr was unable to respond to the charges because {{he did not have a}} pen and paper. Al-Nimr's lawyer was informed one day before the fourth appearance, on 15 April 2014. The ESSHR stated that neither al-Nimr's lawyer nor his family were informed prior to the fifth court session, on 22 April 2014.|$|E

50|$|The TG {{series of}} even larger 1:16 scale cars {{such as the}} Alfa Romeo 1750C, BMW 328 {{roadster}}, Lamborghini Countach, Ferrari GTO, Ferrari 250 California roadster and the Morgan Plus 8 were introduced about 1980. Some of these models, however, did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of competitors Bburago or Maisto. The Morgan, for example is beautiful with opening doors, but the tires are hard plastic, not rubber; {{the steering wheel and}} front wheels are fixed; and the hood does not open, saving the cost of additional parts. The Alfa Romeo 1750, however, did come in two versions; top up and top down. By the late 1980s, though, the larger models were the backbone of Polistil sales, while it would last, and the 1:43 size was now being left to higher end collector brands like Eligor, Vitesse, and venerable Solido.|$|E
5000|$|The {{system of}} tally {{marks of the}} Exchequer is {{described}} in The Dialogue Concerning the Exchequer (see external links below) as follows: The manner of cutting is as follows.

[...] The cuts were made the full width of the stick so that, after splitting, the portion kept by the issuer (the stock) exactly matched the piece (the foil) given as a receipt. Each stick had to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of the transaction written on it, in ink, to make it a valid record.|$|E
50|$|Giovanni's father, Giovan Domenico Quagliata, was {{a painter}} {{who lived in}} Rome in the late 16th century. He was an artist of talent, but not greatness. Unfortunately, we don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of Giovan Domenico's birth, but a {{reasonable}} estimate would be 1570. His birthplace remains a mystery. If he was born on the mainland, it's highly likely {{he was part of}} the Quagliata family located in Balvano. Possibly looking for a better market for his talent and art, Giovan Domenico moved from Rome to the growing trade center of Messina, arriving in Sicily in the late 16th century. Unfortunately Susinno does not cite the works of Giovan Domenico. Sometime before 1600, Giovan Domenico married a woman from Messina named Francesca LeDonne and together they had children. We know of two sons: Andrea Quagliata born in 1594 (or in 1599, and died in 1660) and Giovan Battista Quagliata born in 1603 (1603-1673, also known as Giovanni Quagliata). Andrea became a student of his father and was a capable painter. Giovanni was directed by his parents to study letters, but his studies were interrupted by the premature death of the father. Andrea, by that time a professional painter, convinced his younger brother to attend his school where Giovanni does well. Andrea married, but apparently did not have children.|$|E
