5|$|The Old Blockhouse {{appears to}} have been completed, but the Crown's {{resources}} had become badly stretched and the decision was taken at the end of 1552 to curtail further expenditure on the Scilly Isles. Between 1548 and 1552, a total of £3,123 had been spent on improving the fortifications on the islands; a 1579 survey suggested that, with the cost of the garrisons, the project had come to a total of £6,000. Edward's successor, Queen Mary <b>I,</b> <b>intended</b> to establish a garrison of 150 soldiers on the islands, but it is uncertain if these numbers were ever achieved.|$|E
5|$|The French {{submarine}} Mariotte (Q74) was {{a submarine}} {{built for the}} French Navy prior to World War <b>I.</b> <b>Intended</b> to accompany the fleet, she was designed for high speed on the surface. Although the navy was unsatisfied with her performance on the surface, the boat had a higher underwater speed than any French submarine before or during the following 35 years. Mariotte was plagued with engine problems during her construction and the navy spent years fixing the various issues before finally commissioning her five years after beginning construction. During the war, she participated in the Dardanelles Campaign, but had to be scuttled after she became entangled in the cables of a minefield on her first attempt to penetrate the Dardanelles.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 968, {{battles between}} the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire {{commenced}} in the Principality of Capua, in the Duchy of Benevento and Apulia, and hostilities continued until 970. Both {{sides of the}} conflict made many attempts to find a diplomatic solution. Otto <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> to receive recognition of his title in Byzantium, and to clarify the borders of Western and Eastern allegiances in southern Italy. He wanted this agreement to be ratified by the marriage of his son, Otto II, {{to a member of}} the Byzantine imperial family. Anna, daughter of the deceased Emperor Romanos II, was considered a possible bride. However, Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas was unwilling to marry off a purple-born princess (i.e. a child born to a reigning emperor). After tough negotiations with Nikephoros II Phokas' successor John I Tzimiskes, Archbishop of Cologne Gero secured the marriage of Otto II with Theophanu, a member of the Byzantine imperial family who was not, however, born to the purple.|$|E

25|$|Normally the Imperial {{children}} were kept under female supervision {{until they were}} seven. However, {{by the time he}} was five Konstantin had become too willful and difficult for a governess to handle and his father appointed a male tutor for him. Nicholas <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> that Konstantin would eventually become Admiral General of the Russian Fleet and with this in mind chose Fyodor Litke as tutor for his son. Litke, who had circumnavigated the globe at the age of twenty, was a brash and bold man, unafraid of controversy or offense, and he passed these qualities along to his student. He trained the boy in naval sciences and filled his head with tales of the sea, gaining the friendship of his pupil for life. Languages were an important part of Konstantin's education; he learned Russian, English, German and French. As he grew older, his lessons increased in length and complexity to encompass mathematics, science, statistics, and government administration. There were also early military lessons and drills. Konstantin also enjoyed music, learning to play the piano and cello. He loved drawing and had great appreciation for the arts. He also became an enthusiastic reader and his fascination with Homer led him to translate the Odyssey from German.|$|E

Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role [...] "everything that <b>I</b> <b>intended,</b> and much that I had never dreamed of". Leigh herself had mixed feelings about her association with the character; in later years, she said that playing Blanche DuBois [...] "tipped me over into madness".|$|E

500|$|During {{sessions}} for Door, Door at Richmond Recorders in Melbourne in January 1979, the Boys Next Door recorded [...] "Shivers". Engineer Tony Cohen suggested that Howard perform the vocals for the track, arguing that {{his voice was}} best fitted for his own songs. However, the band's regular vocalist, Nick Cave, insisted on singing on the recording. Howard said later {{that as a result}} of Cave's vocals, [...] "Shivers" [...] was [...] "interpreted completely differently and now the song, to most peoples' minds, is something completely different from what <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> it to be". In hindsight, Cave noted that Howard's vocals should have been recorded, as Cave was [...] "never able to do that song justice".|$|E
500|$|According to Branco, the show's past writing {{teams had}} {{proposed}} creating a Marty and Todd love story, {{but it never}} happened, mostly because Haskell and Howarth had refused to participate. In Branco's opinion, the push toward the storyline was the reason Howarth eventually left OLTL for As the World Turns. By contrast, at a fan gathering in 2008, St. John joked about Todd and Marty bonding during the Carlivati storyline, stating, [...] "I'm all for gang rape." [...] He later issued an apology for the comment: [...] "I should {{know better than to}} ever try and make a joke about such a serious subject. <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> no disrepect and apologize to anyone I offended." ...|$|E

500|$|Amenhotep I's Horus and Two Ladies names, [...] "Bull who conquers the lands" [...] and [...] "He who inspires great terror," [...] are {{generally}} interpreted {{to mean that}} Amenhotep <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> to dominate the surrounding nations. Two tomb texts indicate that he led campaigns into Nubia. According to the tomb texts of Ahmose, son of Ebana, Amenhotep later sought to expand Egypt's border southward into Nubia and he led an invasion force which defeated the Nubian army. The tomb biography of Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet says he also fought in a campaign in Kush, however {{it is quite possible}} that it refers to the same campaign as Ahmose, son of Ebana. Amenhotep built a temple at Saï, showing that he had established Egyptian settlements almost as far as the third cataract.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{health was}} a minor {{campaign}} issue; it was presented by the Whigs as robust, and by Democrats as decrepit. The campaign released a letter from his doctor, testifying to his good health; this was a presidential election first. Another testament to Harrison's health was his speeches: he gave 24 addresses between June and October, all in Ohio and lasting up to three hours; Van Buren did not give any. Harrison {{did not have the}} campaign trail to himself; Vice President Johnson told Van Buren that the President should [...] "go out among the voters as <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> doing". Democrats tried to paint Johnson as the true hero of the Battle of the Thames, but the Vice President refused to criticize Harrison's conduct in battle. Nevertheless, Johnson spoke with such enthusiasm that he may have set off a riot in Cleveland, and was followed onto the trail late in the campaign by John Tyler, who had difficulty staying on message and resorted to telling questioners, [...] "I am in favor of what General Harrison and Mr. Clay are in favor of." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Indie Journal, Joseph said that when writing music he prefers {{to concentrate on the}} melody first, stating, [...] "Basically, I write from a two-person standpoint. [...] First, I let the song take hold and I put down the idea as a raw emotional statement. Then I let it breathe and come back, approaching from more of an objective point of view. This allows me to rediscover the true meaning <b>I</b> <b>intended</b> in the beginning, shedding new light on how I can best represent that to the listener." [...] This same concept is explained again in a taped interview with the Government Television Network with Joseph explaining that a lot of times he may only come up with part of a melody. [...] Then he would let it rest and come back to it and see if it feels right. [...] Then he would start [...] "building around it", [...] like putting a car together - start with a frame and then start building things around it. Musically, he tries to connect a common bridge between such exhilarating feelings as performing at the Acropolis, to the emotions each and every one feels every day. [...] "In the end, a good melody will always stand the test of time", says Joseph.|$|E

500|$|Among the {{products}} Boulton {{sought to make}} in his new facility were sterling silver plate for those able to afford it, and Sheffield plate, silver-plated copper, for those less well off. [...] Boulton {{and his father had}} long made small silver items, but there is no record of large items in either silver or Sheffield plate being made in Birmingham before Boulton did so. [...] To make items such as candlesticks more cheaply than the London competition, the firm made many items out of thin, die-stamped sections, which were shaped and joined together. [...] One impediment to Boulton's work was the lack of an assay office in Birmingham. [...] The silver toys long made by the family firm were generally too light to require assaying, but silver plate had to be sent over [...] to the nearest assay office, at Chester, to be assayed and hallmarked, with the attendant risks of damage and loss. [...] Alternatively they could be sent to London, but this exposed them to the risk of being copied by competitors. Boulton wrote in 1771, [...] "I am very desirous of becoming a great silversmith, yet I am determined not to take up that branch in the large way <b>I</b> <b>intended,</b> unless powers can be obtained to have a marking hall [...] at Birmingham." [...] Boulton petitioned Parliament for the establishment of an assay office in Birmingham. [...] Though the petition was bitterly opposed by London goldsmiths, he was successful in getting Parliament to pass an act establishing assay offices in Birmingham and Sheffield, whose silversmiths had faced similar difficulties in transporting their wares. [...] The silver business proved not to be profitable due to the opportunity cost of keeping a large amount of capital tied up in the inventory of silver. [...] The firm continued to make large quantities of Sheffield plate, but Boulton delegated responsibility for this enterprise to trusted subordinates, involving himself little in it.|$|E
