40|$|Palm fibre is a {{waste product}} from the fruit crushing-extracting process in local communities. This study {{examined}} the characteristics of natural dyed palm yarns and fabrics produced from treated palm fibres. The results showed that fibre characteristics were improved by anaerobic fermentation, and following crushing and carding, were 3 - 5 times smaller, softer and more pliable. In the production of palm/cotton yarns of No. 7 (50 / 50), No. 10 (40 / 60), No. 16 (30 / 70) and No. 10 (0 / 100), the 3 - 5 denier palm yarns and cotton yarns were spun in open-end spinning units. Regarding the physical properties, the blended yarns showed more unevenness and higher tensile strength and elongation at break than 100 % cotton yarn. However, {{it was found that}} the coarser yarns were lower in strength than the finer yarns. Fibre sorting by denier leads to a decrease in unevenness caused by thin and thick patches and neps. When dyed with natural dyes, the palm yarns were found highly fast to light, but only moderately fast to washing.

40|$|The somatotopic {{organization}} of the light touch receptive fields of single unidentified dorsal horn neurons in the lumbosacral spinal cord has been studied in the neonatal cat anesthetized with chloralose. Satisfactory recordings were obtained from single dorsal horn neurons in kittens aged 3 - 6 days. Reconstruction of recording tracks from pontamine blue <b>dye</b> <b>spots</b> and comparisons of the depths of recording sites with Nissl-stained sections of cord showed that most single-unit recordings were obtained from laminae III and IV of Rexed. In animals of all ages neurons were found which responded briskly to light cutaneous mechanical stimulation. Their receptive fields varied widely in size, being smallest on the distal digits and largest on proximal skin. Receptive field areas were similar {{in proportion to the}} size of the hindlimb to those seen in the equivalent region in the adult cat. Because of the shape of the dorsal horn and the relatively narrow dorsal columns in neonatal kittens it proved difficult to locate units with receptive fields on proximal skin. Nevertheless the main features of the somatotopic {{organization of}} the dorsal horn were similar to those in the adult cat. Thus the somatotopic map of the kitten showed a medial representation of glabrous skin that was bounded laterally by the representation of the hairy skin of the toes. Proximal skin was represented in the lateral parts of the dorsal horn, a region which was not easily accessible for microelectrode recording. The individual toes were represented in a rostral to caudal sequence such that toe 2 was represented rostrally and toe 5 caudally. Around the toe representation the medial surface of the foot was represented rostrally, the ventrolateral surface caudally, and the dorsal surface laterally. The results indicate that the mature organization of light touch receptive fields of dorsal horn neurons in the lumbosacral cord of the cat is already largely present at birth...|$|E
40|$|In {{comparison}} to the flow in a rigid channel, there is a multifold reduction in the transition Reynolds number for the flow in a microchannel {{when one of the}} walls is made sufficiently soft, due to a dynamical instability induced by the fluid-wall coupling, as shown by Verma & Kumaran (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 727, 2013, pp. 407 - 455). The flow after transition is characterised using particle image velocimetry in the x-y plane, where x is the streamwise direction and y is the cross-stream coordinate along the small dimension of the channel of height 0. 2 - 0. 3 mm. The flow after transition is characterised by a mean velocity profile that is flatter at the centre and steeper at the walls in {{comparison to}} that for a laminar flow. The root mean square of the streamwise fluctuating velocity shows a characteristic sharp increase away from the wall and a maximum close to the wall, as observed in turbulent flows in rigid-walled channels. However, the profile is asymmetric, with a significantly higher maximum close to the soft wall in comparison to that close to the hard wall, and the Reynolds stress is found to be non-zero at the soft wall, indicating that there is a stress exerted by fluid velocity fluctuations on the wall. The maximum of the root mean square of the velocity fluctuations and the Reynolds stress (divided by the fluid density) in the soft-walled microchannel for Reynolds numbers in the range 250 - 400, when scaled by suitable powers of the maximum velocity, are comparable to those in a rigid channel at Reynolds numbers in the range 5000 - 20 000. The near-wall velocity profile shows no evidence of a viscous sublayer for (y upsilon(*) /nu) as low as two, but there is a logarithmic layer for (y upsilon(*) /nu) up to approximately 30, where the von Karman constants are very different from those for a rigid-walled channel. Here, upsilon(*) is the friction velocity, nu is the kinematic viscosity and y is the distance from the soft surface. The surface of the soft wall in contact with the fluid is marked with <b>dye</b> <b>spots</b> to monitor the deformation and motion along the fluid-wall interface. Low-frequency oscillations in the displacement of the surface are observed after transition in both the streamwise and spanwise directions, indicating that the velocity fluctuations are dynamically coupled to motion in the solid...|$|E

40|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} lordosis, the sexual posturing of female rats, is lumbar dorsiflexion (rump elevation). This movement exposes the perineum and permits the male to intromit. Experiments were done {{to characterize the}} muscles used in lumbar dorsiflexion, to locate their motoneurons, and to describe some physiologic inputs to these muscles. First, the dorsal and ventral muscles of the back and tail of the female Norway rat were described. Of these muscles, the lumbar epaxial muscles lateral longissimus and the transversospinalis muscles are both trunk muscles and capable of producing dorsiflexion: they are suited for producing the rump elevation of lordosis. To see if they are used during lordosis, they were selectively ablated in hormone-primed female rats that were subsequently tested in mating encounters with male rats. Lordosis was rated as amount of rump elevation. Compared to control animals, animals with ablations of lumbar transversospinalis muscles or lateral longissimus were considerably impaired in their performance of lordosis. Ablations of medial longissimus, a lumbar epaxial muscle which produces proximal tail movements, did not affect lordosis. Motoneurons to lumbar epaxial muscles were localized following intraxonal retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injected into muscle. Both lateral longissimus and transversospinalis motoneurons were found medially in the ventral horn throughout the lumbar enlargement, and continued anterior to the enlargement. Following HRP injections into more posterior regions of transversospinalis muscles, motoneurons were also found caudal to the enlargement. Medial longissimus motoneurons were found posterior to the lumbar enlargement, ventrolaterally in the ventral horn. Neuronanatomical localization was confirmed by identifying sites in the spinal cord at which low-level stimulation (mainly (LESSTHEQ) 20 (mu) A) produced visible twitches of transversospinalis, medial longissimus or lateral longissimus. Additionally, cells responding antidromically to stimulation of medial longissimus, lateral longissimus or transversospinalis nerves were identified (extracellular recording) and marked by dye deposition. For each muscle, <b>dye</b> <b>spots</b> fell within the region depicted neuronanatomically. Responses of lateral longissimus or medial longissimus nerves to stimulation of ipsilateral lumbosacral dorsal roots, medial medullary reticular formation, vestibular nuclei, or ventromedial hypothalamus were studied in urethane-anesthetized female rats, {{some of which were}} also hormone-primed and had shown lordosis to manual stimulation. Stimulation of appropriate dorsal roots, using with two or more shocks, evoked short-latency (re effective shock), probably monosynaptic, compound potentials in medial longissimus or in lateral longissimus nerves. Supraspinal influence was studied mainly by using a condition-test paradigm. Conditioning stimulation of the vestibular nuclei facilitated occurrence of short-latency responses to single dorsal root shocks in medial longissimus nerves (13 / 14) and in lateral longissimus nerves (5 / 10). Reticular formation conditioning stimulation also facilitated segmental responses recorded in medial longissimus nerves. Stimulation within the reticular formation or vestibular nuclei could also evoke responses in medial longissimus and lateral longissimus nerves. Stimulation {{in the area of the}} ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus had no facilitatory effect in these preparations. No differences associated with hormone treatment were apparent. Vestibular nuclei and reticular formation can influence lumbar back muscles and tail muscles as they do other axial muscles.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: The {{protein chip}} {{technology}} which has less developed landscape {{as compared to}} the DNA chips, it faces the problem of universal recognition function or the strategy to obtain a universal chip for multitude of protein samples. This is due to the chemical complexity that protein carries as translational product of basic gene (DNA). There exists the basic contradiction of ‘chemical recognition specificity’ against ‘universal applicability’ in such a micro array based recognition which deals with higher chemical complexity. It is the key issue, whether it is possible to combine different methods of characterization and read out to make a platform by integrating specific and less specific methods of chemically diverse analyte recognition. The issue of universal application of chips for specific recognition of analytes has been addressed in this integration process. The primary aim of the work is to integrate various methods of characterization and read out, into the chip technology for liquid chemical recognition. In order to develop the multifunctional chemochips {{the state of the art}} characterization and read out techniques such as non-contact micro spotting, fluorescence digital imaging and AFM techniques have been used. The spotting technique was used to realize microarray of pure and mixed indicator functions as well as chemical reagents for local matrix modification. Rapid fluorescence CCD imaging techniques enables the real time recording of analyte-indicator molecule interaction by series of images with multiple excitation-emission wavelengths. Multivariate data analysis was applied on the pool of the data generated by the analysis of spot intensity changes in the recorded images which gives a better idea of the analyte classification. Along with these established methods the specially developed high resolution nano-positioning and measurements machine equipped with AFM mode (SPM-NPMM) has been used to characterize the micro spot array for the several millimeter range with the resolution and precision of an AFM technique. SPM-NPMM has a large dynamic measurement range of 25 × 25 × 5 mm 3 with the lateral resolution of 0. 1 nm. The SPM-NPMM measurements showed that the evaporation of solvent after spotting leads to the concentric double rim formation inside the micro-spots. These characteristic double rim features of the micro spot was found only for the binary mixed solvents with varying polarity like water and DMF spots due to differential transport of dissolved material in two different solvents during spot formation. High resolution SPM-NPMM measurements showed the inhomogeneous distribution of dye nano-crystals of 2 - 5 nm height restricted to only inner rim formed due to DMF in a double concentric rimed spots, as the dye has less solubility in the solvent. 	 Using single layer chemochip arrays made up of pH and polarity sensitive dyes it was possible to distinguish binary mixed solvents qualitatively and quantitatively. With the help of micro array patterns, the analyte with similar content of alcohol like mixture of 5 % (v/v) of ethanol in water and beers, or other alcoholic beverages can be distinguished qualitatively from the ethanol-water mixtures with corresponding ethanol content. The variation in fluorescent spot patterns acted like fingerprints for complex composed liquids like solvent mixtures and beverages. The multivariate data analysis done on the pool of data obtained from the chemochips experiment enables to distinguish certain classes of binary mixtures. Also, some other micro array components like binary mixed <b>dye</b> <b>spots</b> can be classified for their response towards multitude of liquid analytes using the PCA analysis. Analytical double layer chemochips were prepared by splitting the functions of ‘differentiation’ in top layer and ‘indication’ in bottom layer on the same chip. This was realized by stacking hydro-gel polymer layers with matrix modifier using solvent casting method. The top layer was assigned with mobility dependent differentiation by physically altering the polymer matrix using a cross-linking agent and bottom layer functioned as indicator due to doped fluorescent dyes. It was possible to distinguish different analytes by transition time of diffusion through differentiation top layer by the real time recording of series of images of the double layer arrays. The analyte molecules showed the variation in the transition time of their transport through the top layer depending up on its cross-linking degree. This transport of individual and mixtures of analytes through the differentiation layer can also be detected using the same fluorescence scheme used for single layer chemochips. The double layer chemochips also showed the analyte separation signal for a mixture of two different analyte molecules while diffusing through the differentiation layer. This can be attributed to the preferential interactions between analyte and the modified polymer environment as a transport medium. 	 The open issue of ‘Specificity versus Universality’ faced by less developed biochips like protein chips have been addressed through the reported work using different types of chemochips. It was shown that different preferential and general characterization using fluorescent micro spots was possible with single and double layer micro arrays as a compliment for the specific recognition done by the conventional spot array chips...|$|E
40|$|In {{comparison}} to the flow in a rigid channel, there is a multi-fold reduction in the transition Reynolds number for the flow in a micro channel {{when one of the}} walls is made sufficiently soft, due to a dynamical instability induced by the fluid-wall coupling. The flow after transition is characterized using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the x − y plane where x is the stream-wise direction and y is the cross-stream co-ordinate along the small dimension of the channel of height 0. 2 − 0. 3 mm. For the two different soft walls of shear modulus 18 kPa and 2. 19 kPaused here, the transition Reynolds number is about 250 and 330 respectively. The deformation of the microchannel due to the applied pressure gradient is measured in the experiments, and is used to predict the laminar mean velocity profiles for comparison with the experimental results. The mean velocity profiles in the microchannel are in quantitative agreement with those predicted for the laminar flow before transition, but are flatter near the centerline and have higher gradients at the wall after transition. The flow after transition is characterized by a mean velocity profile that is flatter at the center and steeper at the walls in {{comparison to}} that for a laminar flow. The root mean square of the stream-wise fluctuating velocity shows the characteristic sharp increase from the wall and a maximum close to the wall, as observed in turbulent flows in rigid-walled channels. However, the profile is asymmetric with a significantly higher maximum close to the soft wall in comparison to that close to the hard wall, and the Reynolds stress is found to be non-zero at the soft wall, indicating that there is a stress exerted by fluid velocity fluctuations on the wall. The turbulent energy production profile has a maximum at the soft wall, in contrast to the flow at a rigid surface where the turbulent energy production is zero at the wall (due to the zero Reynolds stress). The maximum of the root mean square of the velocity fluctuations and the Reynolds stress (divided by the fluid density) in the soft-walled microchannel for Reynolds numbers in the range 250 - 400, when scaled by suitable powers of the maximum velocity, are comparable to those in a rigid channel at Reynolds numbers in the range 5000 - 20000. The near-wall velocity profile shows no evidence of a viscous sub-layer for (yv∗/ν) as low as 2, but there is a logarithmic layer for (yv∗/ν) up to about 30, where the von Karman constants are very deferent from those for a rigid-walled channel. Here, v∗ is the friction velocity, ν is the kinematic viscosity and y is the distance from the soft surface.. The surface of the soft wall in contact with the fluid is marked with <b>dye</b> <b>spots</b> to monitor the deformation and motion along the fluid-wall interface. The measured displacement of the surface in the stream-wise direction, which is of the order of 5 − 12 µm, is consistent with that calculated on the basis of linear elasticity. Low-frequency oscillations in the displacement of the surface are observed after transition in both the stream-wise and span-wise directions, indicating that the turbulent velocity fluctuations are dynamically coupled to motion in the solid. Modification of soft-wall turbulence in a micro channel due to the addition of small amounts of polymer The modification of soft-wall turbulence in a microchannel due to the addition of small amounts of polymer is experimentally studied using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to measure the mean and the fluctuating velocities. The micro channels are of rectangular cross-section with height about 160 µm, width about 1. 5 mm and length about 3 cm, with three walls made of hard Poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gel, and one wall made of soft PDMS gel with an elasticity modulus of about 18 kPa. A dynamical instabilty of the laminar flow due to the fluid-wall coupling, and a transition to turbulence, is observed at a Reynolds number of about 290 for the flow of pure water in the soft-walled microchannel (Verma and Kumaran, J. Fluid Mech., 727, 407 - 455, 2013). Solutions of polyacrylamide of molecular weight 5 × 106 and mass fraction up to 50 ppm, and of molecular weight 4 × 104 and mass fraction up to 1500 ppm, are used in the experiments. In all cases, the solutions are in the dilute limit be-low the critical concentration where the interactions between polymer molecules become important. The modification of the fluid viscosity due to addition of polymer molecules is small; the viscosity of the solutions with the highest polymer concentration exceed those for pure water by about 10 % for the polymer with molecular weight 5 × 106, and by about 5 % for the polymer with molecular weight 4 × 104. Two distinct types of flow modifications below and above a threshold mass fraction for the polymer, cTHRESHOLD, which is about 1 ppm for the polyacrylamide with molecular weight 5 × 106, and about 500 ppm for the polyacrylamide with molecular weight 4 × 104. As the polymer mass fraction increases up to the threshold value, there is no change in the transition Reynolds number, but there is significant turbulence attenuation the root mean square velocities in the stream wise and cross-stream directions decrease by a factor of 2, and the Reynolds stress decreases by a factor of 4 in comparison to that for pure water. When the polymer concentration increases beyond the threshold value, there is a decrease in the decrease in the transition Reynolds number by nearly one order of magnitude, and a further decrease in the intensity of the turbulent fluctuations. The lowest transition Reynolds number of about 35 for the solution of polyacrylamide with molecular weight 5 × 106 and mass fraction 50 ppm. For the polymer solutions with the highest concentrations, the fluctuating velocities in the stream wise and cross-stream direction are lower by a factor of 5, and the Reynolds stress is lower by a factor of 10, in comparison to pure water. Despite the significant turbulence attenuation, a sharp increase in the intensity of the fluctuating velocities is evident at transition for all polymer concentrations. Transitions to deferent kinds of turbulence in a channel with soft walls The flow in a rectangular channel with walls made of soft polyacrylamide gel is studied to examine the effect of soft walls on transition and turbulence. The width of the channel is much larger than the height, so that the flow can be considered approximately two-dimensional, the wall thickness is much larger than the channel height (smallest dimension), the bottom wall is fixed to a substrate and the top wall is unrestrained. The fluid velocity is measured using Particle Image Velocimetry, while the wall motion is studied by embedding beads in the soft wall, and measuring the time-variation of the displacement both parallel and perpendicular to the surface. As the Reynolds number increases, two different flow regimes are observed in sequence. The first is the ‘soft-wall turbulence’ resulting from a dynamical instability of the base flow due to the fluid-wall coupling. The flow in this case exhibits many of the features of the turbulent flow in a rigid channel, including the departure of the velocity profile from the parabolic profile, and the near-wall maxima in the stream-wise root mean square fluctuating velocity. However, there are also significant differences. The turbulence intensities, when scaled by suitable powers of the mean velocity, are much larger than those after the hard-wall laminar-turbulent transition at a Reynolds number of about 1000. The Reynolds stress profiles do not decrease to zero at the walls, indicating that the wall motion plays a role in the generation of turbulent fluctuations. There is no evidence of a viscous sub-layer close to the wall to within the experimental resolution. The mean velocity profile does satisfy a logarithmic law close to the surface within a region between 2 - 30 wall units from the surface, but the von Karman constants are very different from those for the hard-wall turbulence. The wall displacement measurements indicate that there is no observable motion perpendicular to the surface, but displacement fluctuations parallel to the surface are observed after transition, coinciding with the onset of velocity fluctuations in the fluid. The fluid velocity fluctuations are symmetric about the center line of the channel, and they show relatively little downstream variation after a flow development length of about 5 cm. As the Reynolds number is further increased, there is a second ‘wall flutter’ transition, which involves visible downstream traveling waves in the top (unrestrained) wall alone. Wall displacement fluctuations of low frequency (less than about 500 rad/s) are observed both parallel and perpendicular to the wall. The mean velocity profiles and turbulence intensities are asymmetric, with much larger turbulence intensities near the top wall. There is no evident logarithmic profile close to either the top or bottom wall. Fluctuations are initiated at the entrance of the test section, and the fluctuation intensities decrease with downstream distance, the fluctuation intensities first rapidly increase and then decrease as the Reynolds number is increased. For a channel with relatively small height (0. 6 mm), the transition Reynolds number for the soft-wall instability is lower the hard-wall transition Reynolds number of about 1000, and the laminar flow becomes unstable to the soft-wall instability leading to soft-wall turbulence and then to wall flutter as the Reynolds number is increased. For a channel with relatively large height (1. 8 mm), the transition Reynolds number for the soft-wall instability is higher than 1000, the flow first undergoes the hard-wall laminar-turbulent transition at a Reynolds number of about 1000, the turbulent flow undergoes the soft-wall transition leading to soft-wall turbulence, and then to wall flutter...|$|E

We propose a quantitative two-zone model for the mixing rate taking into account the geometry of the highly-sheared zone, as well as the rate at which fluid is renewed inside this zone.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} use of chromatography - {{passing a}} mixture through an inert material to create {{separation of the}} solution components based on differential adsorption - is sometimes attributed to German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge, who in 1855 described the use of paper to analyze <b>dyes.</b> Runge dropped <b>spots</b> of different inorganic chemicals onto circles of filter paper already impregnated with another chemical, and reactions between the different chemicals created unique color patterns. [...] According to historical analysis of L. S. Ettre, however, Runge's work had [...] "nothing to do with chromatography" [...] (and instead {{should be considered a}} precursor of chemical spot tests such as the Schiff test).|$|R
40|$|Ultrathin-layer {{chromatography}} (UTLC) {{provides the}} high sensitivities and rapid separations over short distances desirable in many analytical applications. The dependence of these performance benefits on UTLC layer microstructure motivates continued stationary phase engineering efforts. A new method of modifying the elution behaviours of nanostructured thin film UTLC stationary phases is investigated in this report. Macroporous normal phase silica thin films 53 ̆bcm thick were fabricated using glancing angle deposition (GLAD). Reactive ion etching (RIE) and a subsequent annealing treatment modified stationary phase morphology to tune migration velocity, analyte retention, and overall separation performance. Combining this technique with a RIE shadow mask enabled fabrication of adjacent concentration and separation zones with markedly different elution properties. Although produced using {{an entirely new}} approach, GLAD UTLC concentration zone media behaved {{in a manner consistent}} with traditional thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance TLC (HPTLC) concentration zone plates. In particular, these new media focused large volume, low concentration <b>dye</b> mixture <b>spots</b> into narrow bands to achieve high-quality separations. The described approach to modifying the morphology and resultant elution behaviours of nanostructured stationary phases expands the capabilities of the GLAD UTLC technique. 9 2011 Elsevier B. V.

A large number of planned colors in {{graphics}} of topographic maps, are simulated in the press with only four process colorants. Achieved are seperated infromation for the visible and infrared spectrum. This introduces the protection of printed matter, protection of property, reduces the cost of spot printing {{of large numbers of}} layers. For the digital print technology simulation of the merge of "topographical colors" is extended to achieve Infrared graphics. The black color tone, a typical color in cartography, is associated with two dyes with different compositions and different properties in the infrared spectrum.

40|$|Los Alamos National Laboratory has {{developed}} thermal treatment equipment to treat Navy smoke and dye compounds. Navy smokes were {{burned in the}} Los Alamos Controlled Air Incinerator (CAI) in the early 1980 s. These test results {{were used in the}} development of a portable system consisting of a Thermal Treatment Unit (TTU), feed preparation and pumping skid, utility skid, and control trailer. This equipment was started up at Navy facilities at China Lake, CA where several destruction removal efficiency tests were completed in 1993 burning smoke compositions. The equipment was set up at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) in 1996 where tests were completed burning green Navy <b>spotting</b> <b>dyes.</b> Operating and test results from the NTS efforts resulted in clearer understanding of equipment deficiencies, dye characteristics and composition, and secondary wastes generated. Future tests, scheduled for July, 1996 will demonstrate higher bum rates, better pH measurement and control, and stack emission test results for other colored dyes...|$|R
40|$|We have {{constructed}} a confocal scanner suitable for routine microarray analysis from commercially available parts. We have outlined {{the details that}} should be considered when designing such an instrument and listed some of the specific components comprising the system [the full list of system components is available on CD from the corresponding author (D. J. G.) at no charge]. Here, we describe the methods used to test the linearity and sensitivity of the instrument. Performance was evaluated with two commonly used dyes, fluorescein and Cy 5. While the instrument had a linear correlation between the dye concentration and fluorescence intensity, the observed deviation from a slope of 1. 0 underscores the importance of running multipoint calibration experiments to obtain accurate dye quantitation over the full dynamic range of the scanner. This method has utility in testing commercial instruments in addition to the scanner described here. An array with over 300 <b>spots</b> <b>dyed</b> with Cy 3 was scanned with our instrument and a high-end commercial instrument. The agreement between the two instruments was very good over a 1000 -fold intensity range. Our scanner is a cost-effective alternative to more costly commercial scanners with similar capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Differential in-gel {{electrophoresis}} (DIGE) experiments allow three protein {{samples to}} be run per gel. The three samples are labeled with the spectrally resolvable fluorescent dyes, Cy 2, Cy 3, and Cy 5, respectively. Here, we show that protein-specific dye effects exist, and we present a linear mixed model for analysis of DIGE data which takes dye effects into account. A Java implementation of the model, called DIGEanalyzer, is freely available at [URL] Three DIGE experiments from our laboratory, with 173, 64, and 24 gels, respectively, were used to quantify and verify the dye effects. DeCyder 5. 0 and 6. 5 were used for spot detection and matching. The fractions of proteins with a statistically significant (0. 001 level) dye effect were 19, 34, and 23 %, respectively. The fractions of proteins with a dye effect above 1. 4 -fold change were 1, 4, and 6 %, respectively. The median magnitude of the dye effect was 1. 07 -fold change for Cy 5 versus Cy 3 and 1. 16 -fold change for Cy 3 versus Cy 2. The maximal dye effect was a seven-fold change. The <b>dye</b> effects of <b>spots</b> corresponding to the same protein tend to be similar {{within each of the}} three experiments, and to a smaller degree across experiments...|$|R
40|$|Background: Bioassays are {{routinely}} {{used to evaluate}} the toxicity of test agents. Experimental designs for bioassays are largely encompassed by fixed effects linear models. In toxicogenomics studies where DNA arrays measure mRNA levels, the tissue samples are typically generated in a bioassay. These measurements introduce additional sources of variation, which must be properly managed to obtain valid tests of treatment effects. Results: An analysis of covariance model is developed which combines a fixed-effects linear model for the bioassay with important variance components associated with DNA array measurements. These models can accommodate the dominant characteristics of measurements from DNA arrays, and they account for technical variation associated with normalization, <b>spots,</b> <b>dyes,</b> and batches as well as the biological variation associated with the bioassay. An example illustrates how the model is used to identify valid designs and to compare competing designs. Conclusions: Many toxicogenomics studies are bioassays which measure gene expression using DNA arrays. These studies can be designed and analyzed using standard methods with a few modifications to account for characteristics of array measurements, such as multiple endpoints and normalization. As much as possible, technical variation associated with probes, dyes, and batches are managed by blocking treatments within these sources of variation. An example shows how some practical constraints can be accommodated by this modelling and how it allows one to objectively compare competin...|$|R
5|$|A {{research}} survey at Kodumanal has unearthed {{the remains}} of an ancient blast furnace, its circular base distinguishable by its white colour, probably the result of high temperature. Around the base, many iron slags, some with embedded burnt clay, vitrified brick-bats, many terracotta pipes with vitrified mouths and a granite slab, {{which may have been}} the anvil, have been recovered. Absence of potsherds and other antiquities has suggested that the smelting place was located outside the boundary of habitation. More furnaces were discovered at the same site with burnt clay pieces with rectangular holes. The pieces were part of the furnace wall, the holes designed to allow a natural draught of air to pass through evenly into the furnace. Many vitrified crucibles were also recovered from this site; one of them notable because it was found in an in situ position. Evidence of steel making is also found in the crucibles excavated at this site. In addition to iron and steel, the metallurgy seems to have possibly extended to copper, bronze, lead, silver and gold objects. At Arikamedu, there were indications of small-scale workshops containing {{the remains of}} working in metal, glass, semiprecious stones, ivory and shell. Kodumanal has yielded evidence for the practice of weaving, {{in the form of a}} number of intact terracotta spindle whorls pierced at the centre by means of an iron rod, indicating the knowledge of cotton spinning and weaving. To further strengthen this theory, a well preserved piece of woven cotton cloth was also recovered from this site. <b>Dyeing</b> vats were <b>spotted</b> at Arikamedu.|$|R
