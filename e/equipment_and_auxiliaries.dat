It focuses on the tasks of Maintenance and Traffic Management for different groups of objects, in particular road-sections (pavements), engineering structures, <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>auxiliary</b> installations. The experiences with the IRMS in Switzerland have been so convincing that all its users have decided to extend it to their entire road-network, with partial consideration of complementary tasks (Information Management, Quality Management). This decision is mainly based on the necessity to justify their objective-based programs for the politicians and public opinion. Furthermore the IRMS enables the responsible staff of any road-administration to make decisions more rapidly and understandable, as well as establish continuity {{as part of a}} systematic road-policy. Finally the IRMS is, because of its object-independence, also suitable to maintain any other sort of objects or facilities (for example: canals, pipeline installations, military constructions, industrial complexes, airport facilities, buildings). For such cases the objectives and the criteria of the system have to be extended, and modified. 1...|$|R

40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} {{to study the}} effects of the sheet metal on the process of punching circular holes with viscoelastic tooling. Two different kinds of aluminum sheet metal, each with four thicknesses were used in the experiments. The mechani­cal properties of the various sheets were evaluated with particular attention being paid to the mechanical anisotropy so that this could be related to the failure during the punching operation. A new high pressure retainer was designed and built for pressurization of the viscoelastic press pads. This along with existing <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>auxiliary</b> apparatus for the detection of secondary fracture was used to study the primary and secondary fractures. As a result of the analysis of the primary and secondary fractures a useful prediction equation was developed. The prediction equation, with limitations, can be used to esti­mate the pressure necessary to cause complete fracture when punching holes in the aluminum sheet metals. The secondary, fracture analysis yielded contour-type plots from which the suitability of certain combinations of the process variables can be determined. These plots show that for certain combina­tions complete fracture cannot be obtained with practical pressure ratios and with other combinations an optimum punch­ing condition can be established. Suggestions for future research on viscoelastic tooling have been presented...|$|R

The primary aim was to accomplish the experiments. The secondary aim was to begin the development of the heat flux models and create a basis for future work. The heat flux models were supposed to be mathematical models implemented in a computer software and general for any type of spray nozzles. The heat flux models were also supposed to be able to communicate with an auxiliary thermal FE-program. A heat transfer model based on both scientifically proven physical laws and empirical correlations was established. An experimental set up in order to do the experiments was put together. It consisted of a test rig, measurement <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>auxiliary</b> <b>equipment.</b> The mathematical models were supposed to calculate the heat flux at a specified node of a part exposed to spray cooling. Special heat transfer correlations for spray quenching were used to calculate the heat flux. The evaluations of the results indicated that there was a significant difference between the theoretical temperatures and the measured surface temperatures. The conclusions are that the heat transfer model overestimates the heat flux and that the heat transfer model needs to be modified. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|In {{order for}} fuel cells {{to play a}} large part in a global {{sustainable}} energy infrastructure, fuel cell-based systems need to be built {{to meet the demands}} of a wide range of applications in all aspects of society. To date, the majority of fuel cell research has been focused on developing systems to power applications such as passenger vehicles, commercial buildings, and small handheld devices. These applications typically require power outputs that are either greater than 100 kW or less than 20 W, and a gap remains in developing viable fuel cell systems for applications requiring electric power between 100 W and 100 kW. Some of these applications include unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), residential power generators, <b>equipment</b> pumps, camping <b>and</b> recreational devices, lawn <b>and</b> garden <b>equipment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>auxiliary</b> power units. Key requirements for these applications include a power system that is portable, has a quick startup time, and can be easily refueled. The focus of this dissertation is to identify and address the engineering gaps encountered when developing a viable fuel cell system capable of meeting the requirements for these “medium”-sized power applications. Ultimately, an integrated reformer fuel cell system is proposed; this system utilizes a propane catalytic partial oxidation rector coupled with a HT-PEM fuel cell. Using this structure, the optimal operating conditions for propane catalytic partial oxidation were investigated. Additionally, the performance of a HT-PEM fuel cell under various conditions while operating directly on propane fuel reformate was assessed. After investigation into the weight, power, run time, and durability requirements of military UAVs, a reformer fuel cell system is proposed that produces a net power of 250 with a total mass 2. 23 kg, and is capable of a 200 -hour lifetime. This proposed design offers significant advantages over current UAV propulsion technologies in that it is both quiet and capable of long flight durations, unlike battery and internal combustion engine technology presently used that suffer from either low specific energy or high noise level. The proposed system also has advantages over other fuel cell systems in that it is fueled with commonly available propane, where other mobile fuel cells require high purity H 2 that is difficult to obtain. In addition to assessing the technical feasibility of such a system, the potential environmental benefits relative to incumbent technology are described...|$|R
