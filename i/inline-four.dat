5|$|The Chevrolet CobaltSS {{comprises}} three sport compact {{versions of}} the Chevrolet Cobalt that were built on the General Motors Delta platform at Lordstown Assembly in Ohio, United States. The three versions included two forced induction <b>inline‑four</b> Ecotec engines and a third naturally aspirated engine that was later called the CobaltSport. SS is an abbreviation of Super Sport, a moniker used by Chevrolet to denote high performance upgrades for the vehicle that meet certain criteria.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical {{specifications}} carried over, {{except for}} a new five-speed manual transmission, optional on the 1.9-litre four-cylinder and 2.85-litre six-cylinder versions. In an attempt to improve sales figures of the <b>inline-four</b> engine, Holden spent considerable time improving its performance and efficiency. Modifications were also made to the 2.85-litre six to lift economy, and the powerplants managed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} by as much as 12.5 and 14percent, correspondingly. Holden released the sports-oriented Commodore SS sedan in September 1982—reintroducing a nameplate used briefly ten years prior with the HQ series. Provisioned with a choice of 4.2- or optional 5.0-litre V8 engines, both versions of the VH SS were teamed with a four-speed manual transmission. Racing driver Peter Brock's Holden Dealer Team (HDT) high performance outfit produced three upgraded versions, known as Group One, Group Two and Group Three, the latter version available in either 4.2-litre or more commonly 5.0-litre V8 configuration.|$|E
25|$|The {{available}} powerplants {{were three}} twin-cam <b>inline-four</b> engines—the 1.8-liter 4S-FE, plus the 3S-FE and higher-performance 3S-GE 2.0-liter units. Toyota also made available the 2.0-liter 2C-T turbo-diesel <b>inline-four,</b> {{and for the}} flagship Camry Prominent only, the 2.0-liter 1VZ-FE gasoline V6.|$|E
5000|$|... The F letter {{after the}} B letter {{means that the}} engine is multivalvular. Since the B family are <b>inline-fours,</b> {{that means that the}} engine uses 16 valves.|$|R
5000|$|Engines {{available}} were 1.3- and 1.5-liter Orion gasoline <b>inline-fours,</b> plus 1.6 and 1.8-liter Saturn gasoline <b>inline-fours.</b> For Greece only, a 1.2-liter {{version of}} Orion engine {{available in the}} entry-level models outputted [...] The 1.8-liter Sirius diesel carried over from the previous shape. In Japan, four-wheel-drive versions were also available, fitted with the carbureted 1.5 and fuel-injected 1.6-liter gasoline engines, or 1.8-liter diesel. The top Mirages in Japan were called the [...] "Cyborg", featuring the turbocharged 1.6-liter motor developing —the same as fitted to the GSR sedan. The third generation received a minor facelift in 1990, with late models receiving the same engines as were seen in the subsequent generation.|$|R
5000|$|The Giulietta was {{launched}} in November 1977. Two models were available: Giulietta 1.3, with an oversquare [...] 1357 cc engine, and Giulietta 1.6, with a [...] 1570 cc engine, both Alfa Romeo Twin Cam <b>inline-fours</b> fed by two twin-choke carburettors.|$|R
25|$|Chrysler {{received}} the Fiat Powertrain Technologies C635 dual dry-clutch transmission {{for use on}} Chrysler's turbo <b>inline-four</b> in the Dodge Dart in 2013.|$|E
25|$|The first-generation RX 300, {{fitted with}} a 3.0-liter V6 engine, began sales in 1998. The Japanese market Toyota Harrier {{released}} in 1997 also offered a 2.2-liter <b>inline-four,</b> later uprated to 2.4-liters. The second-generation RX 300 (3.0-liter V6) and RX 330 (3.3-liter V6) models went on sale in 2003, with both variants supplanted by the more powerful RX 350 (3.5-liter V6) in 2006. Like the previous series, a 2.4-liter <b>inline-four</b> engine was sold alongside the 3.0-liter V6 in the Japanese market Toyota Harrier. In 2005, a hybridized gasoline-electric version of the 3.3-liter second-generation model was made available as the RX 400h in export markets and as the Harrier Hybrid in Japan. For the third and current iteration released in 2009, both RX 350 (3.5-liter V6) and RX 450h (3.5-liter V6 hybrid) models were initially offered, with an entry-level RX 270 (2.7-liter <b>inline-four)</b> offered by Lexus in some Asian markets, including in Japan, since 2010. Since {{the release of the}} third generation, Japanese sales have occurred under the Lexus RX name as opposed to Toyota Harrier as had been the case previously.|$|E
25|$|The GS 300h {{hybrid model}} {{includes}} a 2.5-liter Atkinson cycle <b>inline-four</b> engine with a D-4S direct injection technology, {{derived from the}} third-generation Lexus IS. The vehicle was unveiled in 2013 Shanghai Motor Show. The vehicle went on sale in China, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, {{but not in the}} US.|$|E
50|$|Engine choices {{included}} 1.6-liter Mitsubishi Saturn (only available {{outside the}} domestic market), 1.8- and 2.0-liter Mitsubishi Sirius <b>inline-fours.</b> The latter unit also {{found its way}} into the 1987 and later Stellar, and in MPI form the 1986 Hyundai Grandeur. The body was a largely unchanged Hyundai Stellar.|$|R
50|$|Belgian arms {{manufacturer}} FN Herstal, {{which had}} been making motorcycles since 1901, began producing the first motorcycles with <b>inline-fours</b> in 1905. The FN Four had its engine mounted upright with the crankshaft longitudinal. Other manufacturers that used this layout included Pierce, Henderson, Ace, Cleveland, and Indian in the United States, Nimbus in Denmark, Windhoff in Germany, and Wilkinson in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|When Mitsubishi {{introduced}} a new independent generation of Lancer in 2000 (without a corresponding Mirage), the old Mirage-based sedan was discontinued in Japan, although production continued for export. The next phase in the Mirage's demise was {{the release of the}} Colt—a five-door hatchback—in 2002. The Colt replaced the Mirage hatchback, despite the latter being a three-door. Unlike its predecessor, the Colt featured a tall, upright design with a short engine compartment to maximize interior dimensions. Engines for the Colt comprised 1.1-liter three-cylinder, plus 1.3-, 1.5-, and 1.6-liter gasoline <b>inline-fours</b> with a standard five-speed manual and optional continuously variable transmission (automatic).|$|R
25|$|With {{launch of}} the Gentra X in South Korea, GMDAT had {{replaced}} engines of T250. 1.2L S-TEC II <b>inline-four</b> engine was updated with features such as dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) and timing chain (older version has timing belt) system. 1.6L E-TEC II engine had replaced with ECOTEC (GEN-III) engine with new features such as variable valve timing mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The Lexus ES 250 {{made its}} world debut at the April 2012 Auto China in Beijing. This car is {{equipped}} with a 2.5-liter <b>inline-four</b> engine and a six-speed automatic transmission. ES 250, ES 300h, and ES 350 models are being offered in China. Production started on 6 July 2012 at the Miyata plant in Miyawaka, Fukuoka.|$|E
25|$|The long-awaited {{turbocharged}} <b>inline-four</b> {{petrol engine}} from Proton was revealed at the 2010 Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show. Officially {{known as the}} 1.6L CamPro CFE, {{it is capable of}} producing power and torque figures of 138bhp (103kW) at 5,000 rpm and 205 N·m at 2,000–4,000 rpm respectively, comparable to a 2.0L naturally aspirated engine, while achieving better fuel efficiency and reduced greenhouse emissions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969 Honda {{revealed}} the CB750 superbike, establishing the template for the Universal Japanese Motorcycle {{with a range}} of transverse <b>inline-fours.</b> Relishing technological innovation, Honda unexpectedly moved on to adopt the V4 ("VF") configuration. However, some of the early VF models suffered mechanical problems, mainly as a result of poor quality camshafts (the [...] "chocolate cams"). Honda, alarmed that they were losing their hard-won reputation for reliability, moved to introduce the VFR750 motorcycles featuring gear-driven ohc cams and a very high build quality. The first three or four iterations of VFR motorcycles re-established Honda's reputation for quality, and the motorcycles received almost universal praise from journalists and riders alike.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{retained}} the frameless hardtop styling {{of the old}} Challenger, but had smaller engines (<b>inline-fours</b> instead of the six and eight-cylinder engines of the old Challenger) and {{was a long way}} off in performance from its namesake. Nevertheless, it acquired a reputation as a reasonably brisk performer in its class, not least because of its available 2.6 L [...] "Hemi" [...] engine with [...] Four-cylinder engines of this size had not usually been built due to inherent vibration, but Mitsubishi pioneered the use of balance shafts to help dampen this effect, and the Challenger {{was one of the first}} vehicles to bring this technology to the American market; it has since been licensed to many other manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|Today's {{fascination with}} retro style {{motorcycles}} began in 1989 with the Honda GB500 and the Kawasaki Zephyr, both first produced {{for sale in}} Japan as 400cc models. These retro-bikes evoked nostalgia for classic motorcycles from decades earlier. The Zephyr was made using the Z series <b>inline-fours</b> from the 1970s as a template. By the late 1990s Kawasaki was designing successors to the Zephyr series, based on even older generations of motorcycles with twin-cylinder engines. In 1999 Kawasaki released new retro-bikes, the V-twin Drifter and the vertical-twin W650. Unlike the 1960s W series, the 1999-2007 W650 had an up-to-date engine design very different from its ancestors, while {{holding on to the}} vintage British motorcycle look. The 2011-2013 W800 carries on with the W brand, and expands the range to include Café racer models.|$|R
25|$|The base model's SOHC <b>inline-four</b> engine {{produced}} 95hp (71kW) {{and had a}} 9.1:1 compression ratio. The {{more powerful}} 1990–1991 GSi used a 1.6L DOHC engine that produced 130hp (97kW) and had a 9.8:1 compression ratio. The GSi package also included driving lights, a spoiler, a rear anti-sway bar, and a transmission with a gear ratio that was slightly better for acceleration than the base model's manual transmission.|$|E
25|$|All trim levels {{include a}} seven-inch MyLink touch-screen {{infotainment}} system with A/M-F/M radio, USB integration, a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, optional SiriusXM satellite radio, voice control, and CarPlay and Android Auto capabilities, keyless entry, power windows, power door locks, OnStar with 4G/LTE/Wi-Fi Hotspot connectivity for multiple devices and RemoteLink via an app on the consumer's smartphone, air conditioning, and a 1.4-liter EcoTec <b>inline-four</b> engine.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the RC was {{available}} {{with a choice}} of three engines; the RC 300h with the 2.5-liter 2AR-FSE <b>inline-four</b> engine mated to a continuously variable transmission, the RC 350 with the 3.5-liter 2GR-FSE V6, and the RC F with 5.0-liter 2UR-GSE V8. The RC 200t, featuring a 2.0-liter 8AR-FTS I4 turbocharged petrol engine, was added to the range in late 2015. All-wheel drive is offered for the RC 300h and RC 350.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine and}} {{transmission}} were licensed from Mitsubishi Motors. Engines available were 1.4 L (4G33) and 1.6 L (4G32) <b>inline-fours</b> until 1986 (same as the Hyundai Pony, using either a KM119 5-speed manual or a Borg-Warner 03-55L 3-speed automatic) and a 2.0 L engine for 1987. Trim levels included L (base), GL/CL, and GSL/CXL. The GSL/CXL featured power windows, locks and mirrors; remote fuel door, remote trunk, premium sound system, full instrumentation (speed, tach, fuel, water temp, volts, and oil pressure) and available air conditioning, a rather surprising list of features {{for the year}} and type of car. The Stellar's Ford genes and conventional design led many British observers to compare it with the then recently discontinued Cortina - where conservative buyers were scared off by the Sierra's radical styling, a fact played upon by Hyundai's advertising agency with print advertisements depicting a jelly/jello mold shaped like the Sierra, above {{a picture of the}} Stellar. Like the Cortina, the Stellar also has wishbone suspension up front with a coil sprung live rear axle.|$|R
50|$|In 1964 the Marcos 1800 GT was introduced, {{using the}} four-cylinder Volvo 1800 cc unit with {{overdrive}} gearbox and De Dion rear axle. This {{was to be}} the design that would become familiar to sports car enthusiasts for more than 30 years, even though the original plywood chassis would later be replaced by a steel chassis. A variety of other engines, mostly from Ford, but also from Triumph and Volvo became available over the years. In 1966 the GT was changed to Ford engines of originally 1500 cc, later 1650 and 1600 cc, and a coil-sprung live rear axle. In 1968 the Ford Essex V6 engine from the Capri Mk1 was added. In 1969 the plywood chassis was replaced by steel, which shortened production time and saved on cost, and the Ford Essex V4 engine replaced the earlier <b>inline-fours.</b> In 1971 a few cars with the Triumph 2.5-litre straight-six were built, to use up engines from the slow selling Mantis. As the bonnet was a close fit over the engine, this variety of engines resulted in a corresponding variation in the bonnet design, particularly as regards changes designed to clear engine air intakes, often the only external sign of the type of engine fitted.|$|R
25|$|In August 2010, Lexus began {{offering}} the RX 270 (AGL10), a front-wheel drive {{model with a}} 2.7-liter 1AR-FE <b>inline-four</b> engine, in Japan, China, and Russia. The RX 270 was a new entry-level offering for the RX lineup, produced with a lower base price and fewer emissions. It was introduced at the 2010 Moscow Auto Show, and aimed to circumvent the additional taxes applied to automobiles with large engine displacements and higher emissions; import cars in China over 3.0 L are subject to additional fees.|$|E
25|$|The Alfa Romeo Spider {{was based}} on Giulia mechanicals, {{including}} its Alfa Romeo twin cam <b>inline-four,</b> independent front and solid axle rear suspension, and unibody construction, incorporating the relatively new principles of crumple zones into the front and rear. Following the evolution the other Giulia sport variants, the Spider was powered by a 1.6L engine, later received the 1.3L 1300, 1.8L 1750 and finally 2.0L 2000 engines. Unlike any other Giulia derivative, it was upgraded and continued to sell through four decades, into the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Engines {{fitted to}} the Cruze are the 1.6-liter Family 1 <b>inline-four,</b> a 1.8-liter {{version of the}} same, and a 2.0-liter VM Motori RA 420 SOHC {{turbocharged}} common rail diesel, marketed as VCDi. All three engines are coupled to a five-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic transmission featuring Active Select. When the Cruze launched in the United States in 2010, a new 1.4-liter Family 0 turbocharged gasoline engine was introduced. North American models fitted with the 1.8-liter gasoline engine have also been upgraded to a standard six-speed manual.|$|E
25|$|The SS20 Cervo {{received}} a very minor facelift in 1978, consisting mainly of interior upgrades. In June 1982, the rear-engined Cervo was discontinued {{in favor of}} a more conventionally laid out replacement, the SS40. In Chile the Cervo was originally only sold with the 970cc F10A engine; a May 1979 drastic lowering on tariffs on cars of less than 850cc meant that the 797cc F8A <b>inline-four</b> became available in that market. The chassis code of this model is SC80. This was sold alongside a better equipped model with the 1 litre F10A as used in the SC100.|$|E
25|$|Celica Camry {{utilizes}} the front-engine, rear-wheel-drive {{layout and}} in A40 guise, a standard four-link rigid axle suspension system with gasoline <b>inline-four</b> engines displacing 1.6liters for the 12T-U (TA41) and 1.8liters with the 13T-U (TA46). Initial model grades comprised: 1600 LT, 1600 XT, 1800 LT, 1800 XT, and 1800 XT Super Edition. In August 1980, Toyota released high-end models with four-wheel independent suspension, denoted A50 (front MacPherson struts, rear semi-trailing arm setup; four-wheel disc brakes). For the TA57 series 1800 SX, Toyota fitted the 1.8-liter 3T-EU engine. Toyota designated the new 2.0-liter grades, the 21R-U powered 2000 SE and 18R-GEU-based 2000 GT as RA56 and RA55, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Cooper's own route into Formula One was {{somewhat}} unorthodox. Following on from producing the Vanwall Maddock {{began work on}} a new sportscar, designed around Coventry Climax's new FWA 1,098 cc <b>inline-four</b> engine. Maddock and John Cooper decided to adapt the Mark IX Formula Three chassis to accept the larger, more powerful engine, retaining the engine mounted behind the driver and the driver's seat on the car's centre-line, per the single-seater's arrangement. The T39 chassis consequently featured Cooper's curved tube design, with the upper longerons sweeping up from the front suspension mounts, passing {{on either side of}} the driving position and engine, before looping back down the rear suspension. The passenger seat, mandated by sportscar rules of the time, was mounted outboard of the chassis on the driver's left.|$|E
25|$|Sport bikes {{emphasize}} top speed, acceleration, braking, {{handling and}} grip on paved roads, typically {{at the expense}} of comfort and fuel economy in comparison to less specialized motorcycles. Because of this, there are certain design elements that most motorcycles of this type will share. Sport bikes have comparatively high performance engines resting inside a lightweight frame. <b>Inline-four</b> engines dominate the sport bike category, with V-twins having a significant presence, and nearly every other engine configuration appearing in small numbers at one time or another. The combination of these elements helps maintain structural integrity and chassis rigidity. Braking systems combine higher performance brake pads and multi-piston calipers that clamp onto oversized vented rotors. Suspension systems are advanced in terms of adjustments and materials for increased stability and durability. Most sport bikes have fairings, often completely enclosing the engine, and windscreens that effectively deflect the air at very high speeds, or at least reduce overall drag.|$|E
500|$|In some Asian {{countries}} where the Aurion is sold as the Toyota Camry, both 2.0- and 2.4-litre powerplants are offered. The naturally aspirated 3.5-litre engine is also available {{in some of these}} markets. The 2.0-litre 1AZ-FE <b>inline-four</b> has a maximum output of [...] of power and [...] of torque. These figures rise to [...] and [...] when the 2.4-litre 2AZ-FE unit is fitted. Of the two four-cylinder motors, the latter is teamed with Toyota's five-speed U250E automatic, with the U241E four-speed unit reserved for the 2.0-litre model. From circa 2009, Toyota began offering a new 2.0-litre 3ZR-FE <b>inline-four</b> petrol engine in some markets. Producing [...] and , the 3ZR-FE was available with the four-speed U241E automatic, or in some markets with a six-speed manual.|$|E
500|$|The Sunbeam Tiger was a {{development}} of the Sunbeam Alpine series I, introduced by the British manufacturer Rootes in 1959. Rootes realised that the Alpine needed more power if it was to compete successfully in world markets, but lacked a suitable engine and the resources to develop one. The company therefore approached Ferrari to redesign the standard <b>inline-four</b> cylinder engine, recognising the sales cachet that [...] "powered by Ferrari" [...] {{would be likely to}} bring. Negotiations initially seemed to go well, but ultimately broke down.|$|E
500|$|Kaiser, Allstate, Frazer and the economy/compact Henry J {{product lines}} all ceased {{production}} {{before the end}} of the 1955 model year run, partly owing to their failure to produce and market a viable V8 engine in a marketplace increasingly focused on the clout (and horsepower) associated with a V8 power plant. In particular, the Henry J (named after Henry J Kaiser sold an initially strong 82,000 units with its 68hp, <b>inline-four</b> power plant and optional 80hp inline-six, but starting at $1363, the consumer could buy a full-sized Chevrolet auto with an inline-6 for only $200 more than the Henry J inline-4, making it economically unappealing, and all three lines underpowered when compared to the offerings of the Big Three. [...] The Allstate is an example of badge engineering, being a rebranded Henry J. [...] It was sold exclusively at Sears, Roebuck and Company in 1952 and 1953.|$|E
2500|$|The Astre {{used the}} Vega 140cuin (2.3-liter) <b>inline-four</b> engine through 1976. The engine {{features}} an aluminum-alloy cylinder block and cast-iron cylinder {{head with a}} single overhead camshaft (OHC). 1977 models featured Pontiac's 151cuin (2.5-liter) <b>inline-four</b> engine with a cast-iron block and head with [...] overhead valves (OHV). Transmissions are the three- and four-speed manual, five-speed manual with overdrive (1976–1977 option) and the three-speed automatic.|$|E
2500|$|The North American-spec Sonic is {{available}} as a 4-door sedan or five-door hatchback. It comes with a 1.8-liter <b>inline-four</b> producing [...] and [...] torque, or a 1.4-liter turbo <b>inline-four</b> producing [...] and [...] torque. The 1.8-liter engine has a timing belt; the 1.4L turbo engine uses a timing chain to drive the camshafts. The 1.8-liter <b>inline-four</b> is mated to a standard five-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission, while the 1.4-liter turbo has a six-speed manual transmission. The Sonic is, notably, the only car in its class to be assembled in America. For the 2015 model year, the US Sonic added OnStar with 4G LTE and standard built-in Wi-Fi hotspot (includes 3GB/three-month data trial), a 1.4L turbo engine that became standard on LTZ models, and a new exterior color, Blue Velvet.|$|E
2500|$|Chevrolet {{developed}} the car's all-aluminum <b>inline-four</b> [...] engine, and British company Cosworth Engineering designed the DOHC cylinder head. 5,000 engines were built.|$|E
