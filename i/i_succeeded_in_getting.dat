6000|$|... "Yes, why not, my old friend," [...] said I, and, {{going to}} {{the master of the}} boat, <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> a pint of rum in a bottle.|$|E
60|$|After some {{considerable}} trouble Archie and <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> two carts with horses to carry our dead and wounded, for I was determined {{the bodies of}} those lads who had given up their lives for the Cause should be carried where they might receive a soldier's burial.|$|E
60|$|We {{struggled}} {{about the}} room, striking one another, knocking over furniture, and rolling upon the floor. Menelek {{was a powerful}} man, and he was fighting for his life. Continually he kept calling for the guard, until <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> a grip upon his throat; {{but it was too}} late. His cries had been heard, and suddenly the door burst open, and a score of armed guardsmen rushed into the apartment.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Mr. Brook said. [...] "It {{is held in}} a field {{belonging}} to [...] "The Chequers," [...] and even did <b>I</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> it closed--which of course {{would be out of}} the question--they would find some other site for the booths." ...|$|R
60|$|Not until I {{had gone}} through the acts of a contortionist, and shown the round coin sewed <b>in,</b> did <b>I</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> the Carter's help. Even then his hand was {{trembling}} so that I was afraid he would cut me instead of the stitches, and I was forced to take the knife away and do it myself. Out rolled the gold piece, a fortune in their hungry eyes; and away we stampeded for the nearest coffee-house.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Whatever I have, I {{hold for}} her. If <b>I</b> could <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> {{out of your}} hands enough {{to make up the}} full sum that I owe her--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I was {{detained}} three months at Toulon, sir, {{and there was}} allowed to buy some French books. I was then a month {{on the way to}} Verdun, and five months there. During that time I practised French incessantly, and picked up enough to pass muster. At last, thanks to a French girl, <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> a disguise and climbing over the wall, and passed through France as a pedlar with wares made by the prisoners.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{being turned}} aside twice again by {{advancing}} fires, <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> {{through to the}} university. On {{the edge of the}} campus I came upon a party of university folk who were going {{in the direction of the}} Chemistry Building. They were all family men, and their families were with them, including the nurses and the servants. Professor Badminton greeted me, I had difficulty in recognizing him. Somewhere he had gone through flames, and his beard was singed off. About his head was a bloody bandage, and his clothes were filthy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I've got him!" [...] cried my sportsman {{in great}} glee; {{but he had}} not got him, for I closed with him, and we swayed about and put forth all our strength, and finally came down with a crash on a couch under the window. Then after some {{struggling}} <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> on top, and with my right hand on his face and my knee on his body to keep him pressed down, I managed with my left hand to capture the wasp and put him out.|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way, Francis," [...] Messer Polani said, [...] "you {{will be glad}} to {{hear that}} <b>I</b> have <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> home your man Giuseppi. He {{returned}} two days ago, and I have no doubt is somewhere below waiting to see you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Do you not see,” said he, “the savages {{themselves}} are fearful {{of being too}} late, and I should hurry forward myself at once, did I not think that, if I showed too much eagerness, I should destroy all our hopes of reaping any benefit from this fortunate event. If you will only endeavour to appear tranquil or unconcerned, you will quiet their suspicions, and I have no doubt they will then let me go {{with them to the}} beach, supposing that I merely go out of curiosity. Should <b>I</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> down to the boats, I will make known the condition in which I have left you, and measures may then be taken to secure our escape.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Nathaniel, I have {{no doubt}} you would. But {{consider}} me a little <b>in</b> this. <b>I</b> have <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> this girl, {{and you know how}} much the money will be to us. Do you think it too much to keep away from your favourite haunt in the village for a single day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After I {{wrote to}} you last year, <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> my husband {{away from the}} detestable University. But he persisted in hanging about Germany, and conferring with moldy old doctors (whom he calls [...] "Princes of Science"!) instead of {{returning}} to Paris, taking a handsome house, and making {{his way to the}} top of the tree with my help. I am the very woman to give brilliant parties, and to push my husband's interests with powerful people of all degrees. No; I really must not dwell on it. When I think of what has happened since, it will drive me mad.|$|E
60|$|He {{closed with}} me, {{and we went}} at it {{for all the world}} like a couple of small boys fighting. We {{scratched}} and bit, pulled hair, clinched, and threw each other down. I remember <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> on him what in my college days I learned was called a half-Nelson. This hold gave me the decided advantage. But I did not enjoy it long. He twisted up one leg, and with the foot (or hind-hand) made so savage an onslaught upon my abdomen as to threaten to disembowel me. I had to release him in order to save myself, and then we went at it again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} one thing more," [...] he said. [...] "There are others in this cruel city, dear heart, who have trusted me, and whom I must not fail--Marie de Marmontel and her brother, {{faithful}} servants of the late queen; they were on the eve of arrest when <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> them to a place of comparative safety; and there are others there, too all of these poor victims have trusted me implicitly. They are waiting for me there, trusting in my promise to convey them safely to England. Sweetheart, you must redeem my promise to them. You will?--you will? Promise me that you will--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{a lesser}} degree," [...] she said, [...] "I, too, have failed. <b>I</b> have <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> the royalist {{officers}} {{removed from the}} frontier army, but {{with regard to the}} navy, they would do nothing. The French government declined to believe that England might need assistance. We shall get no aid from there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most {{probably}} not. My {{ways and}} Lord Ongar's will be altogether different, even if <b>I</b> should <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> up to London. If you {{ever come to}} see Hermione here, I may chance to meet you in the house. But you will not do that often, the place is so dull and unattractive." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{came on a}} {{singularly}} engrossing game of [...] "hide-and-seek." [...] Convinced that Mrs. Smiley {{was innocent}} of any trick in {{the movement of the}} horn, I tried every expedient to satisfy myself that [...] "Wilbur's" [...] voice was independent of her own; but <b>I</b> did not <b>succeed.</b> Mrs. Smiley spoke almost at the same moment but never precisely synchronous with Wilbur's whisper. She answered all my questions perfectly unconcerned and unexcited, lending herself to my experiments. All in vain. At no time did <b>I</b> <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> [...] "Wilbur's" [...] voice at precisely the same moment with her own, though the whisper, following swiftly on her speech, interjected remarks as if echoing her questions. There was always an approximate interval between her voice and the spirit whisper.|$|R
60|$|I came to Salisbury {{one day to}} find it full of visitors, but <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> a room in one of {{the small}} family hotels. I was told by the {{landlord}} that a congress was being held, got up by the Society for the pursuit or propagation of Holiness, and that delegates, mostly evangelical clergymen and ministers of the gospel of all denominations, with many lay brothers, had come in from all over the kingdom and were holding meetings every day and all day long at one of the large halls. The three bedrooms on the same floor with mine, he said, were all occupied by delegates who had travelled from the extreme north of England.|$|E
60|$|I had {{to visit}} Niagara fifteen times before <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> my {{imaginary}} Falls gauged to the actuality and {{could begin to}} sanely and wholesomely wonder at {{them for what they}} were, not what I had expected them to be. When I first approached them it was with my face lifted toward the sky, for I thought I was going to see an Atlantic ocean pouring down thence over cloud-vexed Himalayan heights, a sea-green wall of water sixty miles front and six miles high, and so, when the toy reality came suddenly into view--that beruffled little wet apron hanging out to dry--the shock was too much for me, and I fell with a dull thud.|$|E
6000|$|... "There I {{could not}} refrain from {{stopping}} a moment {{by the side}} of the sleeping babe, upon whose cherub-like face the light of the night lamp dimly shone. The little child was still sleeping sweetly, and my impulse was to stop and kiss it; but I knew that this would be wrong. The infant might awake and utter a cry and my father's joke be spoiled. I moved to the open window, and with some trouble, and, I think, without any noise, <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> out upon the trellis with the box under my arm. The descent was awkward, but my father was a tall man, and, reaching upward, relieved me of my burden before I got to the ground.|$|E
60|$|My brother, ambitious {{of a big}} bag, {{invariably}} went {{a distance}} from home in quest of the large flocks, and despised my way of duck- shooting; but it sometimes vexed him to find on his return from a day's expedition that <b>I</b> had <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> as many birds as himself without having gone {{much more than a}} mile from home.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should feel}} {{all right if}} I only had a little more strength. It {{is hard to know}} that I shall have to lie here a long time, simply waiting to get strong, and all the {{business}} <b>I</b> had <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting,</b> done by some one else. But perhaps I couldn't have kept what I had after that scrape about the glycerine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! that shews you're a--I mean, d'ye see, {{that the}} {{difficulty}} lies here, my elbows are lashed so fast {{to my side}} that I can't use them to prop me up, but if Poopy will roll {{down the hill to}} my side, and shove her pretty shoulder under my back when I raise it, perhaps <b>I</b> may <b>succeed</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> up. What say you, Kickup?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A l'autre station, vite, vite!"--To {{the other}} station, quick, quick! He mounted the box, and {{commenced}} lashing his Rosinante, {{who was a}} subject for crows to mourn over, (because they could hope for nothing in trying to pick him,) and in an ambling, scrambling pace, composed of a trot, a canter, and a kick, we made a descent like an avalanche into the station yard. There Richard was himself again. I assumed at once {{the air of a}} gentleman who had seen the review, and walked about with composure and dignity. No doubt I had seen the emperor and all the troops. <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> home just in the middle of dinner, and by dint of hard eating caught up at the third course with the rest.|$|E
60|$|Yes, I had it beautifully worked out, and I {{waited until}} he should turn in my direction. At last it became evident {{that he was doing}} so, when {{apparently}} without cause, the filly raised her head, neighed and started off at a trot in the opposite direction, immediately followed, of course, by the colts and my stallion. It looked for a moment as though my last hope was blasted; but presently their fright, if fright it was, passed, and they resumed grazing again a hundred yards farther on. This time there was no bush within fifty feet of them, and I was at a loss as to how to get within safe roping-distance. Anywhere under forty feet I am an excellent roper, at fifty feet I am fair; but over that I knew it would be a matter of luck if <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> my noose about that beautiful arched neck.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{having a}} {{perfectly}} dreadful time getting the Junior Reds started. <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> Betty Mead as president, and I am secretary, but they put Jen Vickers in as treasurer and I despise her. She {{is the sort}} of girl who calls any clever, handsome, or distinguished people she knows slightly by their first names--behind their backs. And she is sly and two-faced. Una doesn't mind, of course. She is willing to do anything that comes to hand and never minds whether she has an office or not. She is just a perfect angel, while I am only angelic in spots and demonic in other spots. I wish Walter would take a fancy to her, but he never seems to think about her in that way, although I heard him say once she was like a tea rose. She is too. And she gets imposed upon, just because she is so sweet and willing; but I don't allow people to impose on Rilla Blythe and 'that you may tie to,' as Susan says.|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose you}} know that success has so far {{attended}} my banners--my political banners I mean, and not my literary. In conjunction with the Three Great Powers <b>I</b> have <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> rid of My President and My Chief-Justice. They've gone home, the one to Germany, the other to Souwegia. I hear little echoes of footfalls of their departing footsteps {{through the medium of}} the newspapers....|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>succeeded,</b> however, <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> myself fairly wet all over, even if I {{did nothing}} else, and then I looked {{about for a}} towel. Of course, there was no towel. That is the trick. The idea of the railway {{authorities}} is to lure the passenger, by providing him {{with soap and water}} and a basin, into getting himself thoroughly soaked, and then to let it dawn upon him that there is no towel. That is their notion of fun! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I left my {{entertaining}} companion with Mr. Glennie last Thursday week, [...] and I {{have since}} learnt from {{him that he}} is very comfortable and likes [...] the situation. His schoolfellows are very fine youths, and their [...] deportment does very great credit to their Preceptor. <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> [...] <b>getting</b> Lord Byron a separate room, and I am persuaded the greatest [...] attention will be paid to him. Mr. Glennie is a Scotchman, has [...] travelled a great deal, and seems every way qualified for his present [...] situation." ...|$|R
60|$|Smudge and {{his companions}} were less on the alert, {{as soon as they}} {{perceived}} the ship was going in the proper direction. They probably believed the danger in a measure over, and they began to yield a little to their physical sufferings. I called Neb to the wheel, and leaning over the taffrail, <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> Marble to a cabin-window, without alarming Smudge. I then told the mate to get all his forces in the forecastle, having observed that the Indians avoided that part of the vessel, on account of the heavy plunges she occasionally made, and possibly because they fancied our people were all aft. As soon as the plan was understood, I strolled forward, looking up at the sails, and touching a rope, here and there, like one bent on his ordinary duty. The savage stationed at the fore-scuttle was as sick as a dog, and with streaming eyes, he was paying the landsmen's tribute to the sea. The hatch was very strong, and it was secured simply by its hasp and a bit of iron thrust through it. I had only to slip my hand down, remove the iron, throw open the hatch, when the ship's company streamed up on deck, Marble leading.|$|E
60|$|Marble {{could keep}} silence no longer. He told me afterwards, that, during the dialogue, {{he had been}} taking {{the measure of the}} old usurer's foot, and felt it would be a disgrace to strike so feeble a creature; but, to sit and hear his newly-found mother sneered at, and her just rights derided, was more than his {{patience}} could endure. Rising abruptly, therefore, he broke out at once in one of the plainest philippics of the sea. I shall not repeat all he said; for, to render it justly, might be to render it offensive; but, in addition to calling old Van Tassel by a great many names that were as unusual as they were quaint, he called him by several that would be familiar to the ears of most of my readers, besides being perfectly well merited. I allowed his humour to find vent; and, giving the attorney to understand he should hear further from us, <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> my companion to the wagon, without coming to blows. I could see that Van Tassel was very far from being at his ease, and that he would still gladly keep us, if he could, in the hope of bringing about some sort of a compromise, if possible; but I thought it wisest to let matters rest awhile, after the decided demonstration we had already made.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} (17th) we landed on Chatham Island, which, like the others, rises with a tame and rounded outline, broken {{here and there}} by {{scattered}} hillocks, the remains of former craters. Nothing could be less inviting than the first appearance. A broken field of black basaltic lava, thrown into the most rugged waves, and crossed by great fissures, is everywhere covered by stunted, sunburnt brushwood, which shows little signs of life. The dry and parched surface, being heated by the noonday sun, gave to the air a close and sultry feeling, like that from a stove: we fancied even that the bushes smelt unpleasantly. Although I diligently tried to collect as many plants as possible, <b>I</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> very few; and such wretched-looking little weeds would have better become an arctic than an equatorial Flora. The brushwood appears, from a short distance, as leafless as our trees during winter; and it was some time before I discovered that not only almost every plant was now in full leaf, but that the greater number were in flower. The commonest bush {{is one of the}} Euphorbiaceae: an acacia and a great odd-looking cactus are the only trees which afford any shade. After the season of heavy rains, the islands are said to appear for a short time partially green. The volcanic island of Fernando Noronha, placed in many respects under nearly similar conditions, is the only other country where I have seen a vegetation at all like this of the Galapagos Islands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't go yet, M. de Kernogan," [...] {{he said as}} the Frenchman made a {{movement}} to work {{his way out of}} the crowd, feeling no doubt that the atmosphere round him had become somewhat frigid if not exactly inimical, [...] "don't go yet, I beg of you. Pardi! Can't you see that you have been bringing me luck? As a rule Blakeney, who can so well afford to lose, has the devil's own good fortune, but to-night <b>I</b> have <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> some of my own back from him. Do not, I entreat you, break the run of my luck by going." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{not only}} <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> my things ready, but I {{found time to}} call at the Benedict Club in Piccadilly, where I knew that I should find Manners if he were still in town. There he was sure enough in the smoking-room, and I {{questioned}} him, over a cigarette, as to his reasons for throwing up his recent situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{railroad}} {{knows my}} business {{just a little}} bit better than I do," [...] he said. [...] "It knows my operating expenses to a cent, and it knows the terms of my contracts. How it knows these things I can only guess. It must have spies in my employ, and it must have access to the parties to all my contracts. For look you, when I place a big contract, the terms of which favor me a goodly profit, the freight rate from my quarry to market is promptly raised. No explanation is made. The railroad gets my profit. Under such circumstances <b>I</b> have never <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> the railroad to reconsider its raise. On the other hand, when there have been accidents, increased expenses of operating, or contracts with less profitable terms, <b>I</b> have always <b>succeeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>getting</b> the railroad to lower its rate. What is the result? Large or small, the railroad always gets my profits." ...|$|R
