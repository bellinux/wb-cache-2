50|$|There are {{currently}} no fungicides labeled for use to combat B. cactivora in the United States, though <b>difenoconazole</b> {{has been shown}} to be effective against the fungus. The recommended cultural practices to combat Bipolaris rot are to limit canopy wetness and to maintain a sanitized field. Irrigating in the morning to allow for the plants to dry throughout the day as well as proper spacing of the plants to allow airflow through the canopy will aid in drying and prevention of conditions suitable for the fungus. Similarly, field sanitation will interfere with the fungus’ ability to overwinter as conidia in plant debris, limiting exposure to the fungus during the following season. Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens have been shown to be effective biocontrol methods for fungus prevention.|$|E

40|$|<b>Difenoconazole</b> {{is a kind}} of {{persistant}} triazole pesticide {{and easily}} accumulates in aquatic organisms. This pesticide is recognized and categorized as potential human carcinogen or mutagen by USEPA based on its basic characteristic. The environmental risk assessment should be made when using such kind of pesticide considered for human and animal safety. The present study was undertaken to estimate the concentration of <b>difenoconazole</b> in the soil ecosystem and screen for <b>difenoconazole</b> degrading microorganisms. By field survey it was possible to collect 11 soil samples from different sites with higher amount of <b>difenoconazole</b> in Nantou County (sample name as FG or LF). The concentration of <b>difenoconazole</b> in the soil sample was estimated by Gas Chromatography with ECD detector. <b>Difenoconazole</b> degrading bacteria were isolated after enriched with <b>difenoconazole</b> as sole carbon source in BH medium. The concentration of <b>difenoconazole</b> in 11 soil samples ranged from 0. 03 - 1. 21 mg kg- 1. The <b>difenoconazole</b> concentration in 7 soils was monitored after natural attenuation treatment, and the residual rate of <b>difenoconazole</b> reached to 38 - 63 %. Inoculation of bacterial consortiums (FG 6 and FG 7) of soil solutions also helps in the reduction of the residual rate of <b>difenoconazole</b> (final 17 - 22 %) during 14 days incubation. After inoculation of each individual isolate into <b>difenoconazole</b> containing medium and incubation for 17 days, the residual rate of <b>difenoconazole</b> reached to 65 - 83 %. The results showed that <b>difenoconazole</b> degradation was better when used bacterial consortium than individual isolates. Among these isolates, Sinorhizobium morelense CC-FG 7 - 2 showed the best <b>difenoconazole</b> degrading activity, and other bacteria included Paenibacillus glycanilyticus CC-LF 3 - 2, Arthrobacter polychromogenes CC-LF 3 - 3, Rhodococcus qingshengii CC-LF 4 - 1, Rhodococcus erythropolis CC-LF 4 - 4 were also presented here with <b>difenoconazole</b> degrading activity in the first time. In the future the <b>difenoconazole</b> degrading bacterial strain might be used in the bioremediation of <b>difenoconazole</b> contaminated soil and shorten the persistant period of <b>difenoconazole</b> in the soil. 待克利(difenoconazole) 是一種不易於環境中降解之三唑類農藥，且可累積於生物體內危害水生生物，美國環境保護署(USEPA) 曾針對三唑類(triazole) 農藥進行致腫瘤及致突變性研究，將待克利歸類為可能之人類致癌物。基於農藥使用須進行環境風險評估之理念，本研究針對待克利進行土壤中農藥殘留之檢測，篩選可降解待克利之本土微生物菌種，並探討生物復育法之可行性。首先進行待克利之田間用藥調查，並採集南投縣國姓鄉福龜地區(代號為FG) 與長流地區(代號為LF) 共 11 處多次施用待克利之草莓園農田土壤，進行土壤中殘留待克利之萃取，以電子捕獲式之氣相層析儀測定土壤中之農藥殘留量，利用待克利做為細菌生長之唯一碳源篩選可降解待克利之微生物，並測定本土分離菌株對待克利之降解效果。研究結果顯示 11 處污染土壤中待克利殘留濃度介於 0. 03 ～ 1. 21 mg kg- 1 ，本研究選擇殘留量較高之 7 個土壤樣品進行自然衰減試驗，經 106 天之孵育後待克利殘留率為 38 ～ 63 %，此外接種未經分離之土壤溶液混合菌群(consortium) FG 6 與FG 7 樣品孵育 14 天後待克利殘留率為 17 ～ 22 %。分別接種 5 株單一菌株至含待克利之BH培養基，孵育 17 日後待克利殘留率為 65 ～ 83 %，顯示未經分離之混合菌種降解待克利之效果較單一菌種為佳。Sinorhizobium morelense CC-FG 7 - 2 菌株降解待克利之能力優於其它菌株，其他本土待克利降解菌包括Paenibacillus glycanilyticus CC-LF 3 - 2 、Arthrobacter polychromogenes CC-LF 3 - 3 、Rhodococcus qingshengii CC-LF 4 - 1 與Rhodococcus erythropolis CC-LF 4 - 4 ，均為第一次證明為待克利降解菌，未來期望將究篩選之待克利降解菌應用於污染土壤之生物復育，縮短待克利於土壤中殘留之時間並減少此類農藥對環境造成之衝擊。目 次 摘要 [...] i Abstract [...] . ii 目次 [...] iv 表目次 [...] vi 圖目次 [...] . vii 第一章	緒論 [...] . 1 一、	前言 [...] 1 二、	研究目的 [...] 3 第二章	前人研究 [...] . 4 一、	農藥在環境中之宿命 (fate) [...] 4 (一) 	農藥在環境中之動態 [...] . 4 (二) 	農藥與土壤微生物之相互作用 [...] 7 (三) 	微生物之生物降解反應 [...] . 9 二、	待克利之特性及環境宿命 [...] . 12 (一) 	待克利作用機制 [...] . 12 (二) 	待克利之國內環境安全評估資料 [...] . 17 1. 	待克利農藥之特性 [...] . 17 2. 	待克利農藥之生物毒性 [...] 18 第三章	材料與方法 [...] 22 論文研究流程圖 [...] 23 一、	待克利檢測方法之建立 [...] 24 (一) 	農藥殘留分析方法之建立 [...] 24 (二) 	土壤採集及土壤中待克利殘留測定 [...] . 25 (三) 	水溶液中待克利農藥測定 [...] 28 二、	土壤中待克利之自然衰減及降解特性之研究 [...] . 30 (一) 	土壤特性分析 [...] . 30 (二) 	土壤孵育試驗及待克利殘留量分析-自然衰減分析 [...] 31 (三) 	土壤溶液之混合菌群降解性之測試 [...] . 31 三、	待克利降解菌之分離及生長特性 [...] . 33 (一) 	待克利降解菌之分離與純化 [...] 33 (二) 	待克利分解菌降解能力之測定 [...] . 35 第四章	結果與討論 [...] 36 一、	待克利檢測方法建立 [...] 36 (一) 	土壤中待克利農藥殘留分析之檢量線及相關係數 [...] . 39 (二) 	土壤中待克利殘留量檢測之回收率 [...] . 38 (三) 	水中待克利農藥殘留分析之回收率 [...] . 39 (四) 	供試土壤農藥殘留分析 [...] . 39 二、	土壤中待克利之自然衰試驗 [...] 41 三、	土壤溶液之混合菌群(consortium) 降解性之研究 [...] 44 四、	純菌降解菌特性分析 [...] 47 (一) 	待克利降解菌之分離與純化 [...] 47 (二) 	分離菌株降解待克利之能力 [...] 55 (三) 	以 16 S rDNA鑑別菌種之分析 [...] . 57 第五章	結論 [...] 59 第六章	參考文獻 [...] . 60 表目次 表 1 、	待克利之防治對象及推薦使用量 [...] 16 表 2 、	有機化合物之吸附係數及移動性等級 [...] . 18 表 3 、	待克利農藥之環境安全資料 [...] 19 表 4 、	農藥劑量對試驗動物(鼠) 之毒性分類 [...] 19 表 5 、	國際間對藥物致癌性之分類 [...] 20 表 6 、	美國環保署對癌物之分類 [...] . 21 表 7 、	試驗用土壤之物理化學性質 [...] 25 表 8 、	配製 BH液態無機鹽培養基 [...] . 28 表 9 、	氣相層析儀附電子捕獲式檢測器儀器條件 [...] 29 表 10 、	土壤中待克利農藥分析回收率 [...] . 38 表 11 、	待克利分解菌於Tryptic soy broth(agar) 之菌落型態及適合生長之溫度 [...] 48 表 12 、	 17 株分離菌株於 3 mg L- 1 待克利唯一碳源平板培養基中之生長觀察 [...] 51 表 13 、	 10 株分離菌株於液態待克利培養基中之生長觀察 [...] . 52 表 14 、	 24 株Gordonia菌株於 3 mg L- 1 待克利固體平板培養基中之生長觀察 [...] 53 表 15 、	 5 株Gordonia菌株於液體待克利平板培養基中之生長觀察 [...] . 54 表 16 、	分離株之鑑定結果 [...] . 5...|$|E

40|$|The {{isolation}} {{frequency of}} Microsphaeropsis sp. in spring {{in association with}} necrotic lesions on leaves in Tasmanian pyrethrum (Tanacetum cinerariifolium) fields has increased substantially since first identification in 2001. Examination of morphological features and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) resulted {{in the identification of}} a new species, herein described as Microsphaeropsis tanaceti sp. nov. The pathogenicity of three M. tanaceti isolates to two pyrethrum cultivars was confirmed by inoculating glasshouse-grown plants in three experiments. No significant differences in the susceptibility of the two cultivars to infection by M. tanaceti were found. Symptoms were tan-coloured spots which coalesced around the margins of the leaves. Therefore, the name 'tan spot' is proposed for this new disease of pyrethrum. The sensitivity of seven M. tanaceti isolates to <b>difenoconazole</b> and azoxystrobin, commonly used fungicides for the management of foliar diseases in spring, was assessed under in vitro conditions. Sensitivity testing for <b>difenoconazole</b> was conducted using a mycelial growth assay on potato dextrose agar, whilst testing for sensitivity to azoxystrobin used a conidial germination assay on water agar. Microsphaeropsis tanaceti was found to be more sensitive to azoxystrobin than <b>difenoconazole,</b> with complete inhibition of conidial germination at concentrations above 0. 625 µg a. i. mL- 1.

The effectiveness of the fungicides azoxystrobin + <b>difenoconazole,</b> cyproconazole, pyraclostrobin, tebuconazole and tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin in controlling disease incidence and severity of anthracnose, through applications in the field, was measured in fruits collected at three stages of maturation, according to the skin color (dark green, light green and yellowish green). In postharvest dipping of fruits, the products evaluated were citric acid, peracetic acid, salicylic acid, sodium bicarbonate, chlorine dioxide, Ecolife (R) and chitosan. The fungicides azoxystrobin + <b>difenoconazole,</b> pyraclostrobin, tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin + tebuconazole were highly effective in inhibiting the in vitro mycelial growth of G. psidii and moderately to highly effective in inhibiting C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides.

Conventional {{agricultural practices}} use pesticides to control diseases that attack the crop, and in onion- production in this area fungicides are most commonly used due to the Paramo weather conditions and its location, 3015 meters above sea level (masl). These factors are conducive to the proliferation of fungi in the soil and in crops. In order to evaluate the movement of pesticides to Lake Tota, water samples and suspended sediments were taken for seven months in several channels that traverse the area and flow into the lake. In surface waters, malathion, tebuconazole, <b>difenoconazole</b> and chlorothalonil were detected and even quantified in some samples. In suspended sediments, malathion was detected at concentrations between 1. 90 mg/kg and 4. 38 mg/kg, and chlorothalonil ranged from 0. 27 mg/kg to 1. 29 mg/kg. To determine concentrations of fungicides in surface water closer to the source water samples from a runoff plot located {{in the study area}} were monitored for tebuconazole and <b>difenoconazole.</b> In dissolved form, tebuconazole was found at a concentration of 4800 ng/L and <b>difenoconazole</b> at a concentration of 330 ng/L.

The experimental design was randomized blocks, with 8 treatments in 4 replications. The simple hybrid Avant of precocious cycle was used. The fungicides were sprayed manually (CO 2) at 40 pounds of pressure using 4 pulverizing spouts. The applied volume of fungicide in each plot was of 1. 4 liters. The following fungicides (g a. i. ha- 1) were used: propiconazole (100. 0), propiconazole (125. 0), <b>difenoconazole</b> (50. 0), <b>difenoconazole</b> (75. 0), azoxystrobin (50. 0), azoxystrobin (75. 0) e tebuconazole (200. 0). Plot without fungicide constituted the check. The first spray was accomplished in the V 8 stage (43 days after sowing - DAS) and the second spray in the pretasseling stage (58 DAS). At 85 DAS, plants with ears in the pasty grain stage, the evaluation of the foliar symptoms of gray leaf spot was proceeded, being graded 0 = symptomless; 1 = little lesions below the ear, any lesion above; 2 = much lesions below the ear, little lesions above; 3 = severe development of lesions below the ear, all the leaves above the ear with lesions; 4 = all the leaves with severe development of lesions, but green area still visible; 5 = all the leaves dry and dead.
