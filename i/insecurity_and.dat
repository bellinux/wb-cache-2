5|$|The {{subject of}} the {{emergence}} of castles is a complex matter which has led to considerable debate. Discussions have typically attributed the rise of the castle to a reaction to attacks by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings and a need for private defence. The breakdown of the Carolingian Empire led to the privatisation of government, and local lords assumed responsibility for the economy and justice. However, while castles proliferated in the 9th and 10th centuries the link between periods of <b>insecurity</b> <b>and</b> building fortifications is not always straightforward. Some high concentrations of castles occur in secure places, while some border regions had relatively few castles.|$|E
40|$|Workfare is {{the wrong}} policy {{response}} to the <b>insecurities</b> <b>and</b> inequalities inherent in a flexible market economy. It does nothing to counter these <b>insecurities</b> <b>and</b> inequalities and represents an abandonment of universalistic and solidaristic principles. Instead, it subjects a growing minority to coercive measures and immiseration, while allowing them to be demonized and blamed for being victims of a situation not of their making. Labour should move away from its espousal of workfare {{and come up with}} egalitarian and emancipatory alternatives, such as basic income, that respond to labour market realities...|$|R

25|$|The events {{begin the}} same way as the security-based strategy.
