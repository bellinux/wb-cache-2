500|$|Rationing was {{introduced}} in 1940 {{to cope with the}} shortages caused by the wartime blockade. Foods such as bananas, onions and chocolate became hard to find, while unfamiliar items such as <b>dried</b> <b>egg,</b> dried potato, whale meat, the tinned pork product spam, and the [...] "disgusting" [...] imported fish called snoek appeared in the national diet. Since butter, sugar, eggs and flour were all rationed, English dishes such as pies and cakes became hard to make from traditional recipes. Instead, foods such as carrots were used in many different dishes, their natural sugars providing sweetness in novel dishes like carrot fudge. The diet was less than enjoyable, but paradoxically, rationing meant that the population was healthier than ever before, and perhaps ever since. The Ministry of Food employed home economists such as Marguerite Patten to demonstrate how to cook economically. After the war, Patten {{became one of the first}} television cooks, and sold 17 million copies of her 170 books.|$|E

500|$|Researchers at the University of Maine have {{actively}} {{been developing}} value-added green crab products, {{with the goals}} of driving business interest, stimulating a commercial green crab fishery, and alleviating predation effects. Specifically, one study evaluated the consumer acceptability of empanadas (fried, stuffed pastries) which contained varying amounts of green crab mince meat. It was reported that the empanadas were rated between [...] "like slightly" [...] and [...] "like moderately" [...] for overall acceptability by a consumer panel (n=87). Furthermore, about two-thirds of the panelists would [...] "probably" [...] or [...] "definitely" [...] buy the empanadas if available locally. [...] Additionally, the same researchers developed a patty product made from green crab mince meat using restructuring additives (transglutaminase, <b>dried</b> <b>egg</b> white, isolated soy protein). It was reported that although a successful green crab patty was developed, the restructuring additives may have had greater functionality in a raw crab meat system, as opposed to the fully cooked mince that was utilized in the present study. The results from both studies are considered promising, especially considering that these were initial rounds of green crab product development.|$|E

50|$|The adult beetles are 3.5 - 7.0 mm long, convex, {{straight}} sided, and {{the surface}} has indentations called punctures. They are shiny metallic green or greenish blue in colour. The legs and antennae are red (dark clubs). They feed on the meat-infesting larvae of Calliphora or blow flies, Dermestidae and Piophilidae. The adults are surface feeders; the larvae bore into dry or smoked meats and do most damage. The red-legged ham beetle also attacks bones, hides, copra, <b>dried</b> <b>egg,</b> cheese, guano, bone meal, dried figs, and palm nut kernels.
