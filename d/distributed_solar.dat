25|$|New Jersey {{leads the}} nation with the least {{restrictive}} net metering law, while California leads in total number of homes which have solar panels installed. Many were installed because of the million solar roof initiative. California decided {{that it is not}} moving forward fast enough on photovoltaic generation and in 2008 enacted a feed-in tariff. Washington state has a feed-in tariff of 15 ¢/kWh which increases to 54 ¢/kWh if components are manufactured in the state. By 2015, California, Hawaii, Arizona and some other states were lowering payments to <b>distributed</b> <b>solar</b> owners and instituting new fees for grid usage.

25|$|Solar {{power in}} the United States {{includes}} utility-scale solar power plants {{as well as local}} distributed generation, mostly from rooftop photovoltaics. As of the end of 2016, the U.S. had 40 gigawatts (GW) of installed photovoltaic capacity, having almost doubled in capacity from the previous year. In the twelve months through August 2017, utility scale solar power generated 49.0 terawatt-hours (TWh), 1.22% of total U.S. electricity. During the same time period total solar generation, including estimated <b>distributed</b> <b>solar</b> photovoltaic generation, was 72.1 TWh, 1.80% of total U.S. electricity. In terms of total installed capacity, by year end 2015 the U.S. ranked 4th in the world behind China, Germany, and Japan. In 2016, 39% of all new electricity generation capacity in the country came from solar, more than any other source and ahead of natural gas (29%). By 2015, solar employment had overtaken oil and gas as well as coal employment in the U.S. In 2016, more than 260,000 Americans were employed in the solar industry.|$|E
