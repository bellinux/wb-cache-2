[...] Another advantage is that the components need not be close to ideal. [...] Every LC resonator is directly working into a resistor which lowers the Q anyway so any losses in the L and C components can be absorbed into this resistor in the design. [...] Aggregated designs usually require high Q resonators. [...] Also, stagger-tuned circuits have resonator components with values that are quite close to each other and in synchronously tuned circuits they can be identical. [...] The spread of component values is thus less in stagger-tuned circuits than in aggregated circuits.|$|E

50|$|Staggered tuning is a {{technique}} used {{in the design of}} multi-stage tuned amplifiers whereby each stage is <b>tuned</b> <b>to</b> a slightly different frequency.

5000|$|To {{analyze the}} error convergence, an {{invariant}} state error [...] is defined, which {{is different from}} the standard output error , since the standard output error usually does not preserve the symmetries of the system.

50|$|The engine proved {{flexible}} and very <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tune.</b> The overhead camshaft design {{meant that the}} head could be flowed and ported to allow the engine to run at high speeds. Useful improvements in power could be gained by replacing the standard silencer with one that impeded the exhaust gas flow less and with better carburettors. However, in adapting the design to suit modern mass-production methods, Rootes had left the engine somewhat more fragile than the Coventry Climax model from which it had been derived.|$|E

50|$|Another {{school of}} thought is that PSO should be {{simplified}} {{as much as possible}} without impairing its performance; a general concept often referred to as Occam's razor.

50|$|A {{constriction}} {{in the end}} of {{the barrel}} known as the choke is used to tailor the pattern for different purposes. Chokes may either be formed as part of the barrel at the time of manufacture, by squeezing the end of the bore down over a mandrel, or by threading the barrel and screwing in an interchangeable choke tube. The choke typically consists of a conical section that smoothly tapers from the bore diameter down to the choke diameter, followed by a cylindrical section of the choke diameter. Briley Manufacturing, a maker of interchangeable shotgun chokes, uses a conical portion about 3 times the bore diameter in length, so the shot is gradually squeezed down with minimal deformation. The cylindrical section is shorter, usually 0.6 to 0.75 in. The use of interchangeable chokes has made it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> the performance of a given combination of shotgun and shotshell to achieve the desired performance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rear wheel}} drive configuration, {{combined}} with the AE86's light weight (approximately 2300 lb (950-970 kg) curb weight), balance and relatively powerful (and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tune)</b> 4A-GEU engine made it popular among the Japanese hashiriya (street racers in Japanese), many of whom raced in touge (mountain passes in Japanese) where the corners suited the AE86 best, especially on the downhill. Among those who utilized this car was Japanese racing legend Keiichi Tsuchiya {{also known as the}} Drift King ("Dori-Kin" [...] in Japanese). Keiichi Tsuchiya helped popularize the sport of drifting, which involves taking a car on a set of controlled slides through corners. The AE86's FR configuration made it well suited to this kind of cornering, and currently the car is a mainstay of drift shows and competitions. Japanese drifters like Katsuhiro Ueo, Toshiki Yoshioka, Yoichi Imamura, Koichi Yamashita, Hiroshi Takahashi, Tetsuya Hibino, and Wataru Hayashi were also involved in making the AE86 famous in the drift scene.|$|E

50|$|Single-headed tom-toms (also {{known as}} concert toms) {{have also been}} used in drumkits, though their use has fallen off in {{popularity}} since the 1970s. Concert toms have a single head and a shell slightly shallower than the corresponding double-headed tom. Phil Collins still uses four single-headed rack-mount toms and two floor toms (Gretsch) in his setup. They are generally <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> as they have no bottom head to adjust.|$|R
5000|$|Piano tuning {{became a}} {{profession}} around {{the beginning of}} the 1800s, as the [...] "pianoforte" [...] became mainstream. Previously musicians owned harpsichords, which were much <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>tune,</b> and which the musicians generally tuned themselves. Early piano tuners were trained and employed in piano factories, and often underwent an apprenticeship of about 5-7 years. Early tuners faced challenges related to a large variety of new and changing pianos and non-standardized pitches.|$|R
50|$|Between {{the enharmonic}} notes {{at both ends}} of this sequence, is a {{difference}} in pitch of nearly 24 cents, known as the Pythagorean comma. To produce a twelve tone scale, one of them is arbitrarily discarded. The twelve remaining notes are repeated by increasing or decreasing their frequencies by a power of 2 (the size of one or more octaves) to build scales with multiple octaves (such as the keyboard of a piano). A drawback of Pythagorean tuning {{is that one of the}} twelve fifths in this scale is badly tuned and hence unusable (the wolf fifth, either F-D if G is discarded, or B-G if F is discarded). This twelve tone scale is fairly close to equal temperament, but it does not offer much advantage for tonal harmony because only the perfect intervals (fourth, fifth, and octave) are simple enough to sound pure. Major thirds, for instance, receive the rather unstable interval of 81:64, sharp of the preferred 5:4 by an 81:80 ratio. The primary reason for its use is that it is extremely <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tune,</b> as its building block, the perfect fifth, is the simplest and consequently the most consonant interval after the octave and unison.|$|E
50|$|Jal-tarang {{finds its}} first mention in Sangeet Parijaat. This medieval musical {{treatise}} categorizes this instrument under Ghan-Vadya (Idiophonic instruments in which sound {{is produced by}} striking a surface, also called concussion idiophones.) SangeetSaar considered one with 22 cups to be complete jal tarang and one with 15 cups to be of mediocre status. Cups, of varying sizes were made of either bronze or porcelain. Today only china bowls are preferred by artistes, numbering around sixteen in normal use. Cups for Mandra Swar (notes of lower octave)are large while those for Taar Swar (notes of higher octaves) are smaller in size. Water is poured into the cups and the pitch is changed by adjusting the volume {{of water in the}} cup. The number of cups depends on the melody being played. The bowls mostly are arranged in a half-circle in front of the player who can reach them all easily. The player softly hits the cups with a wooden stick on the border to get the sound. It's not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> the instrument and needs some skill. During playing fine nuances can be reached if the performer is accomplished. SangeetSaar mentions that if the player can rotate the water through a quick little touch of the stick, nuances and finer variations of the note can be achieved.|$|E
5000|$|What made most {{models of}} the 'Pianette' so {{innovative}} was the positioning of the tuning pins. On {{any other type of}} piano, tuning pins are pounded into holes which are sufficiently, deliberately and exactly smaller than the pins so that a long-lasting tightness will keep them from sliding, no matter what force is put upon them while stretching the wires into tune. These holes are positioned beneath a metal soundboard and have a specified depth. On many {{models of the}} 'Pianette' minipiano, however, these tuning pins have to be longer so that they can emerge {{at the front of the}} instrument just below the keyboard. By allowing a wooden flap to fall positioned neatly beneath the keyboard, tuning pins are revealed at the front. These pins can be adjusted with a standard star-shaped piano wrench. The monochords used on the lowest 31 strings are relatively <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>tune.</b> The bichords are somewhat more difficult but if the pins are still tight enough, they can be adjusted with slight movements of the wrench until the desired tone is reached. Unfortunately, however, this system which involved the use of specially made tuning pins specific to the minipiano, has proven to be its greatest problem to people attempting to salvage the instruments today. Although all pianos suffer to some degree from a natural loosening of these pins over time the minipiano is most highly criticized for the tendency of all the pins, especially those belonging to bichords, to loosen and slide much more quickly especially if they are not kept in a warm stable environment. [...] Although it is possible to access the tuning pins from the back as well, it is infinitely prefereable to be able to tune the minipiano from the front because in order to open the back one has to entirely detach the wooden lid, remove a whole set of metal rods, some screws above and across the wooden contraption holding the striking pad mechanism as well as two wooden rods attached to the pedals controlled by the player's feet. This is done to allow the central striking mechanism to pivot outwards on an axis pivoting on two large screws at the bottom of the wooden contraption. But before the wooden structure can pivot on the screws attaching it firmly to the instrument, two curved metallic 'handles' that connect two wooden bars passing horizontally just behind the row of metal rods have to be detached as well by the removing the screws holding them to the higher of the two bars. After this, the whole structure should gracefully pivot outwards, allowing access to both the piano wires and the tuning pins.|$|E

While higher concentrations can result in better engine performance, use of highly concentrated nitromethane is rare because of its cost. Although a given amount of nitromethane contains less energy than the same amount of methanol, it increases the amount of available oxygen in the combustion chamber, which allows the engine to draw in less air and more fuel. The increased amount of fuel increases power output and also helps cool the engine. For racing use, the nitromethane content can be increased to the range of 30%-65%.|$|R
