50|$|For years, Killaloe {{was known}} across Canada for its radio and weather station, which {{operated}} here from 1938 to 1972 {{as part of}} a country-wide chain of sites designed for aircraft communication. The site was a <b>frost</b> <b>pocket</b> with nightly minimum temperatures among the coldest in eastern Canada. A small airstrip operated at the weather station until 1953 before services were moved to neighbouring Bonnechere.|$|R
50|$|Hoar frost (also hoarfrost, {{radiation}} frost, or pruina) {{refers to}} white ice crystals, deposited {{on the ground}} or loosely attached to exposed objects such as wires or leaves. They form on cold, clear nights when conditions are such that heat radiates out to the open sky faster than it can be replaced from nearby sources such as wind or warm objects. Under suitable circumstances, objects cool to below the frost point of the surrounding air, well below the freezing point of water. Such freezing may be promoted by effects such as flood <b>frost</b> or <b>frost</b> <b>pocket.</b> These occur when ground-level radiation losses cool air until it flows downhill and accumulates in pockets of very cold air in valleys and hollows. Hoar frost may freeze in such low-lying cold air even when the air temperature a few feet above ground is well above freezing.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{publication}} of Geiger's (1927) pioneer systematic treatment of micro-climates, there have been important advances in this phase of climatology. Many of these studies are of more than passing significance to plant ecology, as a perusal of Geiger's (1950) second revision of his earlier work will reveal. Research during the past quarter-century has resulted, among other things, in giving dimensions to microclimates and microclimatic situations. It has changed the word microclimate from a philosophical term to one that refers to real, and {{to a greater extent}} than ever before, measureable conditions. The old term, by implication at least, was used to answer all questions, some of them unanswerable; the new concept raises more questions and answers fewer, but gives promise of more fruitful results in ecological investigations. Over almost all landscapes, just above the substrate, there is a mosaic of varying weather regimes. The pattern may be simple, as over a level plain, or it may be exceedingly complex, as in mountainous country. A dozen strikingly dissimilar weather regimes have been described within a single small valley in the dissected TABLE 1.

50|$|The Ohio River {{creates a}} {{microclimate}} in its valley where temperatures {{tend to be}} moderated by the river, hence resulting in longer growing seasons compared {{to the rest of}} the county. Other microclimates, known as frost hollows or <b>frost</b> <b>pockets,</b> exist throughout the county in small isolated valleys. Nocturnal temperatures are often several degrees colder than the surrounding terrain.|$|E
50|$|Frost or cold damage can {{be avoided}} by {{ensuring}} that tender plants are properly hardened before planting, {{and that they are}} not planted too early in the season, before the risk of frost has passed. Avoid planting susceptible plants in <b>frost</b> <b>pockets,</b> or where they will receive early morning sun. Protect young buds and bloom with horticultural fleece if frost is forecast.Cold, drying easterly winds can also severely inhibit spring growth even without an actual frost, thus adequate shelter or the use of windbreaks is important.|$|E
5000|$|Pumice moonwort, as {{the common}} name suggests, live in dry, fine to course pumice gravel and scree without any {{admixture}} of humus, {{in places that}} retain moisture into late spring. Its native landscape is open, fully exposed, sparsely vegetated pumice fields and gently rolling slopes, from subalpine lodgepole pine forest to above timberline. It may also occur in Pinus contorta−Purshia tridentata basins with open <b>frost</b> <b>pockets.</b> During the winter, it is usually covered by several feet of snow. [...] Botrychium pumicola has been found growing with B. lanceolatum and B. simplex. Elevation of occurrence is from 5,900 to 8,850 feet above sea level.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{hypothesis}} is explored that lodgepole pine at the seedling emergence period is {{more resistant to}} low temperatures than ponderosa pine. Differential tolerance between species to low temperatures is then related to the prevalence of lodgepole pine in <b>frost</b> <b>pocket</b> areas in central Oregon {{to the exclusion of}} ponderosa pine. Tolerance thresholds to low temperatures for both species were determined in a controlled environment chamber. The chamber, designed specifically for this study, had separate controls for air and soil temperatures. With soil heated to 32 °F, air temperature could be lowered, with lights out, to a minimum of about 13 °F. Controlled environment chamber treatments consisted of exposing groups of uniformly reared seedlings of each species to nighttime low temperatures of 13 °F to 30 °F. Seedling groups varied in age by two-week intervals for comparisons of differences between seedling development stages. These experiments showed that differential tolerance to low temperatures occurred at 15 °F to 18 °F. About twice as many ponderosa seedlings were killed as lodge pole, with ponderosa mortality occasionally approaching 100 percent. At warmer temperatures up to 23 °F ponderosa mortality continued to be substantially greater than that of lodgepole, but number of seedling deaths was low. Treatments above 23 °F caused little or no injury to either species. During emergence youngest seedlings of each species survived low temperatures better than older seedlings. Fall treatment of seedlings reared in outside planting beds ai 1 ed to show any signs of injury from 15 °F treatments. These results strengthen the theory that the period of species differential tolerance to low temperatures for first year seedlings occurs during the emergence period in the spring. The study of the occurrence of low temperatures in the field was made along a transect starting in a lodgepole pine timbered flat and continuing through a lodgepole-ponderosa transition zone up to a ponderosa timbered slope. On a few occasions during the seedling emergence period, night minimums near the surface were as low as 15 °F to 18 °F at the lodgepole flat compared to 20 °F to 22 °F at the ponderosa timbered slope 80 feet above. This spread of five or more degrees was of the same magnitude as the laboratory determined spread of first injury to ponderosa pine to almost total kill. The controlled environment experiments demonstrated differential tolerance between species, and that laboratory-determined lethal temperatures approximated those recorded in field "frost pocket". Although only a small segment of the natural environment complex could be studied, the evidence strongly supports the original hypothesis that lodgepole pine during the seedling emergence period is more resistant to low temperatures than ponderosa pine, thus, explaining in part the "frost pocket" distribution pattern of lodgepole pine in central Oregon...|$|R

50|$|At Thorpe Green, a green, {{road and}} line of houses beneath Virginia Water station, the river forms the {{southern}} border of Thorpe and the northern border of Lyne. During its passage, the northern bank of the River Bourne receives more sun than the south. This affects the microclimate as there are seasonal <b>frost</b> <b>pockets</b> and areas of high humidity which impacts on the vegetation. The Bourne passes wholesale into Chertsey and adjoins Chertsey Meads before entering St George's College (formerly Woburn Park) close to the Thames in Addlestone. Here, now slow-flowing, as a small river it joins with another River Bourne, the River Bourne (Addlestone branch). Combined these briefly create a back-gardens feature with a deep, vertical metal-lined character. This joins the River Thames within 200 metres below its southernmost weir, {{in one of its}} channels bypassing Shepperton Lock beside Hamm Court, Addlestone close to the border with Weybridge which is marked by the River Wey that joins a further 300 m downstream of this.|$|E
40|$|In {{sugarcane}} producing {{regions of}} the Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa, frost occurs frequently during winter in low-lying areas (<b>frost</b> <b>pockets).</b> Frosted sugarcane often has to be harvested when the stalks are immature and sucrose content and cane yield are low. Early harvesting is common practice in the Midlands to avoid the detrimental aftereffects of frost damage, which include quality deterioration. Where <b>frost</b> <b>pockets</b> occur, there is great demand for frost tolerant sugarcane varieties to improve profitability. In Louisiana, USA, sugarcane is harvested young due to cold winter conditions. Two fast-maturing Louisiana varieties (LCP 85 - 384 and HOCP 96 - 540) and two South African Midlands varieties (N 21 and N 36) were evaluated for frost tolerance. All varieties were bulked-up using the NovaCane ® tissue culture protocol. A field trial was established during October 2007 in a typical valley-bottom frost pocket at New Hanover in the Midlands North area. The Performance Index (PIABS), a sensitive indicator of photosynthetic electron transport efficiency, was derived from chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements performed on leaves of the varieties before and after frost events.

30|$|Climatic {{data are}} {{normally}} available at a spatial scale of 1, 000 to 10, 000 km 2, while plant growth is normally measured {{at a much}} smaller scale of 100 m 2 to 10 km 2. Thus, a plant may actually 'experience' a local climate that {{is quite different from}} the larger scale climatic data used to quantify climate-growth relationships (Peterson et al. 1998). The scale of topoclimates (0.5 km to 10 m) is the spatial scale at which topography can be used to describe the climate near the ground (Geiger et al. 2003), thus more closely approximating the experience of the organism. The discrete influence of complex environments on habitats and species incorporates topographic shading that influences solar radiation and evapotranspiration, <b>frost</b> <b>pockets</b> or cold-air pooling, and differences in soils, all of which can be described on the basis of topoclimates.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 56 - 65) In {{the fall}} of 1964 a survey was initiated in the Cold Canyon drainage basin of the Santa Monica Mountains, Los Angeles County, California, to observe temperature variations in protected valleys. The area is located approximately 3 to 4 miles from the Pacific Ocean, in a region genera 11 y thought of as possessing a mild climate. After preliminary work showed lowest minimum temperatures in valley bottoms, five shelters with recording thermometers were located at various exposures within the area. Previous studies have related <b>frost</b> <b>pockets</b> primarily to the drainage of cold air down hillsides. This factor is felt to be of less significance then strong outgoing radiation, inversion strength, {{and the absence of}} wind. Variations of minimum and maximum temperatures, daily range, and inversion strength are analyzed for the five locations. Results show that frosts occur frequently in and around two valleys but are almost entirely absent at a nearby slope and mountain peak. maximum temperatures are fairly uniform except at the mountain site. Following from this, daily ranges are abnormally high in the valleys and subdued at elevated exposures. Minimum temperature inversions between valleys and hills are correlated with clear and cloudy weather. The strongest inversions occur during clear, calm, and dry conditions...|$|E
40|$|Time domain {{reflectometry}} (TDR) {{was used}} during summer 1997 {{to determine whether}} vegetation patterns follow predicted soil moisture gradients in the Pocono till barrens, a rare species-rich assemblage of pine barrens in northeastern Pennsylvania that occurs disproportionately on deposits of Illinoisan glacial till. The results provide insights into {{the relative importance of}} disturbance and abiotic factors in determining vegetation patterns and dynamics and have implications for barrens protection and management. Soils of barrens and adjacent forests did not differ in water content over all depths and drought conditions, and in the upper 15 cm of soil barrens on bedrock had slightly higher water contents than barrens on Illinoisan till. It can be inferred from these results, contrary to prevailing views, that xeric soil conditions do not maintain the barrens/forest distinction on the southern Pocono Plateau. Vegetation-driven processes that encourage wildfire and restrict nitrogen availability may instead be responsible for barrens maintenance. Relatively mesic conditions could explain the rapid succession of Pocono barrens into woodlands that has occurred since fire suppression [...] particularly in areas over bedrock. Furthermore, soils of distinct barrens types that were thought previously to follow moisture gradients did not differ in water content, although the abundance and diversity of wetland indicator plant species does vary between barrens types. <b>Frost</b> <b>pockets</b> may favor the persistence of heathlands in topographic depressions, with rhodora barrens, which support a greater abundance and diversity of wetland indicator species, occurring in areas subject to periodic flooding not apparent during summer 1997. Mesic soils and the historical importance of wildfire in the Pocono till barrens make prescribed burning a particularly appropriate management strategy for biodiversity conservation...|$|E
