40|$|The {{management}} of natural forests in Brazil {{is concentrated in}} {{the states of the}} Legal Amazon with almost all legal timber extraction occurring on private land. While the government has historically promoted the development of forest plantations through economic incentives, state involvement with natural forests has focused on regulation. Over 1 Â million kmÂ² in the Legal Amazon have been identified as suitable for the production of forest goods and services and other resource-based activities (Veríssimo et al., 2000, p. 6). Only recently, however, has the state taken action to harness the potential this vast public resource holds for promoting sustainable development. In March 2006, the Public Forest Management Law was passed by the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. A key feature of this law is a framework for creating <b>forest</b> <b>concessions</b> on public lands. With the goal of establishing up to 13 Â million ha of <b>forest</b> <b>concessions</b> {{by the end of the}} decade, such an initiative for the development of the forest sector is unprecedented in Brazilian history, marking the state's recognition of the Amazon's vocation as one of forest-based development. A static computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is developed to evaluate the short-run socio-economic and environmental implications of implementing <b>forest</b> <b>concessions</b> in the Brazilian Amazon. Results indicate that household income and private consumption increase with the implementation of <b>forest</b> <b>concessions.</b> With the expansion of natural forest management in the north, forest plantations contract significantly in all regions and to a lesser degree, natural forest management in the north east and center west. As forest plantations demand less agricultural land for production, the price of agricultural land decreases and the excess supply is taken up by the agricultural sector which pays less for the land and consequently produces more of a less expensive product. The implementation of <b>forest</b> <b>concessions</b> results in a 3. 8 % increase in legal deforestation with the largest increase in the north, followed by the north east and center west. <b>Forest</b> <b>concessions</b> <b>Forest</b> industry Deforestation Brazil Computable general equilibrium model CGE Public forests...|$|R

50|$|Philippe Lebon was a French civil {{engineer}} {{working in the}} public engineering corps who became interested while at university in distillation as an industrial process for the manufacturing of materials such as tar and oil. He graduated from the engineering school in 1789, and was assigned to Angoulême. There, he investigated distillation, and became aware that the gas produced in the distillation of wood and coal could be useful for lighting, heating, and as an energy source in engines. He took out a patent for distillation processes in 1794, and continued his research, eventually designing a distillation oven known as the thermolamp. He applied for and received a patent for this invention in 1799, with an addition in 1801. He launched a marketing campaign in Paris in 1801 by printing a pamphlet and renting a house where he put on public demonstrations with his apparatus. His goal was to raise sufficient funds from investors to launch a company, but he failed to attract this sort of interest, either from the French state or from private sources. He was forced to abandon the project {{and return to the}} {{civil engineer}}ing corps. Although he was given a <b>forest</b> <b>concession</b> by the French government to experiment with the manufacture of tar from wood for naval use, he never succeed with the thermolamp, and died in uncertain circumstances in 1805.|$|E

40|$|The Brazilian {{government}} is now planning to implement natural <b>forest</b> <b>concessions</b> for timber extraction. In {{addition to the}} legal requirements imposed on the management of concessions (minimum reserves, maximum extraction rates, etc.), the value of concessions is closely linked with uncertainties in estimates {{of the volume of}} commercial logs within the concession area and on future timber prices. This paper proposes a method to appraise the value of <b>forest</b> <b>concessions</b> based on the real option theory (ROT). By combining the hypothesis of uncertainty in the volume of logs in a concession, logs prices modeled as a mean-reverting stochastic process, and applying inter-temporal maximization of profits, the method provides a more realistic estimate of the market value of concessions than does Net Present Value (NPV), which does not take these uncertainties into account. Comparison between estimates using NPV and ROT shows that the latter are systematically higher. For the base case, the concession value using ROT is 153 % higher. Since <b>forest</b> <b>concessions</b> are public resources, differences of that magnitude cannot be neglected. The paper also proposes methods to estimate the probability distribution of logging volumes in concession areas along with future prices. The volume distribution is specified in a spatial model as a function of geographic characteristics of the area as well of the neighboring areas...|$|R

A modal diameter distribution can be the mark of a demographic imbalance or it can be the consequence of a particular growth pattern. By comparing the observed diameter distribution with the one that follows from a reference growth model under the hypothesis of demographic balance, we diagnosed demographic balance. In a <b>forest</b> <b>concession</b> in Gabon before logging, an unbalanced diameter distribution was found for Aucoumea klaineana, a long-lived pioneer species and also a valuable commercial species. The Aucoumea klaineana population consisted of old trees without meaningful recruitment, thus indicating an ageing, declining population.
