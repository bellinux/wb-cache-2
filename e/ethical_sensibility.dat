The trouble started when a shuttlecraft was attacked, causing several casualties. The Doctor was faced with making a choice between two critically injured patients - Ensign Jetal and Ensign Kim - with an equal chance of survival, but a limited amount of time in which the Doctor could act, meaning that he had to choose to save only one, which was Ensign Harry Kim; Jetal died on the operating table. As time passed, the Doctor was overpowered by guilt, believing that his friendship with Harry somehow influenced his choice. The Doctor fears that he might have, however inadvertently, let Ensign Jetal die so that his friend could live. These events induced a conflict between those parts of his program that compelled him to act impartially, and those that comprised his <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility.</b>|$|E
5000|$|With the {{positive}} and negative feedback received from the viewers and consumers of the campaign the Dove Company did not just want to “talk” to media about the problem they wanted to “act” [...] on the issues and embrace the advantages of the campaign for the future. In the article, “Dove’ Real Beauty Campaign Turns 10: How a Brand Tried To Change The Conversation About Female Beauty”, written by Nina Bahadur from the HuffPost interviewed a spokesperson for the Dove Company about the types of feed back they have got from the Dove Real Beauty Campaign and how it has impacted the company. Sharon MacLeod, vice president of Unilever North America Personal Care, told HuffPost"were thinking, we have to walk the talk” she also stated “We can't just be getting people stirred up; awareness and conversation isn't enough. We actually have to do something to change what's happening.” Since the start of the campaign, Dove has started funds for women and girls to promote their message along with more advertisings in attempt to bring more awareness to women of different ages and cultural background. The company of Dove believes they still have a chance to bring a greater impact on society and the generations to come {{when it comes to the}} impact of societies views of beauty and the impact it has on women and young girls. As stated in the interview with MacLeod [...] "We're going to try to change a generation," [...] MacLeod tells HuffPost”You have to wait until they grow up to see what happens.” Some critiques on the other hand believe that the campaign focuses to greatly on the physical aspect of beauty instead of other areas that should have more focus. From The Cut, Ann Friedman states the following about the Dove Real Beauty Campaign: “These ads still uphold the notion that, when it comes to evaluating ourselves and other women, beauty is paramount. The goal shouldn’t be to get women to focus on how we are all gorgeous in our own way. It should be to get women to do for ourselves what we wish the broader culture would do: judge each other based on intelligence and wit and <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility,</b> not just our faces and bodies.” Critics and defenders of the Dove Real Beauty Campaign have both pointed out on occasion that because just cause Dove is trying to redefine what society and women believe as beauty does not essentially mean that women and younger girls will feel different about themselves, this is also stated by Ann Friedman when she suggests to the HuffPost as evidence that Dove's message about beauty is important and necessary. An estimated 80 percent of American women feel dissatisfied with their bodies, and 81 percent of 10-year-old girls are afraid of becoming [...] "fat."

The empirical data is based on participant observations and in-depth interviews with first-year students attending skills training classes in one of Norway’s four physiotherapy bachelor programmes. Theoretically, this paper is framed within Merleau-Ponty’s and Daly’s embodied approaches to ethics. The analysis pays {{special attention to the}} concepts of ethical insight, <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility</b> and hyper-reflection. The findings are presented according to two themes: ‘embodying tacit care’ and ‘in-between abstract and embodied ethics’.

Ultimately, we argue that while physiotherapy education should embrace the unique nature of skills training as an opportunity to stimulate students to develop their <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility,</b> at the same time, the curriculum must also emphasise hyper-reflection (critical thinking). We also discuss how educators can organise their curriculum and teaching in a way that enhances the potential for students to develop professional ethical insight...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} pursues {{the thesis}} that although Karol Wojtyła makes great strides in expanding the notion of subjectivity beyond consciousness and then establishing the other as acting subject {{as the foundation for}} ethical personalism, his analysis could be significantly enhanced through engagement with the classical Confucian interpersonal <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility.</b> After all, Wojtyła reviles both individualistic and collectivistic forms of ethics. With Jean-Paul Sartre functioning as a foil for the purposes of appraisal, we can see how Wojtyła extends the notion of subjectivity into the dimension of action and how he establishes the person and, moreover, the other as subject, that is, as acting subject. Subjectivity understood on the basis of action instead of (as reducible to) consciousness is compatible with the personalistic ethical postulate “to treat the other not as an object but as a subject. ” On Wojtyła’s account, ethical action is an interaction ipso facto and implies intersubjectivity insofar as one’s action is guided by the other’s subjectivity. What is more, Wojtyła contends not only that the subject is the person but also that person is act. In so doing, he has set the stage for an interpersonal ethics that is the middle way between individualistic and collectivistic forms of ethics. The trajectory of Wojtyła’s ethics bends toward the interpersonal dimension of the human condition, but, perhaps held back by his metaphysics and soteriology, he never fully or methodically develops this interpersonal <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility.</b> It is regarding this lack that an appeal to Confucius and classical Confucianism is auspicious. Indeed, there is a somewhat surprising but striking compatibility between Wojtyłan personalist ethics and classical Confucian humanistic ethics. They are both built around the interpersonal dimension. While the interpersonal <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility</b> of the classical Confucians lacks modern theoretical development, unlike Wojtyła they provide vivid descriptions of interpersonal ethical conduct and a clearer vision for an interpersonal ethical program. What emerges from adapting Wojtyła’s ethics to the classical Confucian interpersonal <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility</b> is enhancement of the Wojtyłan interpersonal ethos and a comprehensive interpersonalist ethics...|$|E

The articulation of an <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility</b> that is not grounded on a universal law has been one of the thorniest issues in political theory. Ethical reflection has been unnecessarily trapped between the poles of moral universalism and/or relativism.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to a rethinking of the <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibilities</b> of geographical research {{in the context of}} an emerging interest amongst geographers in non-representational registers of thinking and moving. Rather than undermining geographical engagements with questions of the ethical, the paper argues that this emerging interest in questions of the non-representational actually extends the range and repertoire of empirical contexts and conceptual vehicles within and with which such an engagement can take place. The paper argues that attending to and through the relation between affect and ethics is particularly important to this effort. The importance of affect in this regard is illustrated through a series of examples drawn from an 18 -month participatory encounter with a specific therapeutic practice, Dance Movement Therapy. Drawing upon such examples, the paper offers some lines of ethical potential that might provide orientation to further geographical research. In doing this, the paper concentrates in particular on the necessity of cultivating a fidelity to the affective event of geographical ethics as much as remaining faithful to the subject or object of an ethical code...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{discussion}} about presence {{and its relationship to}} ethical and moral behaviour. In particular, it problematises the notion of presence within a contemporary culture in which social life is increasingly lived and experienced through networked digital communication technologies alongside the physical presence of co-present bodies. Using the work of Heidegger, Levinas, Bauman and Turkle (among others), it is suggested that the increasing use of these technologies and our increasing presence in on-line environments challenges our tendencies to ground moral and ethical behaviours in face-to-face or materially co-present contexts. Instead, the mediated presences we can achieve amplify our cultural tendency to objectify the social world and weaken our sense of moral and ethical responsibility to others. In that sense, an important disjuncture exists between the largely liminal space of on-line interactions and the <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibilities</b> of material presence which, as these two spheres become more intensely integrated, has potential consequences for the future of an ethical social world and a civil society. The examples are used of on-line suicides, trolling and cyberbullying to illustrate these ethical disjunctures...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores {{advertising}} as a ‘soft’ mode {{of governance}} {{understood in terms}} of a form of power which avoids instruments of coercion, involving instead certain practices of freedom and forms of pleasure. The main concern of the thesis is to analyse the mechanisms through which techniques of such ‘modest’ power interact with techniques of representation in order to define forms of femininity and shape self-fashioning practices of female consumers. The study is based on a comprehensive survey of a sample of television advertisements broadcast in Britain on three television channels with national coverage in May 2001 {{as well as on the}} analysis of a selected body of advertising trade literature.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} offers new {{answers to}} the ethical questions posed by Homer’s epics by implementing interdisciplinary methods and perspectives. Drawing insights from anthropology, literary criticism, philosophy, and psychology, I construct an ethical model, which evaluates ethical systems not primarily {{as a means of}} regulating conduct but as a means of endowing particular actions with exemplary significance. My methodology, which is based on this ethical model, approaches ethics as a complex system that can never be adequately described in its totality but only in reference to specific human problematics. The problematic I investigate is death: how it serves as an opportunity for Homeric heroes to pursue the most significant kind of life they can in light of their mortality. The Homeric hero is obliged to protect his “lot” in life as his birthright and property in the divinely-governed world; he is obliged also to recognize the limits of his lot and respect the lot of other noblemen by rendering them due honor. Not all lots are equal, of course, and certain <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibilities</b> are required to negotiate the social domain properly. The Iliad and Odyssey illustrate what <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibilities</b> come into play as their exemplars struggle against a diverse range of human vicissitudes. Three sensibilities are especially important: (1) a sense of culturally appropriate restraint out of fear of retribution, (2) a sense of culturally appropriate anger upon seeing shameless behavior, (3) a sense of culturally appropriate love/friendship and pity that opens a path for even strangers to be treated as intimates, i. e. to have their needs met. Corresponding to these sensibilities are battle customs and civic customs. A heroic death garners significance from occurring either under the auspices of battle customs or under the auspices of civic customs. The Iliad illustrates good death in war as a “beautiful death,” and the Odyssey illustrates good death in the community as a “gentle death. ” Death is the culmination of one’s living actions, and glorious actions are worthy of being remembered by a community in song. Even when a hero no longer can act in the world, he is able, if his actions are preserved in memory, to participate {{in the life of the}} community. To be remembered and honored “equally to a god” is the greatest good a mortal can have, insofar as it approximates the immortal existence of the gods. In my conclusion, I also discuss methods of researching the reception of Homeric ethics, especially by Plato...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} fields of memory studies and video game studies. As a result, it proposes the concept of virtual {{communicative}} memory to encapsulate the special form of memory that can be produced by player interaction with video games. As an instance of modern media, video games bring the added dimensions of player agency, engagement of personal values and <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibilities</b> of the players, and shared experience of simulated historical environments. These factors justify {{the investigation of the}} memory-making potential of video games. To explore the feasibility of the proposed theoretical development, the thesis presents an analysis of the game Company of Heroes 2 (Relic Entertainment, 2013). In this analysis, the dominant historical themes of the game are fleshed out and the memory making potential of the game is evaluated with a view to virtual communicative memory. The thesis also contains the results of empirical research carried out during the summer of 2016 in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The research was designed to explore player engagement with the game and the process by which players negotiate the meaning potentials and historical themes contained in the game. This research provides some support for the concept of virtual communicative memory and points to numerous further research avenues, {{such as the use of}} video games in education...|$|R
40|$|This paper makes a {{case for}} what it understands to be the ethical {{imperative}} underwriting the need to revisit select historical criticisms of psychotherapy. Three broad areas of historical criticism seem particularly pressing in this respect: socio-political critiques, feminist critiques, and concerns over the potentially abusive nature of the transference. The first set of arguments concerns a series of speculations over how psychotherapy may act {{as an instrument of}} social control, as a de-politicizing and potentially 'pathologizing' vehicle able to implement normative (or ideological) socio-political values through its clinical procedures. The second set of arguments focuses on psychotherapy's gendering potential, that is, both its construction of gender and its reiteration of patriarchal power-relations. The third focus of the paper brings to the fore questions of the frequently sexualized nature of the psychotherapeutic interaction, particular with reference to the transference. The paper concludes by suggesting that the problems thus posed cannot simply be eradicated; the most appropriate response, by contrast, is that of a broadening <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility</b> of the potential impact of such issues and their 'thematic variants' upon clients...|$|E
40|$|Trading Worlds is an anthropological {{study of}} a little {{understood}} yet rapidly expanding global trading diaspora, namely the Afghan merchants of Afghanistan, Central Asia and Europe. It contests one-sided images that depict traders from this and other conflict regions as immoral profiteers, the cronies of warlords or international drug smugglers.

40|$|This article {{offers a}} reading of the philosophies of Emmanuel Levinas and Theravada Buddhism across and through their {{differences}} in order to rethink an education that is committed to ‘negative capability’ and the sensibility to uncertainty that this entails. In fleshing this out, I first explore Buddhist ideas of impermanence, suffering and non-self (anicca, dukkha, and anatta, respectively), known as the three marks of existence, from the perspective of Theravada Buddhism. I explore in particular vipassana meditation’s insistence on openness to the transient nature of experience and self, and the notion of ‘encounter’ that is implied therein. I then interweave this with Levinas’s notion of an ethics of alterity. I argue that taken in tandem, both provide the condition through which another kind of <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility</b> can be developed—that is, one that is attuned to our encounters with the world. In conclusion, the article reflects on how this sensibility as ‘negative capability’ can re-inform an ethics of educational practices, which are by nature themselves necessarily involved with change and uncertainty...|$|E

I make my inquiry by writing my experiences autobiographically and critically interpreting them in dialogue (a Naming itself) with other teachers, with cultural voices, and with discourses of scholarship. Further, conducting my study “upon myself,” I enact a Naming praxis and may therefore determine whether I find myself able to imagine alternate possibilities for Being and whether I am more closely aligned with my <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibilities.</b> In my portrayal, then, I provide an aesthetic experience for my fellow teachers to Name and Imagine their own praxis or orientation toward teaching as a human being.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{project on}} colonialism and immigration in Canadian history explores the complex intersections of discourses of race, nation, and empire. With {{an emphasis on}} the role of visual and popular culture, I locate Canada within transnational discussions about citizenship and civilization. Like emerging states in the "Anglophone colonial world", Canadians helped erect and maintain a "global color line", by passing racist immigration laws that discriminated between "white" and "non-white" migrants. Canadian "racial nationalists" used visual culture to justify immigration restriction and create identity and belonging, even as Canadian identity simultaneously trumpeted tolerance and enlightenment. In turn, anti-racists invoked national exceptionalist mythologies to opposed race-based immigration restriction. Looking back at a global era of nation-building, I locate Canada as an emerging nation-state in which Anglo-Canadians faced the challenge of creating a national identity within a racist global empire, and alongside a powerful Republic that was also virulently racist, but from which Canadians desperately wanted to distinguish themselves. Heated debates about race and national belonging also unearthed cleavages between "white" people in Canada, the United States, and within the British Empire, including distinctions of gender, class, and ethnicity, as well as competing and political and <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibilities.</b> Situated at the intersection of transnational and national history, my project explores how this complex case of nation-formation spawned subtle and dynamic racial discourses, an understanding of which will advance our understanding of race and racism in the twentieth century.

40|$|Dorion Sagan {{observes that}} {{pioneering}} ethologist Jakob von Uexküll {{tends to be}} read in contrasting ways, as a humble naturalist pre-empting current research in biosemiotics, animal perception and agency; and as a biologist-shaman, gesturing to a transcendental realm where the life-worlds of animals interconnect in a vast symphony of nature. In both cases {{the tools of the}} laboratory are thought to generate complete pictures of the invertebrates that Uexküll studies, in unity with their environments. As Giorgio Agamben points out, these experiments form part of an abstract mechanism that produces the human, by isolating instinctual life as an object for study and management from social and ethical modes of existence. What these readings neglect to consider is that Uexküll imagines his experiments through a Picture Book frame. We argue that for Uexküll there is always something fabulous and child-like about the enterprise of reconstructing the subjective environments of the small animals he works with. Drawing on Bernard Stiegler, we propose the Picture Book as a particular technics, or tertiary memory, that cultivates modes of attention that are associated with childhood and are open to the emergence of partial objects and relations. Considered through the Picture Book frame, the Umwelten of insects and other small animals are no longer fixed but are drawn and redrawn in partial expressive ways, through the uncanny picturing-or what Brian Massumi would call semblances-of different configurations of animal, technology, human relations. By considering the Picture Book as a technic for ecological thought and imagination, our paper will explore how the small creatures that Uexküll describes might enable the emergence of new <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibilities</b> and relations. 20 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This essay aims to {{critically}} {{assess the}} later Foucault's ethical turn by using Levinas's ethical metaphysics as critical yardstick. Foucault's notion of ethical subjectivity constitutes {{a site of}} resistance against externally imposed subjugating subject identities. Apart from a practice of freedom, Foucault also insists that it engenders the subject with a generous responsiveness towards others. Despite Foucault's other-aspirations, it seems probable that care of the self would fall short ethically when compared to Levinas's insistence upon an unconditional openness towards the Other. Upon closer investigation, however, we find that Levinas's ethical metaphysics is founded upon phenomenological analyses of our immanent ‘economic’ existence here and now in the world. Although he maintains that metaphysics or ‘transcendence, the welcoming of the other by the same’ (Levinas, 1979 : 43 / 13) is primary, the immanent process of the subject's ‘auto-personification’ (ibid., p. 147 / 120) serves as {{a necessary condition for}} the possibility of becoming ethical, of welcoming the Other. Moreover, contrary to Foucault's self-caring subject, who actively partakes in its own ethical self-formation, Levinas's existent has no educable <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility.</b> It is powerless against the gravitational pull of its egoism, condemned to a hopeless amorality unless the Other intervenes and saves it from itself. I shall therefore argue that Foucault's account of ethical self-becoming invests the subject with a meta-physical potential, which it is denied by Levinas's ethical metaphysics...|$|E
40|$|The design {{community}} has discussed issues {{of ethics and}} values for decades, but less {{attention has been paid}} to the question of how an <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibility</b> might be developed or taken on by design students. In this analysis, we explore how normative concerns emerge through the process of design reviews—where a developing designer’s normative infrastructure is engaged with the artifact they are designing. We focused on the normative concerns that were foregrounded by two undergraduate and two graduate industrial design students across a series of five design reviews, addressing the possible relationship between the emergence of normative concerns and the inscription of norms in the final designed artifact. We used several critical qualitative techniques, including sequence analysis and meaning reconstruction to locate areas where normative concerns were addressed. Normative concerns only arose in explicit form in the earliest review sessions on the graduate level, if they were going to arise at all, and end-user research appeared to be the primary mechanism for introducing norms into the design process. Neither instructor actively engaged or foregrounded the normative infrastructure of the design students, and all of the normative concerns discussed in the four cases were brought to the conversation by students. Implications for including awareness of normative concerns as part of a student’s developing design character are considered as part of a systemic approach to ethics and values in design education...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via [URL] focus on ordinary or everyday ethics has become perhaps the dominant concern in the rapidlydeveloping anthropology of ethics. In this article, I argue that this focus tends to marginalize the studyof {{the ways in which}} religion contributes to people’s moral lives. After deﬁning religion andtranscendence in terms that make them less uncongenial to the study of ethics than many proponentsof ordinary ethics suggest, I examine values as one sometimes transcendent cultural form that ofteninforms ethical life. I draw on Victor Turner (along with Durkheim) to develop an account of how ritualsoften both present people with and allow them to perform transcendent versions of values. Theseencounters, in turn, shape people’s <b>ethical</b> <b>sensibilities,</b> including those they bring to bear in everydaylife, in ways we cannot understand unless we accord religion a more central role in the anthropologyof ethics than it has played to this point. I illustrate my arguments with material drawn both from Turner’s Ndembu ethnography and from my own research on Christianity in Papua New Guinea. This article was delivered as the 2015 Marett Memorial Lecture at Exeter College, Oxford. I thank Marcus Banks for the invitation to deliver the Lecture and I thank him and Exeter College for their generosity in hosting me. I am grateful to many members of the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology at Oxford for their feedback on the lecture. An earlier version was delivered as the Presidential Lecture at the 2015 Meeting of the Society for the Anthropology of Religion. I also thank many of those in attendance at that meeting for their comments. Rupert Stasch, Maurice Bloch, and Jon Bialecki read early drafts and I think them, along with five very helpful anonymous JRAI reviewers, for their comments, while retaining all responsibility for the errors that remain...|$|R

His quickfire, machine-gun delivery of words was a delight to hear, and a reward to unravel: he was funny and self-aware, he enjoyed reporting the follies of others, he distrusted generals, prime ministers and tax officials with sardonic and cruel wit, and above all he made plain his acute intelligence and astonishing range of moral, <b>ethical</b> and literary <b>sensibilities.</b>|$|R

After a critical lecture of his work closely following feminist hermeneutics, we will focus our attention upon the evolution of Lévinas’ treatment of women and the feminine in order to demonstrate that the inherent sexism of his ethical proposal commonly found in his earlier work, is not surpassed by the heterosexist binomial «the saying and the said» which articulates his definite <b>ethical</b> proposal concerning <b>sensibility</b> and vigilance...|$|R
