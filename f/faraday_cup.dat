25|$|Though {{discovered}} in 1927, {{low energy electron diffraction}} {{did not become}} a popular tool for surface analysis until the early 1960s. The main reasons were that monitoring directions and intensities of diffracted beams was a difficult experimental process due to inadequate vacuum techniques and slow detection methods such as a <b>Faraday</b> <b>cup.</b> Also, since LEED is a surface sensitive method, it required well-ordered surface structures. Techniques for the reconstruction of clean metal surfaces first became available much later.|$|E
500|$|The Board convened for {{its first}} meeting on 27 June 1958. [...] Only four members were already engaged in space research: [...] Rossi, Leo Goldberg, John Simpson, and James Van Allen. Rossi formed a {{subcommittee}} which included Thomas Gold, Philip Morrison and biologist Salvador Luria, who agreed that investigations of plasma in interplanetary space would be desirable. Consequently, Rossi decided to turn his group's efforts towards its study. With Herbert Bridge, Rossi designed and tested a plasma probe based on the classical <b>Faraday</b> <b>cup.</b> [...] However, to enhance the instrument's response to positively charged protons and to suppress its response to photoelectrons produced by sunlight, four grids were deployed within the cup. [...] A key innovation was a modulating voltage applied {{to one of the}} grids, which converted the signal into an alternating current, proportional to the proton flux and uncontaminated by any contribution of photoelectrons.|$|E

The sample, often {{in the form of}} graphite, is made to emit C− ions (carbon atoms with a single negative charge), which are injected into an accelerator. The ions are accelerated and passed through a stripper, which removes several electrons so that the ions emerge with a positive charge. The C3+ ions are then passed through a magnet that curves their path; the heavier ions are curved less than the lighter ones, so the different isotopes emerge as separate streams of ions. A particle detector then records the number of ions detected in the [...] stream, but since the volume of [...] (and , needed for calibration) is too great for individual ion detection, counts are determined by measuring the electric current created in a <b>Faraday</b> <b>cup.</b> Some AMS facilities are also able to evaluate a sample's fractionation, another piece of data necessary for calculating the sample's radiocarbon age.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We present {{solar wind}} density {{comparisons}} using three different instruments on the WIND spacecraft: The thermal noise receiver (TNR) on the WAVES experiment which yields the total electron density from the detection and {{the analysis of}} the electron plasma peak; the SWE Fara-day cup detectors which measure ion energy per charge spec-tra and yield the proton and alpha particle densities in the solar wind; and finally the SWE electron spectrometer which provides 3 D electron velocity distribution functions and thus the total electron density.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} work done {{on the design of}} the <b>faraday</b> <b>cups</b> for the DIAMOND light source. Diamond has <b>faraday</b> <b>cups</b> in {{positions}} covering the complete energy range of the machine from the 90 keV gun to the 3 GeV stor-age ring. The Linac cups were modified from an existing design, while the higher energy designs were done using Monte Carlo code. The Monte carlo led designs achieved an elec-tron capture rate of around 99 %, allowing them to be used with reasonable certainty as calibration references. Due to the modest 5 Hz repetition rate of the electron gun, power loading of the structures is minimal and active cooling is not required for any of the cups. Ablation is also not thought to be a significant problem for these designs. OVERVIEW Diamond light source is a 3 GeV 3 rd generation syn-chrotron. The electrons are initially ejected from a 90 keV gun. A linear accelerator increases the energy of the elec-trons to 100 MeV. A booster ring further increases the en-ergy to 3 GeV. Finally the beam is injected into the storage ring to generate the synchrotron radiation [1]. <b>Faraday</b> <b>cups</b> are a basic charge capture device which can be used as reference points for current measurement calibration. Diamond has <b>faraday</b> <b>cups</b> after the 90 keV gun and the 4 MeV bunching section, in the linac to booster transfer line at 100 MeV and at 3 GeV in the booster to stor-age ring transfer line. An initial design decision was made to make the designs passive to increase reliability and reduce complexity. Due to the modest 5 Hz repetition rate of the electron gun, power loading of the structures is minimal and active cooling is not required for any of the cups. The 90 keV and 4 MeV cups were modified from an exist-ing design using analytical formulæ and MathCAD. Monte carlo modeling was used to confirm the new design. The high energy 100 MeV and 3 GeV designs were done using the EGSnrc Monte Carlo code 1 from the national research council Canada, with MatLAB being used for interfaces and post analysis.

40|$|<b>Faraday</b> <b>cups</b> {{are widely}} {{utilized}} to characterize ion and electrons beams.

The results we obtained point out that the secondary electron emission enhanced on incident beam energy and on the angle with respect to the normal direction of the surface.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{accelerator}} systems, beam {{lines are}} generally equipped with diagnostic elements, such as <b>Faraday</b> <b>cups</b> and beam profile monitors (BPM), to optimize beam transport. These diagnostic elements, {{or at least}} commercial ones, are designed to only work with continuous beams, and their typical maximum sensitivity is about few tens of pA. Thus, {{in the case of}} diagnosis of rare isotope beams in accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), <b>Faraday</b> <b>cups</b> and BPMs are not suitable on the high-energy side of the tandem accelerator, after energy-mass-charge analysis. For example, in 14 C AMS, even for a modern sample, the expected counting rate is a few tens of Hz; in these conditions, a commercial BPM cannot be used. On the other hand, checking the shape and the position of the rare isotope beam hitting the detector can be important in order to better iden-tify signals in the detector itself, thus also helping in reducing the measurement background. This paper presents a prototype BPM especially designed for low-intensity beams. The BPM is based on a multiwire propor-tional chamber characterized by 2 grids of anode wires, oriented perpendicular to each other in order to measure both the x and the y coordinates of the particle impact point. Details about the design and the electronics of the device are given, and the first test measurements are discussed...|$|R
