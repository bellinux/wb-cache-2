A series of land speculation ventures near Chicago, Illinois made <b>him</b> <b>very</b> wealthy. He encouraged his fellow Kentuckians to accept {{the results of the}} war. He advocated for civil rights for blacks and urged passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew <b>him</b> <b>very</b> well.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century Æthelwulf's {{reputation}} among historians was poor: he {{was seen}} as excessively pious and impractical, and his pilgrimage {{was viewed as a}} desertion of his duties. Historians in the 21st century see <b>him</b> <b>very</b> differently, as a king who consolidated and extended the power of his dynasty, commanded respect on the continent, and dealt more effectively than most of his contemporaries with Viking attacks. He is {{regarded as one of the}} most successful West Saxon kings, who laid the foundations for the success of his son, Alfred the Great.|$|E
5|$|Suzuki's working {{title for}} this second {{autobiography}} was The Outsider, a title intended {{to express the}} author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this outsider feeling comes from isolation suffered at a Japanese Canadian internment camp during World War II. He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a third generation Canadian, speaking only English. His feeling of isolation continued during his early school years when the only other student of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself as an outsider but insist that the public views <b>him</b> <b>very</b> differently, {{as one of their}} own, leading to the simple The Autobiography title.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} there may be a {{connection}} to a fraternity, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) informs her that it is the secret society for which he is being recruited, the Castle. Wallace tells her that the equipment used to tape him was similar to that which was used to film Veronica and Piz. He starts to go through initiation with the group in order to ascertain the members' identities for Veronica. The members make him go into a room and ask <b>him</b> <b>very</b> personal questions, electrically shocking him if he answers untruthfully. When they find out that Veronica has sent Wallace, they forcibly remove him, but he is able to figure out the identity of one of the other recruits. Veronica sneaks into the house of the recruit Wallace names and sees a large portrait of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). She hears voices and hides behind a curtain before two men emerge. They speak about the Castle, and Veronica discovers that one of them is Jake Kane. After they leave, Veronica steals his computers. Keith investigates the robbery the following day, spotting Veronica on surveillance cameras; however, he does not initially report his daughter. Veronica asks Mac (Tina Majorino) whether any computer could crack Jake's password, and she is taken to a supercomputer on campus.|$|E

25|$|Palmerston built {{a strong}} popular {{following}} among the British electorate, by promoting himself, British nationalism, {{and a sense}} of patriotism.

25|$|In 1938, Béla Imrédy became prime minister. Imrédy's {{attempts}} to improve Hungary's {{diplomatic relations with}} the United Kingdom initially made <b>him</b> <b>very</b> unpopular in Germany and Italy.

In 1348 he was made a Founding Knight of the Garter.|$|E
25|$|Many Conservative {{politicians}} of generations following Macleod recalled {{him as a}} highly effective speaker. His bald head and piercing gaze gave him a striking physical presence, {{and he was one}} of the most powerful platform speakers of his generation, in the league of Churchill or Aneurin Bevan. He was also a superb negotiator with a grasp of detail. Never one to suffer fools, by middle age his disability made <b>him</b> <b>very</b> short-tempered and impatient with people.|$|E
25|$|Segregation {{was also}} hardly {{enforced}} in boxing. In 1908, Jack Johnson, {{would become the}} first African American to win the World Heavyweight Title. However, Johnson's personal life (i.e. his publicly acknowledged relationships with white women) made <b>him</b> <b>very</b> unpopular among many Caucasians throughout the world. It was not until 1937, when Joe Louis defeated German boxer Max Schmeling, that the general American public would embrace, and greatly accept, an African American as the World Heavyweight Champion.|$|E
