5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical <b>group</b> <b>structure,</b> with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{collective}} {{motion of}} a set of moving entities like people, birds, or other animals, is characterized by groups arising, merging, splitting, and ending. Given the tra-jectories of these entities, we define and model a structure that captures all of such changes using the Reeb graph, a concept from topology. The trajectory <b>grouping</b> <b>structure</b> has three natural parameters that allow more global views of the data in group size, group duration, and entity inter-distance. We prove complexity bounds on the maximum number of max-imal groups that can be present, and give algorithms to compute the <b>grouping</b> <b>structure</b> efficiently. We also study how the trajectory <b>grouping</b> <b>structure</b> can be made robust, that is, how brief interruptions of groups can be disregarded in the global structure, adding a notion of persistence to the structure. Furthermore, we showcase the results of experiments using data generated by the NetLogo flocking model and from the Starkey project. The Starkey data describe the movement of elk, deer, and cattle. Although there is no ground truth for the <b>grouping</b> <b>structure</b> in this data, the experiments show that the trajectory <b>grouping</b> <b>structure</b> is plausible and has the desired effects when changing the essential parameters. Our research provides the first complete study of trajectory group evolvement, including combinatorial, algorithmic, and experimental results. ...|$|R
40|$|All quantum <b>group</b> <b>structures</b> on the <b>group</b> GL(2) are classified. It {{is shown}} {{that there are}} only two such structures, the well known quatum groups GLqp(2) and GLhh ′(2). 1 Although the group GL(2) is not a {{complicated}} one, and its dimension is not so high, it seems that there are still some ambiguities in the classification of the quantum <b>group</b> <b>structures</b> on GL(2). There are two well-known deformations of this group [1]: the two parametric Drinfeld-Jimbo deformation GLq,p(2) [2], and the two parametric Jordanian deformation GLh,h ′(2) [3]. It has been shown [4] that these two parametric deformations are related to each other by a singular transformation (contraction). It has been proved that, up to isomorphisms, there are only two quantum <b>group</b> <b>structures</b> on GL(2) with a central quantum determinant, GLq(2) and GLh(2) [5]. Recently Kupershmidt has tried to classify all quantum <b>group</b> <b>structures</b> on the <b>group</b> GL(2) [6]. He has concluded that there are three different quantum <b>group</b> <b>structures</b> on GL(2) : GLq,p(2), GLh,h ′(2), and the new structure GLh,q(2). Here we will show that this new structure is, in fact, not new: by a suitable regular transformation, it falls in one of the two well-known structures GLq,p(2) or GLh,h ′(2), depending on the deformation parameters. So, in fact there are only two non-equivalent quantum <b>group</b> <b>structures</b> on GL(2). To begin, we introduce the quantum-plane relations of GLq,p(2) and GLh,h ′(2).

Unfortunately as the <b>group</b> (<b>structure)</b> becomes increasingly greater the individual becomes separated and grows more alone, isolated and segmented. Simmel's view was somewhat ambiguous with respect to group size. On one hand he believed that the bigger the group the better for the individual. In a larger group it would be harder to exert control on individual, {{but on the other hand}} with a large group there is a possibility of the individual becoming distant and impersonal. Therefore, in an effort for the individual to cope with the larger group they must become a part of a smaller group such as the family.|$|E
