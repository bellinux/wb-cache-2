5|$|Along {{with his}} {{laboratory}} assistants, Professor Bernard Quatermass anxiously awaits {{the return to}} Earth of his new rocket ship and its crew, who have become the first <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> travel into space. The rocket is at first thought to be lost, having dramatically overshot its planned orbit, but eventually it is detected by radar and returns to Earth, crash-landing in Wimbledon, London.|$|E

5|$|Although most ants survive {{attempts}} by <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> eradicate them, {{a few are}} highly endangered. These tend to be island species that have evolved specialized traits and risk being displaced by introduced ant species. Examples include the critically endangered Sri Lankan relict ant (Aneuretus simoni) and Adetomyrma venatrix of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Arachnophobia is a {{specific}} phobia—it is the abnormal fear of spiders or anything reminiscent of spiders, such as webs or spider-like shapes. It {{is one of the}} most common specific phobias, and some statistics show that 50% of women and 10% of men show symptoms. It may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> survive, or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{died out}} {{relatively}} recently {{and is only}} known from subfossil remains, it {{is considered to be}} a modern form of Malagasy lemur. Babakotia radofilai lived during the Holocene epoch and is thought to have disappeared shortly after the arrival of <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> the island, possibly within the last 1000 years. However, the only radiocarbon date that has been reported for it dates back to about 31002800BCE.|$|E

50|$|These are {{infectious}} RNA-containing viruses {{which are}} transmitted from <b>human</b> <b>to</b> <b>human.</b>|$|R
50|$|The virus {{can spread}} both from animal <b>to</b> <b>human</b> and from <b>human</b> <b>to</b> <b>human.</b> Infection from animal <b>to</b> <b>human</b> can occur via an animal bite or by {{direct contact with}} an {{infected}} animal’s bodily fluids. The virus can spread from <b>human</b> <b>to</b> <b>human</b> by both droplet respiration and contact with fomites from an infected person's bodily fluids. Incubation period is 10-14 days. Prodromal symptoms include swelling of lymph nodes, muscle pain, headache, fever, prior {{to the emergence of}} the rash.|$|R
5|$|Because of the {{low number}} of subfossil finds, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been rare, and it died out sooner than its sister taxon, Archaeolemur. Both {{disappeared}} shortly after the arrival of <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> the island, but being a large, specialized, terrestrial grazer, Hadropithecus would have faced more pressure from domestic livestock, introduced pigs, and spreading human populations than its more generalized cousin. The last known record was radiocarbon dated to around 444–772 CE.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras {{have adapted}} {{well to the}} {{urbanization}} in South America. They {{can be found in}} many areas in zoos and parks, and may live for 12 years in captivity. Capybaras are gentle and usually allow <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> pet and hand-feed them, but physical contact is normally discouraged, as their ticks can be vectors to Rocky Mountain spotted fever.|$|E

5|$|Saint Augustine {{offered a}} version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as {{the pursuit of the}} supreme good, which {{delivers}} human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love in the correct manner; this requires <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{difference}} in tone between the {{two versions of the}} elegy; the early one ends with an emphasis on the narrator joining with the obscure common man, while the later version ends with an emphasis on how it is natural for <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> want to be known. The later ending also explores the narrator's own death, whereas the earlier version serves as a Christian consolation regarding death.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Malthus {{had argued}} that {{population}} growth beyond resources was ordained by God to get <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> work productively and show restraint in getting families, this {{was used in the}} 1830s to justify workhouses and laissez-faire economics. Evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and Herbert Spencer's 1851 book Social Statics based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his Lamarckian evolutionary theory.|$|E

5|$|Tião was a {{well-known}} solitary female Bottlenose Dolphin that was first spotted {{in the town}} of São Sebastião in Brazil around 1994 and frequently allowed <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> interact with her. The dolphin became infamous for killing a swimmer and injuring many others, which later earned her the nickname killer dolphin.|$|E
5|$|Wall {{was trained}} as a linguist, and the design of Perl is very much {{informed}} by linguistic principles. Examples include Huffman coding (common constructions should be short), good end-weighting (the important information should come first), and a large collection of language primitives. Perl favors language constructs that are concise and natural for <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> write, even where they complicate the Perl interpreter.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{killer whales}} are not {{considered}} a threat to humans, {{but there have been}} cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks.

5|$|A {{nest box}} {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as an animal surveillance device. Surveilling animals {{can lead to the}} discovery of new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 202 {{different}} birds {{have been recorded}} on the island. Eighteen species of land birds breed {{on the island and}} there are many more migratory species that occur on the island and its adjacent islets, many tame enough that it is possible for <b>humans</b> <b>to</b> get quite close. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Endemic Bird Area, and the Permanent Park Preserve as an Important Bird Area, because it supports the entire population of Lord Howe woodhens, most of the breeding population of providence petrels, over 1% of the world population of another five seabird species, and the whole populations of three endemic subspecies.|$|E
5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with <b>humans.</b> <b>To</b> {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The camera was kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E
