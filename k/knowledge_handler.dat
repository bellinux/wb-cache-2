50|$|Training {{is used to}} {{minimize}} the risk of such outcomes. Target practice increases the precision with which the handler can discharge the firearm and thus increase the chances that the intended target is hit. Education about terminal ballistics gives the <b>handler</b> <b>knowledge</b> about the characteristics of a bullet after a target is hit. This knowledge coupled with insight into the handler's own capabilities makes it easier for the handler to make appropriate decisions about whether to discharge or not, even if given little time and/or put under severe stress.|$|R
40|$|Seniors are {{at greater}} risk than other adults for {{foodborne}} illness, poor nutrition and high rates of nutrition- and lifestyle-related chronic diseases. They also represent a major underserved segment of the UC Cooperative Extension client population. The Make Food Safe for Seniors (MFSFS) initiative assessed food safety and nutrition education needs of fixed-income seniors and food handlers and caregivers serving seniors in 10 California counties. Baseline survey results found unsafe practices by over 50 % of the participants in six areas — and by over 65 % of participants in three of those areas. After one food safety training, a post-test showed an average knowledge gain of 18. 1 %; seniors had gained the least <b>knowledge,</b> food <b>handlers</b> had gained some knowledge, and caregivers had gained the most. The unsafe food handling practices of a majority of the study group, as well as poor food behaviors, suggested areas in which education could reinforce or improve food safety, healthy eating and disease prevention practices of seniors, caregivers and food handlers serving seniors...|$|R

With this survey we aimed to determine the HACCP knowledge of staff working in kitchens of food businesses in Istanbul and correlate the results with some demographic characteristics in order to evaluate HACCP awareness in the foodservice sector in Istanbul. A self-administrable questionnaire was developed in order to evaluate the <b>knowledge</b> of food <b>handlers</b> in all stages of kitchen work. The questionnaire consisted of a first set of 9 demographic questions followed by 12 items related to HACCP system application.

40|$|Objective: We have {{assessed}} {{the factors that}} might improve the free food allergen at the restaurants. In addition, we have compared food <b>handlers</b> <b>knowledge</b> with the general public knowledge about food allergens. Design: Cross-sectional, via questionnaires. Participants: A total of 182 participants (80 food handlers and 102 of general public). Main Outcome Measures: Dependent variables: Food allergy knowledge, attitudes and practices. Analysis: The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent t-test. Questionnaires were hand coded and data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19. 0. Results: The survey showed that food handlers and general public had some knowledge on the issue, a major proportion of both group {{do not believe the}} meals produced in restaurants are safe in terms of food allergies. Conclusions and Implications: Allergic people must stay on the alert, questioning the place where {{they are going to have}} their meals in terms of the ingredients used, verifying whether the food is really free of allergens.

Despite the {{advances}} in food science and technology, providing safe meals {{is still a}} source of restlessness. This is due to society changes, such as increasing urbanization and globalization of food distribution that conduced to completely different social and eating habits. Children and elderly {{can no longer be}} cared for by family, and normally people resort to kindergartens and care homes. These new habits have led to {{an increase in the number}} of foodborne diseases. Among the establishments that host these specific groups, high risk groups for this type of illness are the Private Institutions of Social Solidarity. This work had as main objectives to evaluate the microbiological quality of meals and the knowledge hygiene and food safety (HFS) of food handlers in a Nursery and Kindergarten (NK), in a Continuing Care Unit (CCU) and in a Care Home (CH). Ninety samples of prepared meals were evaluated for: Microorganisms at 30 °C, fungi, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. The median obtained for microorganisms at 30 °C was 3. 42 log cfu/g, while for Enterobacteriaceae the median was 1. 30 log cfu/g. It was verified that the higher levels found were at CH and the lowest were in NK. It was detected E. coli (2. 2 %), coagulase-positive staphylococci (1. 1 %) and B. cereus (1. 1 %) in some samples but at low levels. All samples have proved negative for Salmonella, L. monocytogenes and C. perfringens. 28. 9 % of the analyzed samples had an unsatisfactory result, which may indicate some difficulties in the HFS. Regarding the <b>knowledge</b> of <b>handlers</b> in HFS it was found that there are some failures. The results indicate that the microbiological quality of the meals served do not constitute a public health issue, but the education of the food handlers in HFS need some improvements...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the food-hygiene <b>knowledge</b> of food <b>handlers</b> working {{in nursing homes}} and kindergartens was evaluated. From a global {{population}} of 1392 food handlers, a sample was selected of 335 participants from 155 institutions (kindergartens and nursing homes), {{in the region of}} Porto, Portugal. Data was collected through a self-administrated, multiple-choice questionnaire that was filled-in individually, {{in the presence of the}} researchers. The average score of correctly answered questions was 13. 9 (3. 65 SD), corresponding to 60. 7 % of the questions. The level of knowledge shown was heterogeneous, varying according to the topics covered and the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, although some pattern could be discerned as to areas of strength and weakness. Knowledge relating to temperature control (44. 2 % of correct answers) and to risk associated to foods (50. 2 % of correct answers) was significantly lower (p < 0. 001) than the overall knowledge (60. 7 % of correct answers). Education and training (over the previous 12 months) were positively correlated to higher knowledge on food hygiene (p < 0. 001). The same could not be verified in relation to hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) implementation (p ¼ 0. 454). The results underline the importance of assessing training needs and consider such needs when designing training program...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In Ontario, {{local public}} health {{inspectors}} {{play an important}} frontline role in protecting the public from foodborne illness. This study was an in-depth exploration of public health inspectors' perceptions of the key food safety issues in public health, and their opinions and needs with regards to food safety information resources. Methods Four focus group discussions were conducted with public health inspectors from the Central West region of Ontario, Canada during June and July, 2008. A questioning route was used to standardize qualitative data collection. Audio recordings of sessions were transcribed verbatim and data-driven content analysis was performed. Results A total of 23 public health inspectors participated in four focus group discussions. Five themes emerged as key food safety issues: time-temperature abuse, inadequate handwashing, cross-contamination, the lack of food safety <b>knowledge</b> by food <b>handlers</b> and food premise operators, {{and the lack of}} food safety information and knowledge about specialty foods (i. e., foods from different cultures). In general, participants reported confidence with their current knowledge of food safety issues and foodborne pathogens. Participants highlighted the need for a central source for food safety information, access to up-to-date food safety information, resources in different languages, and additional food safety information on specialty foods. Conclusions The information gathered from these focus groups can provide a basis for the development of resources that will meet the specific needs of public health inspectors involved in protecting and promoting food safety. </p...|$|R
40|$|In global terms, Saudi Arabia is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} country. As such, its food industries {{have yet to}} fully implement the food safety management systems common in the EU. In the hospitals sector, the Ministry of Health intends to implement Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) system to provide safe meals for patients, staff and hospital visitors. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the readiness of the Saudi Arabian hospitals to implement HACCP by assessing the pre-requisites programmes in their foodservices departments. An audit form was used in four hospitals in Riyadh. Questionnaires were also used to assess self-reported behaviour, knowledge and attitudes of 300 foodservices staff. Lack of training was known to be a major omission in the pre-requisite programs (PRP’s) of all hospitals. Therefore a bespoke food safety training program was developed and delivered to food handlers in the participating hospitals. An assessment was then made to determine whether this intervention had any effect on their knowledge, attitude to food safety and self-reported behaviour. The results show that, the prerequisite programs were not implemented properly in the participating hospitals. Also, foodservices staff had a poor knowledge with regard to food safety. However, staff knowledge was significantly improved following the training (p. value < 0. 05) and their level of knowledge remained stable after six months. Participants’ behaviours and attitudes also improved after the training. This indicates that, training has a positive impact on food <b>handlers</b> <b>knowledge,</b> practices and attitude...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to survey the knowledge and behavioural practices of food handlers in bukas (a type of local restaurant) in Nigeria with the aim of assessing the hygiene practices of food handlers and whether they were knowledgeable about typhoid fever and its mode of transmission. Methods: One hundred and seventy four (174) Respondents were ad- ministered questionnaires on their sociode- mographic characteristics, behavioural practices and knowledge of typhoid fever. Results: Ma- jority of the food handlers drank pure water (32. 1 %), borehole water (32. 6 %) and public tap water (31. 1 %) at the about the same frequecy. More than half (62. 2 %) washed their hands with water only before eating while 27. 7 % did not wash their hands always before preparing food. After using toilets, 71. 9 % washed their hands with soap and water while 28. 1 % washed their hands with only water. When asked if they had heard about typhoid fever 90 % said they had heard, out of which 15. 6 % did not know how it was contracted while the others had partial <b>knowledge.</b> Conclusion: Food <b>handlers</b> play a prominent role in the transmission of typhoid fever and so {{it is important that the}} food handlers are well informed about their hygiene status and the causes of typhoid fever trans- mission and ways by which typhoid fever spread is prevented.

40|$|Background: Food borne {{diseases}} {{are caused by}} contamination of pathogenic microorganism and are still a major health problem throughout the world. There are 1, 8 billion cases of diarrhea which mostly were caused by food contamination in 2005. Food handlers {{are at risk of}} contaminating microorganism towards food they handle. The process of transmission can be prevented by practicing good hygiene while processing and handling food. The objective of this study was assessing <b>knowledge</b> among food <b>handlers</b> regarding their personal and food hygiene at canteen in Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran. Methods: A descriptive study was conducted during the period of October to November 2012 to 14 food handlers in the Canteen at Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Padjadjaran using 26 validated questions divided into 3 major parts, 14 questions for knowledge of hand washing, 9 questions for knowledge of utilization of clean water and 3 questions for knowledge of waste management. The scores were classified as good, moderate, and poor. Data were analyzed using frquency distribution. Results: Majority of the respondents was male and common age group was 20 – 29 years old. Eight of the respondents were senior high school graduates. Based on working experience, majority of food handlers had been working for one and three years. None of the respondents had good knowledge. Only 12 and 2 respondents had moderate and poor knowledge, respectively. Conclusion: None of the respondents had good knowledge regarding hand washing, utilization of clean water and waste management.

This study aimed to explore the knowledge, attitude and practice of food handlers in military hospitals in Jordan. A Self completed questionnaire was answered by 200 employees; 150 military employees and 50 civilian employees in 7 Jordanian military hospitals selected randomly one from the capital Amman and two from the three provinces. The {{results showed that the}} means of the percentage scores for the knowledge, attitude, practice, were 84. 82, 88. 88, 89. 43, respectively and the overall knowledge, attitude, practice (KAP) mean percentage score was 87. 88. A significant difference (P 0. 05) in these values was observed between the military and civilian employee. The mean percentage scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 88. 5, 93. 2, and 91. 4, respectively for military employee compared to those for civilian employee of 73. 7, 75. 8, and 83. 5, respectively. A significant difference for the overall (KAP) mean percentage score was also observed between gender, education and specific occupation of the food handler.

40|$|The {{accidental}} {{introduction of}} the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) to Guam {{has resulted in the}} extirpation of most of the island 2 ̆ 7 s native terrestrial vertebrates, has created a health hazard to infants and children, and has resulted in economic losses. The high brown tree snake population densities on Guam, the species 2 ̆ 7 adaptations for successful dispersal, and Guam 2 ̆ 7 s position as a focal point for commercial and military cargo shipments have created a high level of concern that brown tree snakes could spread from Guam to colonize other vulnerable locations. Cargo inspections using teams of handlers and their detector dogs form the last line of defense for preventing brown tree snake dispersal from Guam. We assessed the efficacy of the teams of handlers and their dogs during 1998 and 1999 for locating stowed brown tree snakes by planting live brown tree snakes (in escape-proof containers) in cargo without the <b>knowledge</b> of the <b>handlers</b> inspecting the cargo. Many of these inspections were monitored by a concealed observer to determine the reason if a planted snake was not located by the dog teams. For 1998 and 1999, we found similar efficacies of 6196 and 642 ̆ 736, respectively. When the snakes were not located by the dogs, we found that twice as many were missed because the dog did not change its behavior in response to the snake rather than because the handler did not conduct an adequate search pattern. During daytime inspections we found a greater efficacy for outdoor inspections than for indoor inspections. We found that the average efficacy of 62...|$|R

Several diseases and malaise of the population are due to the intake of contaminated dishes and water, due {{to the presence of}} pathogenic micro-organisms or producers toxins, being necessary to assess the quality of food and <b>knowledge</b> of food <b>handlers</b> on food security. Therefore, the aim of this project is to assess the sanitary-hygienic aspects of food produced in a kitchen pilot, of the meals distributed in all educational institutions of a city region São José do Rio Preto – SP, and the menu served to the children will also be examined through microbiological and parasitological analysis. This research evaluated 102 samples of different types of food, 73 swab samples from the hands and surfaces, 60 water samples from the drinking fountains and faucets at the pilot kitchen, and the water following was subjected from microbiological analysis: heterotrophic bacteria, total coliforms, thermotolerant coliforms and Escherichia coli along with yeast and molds.

40|$|School {{canteens}} {{are more}} than just a system of supplying foods for children, instead they have a special role to play in education, health and well-being of students and the communities they serve. The objective of this research is to explore and document the practices and knowledge, and type of foodservice system as the recognized factors of food poisoning in public primary school canteens in Malaysia. In order to decrease the incidence of foodbome disease, research on food handlers’ behavior and its connection with food safety culture and food safety management systems should be made. A total sample of 161 food handlers from 2 urban cities; Johor Bahru and Kota Bharu, in Malaysia were studied. The states represented developed and less developed areas in Malaysia. Data were collected using both questionnaire and observation. The research revealed that the practice and knowledge of Malaysian food handlers do not go hand in hand. Though the food safety practices of respondents were found to be good and within the ministry’s guidelines, they fail to score satisfactorily to show adequate food safety knowledge. Besides, it was also found that all school canteens were consistently using conventional foodservice system. The subsystems were found systematically performed. This is proposed to be the key to the recurring food poisoning outbreak in schools - the lack of food safety <b>knowledge</b> among food <b>handlers</b> alongside the usage of foodservice system that involve extensive food processing and handling. Throughout the study, respondents tend to answer collectively, choosing the answer where most of them thought were correct rather than answering it based on their own individual knowledge. Other than that, in term of race and religion diversity are limited in this study. The results showed that the School Canteen Management Guidelines should be emphasized more among the food handlers. It is suggested that there should be actions taken by authority and/or canteen superior to help food handlers consistently keep abreast with food safety knowledge. The actions could include more regular food safety classes and distribution of comprehensive circulars. This is also applicable to other foodservice premises; commercial and non-commercial...|$|R
