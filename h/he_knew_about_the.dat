Scott Waxman was Hunt's literary agent on the book.|$|E
25|$|Schmid {{confided to}} his friend Richard Bruns that he murdered the sisters and showed Bruns the bodies, buried haphazardly in the desert.

Bruns stayed with his grandparents in Ohio and told them everything <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> murders, and flew back to Tucson to help with the investigation.|$|E

25|$|Herodotus {{traveled}} very extensively, {{collecting information}} and documenting his findings in his books on Europe, Asia, and Libya. He also combined his knowledge {{with what he}} learned from the people he met. Herodotus wrote his Histories in the mid-5th century BC. Although his work was dedicated {{to the story of}} long struggle of the Greeks with the Persian Empire, Herodotus also included everything <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> geography, history, and peoples of the world. Thus, his work provides a detailed picture of the known world of the 5th century BC.|$|E
25|$|Perry {{finally reached}} Uraga at the {{entrance}} to Edo Bay in Japan on July 8, 1853. His actions at this crucial juncture were informed by a careful study of Japan's previous contacts with Western ships and what <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Japanese hierarchical culture. As he arrived, Perry ordered his ships to steam past Japanese lines towards the capital of Edo, and turn their guns towards the town of Uraga. Perry refused Japanese demands to leave, or to proceed to Nagasaki, the only Japanese port open to foreigners.|$|E

25|$|On March 22, 1973, Nixon {{requested}} that Dean {{put together a}} report with everything <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Watergate matter, and even invited {{him to take a}} retreat to Camp David to do so. Dean did go to Camp David and performed some work on this report, but since {{he was one of the}} cover-up's chief participants, this report-writing task placed him in the difficult position of relating his own involvement, as well as that of others, and he correctly concluded he was being fitted for the role of scapegoat in the cover-up by those higher up. Dean did not complete the report.|$|E
25|$|On February 28, 1973, Acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray {{testified before}} the Senate Judiciary Committee during his {{nomination}} to replace J. Edgar Hoover as Director of the FBI. Armed with newspaper articles indicating the White House had possession of FBI Watergate files, the committee chairman, Sam Ervin, questioned Gray as to what <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> White House obtaining the files. Gray stated he had given FBI reports to Dean, and had discussed the FBI investigation with Dean on many occasions. It also came out that Gray had destroyed important evidence entrusted to him by Dean. Gray's nomination failed and now Dean was directly linked to the Watergate cover-up.|$|E
25|$|A Monmouth University/Asbury Park Press poll, {{published}} February 24, 2014, showed Christie's {{job approval}} ratings in New Jersey at 50%, which was down 9% since January and 20% from 12 months prior. Other results showed 61% believed {{the governor was}} not completely honest about what <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> toll lane closures, and 50% (up from 34% in January) thought Christie was personally involved {{in the decision to}} close the toll lanes. A similar poll, released on April 2, showed his approval ratings to be about the same, remaining 14 points lower than December, before the Bridgegate scandal broke. It reported that 62% said that Bridgegate and Hoboken's Sandy relief aid issues hurt his presidential prospects for 2016, up from 51% in January.|$|E

25|$|Soon after, Hogan's friend Ed Leslie (later {{known as}} Brutus Beefcake) came to Cocoa Beach to help Hogan and Bridges manage both the Anchor Club and the Whitey and Terry's Olympic Gym. On his spare time, he and Leslie {{worked out in}} the gym together, and eventually, Beefcake {{developed}} a muscular physique; Hogan was impressed by Beefcake's physical stature and became convinced {{that the two of}} them should wrestle together as tag team partners. Depressed and yearning to return to wrestling, Hogan called Superstar Billy Graham in 1978 with hopes that Graham could find him a job wrestling outside of Florida; Graham agreed and Hogan soon joined Louie Tillet's Alabama territory. Hogan also convinced Leslie, who had yet to become a wrestler, to come with him and promised to teach him everything <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sport.|$|E
500|$|The trial {{commenced}} on 20 April 2015 at Lüneburg Regional Court (Landgericht). In {{an opening}} statement, Gröning asked for forgiveness for his mainly clerical role at Auschwitz {{in the summer}} of 1944, by saying: [...] "For me there's no question that I share moral guilt," [...] the 93-year-old told the judges, acknowledging that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> gassing of Jews and other prisoners. [...] "I ask for forgiveness. I share morally in the guilt but whether I am guilty under criminal law, you will have to decide." ...|$|E
500|$|Howe's {{failure at}} Savannah led to {{criticism}} from Georgia state officials, who {{believed he had}} abandoned the state to the British, {{as well as from}} fellow Continental Army generals, such as William Moultrie, who criticized Howe for even attempting to resist the British while being so greatly outnumbered. [...] During his testimony before a later court–martial, Howe claimed that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pathway through the swamp taken by the British, but stated that he did not defend it because he believed the chance of an attack along the path was [...] "so remote". [...] This contradicted earlier testimony from Georgia militia officer George Walton, who stated that Howe did not know about the path prior to the battle and that Howe told Walton that he was mistaken in believing a path through the swamps existed.|$|E

500|$|Liszt {{provided}} written prefaces {{for nine}} of his symphonic poems. His doing so, Alan Walker states, [...] "was {{a reflection of}} the historical position in which he found himself." [...] Liszt was aware these musical works would be experienced not just by select connoisseurs, as might have been the case in previous generations, but also by the general public. In addition, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> public's fondness for attaching stories to instrumental music, regardless of their source, their relevance to a musical composition or whether the composer had actually sanctioned them. Therefore, in a pre-emptive gesture, Liszt provided context before others could invent one to take its place. Liszt may have also felt that since many of these works were written in new forms, some sort of verbal or written explanation would be welcome to explain their shape.|$|E
500|$|Whorf {{graduated}} from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1918 {{with a degree in}} chemical engineering where his academic performance was of average quality. In 1920 he married Celia Inez Peckham, who became the mother of his three children, Raymond Ben, Robert Peckham and Celia Lee. Around the same time he began work as a fire prevention engineer (an inspector) for the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. He was particularly good at the job and was highly commended by his employers. His job required him to travel to production facilities throughout New England to be inspected. One anecdote describes him arriving at a chemical plant in which he was denied access by the director because he would not allow anyone to see the production procedure which was a trade secret. Having been told what the plant produced, Whorf wrote a chemical formula on a piece of paper, saying to the director: [...] "I think this is what you're doing". The surprised director asked Whorf how <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> secret procedure, and he simply answered: [...] "You couldn't do it in any other way." ...|$|E

A Geiger counter in Chase's pack indicates that the gold in the Throne of Gold is radioactive.

As she and Nate flee, the caverns begin to collapse, killing Dante and any of his mercenaries still in the cave system.

He is voiced by Jason Spisak.|$|E
