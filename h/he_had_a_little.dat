Brabham scored only three points and finished 11th in the championship. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more success in the non-championship Formula One races, where he ran his own private Coopers and took three victories at Snetterton (26 March), Brussels (9 April), and Aintree (22 April).|$|E
500|$|Bakshi {{is quoted}} as saying that he had [...] "mixed feeling" [...] about Jackson's adaptations, {{although}} he had not seen the films. [...] "In some respects I feel good that Peter Jackson continued and went on, and in some respects I feel bad that Saul Zaentz, the producer, and various people never called me, thanked me, or asked my permission to do the movie. [...] has anyone sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> easier time than I did, and a lot better budget." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis slumped {{a bit in}} 2009 spring {{training}} but still began 2009 as the Rangers' first baseman. Rangers' manager Ron Washington said, [...] "I'm not worried about Chris. Chris works hard. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> spell where {{he was trying to}} get himself together. He's going to have bad times, but what he did tonight is what he's capable of and he'll do that enough to make him love you." [...] On May 14, with the Rangers trailing 21 in the ninth inning against the Seattle Mariners, he homered against Brandon Morrow to give the Rangers a 32 victory. After a 1-for-29 slump, Davis hit two home runs on May 26 in a 73 victory over the New York Yankees. He had four hits on June 25, the fourth a 12th-inning two-run home run against Esmerling Vásquez in a 98 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, {{all three}} {{locations}} were major contenders, when Robert McKinney (publisher of The Santa Fe New Mexican {{and a former}} SJC board member) called and told Weigle {{that a group of}} city leaders had long been looking for another college for Santa Fe. At a lunch Weigle attended at John Gaw Meem's house on the outskirts of Santa Fe in late January 1961, Meem volunteered that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> piece of land (...) that he would gladly donate to the college. Upon looking at it after lunch, Weigle instantly fell in love with it. A committee of four faculty members (Robert Bart, Barbara Leonard, Douglas Allanbrook, and William Darkey) went to visit all four sites (the three in California, and Santa Fe) and, after much deliberation, also recommended Santa Fe.|$|E
2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{his career}} he also began to act in various films. In 1963, {{director}} Otto Preminger asked if he would portray a Boston prelate in The Cardinal, and, writes author Philip Kemp, he [...] "virtually stole the picture." [...] He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> participation (as did many others) in 1967's Casino Royale as actor and director. He acted in Roman Polanski's Chinatown (1974) as the film's master villain, and as Teddy Roosevelt's secretary of state John Hay in The Wind and the Lion. Huston enjoyed acting and denied that he took it all that seriously. [...] "It's a cinch," [...] he once said, [...] "and they pay you damn near as much as you make directing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harrison Ford {{considers}} Deckard to be human. [...] "That was {{the main}} area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time," [...] Ford told an interviewer during a BBC One Hollywood Greats segment. [...] "I thought the audience deserved one human being on screen that they could establish an emotional relationship with. I thought I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact I think <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> reservation about that. I think {{he really wanted to}} have it both ways." [...] Scott suggests that Ford may have since changed his view, although Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve claimed that Ford and Scott argue about the issue to this day. Other people involved in the movie's production who have expressed the view that Deckard is human include: David Snyder (art director), M. Emmet Walsh (who portrayed Bryant) and Rutger Hauer (who portrayed Roy Batty).|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} season saw England {{tour and}} just like nine years previous Taylor was at his best. In the first Test at Johannesburg he batted at number three {{and in the second}} innings scored a superb 176, the next highest score in the match was 50. Taylor's knock included 25 boundaries and was the largest by a South African against England. South Africa won the Test by 168 runs, it was Taylor's first victory as captain and as a Test player. He followed that in the second Test with scores of 9 and 68 as England narrowly won by one wicket. In the third Test at Durban he was moved back up to open the innings, he scored 91 and shared 110 with Bob Catterall. The third days play was washed out leaving the draw inevitable in a four-day match. The fourth Test was also drawn, Taylor scored 11 at number four and when moved back as opener in the second innings made 101. Wisden wrote: [...] "Taylor, who hit out freely when fear of defeat had gone, played a masterly game, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> luck".|$|E

With the series still level at 1–1, the fifth and final Test was made Timeless to ensure a winner of the series. England's C. A. G. Russell scored two centuries in the match and South Africa were set a target of fourth innings target of 344. Taylor, at number four, [...] batted for four and a half hours over an innings of 102 however he received little support from his teammates and South Africa lost by 109 runs. Taylor finished the series with 582 runs at 64.66 and was the highest scorer on either side, his total was 278 more than the next South African. His series total was at the time a Test record for a captain, later surpassed by Don Bradman in 1936. His three centuries in the series set a South African Test record which was only bettered in 2003/04 by Jacques Kallis. The Wisden report of the series recorded that [...] "H. W. Taylor as a batsman was in a class by himself". The series cemented Taylor's position as a leading batsman in the world.|$|E
