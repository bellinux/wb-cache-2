60|$|My Lords, you see {{the fraud}} he has put upon the Council. You will find that Mr. Bristow's letters, up to the 3d of March, had been suppressed; and though then communicated, yet he instigated his cat's-paw, that blind and ignorant Council, to demand from the Vizier the renewal of these very severities and cruelties, the {{continuance}} of which the letters in his pocket had shown him were of no effect. Here you have an instance of his implacable cruelty; you see that it never relaxes, never remits, and that, finding all the resources of tyranny useless and ineffective, he is still willing to use them, and for that purpose he makes a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>concealment</b> of the utter inefficacy of all the means that had been used.|$|E

50|$|At {{common law}} {{there could be}} no larceny of a will of lands. But by the Larceny Act 1861 stealing, {{injuring}} or concealing a will, whether of real or personal estate, was punishable with penal servitude for life. Forgery of a will (at one time a capital crime) rendered the offender liable to the same penalty. <b>Fraudulent</b> <b>concealment</b> of a will material to the title by a vendor or mortgagor of land or chattels is, by the Law of Property Amendment Act 1859, a misdemeanour punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.|$|E

According to Reuters, one reason class action lawyers were able to mobilize so fast is that the company's marketing to upscale professionals, including jurists, had backfired.|$|E

5000|$|In 1993 the pictured [...] "gatehouse" [...] and {{contiguous}} {{property was}} purchased by S.T.B. Jablonski, a New York City S.E.C. registered investment advisor; from Mr. and Mrs. Donald Trost, through McCaffrey Realty of Cold Spring, N.Y. In 1994, {{it was discovered that}} the residence had been infested for decades with a substantial colonization of bats; which had not been disclosed and intentionally hidden by the sellers and their real estate agents, in order to accomplish sale of the property. In 1996 Jablonski filed suit against the sellers and their agents, for rescission of the purchase. Although terms of the settlement cannot be disclosed, the property was transferred in 2005 to the ownership of the wife of the attorney who represented the real estate agents. Prior to this lawsuit, New York had been acaveat emptor (buyer beware) state with respect to real estate transactions. The lawsuit [...] "Jablonski versus Trost, McCaffrey, Piermariniet al", has resulted in significant changes protecting buyers from <b>fraudulent</b> <b>concealment</b> by sellers and their agents.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous former {{students}} {{or their parents}} have filed lawsuits against WWASPS, its personnel, or individual schools. Most have been {{settled out of court}} or dismissed for procedural reasons. For example, a 2005 lawsuit filed in California on behalf of more than 20 plaintiffs was dismissed because the judge found that California lacked jurisdiction. In June 2007, Utah attorney Thomas M. Burton told a reporter that six suits he had filed against WWASPS on behalf of his clients had been dismissed on procedural grounds. WWASPS president Ken Kay told an interviewer that lawsuits against WWASPS are ploys to get money, brought by people who [...] "are never going to be happy." [...] A lawsuit filed in 2007 against WWASPS and its founder, Robert Lichfield, on behalf of 133 plaintiffs alleging physical and sexual abuse and <b>fraudulent</b> <b>concealment</b> of abuse brought negative publicity to Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney, because Lichfield was one of six co-chairs of the Utah state fundraising committee for Romney's campaign.|$|E
40|$|In 2009, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, sitting as the Law Court, decided Picher v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Portland, a {{case that}} {{presented}} an issue of first impression in Maine: whether the doctrine of charitable immunity protected charitable organizations from liability for intentional torts. The court ultimately held that charitable immunity was not a defense to intentional torts, but that it did bar negligence claims based on the sexual abuse of a minor. In Picher, {{a majority of the}} Law Court partly vacated the trial court’s grant of summary judgment for the Roman Catholic Bishop of Portland (Bishop) and held that the doctrine of charitable immunity did not protect the Bishop from liability for the alleged intentional tort of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>concealment.</b> The majority stated three reasons for its decision: (1) charitable immunity is a discredited doctrine; (2) the Legislature did not intend to extend the reach of the doctrine to intentional torts with the enactment of title 14, section 158 of the Maine Revised Statutes in 1965; and (3) there is an absence of any convincing public policy reasons for expanding the scope of the doctrine to cover intentional torts. The dissent argued that section 158 did afford protection from liability for intentional torts and that the majority had “invad[ed] the province of the Legislature” by not maintaining that protection. Moreover, the dissent cautioned {{that as a result of}} the court’s decision, charitable institutions would now be compelled to use their funds to defend lawsuits anytime a plaintiff pled an intentional tort in a cause of action. Although the majority reached the proper conclusion in not extending charitable immunity to cover intentional torts, the court should also have found that the doctrine did not absolve the Bishop from potential liability for negligent supervision, given the public policy rationale underlying that tort in Maine. This Note will detail the history of charitable immunity in Maine and will examine how other jurisdictions have dealt with the immunity...|$|E
