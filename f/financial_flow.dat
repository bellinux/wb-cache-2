40|$|The role of {{financial}} phenomena is growing with economic {{development at the}} cost of material phenomena. Capitalistic states interfere into economic affairs of the country mainly by means {{of financial}} instruments. The state is a kind of generator of <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> and affects <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> of other economic subjects (so called creative and redistributive effect of the state). The interrelation of <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> and material infrastructure of national economy can be measured by help of the FIR, i. e. the ratio of the total of <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> in a given time to the gross national product in the time. In connection with the quantitative and qualitative growth of <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> the thesis has been put forward that it is an anachronism to distinguish into „monetary" and „financial" elements and „real" and „financial" ones.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the emergence}} of current account imbalances {{as a result of}} the co-existence of trade <b>flows</b> and <b>financial</b> <b>flows.</b> The literature has tended to view these factors in isolation: Many post-Kaleckian models, as well as Net-saving approaches assume that <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> will adjust to trade flows. Models focusing on financial crises feature a strong role for <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> but ignore drivers of trade flows. Similarly, empirical analyses either ignore drivers of <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> or insufficiently capture determinants of trade flows. The paper, first, proposes a simple macroeconomic framework of the current account which gives equal emphasis to trade flows, determined by price competitiveness, and <b>financial</b> <b>flows,</b> determined by asset prices. Second, we test a reduced form of the model for 28 OECD countries for the period 1971 - 2014. Our results indicate that cost competitiveness as well as asset prices play a role in the determination of current accounts, but asset prices have dominated in the last two decades...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, Brazilian {{economic}} performance has {{been influenced by}} increasingly volatile <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> and episodes of capital flight, which have occurred mainly due to external events, out of control or influence of the domestic monetary authorities. This paper aims to measure the volatility of <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> in Brazil and to apply different measures of capital flight, in order to analyze the external vulnerability of the Brazilian economy. The main goal is to compare the volatility indicators and measures of capital flight in order to evaluate which indicator best reveals the potential for reversion of <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> to Brazil and best captures external vulnerability in the economy. Our empirical results {{suggest that there is}} a close relationship between the two indicators examined. While volatility of <b>financial</b> <b>flows</b> may capture moments when Brazil is facing a period of inflows of international resources and the transition to sharp reversals and large negative transfers, capital flight may indicate the sensitivity of capital flows toward Brazil due to unstable factors and external shocks. In this sense, the capital flight as the one which occurred in 2008 may be explained by high volatility of capital flows.

5000|$|On 23 May 1871 {{the city}} council spoke about the {{intention}} of building a new parish church, which would eventually replace the old parish church of St Wenceslas. The old church could not contain {{the increasing number of}} believers and failed to comply with official requirements for public buildings. After a fire inspection took place on 2 January 1882, the district marshal in Místek decided to build a new church. Thus, at a council meeting on 5 October 1882 the agreements {{for the construction of a}} new parish church were done. [...] The foundation stone was laid by Mayor Anton Lux and the Reverend Josef Spurný on October 4, 1883. AT that time church committees were competing in Moravia which was established under provincial laws dating from 1864 and 1874. It was the supervisory and executive bodies, which were often the purchaser of furniture projects and new churches, significantly encroached into their final form. Their arguments focused, in particular, on situations where the parish volume was small. The church of the Divine Saviour would serve 4 municipalities which, upon its construction, should contribute a proportionate financial amount. However these villages managed their own parish church and, therefore Ostravanians' contributions to the construction of the church were often the cause of discord. Other <b>financial</b> <b>flow</b> was rather paradoxical. The Archdiocese of Olomouc, who took patronage of the church, was obliged, by patronage law, to pay a third of construction costs, worth just under 33,000 florins. Contributions also flowed in from Jewish entrepreneurs, like Baron Rotschild and the Gutmannové brothers.|$|E
