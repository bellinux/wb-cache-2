This paper analyzes and compares the energetics of several desalination technologies at the high salinities and diverse compositions commonly encountered in produced water from shale formations to guide technology selection and to inform further system development. Produced water properties are modeled using Pitzer's equations, and {{emphasis is placed on}} how these properties drive differences in system thermodynamics at salinities significantly above the oceanic range. Models of mechanical vapor compression, multi-effect distillation, forward osmosis, humidification–dehumidification, membrane distillation, and a hypothetical high pressure reverse osmosis system show that for a fixed brine salinity, <b>evaporative</b> <b>system</b> energetics tend to be less sensitive to changes in feed salinity. Consequently, second law efficiencies of <b>evaporative</b> <b>systems</b> tend to be higher when treating typical produced waters to near-saturation than when treating seawater. In addition, if realized for high-salinity produced waters, reverse osmosis has the potential to achieve very high efficiencies. The results suggest a different energetic paradigm in comparing membrane and <b>evaporative</b> <b>systems</b> for high salinity wastewater treatment than has been commonly accepted for lower salinity water.

Yet, the guidelines vary widely regarding the recommendations that are made to maintain <b>evaporative</b> cooling <b>systems</b> and it is unclear whether guidelines were in place or, if they were, whether they were being followed when the outbreaks of Legionnaires’ disease occurred. Thus, {{this study was designed to}} conduct two systematic reviews of (1) <b>evaporative</b> cooling <b>system</b> maintenance guidelines; and (2) published Legionnaires’ disease outbreaks. For each maintenance guideline identified in the systematic review, recommended maintenance practices were abstracted and similarities and/or differences in the reported recommendations were assessed. Following the systematic review of outbreak investigations that meet the inclusion criteria established for the study, information about the state of the <b>evaporative</b> cooling <b>system</b> during the outbreak investigation was abstracted to summarize, when reported, which maintenance practices were implemented. As expected, the recommended maintenance procedures varied greatly across the guidelines and were not always specific. Overall, the outbreak investigations tended to report similar maintenance issues that were unclear in the maintenance guidelines. Generally, these maintenance issues were biocide use, microbiological testing, frequency of general inspections, and protocols and frequency of total system cleanings. The role in which non-standardized and generalized maintenance guidelines plays in the continued association between Legionnaires’ disease and <b>evaporative</b> cooling <b>systems</b> is still not fully understood. However, this study suggests that more specific and standardized maintenance guidelines, that have been scientifically established to be effective in controlling Legionella bacteria, are needed and then these guidelines must be properly implemented in order to help reduce further Legionnaires’ disease outbreaks associated with <b>evaporative</b> cooling <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R
