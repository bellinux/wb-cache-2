40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a case study}} in <b>forced</b> <b>removals</b> and their ramifications from 1905 to 1977 from the perspective of socio-environmental history. It depicts environmental damages and misunderstandings suffered due to <b>forced</b> <b>removals</b> from Pretoria in a location called Lady Selborne (currently known as Suiderberg) and Ga-Rankuwa where some of the displaced were relocated. The article demonstrates that <b>forced</b> <b>removals</b> did not only result in people losing their historical lands, properties and material possessions, but they lost their inheritance – homes, history and their sense of being and connectedness. The article depicts the complex picture of the ramifications of <b>forced</b> <b>removals</b> among former inhabitants of Lady Selborne where the township was a scenic home, with fertile soils and situated closer to the city centre - where they experienced environmental justice and felt human in the process. With the <b>forced</b> <b>removals</b> and relocation in Ga-Rankuwa the former inhabitants of Lady Selborne were resettled in a place with infertile soil on the outskirts of Pretoria. The article illustrates that successive white governments (from the colonial period till the reign of the National Party under De Klerk) and many scholars have tried to downplay African environmental ethics and to dismiss them as “superstition”. This resulted in <b>forced</b> <b>removals</b> and consequently in Africans being apathetic to environmental issues in the resettlement area; Ga- Rankuwa. This impacted on the oral traditional environmental education on environmental preservation which was ignored by Africans and successive governments and this hastened the deterioration of African environmental settlements in Ga-Rankuwa. Thus, in this article it will be argued that through environmental justice that embraces the “Usable past” of African environmental ethics, environmental education and activism is possible...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (DPhil (History)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2008. This thesis presents, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of socio-environmental history, a case study in <b>forced</b> <b>removals</b> and their ramifications from 1905 to 1977. The focus area is a township called Lady Selborne in South Africa, near Pretoria, and Ga-Rankuwa, where some of those displaced were relocated. The thesis demonstrates that <b>forced</b> <b>removals</b> did not only result in people losing their historical land, properties and material possessions but also their sense of being and connectedness. The focus is thus on the changing perceptions of people in the midst of their land loss, an area of study that is generally under-examined in academia. The research provides a complex picture of the ramifications of <b>forced</b> <b>removals</b> on the former inhabitants of Lady Selborne. Lady Selborne was a “home”, a place for being human where the residents managed to engage in food production and owned properties in a multiracial area. <b>Forced</b> <b>removals</b> emanated from the National Party government’s desire to control African land ownership, {{and the manner in which}} land dispossession took place resulted in environmental injustice. This thesis applies theories of environment, power and injustice to explore how the people related to their environment and how that relationship was defined by class, gender and race. In Lady Selborne, black Africans were displaced from an area that was fertile, close to the city centre of Pretoria and relocated to infertile Ga-Rankuwa on the outskirts of the city. This resettlement resulted in many of those relocated being prevented from engaging in food production which was in turn an affront to Sotho-Tswana culture and religion with its emphasis on land as lefa: a bequest that has to feed its inhabitants. This thesis thus argues that successive governments (and many scholars) have downplayed black African environmental ethics, dismissing them as ‘superstition’. This mindset once resulted in <b>forced</b> <b>removals</b> and they in turn led blacks to disregard environmental issues. Ga-Rankuwa became degraded with litter, soil erosion and dongas, especially in the 1970 ’s, as people realised that there was no hope of returning to Lady Selborne. Environmental apathy emerged unconsciously as a response to <b>forced</b> <b>removals.</b> The thesis concludes by considering the idea of a ‘usable past’ and proposes that socio-environmental history can play a role in realising environmental justice...|$|R

Mormon patrols located three Army supply trains following the army troops on the Oregon/California/Mormon trail which were attacked and burned by Nauvoo Legion members led by Lot Smith.

The Misurasata movement split in 1983, with the breakaway Misura group of Stedman Fagoth Muller allying itself more closely with the FDN, and the rest accommodating themselves with the Sandinistas: On 8 December 1984 a ceasefire agreement known as the Bogota Accord was signed by Misurasata and the Nicaraguan government.
