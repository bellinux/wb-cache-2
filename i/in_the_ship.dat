His descendant further said that Atherton and his wife were each about 15 years old when they were married.|$|E
5|$|Accommodations {{were even}} more cramped and poorly {{ventilated}} than earlier ships because the ammunition hoists passed through the crew spaces, a problem for ships intended for long-endurance sorties into the North Atlantic. The lack of room in the hull forced a number of workshops and offices into the superstructure which added more weight high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> There were three deckhouses abaft the break in the forecastle with intervals between them to permit the beam torpedo tubes to rotate, but these were no larger than in earlier ships which meant that space was at a premium.|$|E

5|$|Descent 3 {{takes place}} in a science fiction setting of the Solar System where the player is cast as Material Defender MD1032, a {{mercenary}} working for a corporation called the Post Terran Mining Corporation (PTMC). The game begins moments after the events of Descent II, with the Material Defender escaping the destruction of a planetoid where he was clearing PTMC's robots infected by an alien virus. He was about to return to Earth to collect his reward, but a malfunction occurred with the prototype warp drive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> he was piloting, making it drift towards the Sun's atmosphere. At the very last moment, the Material Defender is rescued via a tractor beam by an organization known as the Red Acropolis Research Team.|$|E

5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years between the Colossus-class ships' commissioning {{and the start of}} World War I, and the most important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> which electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are unknown, both ships were equipped with a director by December 1915.|$|E

The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Lion received her system in early 1915 while undergoing repairs after the Battle of Dogger Bank and Princess Royal got hers in early 1916. A second director was added to each ship in 1918.|$|E

5|$|Kronan {{was one of}} {{the most}} heavily armed {{warships}} in the world in 1672 when she was launched, a three-decker with 110 guns. The ship had three full gundecks with guns from bow to stern. Altogether there were seven separate levels, divided by six decks. Furthest down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> above the keel, was the hold, and immediately above it, but still below the waterline, lay the orlop; both were used primarily for storage. Above the orlop were the three gundecks, two of them covered, while about half of the topmost gundeck was open to the elements in the ship's middle, or waist. The bow had one deck, making up the forecastle, and the stern had two decks, including a poop deck.|$|E
5|$|Millburn (Rafe Spall) is a {{biologist}} {{who is a}} part of the Prometheus expedition. After awakening, he tries to become friends with Fifield (who rejects him). Millburn joins the initial expedition to the Engineers' artificial structure concealing the Juggernaut, tagging along with Fifield after he is upset by the number of corpses. Separated from the rest of the expedition, they are stranded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship.</b> Millburn and Fifield enter the room containing the thawed black liquid and encounter the Hammerpedes. When Millburn tries to pet one it attacks him, breaking his arm and jumping down his throat. When the crew of the Prometheus returns the next day, they find Millburn's body with the Hammerpede still in his throat.|$|E

The two most prominent {{security features}} are the engraved portrait of Yusof bin Ishak (which contains fine lines that are difficult for counterfeiters to mimic) and the Kinegram (a printed security hologram); MAS states that banknotes with missing or mutilated portrait or/and Kinegram command no value. Paper versions issued by BCCS features its logo and the face value, while those issued by the MAS features its logo with the Merlion (a mythical creature and national symbol) and the face value.

5|$|Seydlitz was {{launched}} on 30 March 1912, and was christened by General der Kavallerie Karl Wilhelm Heinrich von Kleist. On 22 May 1913 {{the ship was}} commissioned into the German fleet, manned by {{the crew of the}} old armored cruiser , which had been recently transferred to the reserve fleet. After trials, Seydlitz joined the rest of the High Seas Fleet for maneuvers off Helgoland. Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Franz von Hipper, the commander of the I Scouting Group, raised his flag <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> on 23 June 1914. The ship served as Hipper's flagship until 26 October 1917.|$|E
5|$|The Forerunner Saga reveals Guilty Spark to {{have barely}} survived {{the events of}} Halo 3. His body barely {{functioning}} and his memory {{of the last few}} years erased from his fight with Chief, he was recovered by the UNSC ship Rubicon and interrogated by ONI for information about the Forerunners. During the interrogation, the barely functioning Spark had breached the Rubicon's firewalls and overpowered the onboard A.I. When the interrogation was over, his monitor body shut down and was launched into space, but his mind remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> informing the crew {{that he was going to}} search for the Librarian and restore his friends Riser and Vinnerva from his life as Chakas before placing the crew in cryostasis and taking the ship for his own to search for the Forerunner.|$|E
5|$|The captain {{ordered the}} ship {{abandoned}} {{later in the}} day, and the carrier was still afloat in the evening, albeit with a slight list to port and down by the bow. Over {{the next couple of}} days, more compartments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> flooded and she settled {{on the bottom of the}} harbor. Another attack on 28 July hit her several more times and the resulting damage from those hits and more near-misses to port caused the ship to list further to port. This gradually increased through the next day until Amagi capsized at 10:00 on the morning of 29 July with part of her flight deck falling overboard. The losses among the ship's crew are unknown, but were supposedly light.|$|E

5|$|The {{identity}} of her purchaser is not known, nor are her activities after her sale, but Ozark {{was still in}} service in late 1873 and based at New Orleans. Louisiana governor William Pitt Kellogg used the ship to transport 35 soldiers of the 19th Infantry Regiment and 25 mounted members of the New Orleans Metropolitan Police to Colfax, Louisiana in October to apprehend the perpetrators of the Colfax Massacre. Due to widespread resistance by local whites, only a few men were arrested and transported to New Orleans by Ozark to stand trial in December. Prosecution witnesses were transported and housed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> during the trials in February–March 1874 {{to protect them from}} threats made by white supremacists. Nothing further is known about the Ozarks activities or fate.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} armed with four 30-calibre BL 13.5-inch Mk I–IV guns in two twin gun turrets, one each {{fore and aft}} of the superstructure. Each gun was {{provided}} with 80 shells per gun. Hoods secondary armament consisted of ten 40-calibre 6-inch Mk I-III guns mounted in casemates in the superstructure. A major problem with the four of these guns mounted on the upper deck {{was that they were}} mounted low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> and were unusable at high speed or in heavy weather. They were removed as useless in 1904. The ship carried 200 rounds for each gun.|$|E
5|$|To this end, {{a crew of}} 12 {{prepared}} a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with headwear, to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make it look more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder were placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled.|$|E
