40|$|AbstractThe article {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of the machining induced surface integrity on tensile properties of 99. 99 % purity Oxygen-Free Pitch copper (OFC), used in nuclear and research facilities. The increase in the feed in machining was found to lead to an increase, up to 55 %, in yield strength of the OFC specimens. Intensive sub-surface deformation and a <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>work-hardening</b> in the near-surface layer are attributed to this effect. Increase of feed resulted in an increase of deformation depth ɛIII and work-hardening ΔH detected via SEM and nanoindentation. The correlation coefficient between the tensile properties and sub-surface deformation was found to equal R = 0. 983...|$|E

40|$|The stress–strain {{behaviour}} of cold-sprayed Ta coatings, deposited onto Al {{and steel}} substrates, was studiedby depth-sensing spherical and sharp (Berkovich) indentation testing, and {{was compared to}} that of anannealed Ta sheet. The mechanical properties of the coatings, free of any scale-dependence, are insensitive tothe presence of a lamellar structure, indicating strong, tight bonding between cold-sprayed Ta particles. Accordingly, the coatings are isotropic. The stress–strain curves reveal that the coating material experiencedsome <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>work-hardening</b> during cold-spraying; indeed, the sprayed particles were plasticallydeformed at impact. This was confirmed by line profile analysis on XRD patterns. The consistency between theresults from different indentation testing techniques provides a means to cross-validate the entire analysis...|$|R

The service robots are expected to provide useful services with a <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> usability and a <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> user experience (UX) from users’ viewpoint. We surveyed required functions on concierge-type robots, and found that an approach function was important for the robots because the robots had to approach users before talking with the users. Therefore, we studied the approach function with a <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> usability and a <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> UX, by applying a development method which we named the model-based development with user model (MBD/UM) [1] as a practical process of human-centred design (HCD) [2].|$|R

However, a <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> tax evasion, due to a lower tax rate, reduces the severity of financial restriction. Underground Economy; Tax evasion; Macroeconomic Policy. ...|$|R

30|$|Today, fierce {{competition}} drives firms in their continual efforts to introduce products with a <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> novelty into the market. There {{is a growing}} need to understand important activities so as to achieve product innovation. This empirical study demonstrates the effect of technology-exploration, including outsourcing R&D, external networking, customer involvement, and inward IP licensing, on product innovation, especially considering the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> the novelty of the manufactured products. Using data from a sample of small and medium Korean manufacturing firms, our results show that technology-exploration are crucial determining factors as to whether low or <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> novelty is achieved in product innovation. The positive impact <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> innovation novelty comes from customer involvement and outsourcing R&D. In addition, customer involvement has positive impact only on low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> innovation. Other practices have no impact on either low or <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> novelty in product innovation.|$|R

We have been researching a model-based development with user model (MBD/UM) as a practical HCD process for service robots. Here, we studied an approach function on a concierge-type robot that should have a <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> usability and a <b>high</b> <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> UX from users’ viewpoint, by applying MBD/UM for HCD.
