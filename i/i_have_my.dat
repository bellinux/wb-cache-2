5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> <b>my</b> dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E
25|$|The Hercules was {{a monumental}} undertaking. It {{is the largest}} {{aircraft}} ever built. It is over five stories tall with a wingspan longer than a football field. That's more than a city block. Now, I put the sweat of my life into this thing. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> reputation all rolled up in it and I have stated several times that if it's a failure, I'll probably leave this country and never come back. And I mean it.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

In {{an early}} November 2013 {{interview}} with Latina magazine, {{she said that}} she finds spirituality to be an important part of maintaining balance in life.

500|$|For {{much of his}} childhood, Smith's {{family was}} a part of the Community of Christ but began {{attending}} services at a local Methodist Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him [...] "really scared of Hell". In 2001, he said: [...] "I don't necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> own version of it." ...|$|E
500|$|He also stated: [...] "I have {{somewhat}} lost my enthusiasm [...] in {{the last}} four or five years. Mainly because film students using digital video these days have not really produced anything more than superficial or simplistic; so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> doubts. Despite the great advantages of digital video and the great ease of using the medium, still those who use it have first to understand the sensitivities of how to best use the medium." ...|$|E

500|$|Dinklage later {{appeared}} in the direct-to-DVD film Tiptoes (2003) with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey. The film met with negative reviews, particularly Oldman's role as a person with dwarfism. According to Dinklage, the original cut of the film was [...] "gorgeous", but the director was fired shortly after turning it in, and the film was re-cut into a [...] "rom-com with dwarves". Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, [...] "There was some flak: Why would you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That's almost like blackface. And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> own opinions about political correctness, but I was just like, It's Gary Oldman. He can do whatever he wants, and I'm {{so happy to be}} here." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} quickly {{recorded}} in Los Angeles {{over the course}} of two weeks. In an interview with The Guardian, when asked about the expectations of the album, Tyler replied [...] "I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> doubts. Everybody's going on it and I just think, fuck, everybody might hate this shit. Everybody might go: 'What the fuck is this? We wanted this, we wanted that.' There we go. We made an album we wanted to make. If everybody hates it, OK. We have an album we like." [...] The track [...] "Forest Green" [...] was released over a year before the release of the album but was featured on the project with remastered production.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst {{continued}} the acting career {{that she had}} begun. As a teenager, she {{found it difficult to}} deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had any regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> stuff to work out... I don't think anybody can sit around and say, 'My life is more screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues." ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{executive}} producer Bill Panzer {{was intrigued by}} the idea that a mortal would want to spend their life with an Immortal, this choice having several drawbacks. MacLeod does not age, while Tessa is mortal and will age. Despite their mutual wish, they know growing old together is impossible and this uneasy thought [...] "...haunts them both, sometimes more than others." [...] As an Immortal, MacLeod is also sterile and Tessa resigns herself to having no children. [...] "" [...] deals with Tessa's choice and its impact upon her life. In this episode, Tessa becomes very fond of a four-year-old girl and muses; [...] "For a while there, just for a few hours... I felt like she was mine. I liked how it felt. But, she's not... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> own life and it's more than enough." [...] Panzer commented that [...] "The Sea Witch" [...] "...brings forth in a very powerful way what exactly 's giving up to be with MacLeod." ...|$|E
500|$|Anthony Lane, {{reviewing}} for The New Yorker, called The Fountain [...] "a gorgeous nimbus of confusion." [...] Lane {{complained about}} the film's up-close and far-away shots, [...] "What fails to concern or attract Aronofsky {{is the place where}} most of us hang out—the in-between, the midshot of everyday existence." [...] He summarized, [...] "The movie may have significant truths to impart, although <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> doubts, but it feels too inexperienced, too unworldly, to have earned the right to them." [...] Roger Ebert, who admired Aronofsky's previous films, conceded in the Chicago Sun-Times that The Fountain was [...] "not a great success." [...] He identified the film's issues: [...] "too many screens of blinding lights," [...] "too many transitions for their own sake," [...] and [...] "abrupt changes of tone." [...] He believed that the scaling down of the film from Aronofsky's original ambition lost some elements and anticipated a director's cut truer to Aronofsky's vision.|$|E
500|$|The work progressed slowly, {{hampered}} by the partially submerged nature of the site, violent storms that wracked the area, {{and the fact that}} preparatory work had to be done away from the building site. During construction, a particularly violent storm hit the construction site, sweeping away much of the iron framework intended to support the stone shell of the lighthouse. Captain Alexander was discouraged, reportedly saying, [...] "If wrought iron won't stand it, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> fears about a stone tower." [...] Those fears were allayed when news reached Alexander that the damage had been due to a ship striking the lighthouse, rather than from just the storm alone. Work recommenced on building the lighthouse, and the final stone was laid on June 29, 1860, five years after Alexander and his workmen first landed at the ledge. The final cost of about $300,000 made {{it one of the most}} expensive lighthouses in United States history.|$|E

500|$|To {{prepare for}} the part of Blair, actress Leighton Meester, a natural blonde, dyed her hair brown before auditioning, and also studied the first novel. She has {{described}} the character as multi-faceted, labeling her [...] "a {{little bit of everything}} which is pretty amazing." [...] Like von Ziegesar, Meester has also claimed to relate to Blair on certain levels. Prior to the show's debut in 2007, the actress stated that, [...] "The only way to play Blair, or any character, and make her human, is to find what she is inside me. And I know <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> insecurities, too." [...] She went on to say that, [...] "The way Blair and I are not alike when it comes to insecurities is: She pays so much attention to hers!" [...] Meester's casting was described by Yahoo! as a star-making role which moved her [...] "into the pop culture vanguard," [...] while Cecily von Ziegesar has called her a perfect choice.|$|E
500|$|Discussing Cordelia's {{relationship}} with Xander, Carpenter says, [...] "A lot of Cordy's conflict, {{and a lot}} of who she is, comes out around Xander. Because she is in love with him in spite of herself, or in spite of him. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> best moments with [...]" [...] However, her character's growing involvement with Buffy and her friends caused the actress some concern; [...] "I wasn't sure how I felt about it, because I didn't want to lose my edge. I didn't want her to be nice; I didn't want her to change because that's who she is." [...] Carpenter's challenge was to find a balance between the good and bad sides of Cordelia, and she explains, [...] "That's why I enjoy playing her so much. She's got to be somewhat tolerable or why would they hang out with her? But I [...] not to lose her edge, her honesty." [...] Carpenter claims that Cordelia's [...] "rough edges" [...] made for difficult experiences with fans, who expected her to be snobby like her character. Charisma continually pleaded to get to slay a vampire, which the writers let her do in her final Buffy appearance, [...] "Graduation Day, Part Two".|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from his vacation, Saadiq started writing and recording The Way I See It, which took four months. In {{an interview for}} Sound on Sound, he discussed his comfort level when returning to Blakeslee Recording Company: [...] "The music for this album flowed organically, naturally, and since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> own studio I was able to perfect it and take my time to make it right. I was able {{to live with it}} day after day, and I think that {{had a lot to do}} with how the album turned out." [...] He wrote the songs extemporaneously, often by playing guitar and improvising riffs. He subsequently sung them while playing each instrument one at a time, including guitar, bass, and basic piano parts that he planned to include on the recordings. He attributed this secluded approach to [...] "the state of the industry" [...] and idealized [...] "bounc ideas off other people, do some writing with them, take the material to my band and say, 'OK, let's cut it,' with the orchestra already there. That's my dream. I'd crank records out weekly if I had staff writers like they did at Stax and Motown".|$|E
