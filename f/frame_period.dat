40|$|Abstract—The {{real-time}} streaming of bursty continuous media, such as variable-bit rate encoded video, to buffered clients over networks can be {{made more}} efficient by collaboratively prefetching parts of the ongoing streams into the client buffers. The existing collaborative prefetching schemes {{have been developed for}} dis-crete time models, where scheduling decisions for all ongoing streams are typically made for one <b>frame</b> <b>period</b> at a time. This leads to inefficiencies as the network bandwidth is not utilized for some duration {{at the end of the}} <b>frame</b> <b>period</b> when no video frame “fits ” into the remaining transmission capacity in the schedule. To overcome this inefficiency, we conduct in this paper an extensive study of collaborative prefetching in a continuous-time model. In the continuous-time model, video frames are transmitted contin-uously across frame periods, while making sure that frames are only transmitted if they meet their discrete playout deadlines. We specify a generic framework for continuous-time collaborative prefetching and a wide array of priority functions to be used for making scheduling decisions within the framework. We conduct an algorithm-theoretic study of the resulting continuous-time prefetching algorithms and evaluate their fairness and starvation probability performance through simulations. We find that the continuous-time prefetching algorithms give favorable fairness and starvation probability performance.

40|$|The ambient-light-canceling camera (ALCC) is a {{proposed}} near-infrared electronic camera that would utilize {{a combination of}} (1) synchronized illumination during alternate frame periods and (2) subtraction of readouts from consecutive frames to obtain images without a background component of ambient light. The ALCC is intended especially for use in tracking the motion of an eye by the pupil center corneal reflection (PCCR) method. Eye tracking by the PCCR method has shown potential for application in human-computer interaction for people with and without disabilities, and for noninvasive monitoring, detection, and even diagnosis of physiological and neurological deficiencies. In the PCCR method, an eye is illuminated by near-infrared light from a lightemitting diode (LED). Some of the infrared light is reflected {{from the surface of}} the cornea. Some of the infrared light enters the eye through the pupil and is reflected from back of the eye out through the pupil a phenomenon commonly observed as the red-eye effect in flash photography. An electronic camera is oriented to image the user's eye. The output of the camera is digitized and processed by algorithms that locate the two reflections. Then from the locations of the centers of the two reflections, the direction of gaze is computed. As described thus far, the PCCR method is susceptible to errors caused by reflections of ambient light. Although a near-infrared band-pass optical filter can be used to discriminate against ambient light, some sources of ambient light have enough in-band power to compete with the LED signal. The mode of operation of the ALCC would complement or supplant spectral filtering by providing more nearly complete cancellation of the effect of ambient light. In the operation of the ALCC, a near-infrared LED would be pulsed on during one camera <b>frame</b> <b>period</b> and off during the next <b>frame</b> <b>period.</b> Thus, the scene would be illuminated by both the LED (signal) light and the ambient (background) light during one <b>frame</b> <b>period,</b> and would be illuminated with only ambient (background) light during the next <b>frame</b> <b>period.</b> The camera output would be digitized and sent to a computer, wherein the pixel values of the background-only frame would be subtracted from the pixel values of the signal-plus-background frame to obtain signal-only pixel values (see figure). To prevent artifacts of motion from entering the images, it would be necessary to acquire image data at a rate greater than the standard video rate of 30 frames per second. For this purpose, the ALCC would exploit a novel control technique developed at NASA s Jet Propulsion Laboratory for advanced charge-coupled-device (CCD) cameras. This technique provides for readout from a subwindow [region of interest (ROI) ] within the image frame. Because the desired reflections from the eye would typically occupy a small fraction of the area within the image frame, the ROI capability would make it possible to acquire and subtract pixel values at rates of several hundred frames per second considerably greater than the standard video rate and sufficient to both (1) suppress motion artifacts and (2) track the motion of the eye between consecutive subtractive frame pairs...|$|E
