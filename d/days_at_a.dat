5|$|Kepler-10c is the {{outermost}} {{of the two}} known planets of Kepler-10, completing one orbit of the star every 45.29485 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of 0.2407 AU. The inner planet, Kepler-10b, is a rocky planet that orbits every ~0.8 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of 0.01684 AU. Kepler-10c's equilibrium temperature is estimated at 584 K, almost four times hotter than Jupiter's. The planet's orbital inclination is 89.65º, or almost edge-on with respect to Earth and to Kepler-10. Transits have been observed at points where Kepler-10c has crossed in front of its host star.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded. These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point moorings. On {{the other end of}} the journey, they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated lightering points off-coast. A supertanker's routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at sea for extended periods, up to and beyond seventy <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> time.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-10c orbits {{its host}} star every forty-five <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{quarter of the}} average {{distance}} between the Sun and Earth. It has a radius more than double that of Earth, but a higher density, suggesting a mainly rocky composition with around 5–20% ices by mass. For comparison, the Earth's oceans represent only 0.02% of our planet's mass, with an additional amount potentially a few times this stored in the mantle.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-11f is, at 2.3 {{times the}} mass of Earth, the least massive of the six planets {{discovered}} in the orbit of Kepler-11, although the planet's mass may range from 1.1 to 4.5, or from approximately that of Earth's mass to that of Kepler-10b, a rather large confidence interval. Its radius is the second smallest of the six planets discovered in the system at 2.61 times the radius of Earth. Kepler-11f has a density of about 0.7g/cm3, {{comparable to that of}} the Solar System's least dense planet, Saturn. Kepler-11f is the fifth planet from Kepler-11, orbiting its host star every 46.68876 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of 0.25 AU. Its orbital eccentricity is unknown. In comparison, Mercury orbits the Sun every 87.97 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of 0.387 AU. Kepler-11f has an orbital inclination of 89.4°; it can be seen almost edge-on with respect to Earth. Its surface equilibrium temperature is 544 K, over twice the surface equilibrium temperature of Earth and about two-thirds the surface temperature of Venus.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5b orbits {{its host}} star every 3.5485 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> mean {{distance}} of 0.05064 AU.

5|$|As the American {{troops were}} {{attempting}} to destroy Shōji's force, Vandegrift ordered Carlson's raiders to march overland from Aola Bay toward Koli Point to cut off any of Shōji's forces that escaped the encirclement attempt. On 5 November, two transport ships headed for Espiritu Santo to pick up three companies from Carlson's battalion while Carlson prepared his two companies already on Guadalcanal to march overland towards Koli Point. Carlson arranged for rear echelon personnel at Aola to resupply his patrol with rations every four <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> prearranged point on the coast. A patrol with native carriers would meet the boat and manpack the supplies inland to Carlson's patrol base.|$|E
5|$|Eta Hydri is {{the other}} optical double, {{composed}} of Eta1 and Eta2. Eta1 is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B9V that was suspected of being variable, and is located just over 700 light-years away. Eta2 has a magnitude of 4.7 and is a yellow giant star of spectral type G8.5III around 218 light-years distant, which has evolved off the main sequence and is expanding and cooling {{on its way to}} becoming a red giant. Calculations of its mass indicate it was most likely a white A-type main sequence star for most of its existence, around twice the mass of our Sun. A planet, Eta2 Hydri b, greater than 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter was discovered in 2005, orbiting around Eta2 every 711 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of 1.93 astronomical units (AU).|$|E
5|$|Fuller, however, was {{confident}} {{in his work}} {{and the idea that}} the film would be strongly anti-racist, particularly with the changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 3634 b (commonly {{shortened}} to GJ 3634 b) is a super-Earth exoplanet in {{the orbit}} of the nearby red dwarf Gliese 3634 at approximately 64.5 light-years in constellation Hydra. The planet is approximately eight times the mass of Earth, and orbits its star every {{two and a half}} <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of 0.0287 AU. The planet was the first to be discovered by a group of astronomers searching for exoplanets in {{the orbit of}} very-low-mass stars after the team reorganized their strategy, choosing to search for targets that they could also confirm using the transit method. However, a transit event associated with Gliese 3634 b was not detected. The planet's discovery was published in Astronomy and Astrophysics on February 8, 2011.|$|E
5|$|HD 205739 b is a Jupiter-size planet. The {{estimated}} minimum mass is 1.37 {{times the}} mass of Jupiter. The planet {{has been found to}} orbit its host star every 279.8 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of 0.896 AU, which is approximately 89.6% of the mean distance between the Sun and the Earth. HD 205739 b has a mildly elliptical orbit, given its orbital eccentricity of 0.27. The planet's elliptical orbit is typical with respect to discovered planets whose orbits are longer than twenty days and have not grown circular because of tidal forces. According to its discoverers, HD 205739 b's elongated orbit causes its surface temperature to fluctuate by up to 100 K.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 a {{paper was}} {{published}} that hypothesised {{the existence of}} a binary nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Hale–Bopp's dust emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30km, with the main nucleus being about 70km across, and would orbit in about three <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of about 180km. This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.|$|E

Kepler-11g orbits Kepler-11 every 118.37774 days (over 2.5 {{times that of}} the fifth planet from Kepler-11, Kepler-11f) at a distance of 0.462 AU, almost half of the distance from which Earth orbits the Sun. Its eccentricity is unknown. In comparison, planet Mercury orbits the Sun every 87.97 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> distance of 0.387 AU.

5|$|Kepler-40b is {{the first}} (and only) planet {{discovered}} {{so far in the}} orbit of Kepler-40. It has a mass that is 2.2 times that of Jupiter's, the rough equivalent of 700 Earths. The planet also has a radius that is 1.17 times that of Jupiter and a density of 1.68grams/cm3. Kepler-40b has an equilibrium temperature of 1620 K, over six times hotter than the equilibrium temperature of Earth.

5|$|Kepler-5b {{is one of}} {{the first}} five planets {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. It is a Hot Jupiter that orbits a subgiant star that is more massive, larger, and more diffuse than the Sun is. Kepler-5 was first flagged as the location of a possibly transiting planet, and was reclassified as a Kepler Object of Interest until follow-up observations confirmed the planet's existence and many of its characteristics. The planet's discovery was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010. The planet has approximately twice the mass of Jupiter, and is about 1.5 times larger.
