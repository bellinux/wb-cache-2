5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized {{one of the things that}} made <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E

5|$|From the {{coronation}} of Henry IV in 1399 the full ceremonies were restricted to major royal occasions such as coronations, investitures of the Prince of Wales or Royal dukes, and royal weddings, and the knights so created {{became known as}} <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bath. Knights Bachelor continued to be created with the simpler form of ceremony. The last occasion on which <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bath were created was {{the coronation}} of Charles II in 1661.|$|E

5|$|<b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nine is {{identical}} to the gameplay of Oblivion; the basic design, maneuvers, and interfaces remain unchanged. As such, it is a fantasy-based role-playing adventure game. Players begin Oblivion by defining their character; deciding on its skill set, specialization, physical features, and race. <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nine is an example of open-ended-style gameplay: the main quest may be delayed or completely ignored as the player explores the game world, follows side quests, interacts with NPCs, and develops a character according to their taste. Furthering the goal of open-ended gameplay, <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nine, unlike Bethesda's prior content packs for Oblivion, begins with no explicit prodding towards the newly introduced content; players must seek out and find the game's quest without external aid.|$|E

5|$|<b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic II was {{developed}} by Obsidian Entertainment and published by LucasArts. It is the sequel to BioWare's <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic, and it uses the same Odyssey Engine as the original game. BioWare suggested that Obsidian should be offered the <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic license due to their familiarity with Obsidian's past work and the good {{relationship between the two}} developers, as well as due to finding LucasArts' development schedule for the sequel to be too tight. The game was released in PC and Xbox versions, but due to the Xbox version being released two months prior to the PC version, it has multiple unfixed bugs.|$|E
5|$|Later, Jon gathers {{the various}} Northern lords, the <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vale, and the Free Folk {{to plan for}} the fight against the White Walkers.

5|$|The combat was {{generally}} well-received, with some reviewers noting {{that it is}} mostly unchanged from the original <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic. GameSpot compared the combat from the first <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic to the second, saying that it isn't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous. GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic to the second, but {{that this is a}} good thing since the combat in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, saying that it is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members. GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic.|$|E
5|$|A Union soldier named Robinson {{was shot}} in July or August 1864 near Raven Creek, a {{tributary}} of Fishing Creek.

5|$|About {{the same}} time Nobel Prize-winner Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote the novel The <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cross (Polish: Krzyżacy), {{prominently}} featuring the battle {{in one of the}} chapters. In 1960 Polish filmmaker Aleksander Ford used the book as the basis for his film, <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Teutonic Order. A museum, monuments and memorials were constructed at the battlefield in 1960. The battle site is one of Poland's official, national Historic Monuments, as designated October 4, 2010, and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland. The battle has lent its name to military decorations (Cross of Grunwald), sports teams (BC Žalgiris, FK Žalgiris), and various organizations.|$|E

5|$|When Obsidian were {{preparing}} to present <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic II at E3 2004, they tried to fit {{as much information as}} they could, saying that it would need to be a duration of 30 minutes as it was the only E3 event it would be showcased at; however, due to the limited time frame, they would have to cut it down to a five- to ten-minute presentation. During this time, none of the levels Obsidian designed were ready to be shown, so they picked three levels, and put them through a schedule to finish them on time. The demo was finished {{a few days before the}} event, and the game was presented in May 2004. The first trailer for <b>Knights</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Republic II was later unveiled in July 2004, and the official website was launched in October.|$|E
