5|$|Anwar {{is thought}} to have been based on the poet Chairil Anwar, an individualistic anarchist known for being abrasive, having <b>kleptomania,</b> and womanizing. The poet's friend Nasjah Djamin notes that the {{characterization}} captured the real-life Anwar's nonchalance, impoliteness, and arrogance.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Sam Catlin and {{directed}} by filmmaker David Slade, marking his first time directing for television. It featured guest appearances by Nigel Gibbs and stand-up comedian Bill Burr, the latter of whom specifically sought {{to appear on the}} show. The footage shown from the first-person perspective of Gus' camera is actual footage from the real camera. Marie's return to the <b>kleptomania</b> she demonstrated in the first season was conceived early during brainstorming sessions for the third season.|$|E
5|$|Sharon dates Phyllis' ex, Jack Abbott, {{and they}} {{eventually}} marry. Phyllis discovers Sharon's affair with Brad, and blackmails her. During a cliffside photo shoot Phyllis threatens to tell Jack about the affair, triggering a fight. Sharon {{and her best}} friend Drucilla Winters (Victoria Rowell) fall from the cliff, and Drucilla dies. Sharon is found apparently dead, but she is revived. Nick is later presumed dead after his plane crashes; he returns with amnesia (thinking he is still married to Sharon), regains his memory and returns to Phyllis. Jack, Phyllis, Nick and Sharon develop a magazine, Restless Style; however, clashes among the four drive Jack and Sharon from the company. In October 2008, Sharon and Nick meet in Paris; they kiss on a bridge, and Phyllis sees them. Sharon divorces Jack because his dishonesty; she and Nick make love at the Abbott cabin. Confused, Sharon spirals out of control; she develops <b>kleptomania</b> and has a brief affair with Jack's brother, Billy (Billy Miller). Sharon becomes pregnant; Nick goes back and forth between her and Phyllis, choosing Phyllis when Sharon lies about Jack being the father of the child. After being arrested for larceny a second time, Sharon checks herself into Fairview sanitarium (a psychiatric hospital) when her <b>kleptomania</b> becomes uncontrollable. She gives birth to a baby girl, Faith, who is stolen by Adam Newman (Nick's brother) and given to Jack's sister Ashley (Eileen Davidson) after he caused her miscarriage and hysterical pregnancy. Believing her baby is dead, Sharon grows close to Adam (who bonds with her out of guilt). Sharon and Adam are married, but when the truth about Faith is revealed the marriage ends. Several months later, Sharon shoots Adam when he tries to visit her at the Abbott cabin (mistaking him for a burglar); he survives. Nick and Sharon briefly reunite, but break up again when she cheats on him with Adam (who follows her to New Orleans).|$|E
25|$|In the U.S. the {{presence}} of <b>kleptomania</b> is unknown but has been estimated at 6 per 1000 individuals. <b>Kleptomania</b> is also {{thought to be the}} cause of 5% of annual shoplifting in the U.S. If true, 100,000 arrests are made in the U.S. annually due to kleptomaniac behavior.|$|E

25|$|In Paris, Petiot {{attracted}} {{patients with}} fake credentials and built an impressive reputation for his practice at 66 Rue de Caumartin. However, {{there were rumors}} of illegal abortions and excessive prescriptions of addictive remedies. In 1936, he was appointed médecin d'état-civil, with authority to write death certificates. The same year, he was briefly institutionalized for <b>kleptomania,</b> but was released the following year. He still persisted in tax evasion.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Sharon {{suffers from}} <b>kleptomania</b> (an impulse-control disorder), {{causing her to}} steal items from people and stores. As a result, she is forced to admit herself into a {{psychiatric}} hospital while she is pregnant. Case told TV Guide that all the character's [...] "craziness" [...] made sense; she welcomed the challenge to decide how functional Sharon appears to viewers and got into debates with directors. Michael Fairman noted that Sharon is [...] "acting so bizarre". Case said her breakdown was due (in part) to Brad Carlton's death and the breakdown in her marriage to Jack; each time Sharon mapped out her life, it is [...] "torn to pieces". Sharon has since experienced periodic <b>kleptomania.</b>|$|E
500|$|Despite {{her second}} {{marriage}} to (and divorce from) Jack Abbott, Nick and Sharon {{had an affair}} and conceived a third child: Faith. During the pregnancy, Sharon experienced <b>kleptomania.</b> Faith was kidnapped by Adam Newman, Nick's brother, leading Sharon to believe she had died. When Adam's crimes were revealed and Faith was returned to Sharon, she remained in love with him; SoapNet considered the relationship [...] "dark". Since 2011, former showrunner Maria Arena Bell and subsequent head writers that followed have significantly changed the character's direction, receiving negative backlash from critics and audiences. Sharon married her ex-father-in-law Victor Newman, gained control of his company (Newman Enterprises) and burned down his ranch—a sequence of events which resulted in her being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The character was then involved in a DNA test alteration storyline, which was also heavily criticized by critics.|$|E
500|$|Scott Ellis of the Sydney Morning Herald {{television}} magazine stated that, even {{compared to}} the slightly surreal standards of most soap operas, Carmella has [...] "been through a wringer". He {{made a point of}} the many storylines that transformed the character: [...] "A former party girl turned nun, Carmella has been stalked, slapped, scalded, scarred and even sold a baby. She's found and lost love at least three times, given birth, fought a custody battle, fought <b>kleptomania,</b> and fought various members of her family." [...] In the same vein, The Daily Telegraph praised Carmella's versatility in going from [...] "baby peddler to nun, before suffering severe facial burns that required re-constructive surgery." [...] Inside Soap opined that 2008 for Carmella was [...] "tragedy after tragedy". What's on TV deemed Carmella's scalding with boiling water her most explosive scene, and the Daily Record called it karma for selling Teresa's baby.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} Gus {{installing}} a surveillance camera into the meth lab {{stemmed from the}} idea of Walter and Gus employing what Gilligan called [...] "brinkmanship and gamesmanship" [...] against each other after their falling {{out at the end of}} the third season. Gilligan commented: [...] "What's one way Gus can amp up the story there? How can he mess with Walt's head a little bit?" [...] The footage shown from the first-person perspective of the camera is actual footage from the real camera, including the numbers shown at the top and bottom of the screen. This is why that shot is shown in pillarbox and in lower quality than the rest of the episode, which was shot in 35 mm film. The episode features a subplot with Marie engaging in acts of <b>kleptomania,</b> which had been a major part of her character during the first season. Catlin said it was conceived early on that Marie would act this way while brainstorming the ideas for Marie coping with Hank's difficult recovery. Gilligan described Marie's acts of stealing as a respite for her: [...] "She's looking for another life, but she's not actively ready to leave her husband or anything like that. ... We liked the quirkiness of it." [...] Betsy Brandt said [...] "Open House" [...] was her favorite episode of the season to shoot.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, after Victor disappears {{following}} his wedding to Sharon, she realizes {{she must be}} married to Victor for more than eight days to obtain his money. She then burns their prenuptial agreement after Nikki sends her a text from Victor's phone saying he has left her. Sharon decides to run his company (Newman Enterprises) in his absence. Case thought a scene where Sharon crashed a Newman board meeting was fun and different, confessing that {{she had wanted to}} play [...] "this version of Sharon for years". As Victor's proxy she became CEO of the company, secretly aided by manipulative businessman Tucker McCall (Stephen Nichols). The stock price for Newman drops (with Tucker secretly buying stock). Case hoped the writers wouldn't go the typical route, where Victor would return and [...] "wreak havoc on everyone". Sharon was labeled [...] "Newman's Grim Reaper" [...] by the media of Genoa City, leaving Nick and Victoria to regain the company from her clutches. They demonstrate her history of <b>kleptomania</b> to a court judge, forcing her to return to the psychiatric hospital for an evaluation (which she passes); she then returns to her position as CEO. Case called Sharon's return a [...] "fun aspect of the story". Sharon continued to behave out of character; when she discovers that Victor is alive, she tells everyone he died after identifying a burnt body which was not his (Case said that Sharon took advantage of the situation). At Victor's funeral Sharon wears white, nearly marrying Tucker afterwards. Victor then returns, expelling Sharon from his family, home and company. Despite her crimes, Sharon avoids prison. At this point, Aaron Hagey-MacKay of GlobalTV stated that Sharon was [...] "crazy".|$|E
500|$|Following the character's {{diagnosis}} with bipolar disorder, her switching Summer's {{paternity test}} was heavily criticized by critics, {{who felt that}} the character still had not been repaired. About.com listed the paternity twist {{as one of the}} worst storylines of 2013 on the soap opera. Mental health advocate Arthur Gallant of The Huffington Post commended the show's initial portrayal of Sharon's bipolar disorder, writing: [...] "I praise the writers for their diligence in how mental illness has been depicted and feel the show has done their part in helping to eliminate mental health stigma." [...] Sara Bibel of Xfinity slammed Josh Griffith's writing, stating that he [...] "undid all his great work rehabilitating the character of Sharon" [...] in a [...] "character-destroying" [...] storyline. Garrett (writing for Highlight Hollywood this time) was livid with then-executive producer Jill Farren Phelps, who he labeled as a female misogynist, and strongly opposed to Sharon being turned into a villain [...] "with no good reason". Soap Opera Digest named the character of Sharon as the [...] "Most Ruined" [...] soap opera character in both 2012 and 2013, while in turn praising the performance of Case. In December 2014, Daytime Confidential described Sharon {{as one of the most}} [...] "drastically damaged" [...] characters in the history of the soap opera genre, and wrote, [...] "You name it, one head writer or another has had her do it. <b>Kleptomania.</b> Three baby daddies. Bipolar disorder. It was almost like a reward was passed out in the Y writing room anytime anyone came up with something more awful to have Sharon do." [...] Giddens criticized Charles Pratt Jr. in 2015 for enjoying writing Sharon as [...] "crazy", [...] "despite legions of fans demanding the bipolar character be given back her dignity". Writing for TV Insider, Michael Logan said in 2016 that fans of the character were tired of seeing her written as [...] "the liar, the villain, the nutcase, the doormat".|$|E
2500|$|The role of impulsivity in the ICDs varies. [...] Research on <b>kleptomania</b> and {{pyromania}} are lacking, {{though there}} is some evidence that greater <b>kleptomania</b> severity is tied to poor executive functioning.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of <b>kleptomania,</b> the {{cognitive}} behaviour techniques used in these cases consists of covert sensitization, imaginal desensitization, systematic desensitization, aversion therapy, relaxation training, and [...] "alternative sources of satisfaction".|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Dr. Richard Castillo, as {{quoted by}} Dr. C. George Boeree, {{believes}} that amok (with very similar symptoms to grisi siknis), pibloktoq, latah, [...] "falling out", [...] "indisposition", and the [...] "fits" [...] are all related to impulse control disorders, {{and thus are}} associated with trichotillomania, compulsive gambling, pyromania, and <b>kleptomania</b> in Western medicine.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{specific}} {{conditions that are}} widely considered anti-social, or tend to result in illegal activity, such as <b>kleptomania,</b> pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, etc. are excluded under the definition of [...] "disability" [...] {{in order to prevent}} abuse of the statute's purpose. Additionally, other {{specific conditions}}, such as gender identity disorders, are also excluded under the definition of [...] "disability".|$|E
2500|$|Behavioral {{interventions}} {{also have}} a fairly strong evidence base in impulse control disorders. In ADHD, the behavioral interventions of behavioral parent training, behavioral classroom management, and intensive peer-focused behavioral interventions in recreational settings meet stringent guidelines qualifying them for evidence based treatment status. In addition, a recent meta-analysis of evidence-based ADHD treatment found organization training to be a well-established treatment method. Empirically validated behavioral treatments for substance use disorder are fairly similar across substance use disorders, and include behavioral couples therapy, CBT, contingency management, motivational enhancement therapy, and relapse prevention. [...] Pyromania and <b>kleptomania</b> are understudied (due {{in large part to}} the illegality of the behaviors), though there is some evidence that psychotherapeutic interventions (CBT, short term counseling, day treatment programs) are efficacious in treating pyromania, while <b>kleptomania</b> seems to be best impacted using SSRIs. [...] Additionally, therapies including CBT, family therapy, and social skill training have shown positive effects on explosive aggressive behaviors.|$|E
2500|$|An American physician, Beard, {{described}} [...] "neurasthenia" [...] in 1869. German neurologist Westphal, {{coined the}} term [...] "obsessional neurosis" [...] now termed obsessive-compulsive disorder, and agoraphobia. Alienists created a whole new series of diagnoses that highlighted single, impulsive behavior, such as <b>kleptomania,</b> dipsomania, pyromania, and nymphomania. The diagnosis of drapetomania was also developed in the Southern United States to explain the perceived irrationality of black slaves trying to escape what {{was thought to be}} a suitable role.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{side effect}} of these characteristics, kender can be {{difficult}} to play within the role-playing game, as their lack of interest in monetary gain is [...] "a virtual anathema" [...] to the manner in which characters of many other races are typically portrayed. It was recommended in The Mists of Krynn that kender be employed as non-player characters, with their <b>kleptomania</b> providing a convenient means for those running the game to introduce objects at critical times.|$|E
2500|$|Lott {{generally}} {{pursued a}} conservative position {{in politics and}} was a noted social conservative. For instance, in 1998, Lott caused some controversy in Congress when as a guest on the Armstrong Williams television show, he equated homosexuality with alcoholism, <b>kleptomania</b> and sex addiction. When Williams, a conservative talk show host, asked Lott whether homosexuality is a sin, Lott simply replied, [...] "Yes, it is." [...] Lott's stance against homosexuality was disconcerting to liberal Democratic Party elected officials and the Human Rights Campaign Fund, an advocacy group for gay rights.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} there are students who have a pathological urge to cheat. The writer Thomas Mallon noted that many scholars had found plagiarism in literature (Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Charles Reade being two notable examples) to often be perpetrated in a way similar to <b>kleptomania</b> (a psychological disease associated with uncontrollable stealing, {{even when it is}} against the interests of the thief). On the other hand, Mallon concludes it is probable that most [...] "cheaters" [...] make a rational choice to commit academic misconduct. A common reason for unethical behavior is the desire to [...] "gain a competitive advantage in the race for position or power".|$|E
2500|$|A single manic episode, in {{the absence}} of {{secondary}} causes, (i.e., substance use disorder, pharmacologic, general medical condition) is sufficient to diagnose bipolar I disorder. Hypomania may be indicative of bipolar II disorder. [...] Manic episodes are often complicated by delusions and/or hallucinations; should the psychotic features persist for a duration significantly longer than the episode of mania (two weeks or more), a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is more appropriate. Certain of [...] "obsessive-compulsive spectrum" [...] disorders as well as impulse control disorders share the name [...] "mania," [...] namely, <b>kleptomania,</b> pyromania, and trichotillomania. Despite the unfortunate association implied by the name, however, no connection exists between mania or bipolar disorder and these disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Impulse control {{disorder}} (ICDs) are a {{class of}} DSM diagnoses that do not fall into the other diagnostic categories of the manual (e.g. substance use disorders), and that are characterized by extreme difficulty controlling impulses or urges despite negative consequences. [...] Individuals suffering from an impulse control disorder frequently experience five stages of symptoms: compelling urge or desire, failure to resist the urge, {{a heightened sense of}} arousal, succumbing to the urge (which usually yields relief from tension), and potential remorse or feelings of guilt after the behavior is completed. Specific disorders included within this category include intermittent explosive disorder, <b>kleptomania,</b> pathological gambling, pyromania, trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder), and impulse control disorders not otherwise specified (ICD NOS). ICD NOS includes other significant difficulties that seem to be related to impulsivity but do not meet the criteria for a specific DSM diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing {{from her}} studies in {{computer}} addiction, Maressa Orzack {{moved on to}} look at internet addiction. In her research, she again likened the addiction to alcoholism, and through studies of cases of extreme internet addiction, learned {{the severity of the}} matter. Included in the cases she encountered was where a male who had become heavily addicted to the Internet, resulting in him quitting his graduate degree, leaving his wife and ignoring friends. Although she did not consider Internet addiction to be a recognizable disorder, Orzack felt that it could eventually be categorized as an impulse control disorder in a similar way to <b>kleptomania,</b> compulsive shopping and compulsive gambling. Orzack documented the effects of internet addiction, with withdrawal, loss of control, and compulsive behavior being some of them. She also described that one in ten people become addicted to the internet, with the figure being compared to that of gambling and alcohol addiction. Many of her patients were later referred to a psychiatrist for prescriptions for antidepressant and antianxiety medication. Orzack believed that treatment for internet addiction should be carried out without the aid of computers, and argued that computer-based treatment would be like [...] "having an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in a bar".|$|E
2500|$|By the {{conclusion}} of this first run of leucotomies in February 1936, Moniz and Lima had operated on twenty patients with an average period of one week between each procedure; Moniz published his findings with great haste in March of the same year. The patients were aged between 27 and 62 years of age; twelve were female and eight were male. Nine of the patients were diagnosed as suffering from depression, six from schizophrenia, two from panic disorder, and one each from mania, catatonia and manic-depression with the most prominent symptoms being anxiety and agitation. The duration of the illness prior to the procedure varied from as little as four weeks {{to as much as}} 22 years, although all but four had been ill for at least one year. Patients were normally operated on the day they arrived at Moniz's clinic and returned within ten days to the Miguel Bombarda Mental Hospital. A perfunctory post-operative follow-up assessment took place anywhere from one to ten weeks following surgery. Complications were observed in each of the leucotomy patients and included: [...] "increased temperature, vomiting, bladder and bowel incontinence, diarrhea, and ocular affections such as ptosis and nystagmus, as well as psychological effects such as apathy, akinesia, lethargy, timing and local disorientation, <b>kleptomania,</b> and abnormal sensations of hunger". Moniz asserted that these effects were transitory and, according to his published assessment, the outcome for these first twenty patients was that 35%, or seven cases, improved significantly, another 35% were somewhat improved and the remaining 30% (six cases) were unchanged. There were no deaths and he did not consider that any patients had deteriorated following leucotomy.|$|E
2500|$|Poirot {{is leaving}} the London Underground at Piccadilly Circus when he passes an old acquaintance, the Countess Vera Rossakoff, on the escalators, going in the {{opposite}} direction. She insists that they meet and when asked to suggest a place, responds [...] "In Hell…"! Poirot is puzzled {{but it is the}} unflappable Miss Lemon who coolly informs him it is the name of a new London nightclub and books him a table for that night. The club is in a basement and is decorated in styles of hell as represented by different cultures. It even has a large black, vicious-looking hound at the entrance called Cerberus. Rossakoff introduces him to Professor Liskeard who advised her on the decorations (although he is ashamed of the gaudy results), and to Dr Alice Cunningham, a practitioner of psychology who is engaged to Rossakoff's son, currently working in America. Alice and Poirot do not get along. She is coldly interested in criminal tendencies and finds Rossakoff's <b>kleptomania</b> interesting, but to Poirot's chagrin, she does not seem at all interested in the legendary detective! His questioning of her manner of dress with her heavy coat and pocketed skirt instead of a more feminine style of clothing does not go down well. However, Alice does find an individual called Paul Varesco fascinating. He is a good-looking lounge lizard with a very dubious reputation and she spends time dancing with him, questioning him incessantly about incidents in his childhood which could have contributed to his personality. Poirot recognises a young Scotland Yard detective in the crowd in evening dress and feels that something is going on...|$|E
60|$|He was so amiable {{next morning}} that Mr. Bodfish, {{who was trying}} to explain to Mrs. Negget the {{difference}} between theft and <b>kleptomania,</b> spoke before him freely. The ex-constable defined <b>kleptomania</b> as a sort of amiable weakness found chiefly among the upper circles, and cited the case of a lady of title whose love of diamonds, combined with great hospitality, was a source of much embarrassment to her guests.|$|E
6000|$|... "So stock-improving," [...] {{continued}} Dr. Cyrus Pym, [...] "so {{fraught with}} real high hopes of the future. Science therefore regards thieves, in the abstract, {{just as it}} regards murderers. It regards them not as sinners to be punished for an arbitrary period, but as patients to be detained and cared for," [...] (his first two digits closed again as he hesitated)--"in short, for the required period. But there is something special in the case we investigate here. <b>Kleptomania</b> commonly con-joins itself--" ...|$|E
60|$|After some time, however, he was reluctantly {{compelled}} {{to give up}} the search, for the bell rang for dinner, and he always lunched, as did many of the masters, in the Great Hall. During the course of the meal he exercised his brains without pause in the effort to discover a fitting suspect. Did he know of any victim of <b>kleptomania</b> in the School? No, he was sorry to say he did not. Was anybody in urgent need of money? He could not say. Very probably yes, but he had no means of knowing.|$|E
6000|$|Insanity {{certainly}} {{is on the}} increase in the world, and crime is dying out. There are no longer any murders--none worth mentioning, at any rate. Formerly, if you killed a man, it was possible that you were insane--but now, if you, having friends and money, kill a man, it is evidence that you are a lunatic. In these days, too, if a person of good family and high social standing steals anything, they call it <b>kleptomania,</b> and send him to the lunatic asylum. If a person of high standing squanders his fortune in dissipation, and closes his career with strychnine or a bullet, [...] "Temporary Aberration" [...] is what was the trouble with him.|$|E
60|$|Our youth has now {{reached the}} {{flowering}} season of life, that brief May {{time when the}} whole world takes on the rose-tint, and when by all dramatic laws he ought to fall in love. He does nothing of the kind. Sad to say, he is a stranger to the feeling. Love, as we understand the word, is a thing unknown to the Far East; fortunately, indeed, for the possession there of the tender passion would be worse than useless. Its indulgence would work no end of disturbance to the community at large, beside entailing much misery upon its individual victim. Its exercise would probably be classed with <b>kleptomania</b> and other like excesses of purely personal consideration. The community could never permit the practice, for it strikes at the very root of their whole social system.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait! Hear me out. Though I {{have said}} nothing to you before, or to anyone else, {{concerning}} the matter, {{the fact remains that}} during the past few weeks a number of objects--some valuable, others not--have disappeared in this house. The conclusion to which one is irresistibly impelled {{is that we have a}} kleptomaniac in our midst. It is a peculiarity of <b>kleptomania,</b> as you are no doubt aware, that the subject is unable to differentiate between the intrinsic values of objects. He will purloin an old coat as readily as a diamond ring, or a tobacco pipe costing but a few shillings with the same eagerness as a purse of gold. The fact that this manuscript of mine could be of no possible value to any outside person convinces me that----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If Mr. Moon {{will have}} patience," [...] said Pym with dignity, [...] "he {{will find that}} this was the very point to which my {{exposition}} was di-rected. <b>Kleptomania,</b> I say, exhibits itself as a kind of physical attraction to certain defined materials; and it has been held (by no less a man than Harris) that this is the ultimate explanation of the strict specialism and vurry narrow professional outlook of most criminals. One will have an irresistible physical impulsion towards pearl sleeve-links, while he passes over the most elegant and celebrated diamond sleeve-links, placed about in the most conspicuous locations. Another will impede his flight with no less than forty-seven buttoned boots, while elastic-sided boots leave him cold, and even sarcastic. The specialism of the criminal, I repeat, is a mark rather of insanity than of any brightness of business habits; but there is one kind of depredator to whom this principle is at first sight hard to apply. I allude to our fellow-citizen the housebreaker.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was about}} an hour later. Dr. Cyrus Pym had {{remained}} for an unprecedented time {{with his eyes closed}} and his thumb and finger in the air. It almost seemed {{as if he had been}} [...] "struck so," [...] as the nurses say; and in the deathly silence Michael Moon felt forced to relieve the strain with some remark. For the last half-hour or so the eminent criminologist had been explaining that science took the same view of offences against property as it did of offences against life. [...] "Most murder," [...] he had said, [...] "is a variation of homicidal mania, and in the same way most theft is a version of <b>kleptomania.</b> I cannot entertain any doubt that my learned friends opposite adequately con-ceive how this must involve a scheme of punishment more tol'rant and humane than the cruel methods of ancient codes. They will doubtless exhibit consciousness of a chasm so eminently yawning, so thought-arresting, so--" [...] It was here that he paused and indulged in the delicate gesture to which allusion has been made; and Michael could bear it no longer.|$|E
6000|$|... 'His {{advice is}} the same as that which, as I {{mentioned}} this afternoon, Levine gave when I told him of the circumstances, and which I have no doubt he will repeat when he has further thought the matter over, namely, that unless we can obtain some evidence to support your denial, we have no chance of obtaining a verdict if we go into court. Danvers says that, of course, to those who know you, the idea of your taking these diamonds is absolutely preposterous; still, as the jury will not know you, and the public who read the report will not know you, they can only go by the evidence. He says that trying to {{look at it as a}} stranger, his opinion would be that it was an extraordinary case, but that unless we believed thoroughly that you had not taken the things, we should never have taken so hopeless a case into court. Still, he thinks that the verdict of those who only look at the outside of things would be that the denial was almost worse than the act. Had it not been for the unfortunate rumours previously circulated, many people might be of opinion that it was a case of <b>kleptomania,</b> and that no woman in her senses would have thus openly carried the things away from a place where she was well known.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was coming}} {{the other day}} along a great valley road that strikes out of the westland {{counties}} about Glasgow, more or less towards {{the east and the}} widening of the Forth. It may, for all I know (I amused myself with the fancy), be the way along which Wallace came with his crude army, when he gave battle before Stirling Brig; and, in the midst of mediaeval diplomacies, made a new nation possible. Anyhow, the romantic quality of Scotland rolled all about me, as much in the last reek of Glasgow as in the first rain upon the hills. The tall factory chimneys seemed trying to be taller than the mountain peaks; as if this landscape were full (as its history has been full) of the very madness of ambition. The wageslavery we live in is a wicked thing. But there is nothing in which the Scotch are more piercing and poetical, I might say more perfect, than in their Scotch wickedness. It is what makes the Master of Ballantrae the most thrilling of all fictitious villains. It is what makes the Master of Lovat the most thrilling of all historical villains. It is poetry. It is an intensity which is on the edge of madness or (what is worse) magic. Well, the Scotch have managed to apply something of this fierce romanticism even to the lowest of all lordships and serfdoms; the proletarian inequality of today. You do meet now and then, in Scotland, the man you never meet anywhere else but in novels; I mean the self-made man; the hard, insatiable man, merciless to himself as well as to others. It is not [...] "enterprise"; it is <b>kleptomania.</b> He is quite mad, and a much more obvious public pest than any other kind of kleptomaniac; but though he is a cheat, he is not an illusion. He does exist; I have met quite two of him. Him alone among modern merchants we do not weakly flatter when we call him a bandit. Something of the irresponsibility of the true dark ages really clings about him. Our scientific civilisation is not a civilisation; it is a smoke nuisance. Like smoke it is choking us; like smoke it will pass away. Only of one or two Scotsmen, in my experience, was it true that where there is smoke there is fire.|$|E
