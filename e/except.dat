50|$|One {{key factor}} {{concerning}} the <b>excepted</b> service is that employees have fewer appeal rights (compared to {{positions in the}} competitive service) {{in the event of}} disciplinary actions or job termination. For example, non-veteran employees in the <b>excepted</b> service are generally barred from appealing adverse agency personnel decisions to the United States Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or to the Federal courts for their first two years of employment, whereas employees in the competitive service have a one-year probationary period. <b>Excepted</b> service agencies have consistently claimed that they need the speed and flexibility afforded by being in the <b>excepted</b> service in order to perform their missions and maintain good order and discipline.|$|R

50|$|Some {{charities}} {{which are}} called exempt charities {{are not required}} to register with the Charity Commission and are not subject to any of the Charity Commission's supervisory powers.

The regulations on <b>excepted</b> charities have however been changed by the Charities Act 2006. Many <b>excepted</b> charities are religious charities.|$|R

50|$|Most {{civilian}} {{positions in}} the federal government of the United States are part of the competitive service, where applicants must compete with other applicants in open competition under the merit system administered by the Office of Personnel Management. However, some agencies (and some positions within other agencies) are excluded from these provisions. Although they primarily operate on a merit basis also, they have their own hiring systems and evaluation criteria. These agencies are called <b>excepted</b> service agencies and such positions are part of the <b>excepted</b> civil service. The primary common denominator of many of these agencies and positions is that they have national security and/or intelligence functions, such as the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of State, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, NCIS and the Secret Service. Attorney positions, Presidential Management Fellows, Presidential Innovation Fellows, and Foreign Service positions are examples of positions <b>excepted</b> across-the-board in all Federal agencies. Not all <b>excepted</b> service members serve in sensitive areas—for example, teachers and administrators at DOD schools, both in the U.S. and overseas, are also <b>excepted,</b> as are all patent examiners. In addition, most employees in the legislative branch of the federal government are <b>excepted</b> service employees.|$|R
