5|$|A <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a {{tapered hole}} drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|A {{patented}} (Patent published 1867) type of fireproof safe uses a <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> to douse {{its contents}} with water if the external temperature gets too high.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} design {{was a simple}} solid plug filled with a slug of low-melting-point alloy. When this melts, it first melts as a narrow channel through the plug. Steam and water immediately begins to escape through this. The cored <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> {{was developed in the}} 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as the alloy softens. This version has a solid brass or bronze centre, soldered into place by a layer of the low-melting-point alloy. When overheated, the plug does not release any steam or water until the alloy melts sufficiently to release the centre plug. The plug now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely to be noticed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fusible</b> <b>plugs</b> {{are common}} in {{aircraft}} wheels, typically in larger or high-performance aircraft. The very large thermal loads imposed by abnormal landing and braking conditions (and RTO notably) can cause already high pressure in the tyres {{to rise to the}} point that the tyre might burst, so <b>fusible</b> <b>plugs</b> are used as a relief mechanism. The vented gas may be directed to cool the braking surfaces.|$|R
5|$|Automobile air {{conditioning}} systems were commonly fitted with <b>fusible</b> <b>plugs,</b> operating at 100–110°C, but from concerns about the environmental effects of any released refrigerant gas this function has {{been taken over by}} an electrical switch.|$|R
25|$|During operation, the boiler's {{water level}} is {{constantly}} monitored, normally via a transparent tube {{referred to as}} a sight glass, or with a gauge. Maintaining a proper water level is central to the efficient and safe operation of the boiler. If the water level is too high, steam production is decreased, efficiency is lost and in extreme cases, water will be carried out with the steam into the cylinders, possibly causing mechanical damage. More seriously, if the water level gets too low, the crown (top) and/or side sheets of the firebox may become exposed. Without sufficient water to absorb the heat of combustion, the firebox sheets may soften and melt, with the possible result of high-pressure steam being ejected with tremendous force through the firebox and into the locomotive's cab. The development of the <b>fusible</b> <b>plug,</b> a device to release pressure in conditions of excessively high temperature and low water levels was intended to protect against this occurrence.|$|E
500|$|A <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> {{operates}} as a safety valve when dangerous temperatures, rather than dangerous pressures, are reached in a closed vessel. In steam engines [...] the <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> is screwed into the crown sheet (the top plate) of the firebox, typically extending about an inch (25mm) into the water space above. Its purpose is {{to act as a}} last-resort safety device in the event of the water level falling dangerously low: when the top of the plug is out of the water it overheats, the low-melting-point core melts away and the resulting noisy release of steam into the firebox serves to warn the operators of the danger before the top of the firebox itself runs completely dry, which could result in catastrophic failure of the boiler. The temperature of the flue gases in a steam engine firebox can reach 1000°F (550°C), at which temperature copper, from which historically most fireboxes were made, softens to a state which can no longer sustain the boiler pressure and a severe explosion will result if water is not put into the boiler quickly and the fire removed or extinguished. The hole through the plug is too small to have any great effect in reducing the steam pressure and the small amount of water, if any, that passes through it is not expected to have any great impact in quenching the fire.|$|E
500|$|The {{principle}} of the <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> is also applied to the transport of liquefied petroleum gases, where fusible plugs (or small, exposed patches of the containers' lining membrane) are designed to melt or become porous if too high a temperature is reached: a controlled release, at a typical temperature of 250 °F (120 °C), is preferable to an explosive release (a [...] "BLEVE") at a higher temperature. Corrosive gas containers, such as those used for liquid chlorine, are fitted {{with one or more}} fusible plugs with an operating temperature [...] of about 158 to 165°F (70–74°C).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fusible</b> <b>plugs</b> {{over the}} firebox melt at a {{temperature}} {{lower than that}} of the firebox plates, thereby warning the operators by the noisy escape of steam if the water level is too low to cool the firebox crown safely.|$|R

5|$|<b>Fusible</b> <b>plugs</b> are {{sometimes}} fitted to the receivers of air compressors {{as a precaution}} against the ignition of any lubricating oil vapour that might be present. Should {{the action of the}} compressor heat the air above a safe temperature the core will melt and release the pressure.|$|R
500|$|Experiments {{conducted}} by the Franklin Institute, Boston, in the 1830s had initially {{cast doubt on the}} practice of adding water as soon as the escape of steam through the device was noted. A steam boiler was fitted with a small observation window of glass and heated beyond its normal operating temperature with the water level below the top of the firebox. When water was added {{it was found that the}} pressure rose suddenly and the observation glass shattered. The report concluded that the high temperature of the metal had vaporised the added water too quickly and that an explosion was the inevitable result. It was not until 1852 that this assumption was challenged: Thomas Redmond, one of the Institute's own inspectors, [...] specifically ruled out this theory in his investigation into the [...] boiler explosion on the steam ship Redstone on the Ohio River on 3 April that year. A 1907 investigation in Wales came to a similar conclusion: a steam locomotive belonging to the Rhymney Railway was inadvertently sent out with its safety valves wrongly assembled. The pressure in the boiler built up to the extent that the injectors failed; the crown sheet became uncovered, was weakened by the heat of the fire and violently blew apart. The investigation, led by Colonel Druitt of the Railway Inspectorate, dismissed the theory that the enginemen had succeeded in starting the [...] injectors and that the sudden flood of cold water had caused such a generation of steam that the boiler burst. He quoted the results of experiments by the Manchester Steam Users' Association, a national boiler certification and insurance body, that proved that the weight of copper present (considered with its specific heat) was insufficient to generate enough steam to raise the boiler pressure at all. Indeed, the addition of cold water had caused the pressure to fall. From then on it was accepted that the correct action in the event of the operation of the <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> was to add water.|$|E
50|$|One {{issue that}} is faced by any heated {{pressure}} vessel is how to prevent catastrophic rupture. This is why the typical RV Fridge has a pressure relief device which is commonly called a PRV. The RV Fridge PRV is very limited {{because it is a}} <b>fusible</b> <b>plug.</b> It is reported that the <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> will only vent the pressure vessel {{in the event of a}} fire. Unfortunately the <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> does not prevent a majority of fridge safety issues. The RV fridge <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> is a retroactive device which responds to a major failure mode that results in a fire.|$|E

5000|$|The metal {{walls of}} the firebox are {{normally}} called sheets, which are separated and supported by stays. The stays support and brace the [...] "sheets" [...] (plates) against pressure. Ideally, they should be located {{at right angles to}} the sheets, but since the outer sheet (wrapper sheet) is radial and the top of the firebox (crown sheet) is relatively flat by comparison, such a relationship to both sheets is impossible. The actual location of the stays is a compromise. Since stay breakage is hidden, the stays have longitudinal holes, called tell-tales, drilled in them which will blow water and steam, revealing if they are broken. A boiler with more than 5 broken stays, or two next to each, other must be taken out of service and the stays replaced. The <b>fusible</b> <b>plugs,</b> usually located in the highest part of the crown sheet, have a soft metal alloy core which melts out if the water level in the boiler gets too low. Steam and water blowing into the firebox both alerts the locomotive crew to the low water condition and helps put out the fire. Not all locomotives are equipped with <b>fusible</b> <b>plugs.</b> Also, <b>fusible</b> <b>plugs</b> should be replaced at regular intervals, about every three months for a locomotive in regular service, because the soft metal alloy core will slowly melt out over time even if the boiler water is carried at proper levels. The [...] "mudholes," [...] or washout plugs, allow access to the interior of the boiler for washing and scraping away boiler mud and scale.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft tires {{also include}} <b>fusible</b> <b>plugs</b> (which are {{assembled}} {{on the inside}} of the wheels), designed to melt at a certain temperature. Tires often overheat if maximum braking is applied during an aborted takeoff or an emergency landing. The fuses provide a safer failure mode that prevents tire explosions by deflating in a controlled manner, thus minimizing damage to aircraft and objects in the surrounding environment.|$|R
50|$|In {{commercial}} laser systems, hazard mitigations such as {{the presence}} of <b>fusible</b> <b>plugs,</b> thermal interrupters, and pressure relief valves reduce the hazard of, for example, a steam explosion arising from an obstructed water cooling jacket. Interlocks, shutters, and warning lights are often critical elements of modern commercial installations. In older lasers, experimental and hobby systems, and those removed from other equipment (OEM units) special care must be taken to anticipate and reduce the consequences of misuse as well as various failure modes.|$|R

50|$|Lead <b>fusible</b> <b>plugs</b> may {{be present}} in the crown of the boiler's firebox. If the water level drops, such that the {{temperature}} of the firebox crown increases significantly, the lead melts and the steam escapes, warning the operators, who may then manually suppress the fire. Except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire. The plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly, depressurizing the boiler. If they were any larger, the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew.|$|R
50|$|Such alloys {{are used}} for making the <b>fusible</b> <b>plugs</b> {{inserted}} in the furnace crowns of steam boilers, as a safeguard {{in the event of}} the water level being allowed to fall too low. When this happens the plug, being no longer covered with water, is heated to such a temperature that it melts and allows the contents of the boiler to escape into the furnace. In automatic fire sprinklers the orifices of each sprinkler is closed with a plug that is held in place by fusible metal, which melts and liberates the water when, owing to an outbreak of fire in the room, the temperature rises above a predetermined limit.|$|R
50|$|An RTO {{is usually}} {{seen as one}} of the hardest tests an {{airplane}} has to undergo for its certification trials. The RTO test is performed under the worst possible conditions; i.e. with fully worn out brakes, the plane loaded to maximum takeoff weight and no use of thrust reversers. During an RTO test most of the kinetic energy of the airplane is converted to heat by the brakes, which may cause the <b>fusible</b> <b>plugs</b> of the tires to melt, causing them to deflate. Small brake fires are acceptable {{as long as they do}} not spread to the airplane body within five minutes (the maximum likely time for arrival of the airport fire fighters).|$|R
50|$|An {{assistant}} {{engineer who}} had been with Rockwell five minutes before the explosion stated that when he left, the boiler gauges showed steam pressure to be in the safe range and the boiler to have plenty of water.The state Inspector of Boilers checked the boiler's <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> and determined that the explosion was not caused by a lack of water.|$|E
50|$|The process {{starts with}} a “blowdown” while some {{pressure}} remains in the boiler, then the draining away of all the boiler water through the “mudholes” {{at the base of}} the firebox and the removal of all the “washout plugs”. Scale is then jetted or scraped from the interior surfaces using a high-pressure water jet and rods of soft metal, such as copper. Areas particularly susceptible to scale buildup, such as the firebox crown and narrow water spaces around the firebox, are given special attention. The inside of the boiler is inspected by sighting through the plug holes, with a particular check paid to the integrity of the firetubes, firebox crown and stays and absence of pitting or cracking of the boiler plates. The gauge glass cocks and tubes and <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> should be cleared of scale; if the core of the <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> shows signs of calcination the item should be replaced.|$|E
50|$|Medical gas {{cylinders}} in the UK {{and some other}} countries have a <b>fusible</b> <b>plug</b> of Wood's metal in the valve block between the valve seat and the cylinder. This plug melts at a comparatively low temperature (70 °C) and allows {{the contents of the}} cylinder to escape to the surroundings before the cylinder is significantly weakened by the heat, lessening the risk of explosion.|$|E

The autoclave results showed {{that there were some}} temperature and pressure region that made a maximum deposit formation. On the other hand, the CCD weight on the piston crown surface of a utility two-stroke cycle spark ignition engine was measured, and the relative contribution of fuel and lubricant oil to the CCD formation was discussed. The engine was operated with gasoline as a fuel and with commercial oil for two-stroke and base oil without any additives as lubricant oil. As a result, most CCD was formed from lubricant oils, especially oil additives. Furthermore, we measured the temperature profiles on a piston crown surface using many <b>fusible</b> <b>plugs</b> that had specific melting points, for considering the relation between the engine CCD and the autoclave results...|$|R
40|$|The LANSCE {{accelerator}} {{relies on}} a Radiation Security System to provide personnel protection from prompt beam-induced radiation. System faults inhibit beam generation in ion sources until areas are made safe by the automatic insertion of beam plugs (stoppers) for the affected area. Should system failures occur, final protection is provided by reliably-engineered, redundant <b>fusible</b> beam <b>plugs</b> which can intercept the beam at the accelerator injection energy of 750 keV. These plugs auto-insert on faults of the Radiation Security System, and remain in until the fault clears. They are normally protected by systems designed to shut off or intercept the full-power beam. In the event of failure of these systems, the beam incident on the stainless- steel surface of the plug will cause, the layer of steel to vaporize and open the beam-line to an atmospheric air passage that results in {{a portion of the}} accelerator losing vacuum. The low energy beam cannot propagate through air, thus ensuring personnel safety...|$|R
40|$|The Radiation Security System (RSS) is an {{engineered}} {{safety system}} which automatically terminates transmission of accelerated ion beams {{in response to}} pre-defined abnormal conditions. It {{is one of the}} four major mechanisms used to protect people from radiation hazards induced by accelerated pulsed ion beams at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE). The others are shielding, administrative policies and procedures, and qualified, trained personnel. Prompt radiation hazards at the half-mile long LANSCE accelerator exist due to average beam intensities ranging from 1 milli-amp for H{sup +} beam to 100 micro-amps for the high intensity H{sup {minus}} beam. Experimental programs are supplied with variable energy (maximum 800 MeV), pulse-width (maximum 1 msec), and pulse frequency (maximum 120 Hz) ion beams. The RSS includes personnel access control systems, beam spill monitoring systems, and beam current level limiting systems. It is a stand-alone system with redundant logic chains.
