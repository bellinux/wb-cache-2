40|$|Pre-processing is {{a crucial}} step to ensure the {{efficiency}} of subsequent processes {{and the quality of}} recyclates. The efficiency of pre-processing can be affected by high losses to undesignated output fractions. Standard batch tests usually provide mass balances and are a good proxy for bulk materials balances (iron/steel, aluminum, plastics). This article aims at harmonizing methodologies and recommends a strategy for further study in pre-processing on a plant scale. We have developed an “extended batch test” method, which should help to • describe the fates of materials and elements, • assess the quality of output fractions, • identify access points for critical metals and other valuable elements to enable their recovery. A methodical approach was compiled with common material flow analysis methods and an extended set of methods, which improve the reliability via the assessment of uncertainties. This applies to systematic effects and random effects. This extended batch test was performed with a 40 Mg Waste Electrical & Electronic Equipment (WEEE) batch to trace the flows of industrial base metals, precious metals and critical metals in a WEEE pre-processing plant. Results show that one-third of the input was separated and sorted manually, while the remaining material was subsequently crushed and automatically sorted. Copper and precious metals are distributed to various output fractions but are most concentrated in the sorting residues. Critical metals like cobalt and rare earth elements are mainly concentrated in the manually sorted materials but also appear in the <b>ferrous</b> metals <b>scrap</b> and the shredder light fraction...|$|R
40|$|The Integrated Waste Services Association (IWSA) compiles {{annual data}} of metal {{recovery}} by U. S. waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities. The 2004 IWSA {{survey showed that}} the U. S. WTEs processed 28. 8 million short tons of municipal solid wastes (MSW) and recovered a total of approximately 706, 000 tons of <b>ferrous</b> metal <b>scrap,</b> i. e. 2. 45 % of the MSW stream. The 2001 U. S. E. P. A. report on the characterization of the U. S. wastes reported that MSW contained 7. 9 % metals. However, some of this metal is collected separately at the household level and a small amount is non-ferrous metal. If {{it is assumed that}} the waste stream that is “disposed ” in WTE facilities contains on the average 5 % of ferrous metals, the ferrous input to all U. S. WTEs is estimated at approximately 1. 44 million tons. On this basis, close to 0. 7 million tons of metal are not recovered in WTEs. On the same basis, the ferrous metal lost in MSW that is landfilled (247 million tons in the U. S.) is estimated to be about 12 million tons per year. The non-recovered metal at WTEs entails both environmental and economic penalties. Therefore, an industry-university collaborative study is addressed to examining a) current metal recovery before and after combustion; b) potential for increasing metal value by physical processing of the metals recovered, either at WTEs or at a regional facility to be supplied by several WTEs; c) sampling and characterization procedures used in the WTE industry; and d) potential for physical and chemical characterization of different grades of WTE metal scrap. This paper focuses on the first two subjects-the current state of WTE metal recovery and the potential for increasing metal recovery. This work in progress is published in the NAWTEC 14 Proceedings with the objective of stimulating discussion and obtaining useful input from industry and academia concerned with the conservation of non-renewable resources. 1...|$|R

The primary focus of this thesis is an examination of the alternative strategies available to generators.;An analytical framework was tested at twelve sites, with data collection and analysis guided by three research questions and eleven propositions. A range of variables was identified as influencing <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposal strategies which were classified as either drivers, moderators or outcomes; trade-offs among these variables defined the disposal strategies for each of the sites.;The volume driver highlighted the trade-offs in <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposition; three volume groups were observed, each having a distinctly different set of <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposal options. Specifically, volume was found to influence the duration of generator-processor contracts, logistics, the frequency with which generators switched processors, the recovery value received and the level of resources employed in the disposition process.;Although striking differences exist between the three volume groups, the boundaries are indistinct. Characteristics of plants located on the margins demonstrate certain elements of the adjacent group. Contrasts between the volume groups are, therefore, most conspicuous when comparing plants at the midpoints of the three categories.;Cost recovery was found to be the dominant outcome variable. Most of the plants in this study, typically, did not effectively manage the <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposal process, although opportunities exist within each of the volume groups to provide competitive advantages to the firm through effective disposal strategies.

The authors have developed software for performing the calculations.
