40|$|A few {{distinct}} cortical {{operations have}} been postulated {{over the past}} few years, suggested by experimental data on nonlinear neural response across different areas in the cortex. Among these, the energy model proposes the summation of quadrature pairs following a squaring nonlinearity in order to explain phase invariance of complex V 1 cells. The divisive normalization model assumes a <b>gain-controlling,</b> divisive inhibition to explain sigmoid-like response profiles within a pool of neurons. A gaussian-like operation hypothesizes a bell-shaped response tuned to a specific, optimal pattern of activation of the presynaptic inputs. A maxlike operation assumes the selection and transmission of the most active response among a set of neural inputs. We propose that these distinct neural operations can be computed by the same canonical circuitry, involving divisive normalization and polynomial nonlinearities, for different parameter values within the circuit. Hence, this canonical circuit may provide a unifying framework for several circuit models, such as the divisive normalization and the energy models. As a case in point, we consider a feedforward hierarchical model of the ventral pathway of the primate visual cortex, which is built on a combination of the gaussianlike and max-like operations. We show that when the two operations are approximated by the circuit proposed here, the model is capable of generating selective and invariant neural responses and performing object recognition, in good agreement with neurophysiological data. ...|$|R

We found that the <b>gain-controlling</b> ability of channels increased exponentially with the steepness of their activation within the dynamic voltage window (voltage range associated with firing). For depolarization-activated channels, this produced a greater channel current per action potential at higher firing rates. This allowed these channels to modulate gain by contributing to firing preferentially at states of higher excitation. A finer analysis of the current-voltage relationship during tonic firing identified narrow voltage windows at which the gain-modulating channels exerted their effects. As a proof of concept, we show that h-type channels can be tuned to modulate gain by changing the steepness of their activation within the dynamic voltage window. These results show how the impact of an ion channel on gain can be predicted from the relationship between channel kinetics and the membrane potential during firing.

50|$|A {{number of}} factors affect how precise a signal is, mainly the noise present in the {{original}} signal and the noise added by processing (see signal-to-noise ratio). Fundamental physical limits such as the shot noise in components limits the resolution of analogue signals. In digital electronics additional precision is obtained by using additional digits to represent the signal. The practical limit {{in the number of}} digits is determined by the performance of the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), since digital operations can usually be performed without loss of precision. The ADC takes an analogue signal and changes it into a series of binary numbers. The ADC may be used in simple digital display devices, e. g., thermometers or light meters but it may also be used in digital sound recording and in data acquisition. However, a digital-to-analogue converter (DAC) is used to change a digital signal to an analogue signal. A DAC takes a series of binary numbers and converts it to an analogue signal.

40|$|International audienceThe early {{visual system}} has {{probably}} been the most widely studied {{part of the human}} brain. As a consequence, it is now possible to confront structural observations, neurophysiological data and functional properties of this early stage in visual processing. One way to integrates these approaches is modelization and simulation. In this field, the use of analogies between retinal cells and retinal wiring with electronic circuits proved to be a particularly relevant way to understand signal processing in the early visual system and to reproduce its functionnal properties (Mead & Mahowald, 1988; Beaudot, 1994; Zaghloul & Boahen, 2004). Those models led to hardware implementations. However, those simulations require heavy technological means and remain difficult to manipulate. To the opposite, computationnal model may be implemented as software (Shah & Levine, 1996; Pelayo et al., 2004), thus benefiting from a good adjustability and versatility. However, sophisticated simulation {{would not be able to}} work real time, and simplified ones would be weakly biologically reliable. To answer this problem, we developed an analytic model of the retina based on the transfer functions of the "retinal circuits" designed for electronic simulations (Hérault & Durette, 2007). We then implemented them as software to propose a biologically reliable retina simulation that is adjustable, versatile, and works real-time on a standard PC-Computer. As a main difference with other computational models, the transfer functions of our retinal cells layers are high-pass spatiotemporal filters with non-separable variables. In other computational simulation, the non-separability beween space and time is eluded. Linking these filters by a simple architecture directly inspired from the synaptic patterns of connections in the retina leads to the generation of three different streams that match the known properties of the Magno- and Parvo-cellular pathways. Non-separability plays a key role in our approach: it is responsible for the main part of computational parallelism; it enables adaptive local inhibition in space and also in time, and gives a further insight into the so-called "Coarse-to-Fine" streaming process in the visual system. Local spatial and temporal <b>gain-controls</b> are replicated, at both the levels of photoreceptors and of ganglion cells, using an adaptive Michaelis-Menten law. It is responsible respectively for luminance and contrast equalization, which makes it suitable, particularly, for texture extraction. Its last feature is the capability of chromatic computation at the same rate as monochromatic computation using the bio-inspired mosaic encoding scheme for color (Alleysson et al., 2005). The software application is the first retinal simulator software built on a strong physiological background which accounts for many functional observations such as non-separable spatio-temporal behavior, color, adaptive gain control, and is optimized enough to work in real time on a PC-computer. It is modular and fully configurable so that it can be used in a wide field of applications, from vision research to real-time image processing and computer vision (Benoit et al., 2007, ERM submitted abstract) ...|$|R

However, at stimulus offset the responses fall simultaneously and at the same rate at all locations. Although response onset depends on stimulus contrast, both the peak spatial profile and the offset dynamics are independent of contrast.

40|$|Although human {{observers}} can perceive depth from stereograms {{with considerable}} contrast {{difference between the}} images presented to the two eyes (Legge & Gu, 1989), how contrast gain control functions in stereo depth perception has not been systematically investigated. Recently, we developed a multipathway contrast <b>gain-control</b> model (MCM) for binocular phase and contrast perception (Huang, Zhou, Lu, & Zhou, 2011; Huang, Zhou, Zhou, & Lu, 2010) based on a contrast <b>gain-control</b> model of binocular phase combination (Ding & Sperling, 2006). To extend the MCM to simultaneously account for stereo depth and cyclopean contrast perception, we manipulated the contrasts (ranging from 0. 08 to 0. 4) of the dynamic random dot stereograms (RDS) presented {{to the left and}} right eyes independently and measured both disparity thresholds for depth perception and perceived contrasts of the cyclopean images. We found that both disparity threshold and perceived contrast depended strongly on the signal contrasts in the two eyes, exhibiting characteristic binocular contrast <b>gain-control</b> properties. The results were well accounted for by an extended MCM model, in which each eye exerts gain control on the other eye's signal in proportion to its own signal contrast energy and also gain control over the other eye's gain control; stereo strength is proportional to the product of the signal strengths in the two eyes after contrast gain control, and perceived contrast is computed by combining contrast energy from the two eyes.

40|$|Abstract — Algorithms for a {{stereoscopic}} image quality assessment (IQA) aim {{to estimate the}} qualities of 3 D images {{in a manner that}} agrees with human judgments. The modern stereoscopic IQA algorithms often apply 2 D IQA algorithms on stereoscopic views, disparity maps, and/or cyclopean images, to yield an overall quality estimate based on the properties of the human visual system. This paper presents an extension of our previous 2 D most apparent distortion (MAD) algorithm to a 3 D version (3 D-MAD) to evaluate 3 D image quality. The 3 D-MAD operates via two main stages, which estimate perceived quality degradation due to 1) distortion of the monocular views and 2) distortion of the cyclopean view. In the first stage, the conventional MAD algorithm is applied on the two monocular views, and then the combined binocular quality is estimated via a weighted sum of the two estimates, where the weights are determined based on a block-based contrast measure. In the second stage, intermediate maps corresponding to the lightness distance and the pixel-based contrast are generated based on a multipathway contrast <b>gain-control</b> model. Then, the cyclopean view quality is estimated by measuring the statistical-difference-based features obtained from the reference stereopair and the distorted stereopair, respectively. Finally, the estimates obtained from the two stages are combined to yield an overall quality score of the {{stereoscopic image}}. Tests on various 3 D image quality databases demonstrate that our algorithm significantly improves upon many other state-of-the-art 2 D/ 3 D IQA algorithms.

40|$|In {{binocular}} combination, light {{images on}} the two retinas are combined to form a single “cyclopean” perceptual image, in contrast to binocular rivalry which occurs when the two eyes have incompatible (“rivalrous”) inputs and only one eye`s stimulus is perceived. We propose a computational theory for binocular combination with two basic principles of interaction: in every spatial neighborhood, each eye (i) exerts gain control on the other eye's signal {{in proportion to the}} contrast energy of its own input and (ii) additionally exerts gain control on the other eye's gain control. For stimuli of ordinary contrast, when either eye is stimulated alone, the predicted cyclopean image is the same as when both eyes are stimulated equally, coinciding with an easily observed property of natural vision. The <b>gain-control</b> theory is contrast dependent: Very low-contrast stimuli to the left- and right-eye add linearly to form the predicted cyclopean image. The intrinsic nonlinearity manifests itself only as contrast increases. To test the theory more precisely, a horizontal sine wave grating of 0. 68 cycles per degree is presented to each eye. The gratings differ in contrast and phase. The predicted (and perceived) cyclopean grating also is a sine wave; its apparent phase indicates the relative contribution of the two eyes to the cyclopean image. For 48 measured combinations of phase and contrast, the theory with only one estimated parameter accounts for 95 % of the variance of the data. Therefore, a simple, robust, physiologically plausible <b>gain-control</b> theory accurately describes an early stage of binocular combination...|$|E
40|$|The {{electric}} {{sense of}} mormyrids is often {{regarded as an}} adaptation to conditions unfavourable for vision and in these fish {{it has become the}} dominant sense for active orientation and communication tasks. With this sense, fish can detect and distinguish the electrical properties of the close environment, measure distance, perceive the 3 -D shape of objects and discriminate objects according to distance or size and shape, irrespective of conductivity, thus showing a degree of abstraction regarding the interpretation of sensory stimuli. The physical properties of images projected on the sensory surface by the fish's own discharge reveal a "Mexican hat" opposing centre-surround profile. It is likely that computation of the image amplitude to slope ratio is used to measure distance, while peak width and slope give measures of shape and contrast. Modelling has been used to explore how the images of multiple objects superimpose in a complex manner. While electric images are by nature distributed, or 'blurred', behavioural strategies orienting sensory surfaces and the neural architecture of sensory processing networks both contribute to resolving potential ambiguities. Rostral amplification is produced by current funnelling in the head and chin appendage regions, where high density electroreceptor distributions constitute foveal regions. Central magnification of electroreceptive pathways from these regions particularly favours the detection of capacitive properties intrinsic to potential living prey. Swimming movements alter the amplitude and contrast of pre-receptor object-images but image modulation is normalised by central <b>gain-control</b> mechanisms that maintain excitatory and inhibitory balance, removing the contrast-ambiguity introduced by self-motion {{in much the same way}} that contrast <b>gain-control</b> is achieved in vision...|$|E

40|$|Networks of {{signaling}} pathways perform complex temporal decoding {{functions in}} diverse biological systems, including the synapse, development, and bacterial chemotaxis. This paper examines temporal filtering and tuning properties of synaptic signaling pathways {{as a possible}} substrate for emergent temporal decoding. A mass action kinetic model of 16 synaptic signaling pathways was used to dissect out the contribution of these pathways in linear cascades and when coupled to form a network. The model predicts two primary mechanisms of temporal tuning of pathways: a weighted summation of responses of pathways with different timings {{and the presence of}} biochemical feedback loop(s) with emergent dynamics. Regulatory inputs act differently on these two tuning mechanisms. In the first case, regulators act like a <b>gain-control</b> on pathways with different intrinsic tuning. In the case of feedback loops, the temporal properties of the loop itself are changed. These basic tuning mechanisms may underlie specialized temporal tuning functions in more complex signaling systems in biology...|$|E

The phenomenon {{has been attributed to}} a facilitation process which asymmetrically modulates the inputs to motion detectors, for instance by some sort of changes in processing speed. Computer simulations of motion detector arrays show, however, that this basic effect has to be expected from the properties of simple motion detectors.
