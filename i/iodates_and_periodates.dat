The method involves the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite with iodate under acidic condition. The formed nitrite is determined based on the diazo coupling reaction between p-nitroaniline and N-(1 -naphthyl) ethylenediammine dihydrochloride [NEDA]. The method obeys Beer’s law in the concentration range 1 - 15 µg of iodate in an overall aqueous volume of 10 mL at 545 nm and the color is stable for 3 h. The relative standard deviation is 1. 7 % (n= 10) at 12 g of iodate. The molar absorptivity is calculated to be 8. 33 x 104 L mol- 1 cm- 1 with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9998.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the key factors involved in patulin adsorption by heat-inactivated lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cells. For preventing bacterial contamination, a sterilization process was involved in the adsorption process. The effects of various physical, chemical, and enzymatic pre-treatments, simultaneous treatments, and post-treatments on the patulin adsorption performances of six LAB strains were evaluated. The pre-treated cells were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the removal of patulin by viable cells was mainly based on adsorption or degradation, depending on the specific strain. The adsorption abilities were widely increased by NaOH and esterification pre-treatments, and reduced by trypsin, lipase, <b>iodate,</b> <b>and</b> <b>periodate</b> pre-treatments. Additionally, the adsorption abilities were almost maintained at pH 2. 2 - 4. 0, and enhanced significantly at pH 4. 0 - 6. 0. The effects of sodium and magnesium ions on the adsorption abilities at pH 4 were slight and strain-specific. A lower proportion of patulin was released from the strain with higher adsorption ability. Analyses revealed that the physical structure of peptidoglycan was not a principal factor. Vicinal OH and carboxyl groups were not involved in patulin adsorption, while alkaline amino acids, thiol and ester compounds were important for patulin adsorption. Additionally, besides hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic interaction also participated in patulin adsorption, which was enhanced with the increase in pH (4. 0 - 6. 0) ...|$|R

These species may undergo transformation {{to one another}} and thus affect the formation of iodinated disinfection byproducts during disinfection of drinking waters or wastewater effluents. In this study, a fast, sensitive and accurate method for determining these iodine species in waters was developed by derivatizing iodide <b>and</b> <b>iodate</b> to organic iodine and measuring organic iodine with a total organic iodine (TOI) measurement approach. Within this method, organo-iodine was determined directly by TOI measurement; iodide was oxidized by monochloramine to hypoiodous acid and then hypoiodous acid reacted with phenol to form organic iodine, which was determined by TOI measurement; iodate was reduced by ascorbic acid to iodide and then determined as iodide. The quantitation limit of organo-iodine or sum of organo-iodine and iodide or sum of organo-iodine, iodide <b>and</b> <b>iodate</b> was 5 μg/L as I for a 40 mL water sample (or 2. 5 μg/L as I for an 80 mL water sample, or 1. 25 μg/L as I for a 160 mL water sample).

40|$|The {{presence}} of iodinated disinfection by-products (I-DBPs) {{in drinking water}} poses a potential health concern since {{it has been shown}} that I-DBPs are generally more genotoxic and cytotoxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogs. I-DBPs are formed during oxidation/disinfection of iodide-containing waters by reaction of the transient hypoiodous acid (HOI) with natural organic matter (NOM). In this study, we demonstrate that ozone pre-treatment selectively oxidizes iodide to <b>iodate</b> <b>and</b> avoids the formation of I-DBPs. <b>Iodate</b> is non-toxic <b>and</b> is therefore a desired sink of iodine in drinking water. Complete conversion of iodide to iodate while minimizing the bromate formation to below the guideline value of 10 μg L− 1 was achieved for a wide range of ozone doses in five raw waters with DOC and bromide concentrations of 1. 1 – 20 mg L− 1 and 170 – 940 μg L− 1, respectively. Lowering the pH effectively further reduced bromate formation but had no impact on the extent of <b>iodate</b> <b>and</b> bromoform formation (the main trihalomethane (THM) formed during ozonation). Experiments carried out with pre-chlorinated/post-clarified samples already containing I-DBPs, showed that ozonation effectively oxidized I-THMs. Therefore, in iodide-containing waters, in which I-DBPs can be produced upon chlorination or especially chloramination, a pre-ozonation step to oxidize iodide to iodate is an efficient process to mitigate I-DBP formation...|$|R
