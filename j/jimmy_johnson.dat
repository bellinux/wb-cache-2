5|$|Warner's {{next two}} years were less fruitful. The 1900 {{football}} team went 6–4–1, losing three games to the Big Four, and the 1901 season was a losing one, with Carlisle posting a 5–7–1 record. The following year, the team posted an improved 8–3 record, when Warner began implementing double (lateral) passes. Carlisle's quarterback <b>Jimmy</b> <b>Johnson</b> would make a lateral pass to the halfback running towards the sideline, bringing the defense {{with him as he}} tossed the ball back to the fast-running Johnson.|$|E
5|$|Hindley hired {{a vehicle}} {{a week after}} Kilbride went missing, and again on 21 December 1963, {{apparently}} {{to make sure the}} burial sites had not been disturbed. In February 1964 she bought a second-hand Austin Traveller, but soon after traded it for a Mini van. Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett disappeared on 16 June 1964. His stepfather, <b>Jimmy</b> <b>Johnson,</b> became a suspect; in the two years following Bennett's disappearance, Johnson was taken for questioning on four occasions. Detectives searched under the floorboards of the Johnsons' house, and on discovering that the houses in the row were connected, extended the search to the entire street.|$|E
5|$|The Oklahoma State Cowboys {{football}} {{program is a}} college football team that represents Oklahoma State University–Stillwater {{as part of the}} Big 12 Conference in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The team has had 22head coaches since organized football began in 1901 with the nickname Aggies. The team played without a head coach until 1906. The university, then known as Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College, was renamed Oklahoma State University in 1957 and its nickname was changed to Cowboys. Oklahoma State was an original member of the Southwest Conference, joining in 1915. They later joined the Missouri Valley Conference in 1925 and the Big Eight Conference in 1960. The Cowboys became a charter member of the Big 12 in 1996. The Cowboys have played in more than 1,000games during their 108seasons. In those seasons, eightcoaches have led the Cowboys to postseason bowl games: Jim Lookabaugh, Cliff Speegle, Jim Stanley, <b>Jimmy</b> <b>Johnson,</b> Pat Jones, Bob Simmons, Les Miles and Mike Gundy. Sixcoaches have won conference championships with the Cowboys: John Maulbetsch, Lynn Waldorf, Lookabaugh, , Stanley, and Gundy.|$|E

25|$|Before the game, Dallas coach <b>Jimmy</b> <b>Johnson</b> famously {{guaranteed}} {{that his team}} would win, and his team did not disappoint. The Cowboys jumped to a 28–7 halftime lead, racking up 273 yards and 19 first downs, and scoring four touchdowns in their first five possessions. San Francisco finished the half with just 110 total yards and six first downs.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, the Super Bowl hype {{was more}} focused onto Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones and head coach <b>Jimmy</b> <b>Johnson.</b> Although the two rebuilt {{the team with}} young talent that {{eventually}} won the previous year's Super Bowl, both men had huge egos that conflicted with each other. Both had different ideas on the future personnel plans for the Cowboys, and both wanted equal credit for the team's recent success (eventually, Johnson would leave the team after the season).|$|E
25|$|The 1989 {{game between}} UCLA and Arkansas was highly publicized in the Dallas area because Bruin quarterback Troy Aikman was {{expected}} to be the top pick in the 1989 NFL Draft; the first pick was held by the Dallas Cowboys. Much was made of Cowboys longtime head coach Tom Landry watching Aikman practice at Texas Stadium, UCLA's practice facility for game preparation. Landry never got to draft Aikman, because he was fired the next month, but his successor, <b>Jimmy</b> <b>Johnson,</b> did. UCLA and Aikman won, 17–3.|$|E

Additionally, Frank Caliendo appeared in various comedic skits and Ryan Seacrest provided coverage of celebrity arrivals to the game site. This was the first Fox Super Bowl not to be hosted by James Brown, who had returned to CBS after the 2005 season.|$|E
25|$|The 49ers' {{spectacular}} performance led {{to their}} offensive coordinator, Mike Shanahan, and defensive coordinator, Ray Rhodes, earning head coaching positions in 1995 for the Denver Broncos and the Philadelphia Eagles, respectively. Bobby Ross became the second coach, after <b>Jimmy</b> <b>Johnson</b> in Super Bowl XXVII, to lead a team to a college football national championship (Georgia Tech in 1990) and a Super Bowl. One year later, Barry Switzer would join Johnson as the only coaches to win championships in both NCAA Division I-A (now FBS) college football and the NFL.|$|E

25|$|Fox Sports {{televised}} {{the game}} in the United States, with Joe Buck as the play-by-play announcer and Troy Aikman, himself a three-time Super Bowl winner as a Dallas Cowboys quarterback, as the color analyst. Mike Pereira joined Buck and Aikman in the broadcast booth to comment on instant replay reviews, while Pam Oliver and Chris Myers served as sideline reporters. The pre-game show featured the Fox NFL Sunday crew of host Curt Menefee and a group of analysts with extensive Super Bowl experiences of their own: Terry Bradshaw (4 time Super Bowl winning QB with the Pittsburgh Steelers), Howie Long (one-time Super Bowl winning defensive end with the then-Los Angeles Raiders), Michael Strahan (one-time Super Bowl winning defensive end with the NY Giants) and <b>Jimmy</b> <b>Johnson</b> (two-time Super Bowl winning head coach with the Cowboys). They were joined by a variety of other commentators.|$|E
25|$|After forcing Dallas to punt {{on their}} opening drive, Kramer {{completed}} passes to Herman Moore, Mike Farr and Willie Green for gains of 11, 13, and 13 yards before finished the 68-yard drive with a 31-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Green. Dallas responded {{with a pair of}} receptions by Michael Irvin for 35 yards and an 18-yard run from Emmitt Smith setting up a 28-yard field goal by Ken Willis. But the next time Dallas had the ball, Melvin Jenkins intercepted a pass from Beuerlein and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown. After the Cowboys responded with another 28-yard Willis field goal, Eddie Murray's 36-yard field goal made the score 17–6 at halftime. Near the end of the half, Cowboys coach <b>Jimmy</b> <b>Johnson</b> benched Beuerlein in favor of Aikman, but this did not improve the Cowboys fortunes. On the final two plays of the second quarter, Aikman was sacked and then threw an interception to linebacker Chris Spielman.|$|E
