Do <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> too much?" [...] after Jack explains to Kenneth what to do as his assistant. Later, Jack tells Liz to make her budget cuts, with Liz replying [...] "What? That's it? I thought you'd tell me to cook the numbers or shred something or do some Pelican Brief stuff." [...] Finally, Tracy and Jenna decide to investigate Kenneth's apartment, which leads them to compare themselves to actors Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts, the two leads from the movie.|$|E

[...] When Elisa informs Jack {{that he has a}} lump on one of his testicles, Jack responds, [...] "Thank you for telling me what <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>know.</b> You should work for the Huffington Post", the latter being a liberal news and aggregated blog website that Alec Baldwin has been a contributor to since 2005. Elisa tells Jack that [...] "Señor Macho Solo" [...] is [...] "what we call a McRib sandwich", a sandwich sold at McDonald's. NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) does the [...] "Top That" [...] rap from the fantasy-comedy film Teen Witch (1989). Jenna sings the song [...] "Piece of My Heart", from Janis Joplin, though, the lyrics had been reworded by Jack so that Sheinhardt Universal avoid legal problems. In addition, Jenna sings the song and carries a bottle of Jack Daniel's in hand, a real life trait of the late singer.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You were my sun, you were my earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>know,</b> I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me you loved me, {{why did you leave}} me all alone / Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".|$|E

[...] The episode {{was the first to}} be directed by Joss Whedon. [...] Whedon, who is a friend of both producer Greg Daniels and Jenna Fischer, and also met most of the production staff prior to the episode, stated that he chose to direct the episode [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> the writing staff and a bunch of the cast, and I adore the show." [...] When informed that the episode was about a bat entering into the office and one of the characters pretending to be a vampire, Whedon thought that it was a joke, stating [...] "Didn't I just leave this party?" [...] in reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. [...] In an interview featured on the third season DVD, Whedon joked that the [...] "Business School" [...] episode and his former TV show were very similar because [...] "Buffy [...] was sad and depressing but... it was funny. Especially when people died. And {{a lot of people do}} die in [...]" [...] But upon completing the episode, Whedon stated [...] "That was just coincidence. But that's how that happened. God, it was fun." [...] Whedon stated that he was surprised with the amount of input he was allowed with the script. [...] "I wouldn't say freedom to do things with it...But way more input was asked for than I would have ever anticipated." [...] At Pam's art show, the pieces which she was supposed to have painted didn't suit Whedon. [...] "I got to the set and saw Pam's art, and I was like, 'This is not right.'" [...] Whedon said that he held up filming for over an hour until the staff was able create new pieces of art.|$|E
