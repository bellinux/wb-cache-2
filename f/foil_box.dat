40|$|Under {{operations}} in hot regions and flights at low heights {{the temperature in}} the fighter cockpit may rise to high levels causing heat stress on pilot. Reducing cockpit glass light permeability or increasing cockpit ventilation reduce heat load. The measures should not affect pilots’ performance. This study investigated if clothing material with reflective properties has an effect on heat gain in pilot, specifically, under solar radiation. Two materials, conventional pilot suit material (Old) and material coated with coldblack® (New, Schoeller Technologies AG, Switzerland) were tested over the underwear layer. Additional test involved a bubble plastic layer to simulate layers and air gaps of the pilot clothing system. A hot plate was used to measure textile combinations’ insulation. Under the solar radiation simulation with a Thorn lamp a water cooled plate was utilized. In the cooled plate water was circulated with a peristaltic pump, and inlet and outlet temperatures were recorded. From flow and temperature gradient the heat gain was calculated. In addition, a cockpit scenario was simulated in a box. The cooled plate was placed {{on the bottom of the}} box, covered with the textile materials as described above, and box was closed by a piece of cockpit glass. The areas by the side of the glass were covered with aluminium <b>foil.</b> <b>Box</b> ventilation was or was not applied. Solar lamp was positioned at 90 ° angel 2. 5 m from the material surface providing a load of 841 W/m 2 on the plate. The insulation of New was slightly lower than in Old. New showed about 10 % lower heat transmission under solar radiation than Old. Textile surface temperature in New was several degrees lower than in Old. At “skin” the temperatures did not reach over 40 °C in any case. Bubble plastic did minimize the differences while New still stayed lower. When placed in the box the heat transmission difference reduced to about 1 %. The use of the bubble plastic as additional insulation reversed this difference. Adding ventilation equalized heat transmission. The new material has ability to reduce the heat load considerably in the open space that is exposed to solar radiation. In closed space the advantage disappears. In heat under solar load New would help, while in cold it might be a disadvantage. Thus, two different outer layers for warm respective cold may be recommended. However, the effect of the outer layer in cockpit scenario is marginal...|$|E

50|$|The Vélodrome d'hiver was {{an indoor}} velodrome (cycle track) {{at the corner}} of {{boulevard}} de Grenelle and rue Nélaton in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, not far from the Eiffel Tower. It was built by Henri Desgrange, editor of L'Auto, who later organised the Tour de France, when his original track in the nearby Salle des Machines was listed for demolition in 1909 to improve the view of the Eiffel Tower. As well as track cycling, the new building was used for ice hockey, wrestling, boxing, roller-skating, circuses, spectacles and demonstrations. In the 1924 Summer Olympics, several events were held there, including <b>foil</b> fencing, <b>boxing,</b> cycling (track), weightlifting, and wrestling.|$|R

On March 3, 2015 it was released in the Americas by RCA and 19 Recordings. That same day, a limited edition box set was released, containing a deluxe edition of the album and a 17-piece lyric card puzzle housed in a customized holographic <b>foil</b> stamped <b>box</b> to correspond each track. An exclusive pre-sale ticket code for a concert tour supporting the album was also hidden in each box set. A double LP pressing of the record followed the CD release on March 24, 2015. To coincide with the album's first anniversary of release, RCA digitally reissued the deluxe edition of Piece by Piece on March 4, 2016, now containing the [...] "Idol version" [...] of the title track.|$|R
50|$|Putting {{a baking}} sheet pan over a furnace can allow for baking, which is in turn derived from {{the concept of the}} masonry oven. This was common for centuries, used to make breads, pies, and other items, and is still popular today, {{particularly}} among campers who enjoy stuffing their meats. Ovens can be made from cast iron, sheet metal or aluminum <b>foil</b> covered cardboard <b>box.</b> Reflector ovens are metal containers designed to surround an article of food being baked over an open flame and reflect the heat back towards the food.|$|R
60|$|I {{had lost}} my habits of study while at home; and I was {{not likely to}} find them again at college. I found that study was not the fashion at college, and that a lad of spirit only ate his terms; and grew wise by dint of knife and fork. I was always prone to follow the fashions of the company into which I fell; so I threw by my books, and became a man of spirit. As my father made me a {{tolerable}} allowance, notwithstanding the narrowness of his income, having an eye always to my great expectations, I was enabled to appear to advantage among my fellow-students. I cultivated all kinds of sports and exercises. I {{was one of the}} most expert oarsmen that rowed on the Isis. I boxed and fenced. I was a keen huntsman, and my chambers in college were always decorated with whips of all kinds, spurs, <b>foils,</b> and <b>boxing</b> gloves. A pair of leather breeches would seem to be throwing one leg out of the half-open drawers, and empty bottles lumbered the bottom of every closet.|$|R
50|$|The {{experimental}} set-up {{was made by}} nine 9.70 kg low-radioactivity scintillating thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) crystals. Each crystal was faced by two low-background photomultipliers through 10 cm light guides. The detectors were installed inside a sealed copper box flushed with highly pure nitrogen in order to insulate the detectors from air that contains trace amounts of radon, a radioactive gas. To reduce the natural environmental background the copper box is enclosed inside a multicomponent multi-ton passive shield made of copper, lead, polyethylene/paraffin, cadmium <b>foil.</b> A plexiglas <b>box</b> encloses the whole shield and is also kept in a highly pure nitrogen atmosphere. A 1 m concrete neutron moderator largely surrounds the set-up.|$|R
2500|$|While the {{technical}} {{principles of the}} camera obscura have been known since antiquity, the broad use of {{the technical}} concept in producing images with a linear perspective in paintings, maps, theatre setups and architectural and later photographic images and movies started in the Western Renaissance and the scientific revolution. While e.g. Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) had already observed an optical effect and developed {{a state of the}} art theory of the refraction of light, he was less interested to produce images with it (compare Hans Belting 2005); the society he lived in was even hostile (compare Aniconism in Islam) towards personal images. Western artists and philosophers used the Arab findings in new frameworks of epistemic relevance. [...] E.g. Leonardo da Vinci used the camera obscura as a model of the eye, René Descartes for eye and mind and John Locke started to use the camera obscura as a metaphor of human understanding per se. The modern use of the camera obscura as an epistemic machine had important side effects for science.While the use of the camera obscura has dwindled away, for those who are interested in making one it only requires a few items including: a box, tracing paper, tape, <b>foil,</b> a <b>box</b> cutter, a pencil and a blanket to keep out the light.|$|R
40|$|Ensuring {{the quality}} of fish you want to {{preserve}} should begin {{as soon as the}} fish are caught. Fish bruise easily, so handle them carefully. Place them on ice immediately, then clean, dress, and wash them within 2 hours. Pack them in ice or refrigerate as soon as possible to prevent deterioration. Use fresh, iced fish within 1 to 2 days. Freezing Fish You can freeze all kinds of fish. Store fish at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (F) or below. Package fish in small or flat packages. To prevent dehydration and to lock in fresh fish flavor, package fish in airtight, vapor-proof packaging, such as aluminum <b>foil,</b> plastic freezer <b>boxes</b> with airtight lids, vacuum-sealed individual plastic bags, thick plastic freezer bags, or freezer papers. 1. Use fresh fish, cleaned and dressed. 2. Cut fish into serving pieces. Fish can be frozen whole or as portions. The most economical wa...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{residuals}} {{of printing}} ink components were determined in 94 samples of packaging materials commercially {{used in the}} Czech Republic for food packaging. Tested samples included printed polyethylene and polypropylene films, coextruded and laminated films, paperboard beverages <b>boxes,</b> <b>foils</b> for thermo sealing of polystyrene cups and polypropylene cups. Printing ink components were extracted with diethylether, then separated and determined using gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectroscopy detector. Fifty compounds potentially originated from printing were isolated, identified and quantified. No acute health risk for food consumer was identified even though several findings of higher levels of photoiniciators (e. g. in PET films for thermo sealing of polystyrene cups) as well as plasticizers (acetyl tributyl citrate, tributyl aconitate, 2 -butoxyethyl oleate and 2 -ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate in coextrudet films) should be completed with information on their real migration into food and or food simulants for a proper safety evaluation...|$|R
