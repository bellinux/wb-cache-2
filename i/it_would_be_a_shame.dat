Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame.</b> When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

Duntov and the other Corvette {{engineers}} gravitate toward the big blocks because they like the torque. And granted, the 454s will squirt through traffic with just a feather touch on the gas pedal. But, to us at least, the small block engine contributes to a fine sense of balance in the Corvette that is rare in any GT car, so rare that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to exchange it for a few lb.-ft. of torque.” ...|$|E
