25|$|After {{eleven years}} of marriage, George Boleyn {{was arrested in}} May 1536 and imprisoned in the Tower of London, accused of having <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> with his sister, the Queen. Jane likely {{had little to do}} with these accusations, and it is usually Elizabeth Somerset, Countess of Worcester who is {{accredited}} by contemporaries with having provided the evidence against the Queen and her brother. There was no truth in these rumours, according to the vast majority of contemporary witnesses, but they provided the legal pretext that the Boleyns' enemies needed to send Lord Rochford to the block.

25|$|Regional {{studies found}} a {{different}} prevalence {{of sexual harassment}} by teachers.

In another study college students were asked to recall if they or other students had experienced sexual harassment by high school teachers. 6.5% of the respondents reported having personally experienced sexually inappropriate attention from high school teachers.

25|$|Sexual {{abstinence}} is {{the practice}} of refraining from some or all aspects of sexual activity for medical, psychological, legal, social, financial, philosophical, moral or religious reasons. For the last twenty years, abstinence rates among American adolescents have risen.

A cross-sectional survey in 1998 found that fear of pregnancy was the most commonly cited reason for choosing abstinence, especially among girls, as well as boys who had caused a pregnancy in the past. Other reasons included a fear of sexually transmitted infections, a lack of desire, being afraid of getting caught, and the belief that sex was not appropriate for someone of their age.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, Berry was a {{high-profile}} established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had opened a racially integrated St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand, and invested in real estate. But in December 1959, he was arrested under the Mann Act after allegations that he had <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> with a 14-year-old Apache waitress, Janice Escalante, whom he had transported across state lines to work as a hatcheck girl at his club. After a two-week trial in March 1960, he was convicted, fined $5,000, and sentenced to five years in prison. He appealed the decision, arguing that the judge's comments and attitude were racist and prejudiced the jury against him. The appeal was upheld, and a second trial was heard in May and June 1961, resulting in another conviction and a three-year prison sentence. After another appeal failed, Berry served one and one-half years in prison, from February 1962 to October 1963. He had continued recording and performing during the trials, but his output had slowed as his popularity declined; his final single released before he was imprisoned was [...] "Come On".|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, the thrall girl {{went from}} one tent {{to the other}} and <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> with the men. Every man told her: [...] "Tell your master that I did this because of my love to him". In the afternoon, they moved the thrall girl to {{something}} that looked like a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her relatives, and the third time she saw her master in the afterworld. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young boys. She saw that her master beckoned for her. By using intoxicating drinks, they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead. The same ritual also appears in the Icelandic short story [...] "VÃ¶lsa Ã¾Ã¡ttr," [...] where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her look into the otherworld.|$|E

500|$|The 19th-century {{antiquarian}} Angharad Llwyd, {{who wrote}} a history of Anglesey in 1833, recorded the story noted by Gerald of Wales in the late 12th century that the church once possessed a stone [...] "resembling a human thigh" [...] which would return [...] "of its own accord" [...] however far away it was carried. It was sometimes known as the [...] "homing stone". Gerald said that Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester (who died in 1101) had tested this story by throwing the stone into the sea, chained to a large rock, {{only to discover that}} the stone had returned by the next morning. As a result, the Norman earl issued an order that no-one was to attempt to move it. [...] It was popularly believed that if a couple <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> near the stone (something that Gerald said happened [...] "frequently"), it would [...] "sweat large drops of water" [...] and the woman would not become pregnant.

500|$|The postmortem report stated Leigh's {{cause of}} death to be a {{fractured}} skull and injury to the brain. Leigh had been struck with great force several times, including {{at least three times}} in the head. The postmortem also found that Leigh had asphyxial haemorrhages, and multiple injuries to the jaw, ribs, liver and right kidney. Leigh had neck fingertip pressure injuries, indicating she had been choked before she died, though this was not the {{cause of death}}. Leigh's blood alcohol reading was 0.128, a level which, according to the University of Notre Dame, would have caused [...] "significant impairment of motor coordination and loss of good judgment". There was no doubt that Leigh was violently sexually assaulted before she was murdered, and the evidence indicated that prior to the night of her murder she had not <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse.</b> Leigh had deep bruising to the left wall of her vagina, extensive bruising to her hymen and two tears, one [...] long, to her vulva. An analysis of the postmortem by Dr Johan Duflou, deputy director of the New South Wales Institute of Forensic Medicine, stated that an inflexible object, possibly a beer bottle, was likely to have caused most of her genital injuries. No semen was found in her body.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Divine {{returned}} to Baltimore to film Waters's next motion picture, Female Trouble, {{in which he}} played the lead role. Divine's character, teenage delinquent Dawn Davenport, embraces the idea that crime is art and is eventually executed in the electric chair for her violent behavior. Waters claimed that the character of Dawn had been partly based on the mutual friend who had introduced him to Divine, Carol Wernig, while the costumes and make-up were once more designed by Van Smith to create the desired [...] "trashy, slutty look." [...] In the film, Divine did his own stunts, including the trampoline scene, {{for which he had}} to undertake a number of trampolining lessons. Divine also played his first on-screen male role in the film, Earl Peterson, and Waters included a scene during which these two characters <b>had</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>intercourse</b> as a joke on the fact that both characters were played by the same actor. Female Trouble proved to be Divine's favorite of his films, because it both allowed him to develop his character and to finally play a male role, something he had always felt important because he feared being typecast as a female impersonator. Divine was also responsible for singing the theme tune for Female Trouble, although it was never released as a single. Divine remained proud of the film, although it received a mixed critical reception.|$|E
