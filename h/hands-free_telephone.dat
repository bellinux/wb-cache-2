40|$|More than 20 {{years ago}} it was shown that {{adaptive}} Volterra filters can be used for telephone echo cancellation, but the inherent need for a large number of coefficients has inhibited their practical use. Recently, first {{attempts have been made to}} combat nonlinearities in the acoustic echo path of <b>hands-free</b> <b>telephones,</b> which are caused by low-cost audio components. As these attempts are based on a memoryless nonlinear model, they are constrained to saturation effects, which can not describe the nonlinear behavior of small loudspeakers accurately enough. In this contribution, we report real time measurements with an adaptive Volterra filter. At first, we verify that loudspeaker nonlinearities encountered in the echo path of <b>hands-free</b> <b>telephones</b> have to be modelled with memory. Based on these results, we propose an adaptive Volterra filter structure with a reduced number of coefficients.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the existing literature}} concerning the effect of telephoning while driving on road safety. Telephone use in the car has increased dramatically in the Netherlands in recent years. The telecom industry expects {{that by the end}} of the year 2000, four million cellular telephones will be in use in the Netherlands; the percentage of hands-free installations is not known. Various studies show that telephoning whilst driving interferes with driving tasks and therefore has a negative effect on the performance of driving tasks. This concerns both hand-held and <b>hands-free</b> <b>telephones,</b> although hand-held equipment appears to have a greater negative effect on driving tasks than hands-free. On the basis of data now available, the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research concludes that using a mobile phone while driving a car is undesirable. This applies to all forms of telephone use and vehicle operation. Prohibiting the use of hand-held telephones while driving will benefit road safety. Upholding a legal ban on hand-held telephoning would be reasonably feasible; doing so for <b>hands-free</b> <b>telephoning</b> would be almost impossible. (A...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the limitations of}} acoustic echo cancellers which are commonly used in <b>hands-free</b> full-duplex <b>telephones.</b> The various factors affecting the performance of echo cancellers in terms of achievable steady-state echo cancellation and convergence characteristics are discussed. New techniques which can overcome these limitations are proposed, and evaluated using field test data acquired from com-mercial <b>hands-free</b> <b>telephones</b> in different rooms. Full-duplex hands-free telephony is achieved by using an adaptive acoustic echo canceller (AEC) to model the transfer function between the loudspeaker and microphone.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [116]- 118) Conventional telephones {{have grown}} into {{a new generation of}} <b>telephone</b> systems called <b>hands-free</b> <b>telephones.</b> In <b>hands-free</b> <b>telephones,</b> the speaker and microphone are widely separated according to application's need. Teleconferencing is one such application, where the acoustic path between the speaker and microphone is very long. This long acoustic path varies with time and causes an undesirable effect called the acoustic echo. Theoretically, the acoustic echo can be suppressed using long adaptive filters. However in real-time, long adaptive filters cannot converge fast enough to track the acoustic echo’s dynamic changes. One of the recent approaches is to use multirate filtering techniques to split the long adaptive filter into short subband adaptive filters. A new type of non-overlapping subband scheme has gained popularity in acoustic echo cancellation schemes. This scheme has high computational complexity, but can be easily implemented in real-time on floating-point hardware. In this thesis, a new twin fixed- point parallel DSP architecture has been proposed and designed to meet the complexity of the subband-based adaptive algorithm. The new DSP architecture utilizes a high-speed synchronous link to achieve fast data exchange and parallel execution of time-intensive applications. The simulation and real-time results confirm the feasibility of the algorithm in the new architecture. A pole-zero model along with an adaptive lattice filter structure is suggested for the new subband scheme. The new HR lattice model has been computer- simulated and the results are presented. The thesis also discusses some of the theoretical basics required for subband and lattice structures. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

40|$|With {{acoustic}} echo cancellation for hands-free communications, dominant nonlinearities {{occur at the}} loudspeaker and its amplifier. This contribution addresses memoryless nonlinearities as they are common, e. g., in loudspeaker amplifiers of mobile phone terminals. An NLMS (normalized least mean square) -type adaptation algorithm is investigated which allows simultaneous identification of a nonlinearity modeled by a polynomial, followed by a linear FIR system. For {{the analysis of the}} proposed algorithm, we introduce a signal-independent distance measure which provides more insight into the adaptation behavior than the commonly used ERLE (echo return loss enhancement) measure. A difficult issue with cascaded adaptive filters is the adaptation stepsize control, which is discussed in detail.

As examples for the preprocessor a hard clipping curve and a polynomial are considered. Fast convergence of the latter is achieved with signal orthogonalization or RLS adaptation.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} and compares algorithms for combined acoustic echo cancellation and noise reduction for <b>hands-free</b> <b>telephones.</b> A structure is proposed, {{consisting of a}} conventional acoustic echo canceler and a frequency domain postfilter in the sending path of the hands-free system. The postfilter applies the spectral weighting technique and attenuates both the background noise and the residual echo which remains after imperfect echo cancellation. Two weighting rules for the postfilter are discussed. The first is a conventional one, known from noise reduction, which is extended to attenuate residual echo as well as noise. The second is a psychoa-coustically motivated weighting rule. Both rules are evaluated and compared by instrumental and auditive tests. They succeed about equally well in attenuating the noise and the residual echo. In lis-tening tests, however, the psychoacoustically motivated weighting rule is mostly preferred since it leads to more natural near end speech and to less annoying residual noise.

This thesis is on a new method for improving the convergence speed of the normalised least mean square (NLMS) algorithm when the input is a coloured signal, such as speech, that can be decorrelated using linear prediction. The proposed method gives a significant improvement in the convergence speed and requires very little additional computation in terms of arithmetic operations and memory space. It is also very easy to implement. An {{important aspect of the}} proposed method is its inherent stability irrespective of the order of the prediction-error filter or {{the manner in which it}} is adapted. This allows the proposed method to be used without any restrictions beyond those of the conventional NLMS algorithm. Following the stability analysis, a further improvement to the basic proposed method is suggested. This improvement is restricted to the cases where the input signal is decorrelated by a prediction-error filter of up to order two. The proposed method finds immediate application in acoustic echo cancellation in <b>hands-free</b> <b>telephones</b> where the impulse response of the system (echo path) to be identified is very long and the identification has to be done in real time. Such an application requires an algorithm with low computational complexity and a fast rate of convergence.
