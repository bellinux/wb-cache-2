40|$|Road {{traffic jams}} {{continue}} {{to remain a}} major problem in most cities around the world, especially in developing regions resulting in mas-sive delays, increased fuel wastage and monetary losses. Due to the poorly planned road networks, a common outcome in many de-veloping regions is the presence of small critical areas which are common hot-spots for congestion; poor traffic management around these hotspots potentially results in elongated traffic jams. In this paper, we first present a simple automated image processing mech-anism for detecting the congestion levels in road traffic by process-ing CCTV camera image feeds. Our algorithm is specifically de-signed for noisy traffic feeds with poor image quality. Based on live CCTV camera feeds from multiple traffic signals in Kenya and Brazil, we show evidence of this congestion collapse behav-ior lasting long time-periods across multiple locations. To partially alleviate this problem, we present a local <b>de-congestion</b> protocol that coordinates traffic signal behavior within a small area and can locally prevent congestion collapse sustaining time variant traffic bursts. Based on a simulation based analysis on simple network topologies, we show that our local <b>de-congestion</b> protocol can en-hance road capacity and prevent congestion collapse in localized settings...|$|E
40|$|Heliports are {{relatively}} small infrastructures able to serve medium volumes of regional traffic in poor accessible areas or in zones just located to the next proximity, {{or in some cases}} inside, urban areas. The spaces required for the movement of heli-copters on the airsides of these infrastructures are far smaller than those required for airplanes. This characteristics derives from the great flexibility of the VTOL in mov-ing in tight spaces. On the other hand, the need for land saving especially in those filled areas within the major cities requires infrastructures large no more than a block. The use of the helicopter as a mean of transport to serve the traffic between cities and airports is a way to improve the performances of the major hubs by the <b>de-congestion</b> of traffic affecting both the landside and the airside and to increase the at-tractiveness towards otherwise inaccessible zones. This paper seeks to evaluate the efficiency of some heliports by using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The DEA is a non-parametric method used in Opera-tions Research for measuring and evaluating the performance of a group of DMUs (Decision Making Units). There is a great variety of applications of DEA for use in evaluating the performances of many different kinds of entities (hospitals, universi-ties, enterprises, airports etc.) engaged in different activities in many different con-texts in many different countries. Here we intend to investigate the inefficiencies linked to the infrastructural and operational features of a group of transport heliports where scheduled flights are supplied. Both CCR and BCC models are implemented to evaluate the efficiency in the Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) and Variable Re-turns to Scale (VRS) cases. Inputs and outputs are selected in virtue of the aim that we want to pursue in each simulation, {{on the basis of the}} infrastructural and opera-tional requirements of the heliports. In order to highlight the ranking of the DMUs under evaluation, a super-efficiency model is applied to the same peer group of heliports. The super-efficiency score enables one to distinguish between the efficient observations. In particular, the super-efficiency measure examines the maximal radial change in inputs and/or out-puts for an observation to remain efficient. Finally, the inference on the results allows to draw conclusions on the im-portance of the heliports as infrastructures to serve passenger traffic...|$|E
40|$|A high {{performance}} HW accelerator is proposed to extract and refine the Interest Points from images, by accurately calculating the Difference-of-Gaussian and using refinement algorithms from the SIFT method. Unique {{features of the}} accelerator consist in an accuracy comparable to the CDVS Test Model, reference software; in the capability to process the incoming pixel in streaming order to minimize the amount of embedded memory and avoid external frame buffers; in the possibility to configure the processor with different area/speed ratios. FPGA synthesis on a Xilinx XC 7 V 2000 T returns a maximum operation frequency up of 309 MHz at the fastest corner. Standard cell synthesis with the STMICROELECTRONICS FDSOI 28 nm technology, <b>de-congestioned</b> {{by the use of}} DPREG memories in place of SRAM, gives a maximum frequency of 1. 2 GHz and a power dissipation of about 1 W at the typical conditions...|$|R
