5|$|In 1988, the East German {{leadership}} considered {{proposals to}} replace the expensive and intrusive fortifications with a <b>high-technology</b> system codenamed Grenze 2000. Drawing on technology used by the Soviet Army during the Soviet–Afghan War, it would have replaced the fences with sensors and detectors. However, the plan was never implemented.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{manufactured}} 3.4 {{percent of}} total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking tenth among the 48 states. In Eastern Massachusetts, following World War II, the economy was transformed from one based on heavy industry into a service-based economy. Government contracts, private investment, and research facilities led to a new and improved industrial climate, with reduced unemployment and increased per capita income. Suburbanization flourished, and by the 1970s, the Route 128 corridor was dotted with <b>high-technology</b> companies who recruited graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Defence Force {{seeks to}} be a <b>high-technology</b> force, {{and much of}} its {{equipment}} {{is scheduled to be}} replaced or upgraded in the near future. Australia does not possess {{weapons of mass destruction and}} has ratified the Biological Weapons Convention, Chemical Weapons Convention and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Although most of the ADF's weapons are only used by single service, there is an increasing emphasis on commonality. The three services use the same small arms and the FN Herstal 35 is the ADF's standard hand gun, the F88 Austeyr the standard rifle, the F89 Minimi the standard light support weapon, the FN Herstal MAG-58 the standard light machine gun and the Browning M2HB the standard heavy machine gun.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} corporate performance and the Chief Executive Officer compensation in high- technology firms in the S&P 1500. The total CEO compensation and short and long-term compensations were tested regarding corporate performance. A panel data SUR model is estimated and describes the total compensation and cash compensation {{as a proportion of}} total pay for the period between 2000 and 2010 in <b>high-technologies</b> firms. The findings indicate that there is a strong and positive relation between CEO compensation and firm performance. This econometric study provides a better understanding on the relationship between CEO compensation and performance in <b>high-technologies</b> firms...|$|R
5|$|The city's skyline {{changed in}} the 1960s and 1970s with the {{construction}} of office towers around the Empire State Plaza and at the uptown campus of SUNY Albany, mainly under the direction of Governor Nelson Rockefeller. While Albany experienced a decline in its population due to urban sprawl and suburbanization, many of its historic neighborhoods were saved from destruction through the policies of Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd, the longest-serving mayor of any city in the United States. In the early 21st century, Albany has experienced growth in the <b>high-technology</b> industry, with great strides in the nanotechnology sector.|$|E
5|$|London was {{historically}} a centre {{for trade}} and arbitration, which Peter S. Smedresman, {{writing in the}} Journal of Maritime Law and Commerce divides into three categories of transaction. English commodities trading, through bodies such as the Baltic Exchange, specify that any conflicts are to be settled through arbitration in London, even when the goods being traded have {{no relation to the}} United Kingdom. London has also been a centre for arbitration on maritime issues, and insurance. However, it failed to significantly attract more modern forms of trade, such as major communications developments or <b>high-technology</b> projects, {{due to the nature of}} its arbitration law. These contracts normally involve large amounts of money and are administered by the International Chamber of Commerce, which rarely sent arbitration cases to London due to the individual nature of English law on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Somerset is an {{important}} supplier of defence equipment and technology. A Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Bridgwater was built {{at the start of}} the Second World War, between the villages of Puriton and Woolavington, to manufacture explosives. The site was decommissioned and closed in July 2008. Templecombe has Thales Underwater Systems, and Taunton presently has the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office and Avimo, which became part of Thales Optics. It has been announced twice, in 2006 and 2007, that manufacturing is to end at Thales Optics' Taunton site, but the trade unions and Taunton Deane District Council are working to reverse or mitigate these decisions. Other <b>high-technology</b> companies include the optics company Gooch and Housego, at Ilminster. There are Ministry of Defence offices in Bath, and Norton Fitzwarren is the home of 40 Commando Royal Marines. The Royal Naval Air Station in Yeovilton, is one of Britain's two active Fleet Air Arm bases and is home to the Royal Navy's Lynx helicopters and the Royal Marines Commando Westland Sea Kings. Around 1,675 service and 2,000 civilian personnel are stationed at Yeovilton and key activities include training of aircrew and engineers and the Royal Navy's Fighter Controllers and surface-based aircraft controllers.|$|E
30|$|The field {{emission}} {{scanning electron microscopy}} (FE-SEM) images were taken with Hitachi SU 8000 (Hitachi <b>High-Technologies</b> Corporation, Tokyo, Japan); SEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM 2000 Fx (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).|$|R
30|$|The morphologies of the hydrogels were {{characterized}} using a S- 4800 field-emission {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM; Hitachi <b>High-Technologies</b> Co., Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 3  kV. All samples were freeze-dried and sputter-coated with platinum using an E 1045 Pt-coater (Hitachi <b>High-technologies</b> Co., Japan) before characterization. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of Fmoc-FF, alginate, and Fmoc-FF–alginate hydrogels were recorded on a Nicolet- 560 FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet Co., USA). The hydrogels were freeze-dried and deposited {{on the surface of}} the KBr plate, and the FTIR spectra were recorded across the range of 400 – 4000  cm– 1 with 20 scans and a resolution of 4  cm– 1.|$|R
30|$|Polyethylene {{precipitates}} {{were carefully}} transferred on an adhesive tape {{on a platform}} for SEM observation to avoid deformation of the specimens.

5|$|The three member team is {{composed}} of Edward Tolby, his daughter, Silvia Tolby (of unspecified age, but vaguely described as an adolescent or young adult), and their mutual friend, Robert Penn. While {{en route to the}} valley, the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax. Fairfax is littered with ancient, decaying gadgets; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society, which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce. Excited by the strangers, the locals ask about the League. Tolby answers their questions in turn, ending with an explanation of the timeline of events which led up to the great revolt. The event is summarized as having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments. After France exists for a month free of government, millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the nuclear powers. At each toppled government center, millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed. These events result in the setting of the story; a world full of anachronistic <b>high-technology,</b> interspersed in a pre-industrialized, agrarian culture.|$|E

25|$|The {{finance and}} real estate {{industries}} bloomed in the 1990s. However, the dependence on such industries caused a loss of competitiveness between products produced by Hong Kong-based manufacturers and those from the international market. The other Asian Tigers had developed capital-intensive industries such as crude oil, computers and heavy industries. As a result, the government of Hong Kong has tried to develop knowledge-based, <b>high-technology</b> and higher-value-added industries. <b>High-technology</b> training programmes have been provided as well as courses related to information technology and biotechnology. Land was used for <b>high-technology</b> industries, notably Cyberport. Research centres {{have been set up}} to support such industries, notably the Hong Kong Science and Technology Park. <b>High-technology</b> exports took up one-third of Hong Kong's total exports in 2005. Manufacturing workers who are unskilled in other areas are unemployed as a result of industrial relocation. To aid them, the government provided retraining programmes, allowing them, especially those in the tertiary industry, to get new jobs.|$|E

30|$|T. toreumaticus embryos and larvae {{were fixed}} with 1 % osmium tetroxide in 0.6  M sucrose and 0.05  M sodium-cacodylate buffer (pH  7.4) for 1  h on ice or with 4 % {{formaldehyde}} in ASW for approximately 1  h {{at room temperature}} as previously described (Kitazawa et al. 2012). The fixed specimens were dehydrated in graded ethanol dilutions and gradually transferred to 2 -methyl- 2 -propanol (ethanol, 2 -methyl- 2 -propanol ratios of 3 : 1, 1 : 1, and 1 : 3). After washing twice with 2 -methyl- 2 -propanol, the specimens were freeze-dried (model BFD- 21 S, Vacuum Device Inc., Ibaraki, Japan). The dried specimens were mounted on an aluminum stage using double-sided conductive aluminum tape and then coated with gold using a fine ion sputter (E- 1010, Hitachi <b>High-Technologies,</b> Tokyo, Japan). They were then observed and photographed under the scanning electron microscope (Miniscope TM- 1000 S, Hitachi <b>High-Technologies).</b>|$|R
30|$|The phase {{structures}} of the samples were characterized by using an X-ray diffraction spectrometer (XRD, D 8 Advanced XRD; Bruker AXS, Karlsruhe, Germany) with Cu Kα radiation.
