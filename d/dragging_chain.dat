60|$|Just as it {{had done}} before, when Bridge and The Oskaloosa Kid had taken refuge there with the girl, the THING moved {{down the hallway to}} the closed door. The <b>dragging</b> <b>chain</b> marked each foot of its advance. If it made other sounds they were drowned by the clanking of the links over the time {{roughened}} flooring.|$|E
60|$|The {{sound of}} the <b>dragging</b> <b>chain</b> could be heard at {{intervals}} upon the floor below. It seemed to the tense listeners above to pause beside the dead man as though hovering in gloating exultation above its gruesome prey and then it moved again, this time toward the stairway where they all heard it ascending with a creepy slowness which wrought more terribly upon tense nerves than would a sudden rush.|$|E
6000|$|The {{cause of}} their {{perturbation}} was imprinted deeply in the mud of the pathway--the irregular outlines of an enormous, naked, human foot--a great, uncouth foot that bespoke a monster of another world. While, still more uncanny, in view {{of what they had}} heard in the farm house during the previous night, there lay, sometimes partially obliterated by the footprints of the THING, the impress of a small, bare foot--a woman's or a child's--and over both an irregular scoring that might have been wrought by a <b>dragging</b> <b>chain!</b> ...|$|E

60|$|With {{trembling}} hands The Oskaloosa Kid directed the lens {{over the edge}} of the swaying and rotting bannister. His finger slipped from the lighting button plunging them all into darkness. In his frantic effort to find the button and relight the lamp the worst occurred--he fumbled the button and the lamp slipped through his fingers, falling over the bannister to the floor below. Instantly the sound of the <b>dragging</b> <b>chain</b> ceased; but the silence was even more horrible than the noise which had preceded it.|$|E
60|$|In the {{resultant}} light the man saw {{with a quick}} glance a large room furnished with an old walnut bed, dresser, and commode; two lightless windows opened {{at the far end}} toward the road, Bridge assumed; and there was no door other than that against which he leaned. In the last flicker of the match the man scanned the door itself for a lock and, to his relief, discovered a bolt--old and rusty it was, but it still moved in its sleeve. An instant later it was shot--just as the sound of the <b>dragging</b> <b>chain</b> ceased outside. Near the door was the great bed, and this Bridge dragged before it as an additional barricade; then, bearing nothing more from the hallway, he {{turned his attention to the}} two unconscious forms upon the floor. Unhesitatingly he went to the boy first though had he questioned himself he could not have told why; for the youth, undoubtedly, had only swooned, while the girl had been the victim of a murderous assault and might even be at the point of death.|$|E
5000|$|The ASPB, {{better known}} as the [...] "Alpha" [...] boat, was {{approximately}} 50 ft long, its hull was constructed of 7/32 inch steel, from the gunwale 2" [...] up it was 1/8 inch steel, its superstructure was 1/4 inch aluminum. It was armed with two Mk 48 turrets with either 20 mm or [...]50 cal machine guns, two single 7.62 mm machine guns, one 81 mm mortar, a <b>dragging</b> <b>chain</b> for mine sweeping the river, and had a complement of five crewmen. The 20 mm Mk16 Mod 4 Colt 20mm automatic cannon was derived from the AN/M3 version of the Hispano-Suiza HS.404 and was also found on the LCMs and PBRs but was prone to jamming. The ASPB itself was built especially strongly to resist the explosion of mines; consequently, the [...] "Alpha" [...] boat is mainly remembered for its riverine mine-sweeping duties.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "cleaned" [...] gases are {{normally}} {{passed through a}} mist eliminator (demister pads) to remove water droplets from the gas stream. The dirty water from the scrubber system is either cleaned and discharged or recycled to the scrubber.

40|$|Abstract — Drag {{conveyors}} are {{the most}} efficient medium of material handling for conveying higher volume {{from one place to}} another. In horizontal condition <b>drag</b> <b>chain</b> conveyors can handle material up to 45 - 50 % of cross sectional area of the trough. In between the drive and non drive ends of drag conveyor an endless chain, having wide links carrying projection or wings are drags a bed of bulk material from feeding end to discharge end. <b>Drag</b> conveyor <b>chains</b> are work under the very extreme conditions such as high tensile load, friction and some time hazardous operating environment (e. g. presence of humidity, chemicals). Due to versatile application various failures are occurred in the <b>drag</b> conveyor <b>chain</b> and causes loss of productivity and corrective maintenance in the system. In this paper we emphasis on appropriate design changes by which can reduce cost of <b>drag</b> conveyor <b>chain</b> and enhance the performance...|$|R
60|$|This {{might have}} lasted half a minute, or a minute, {{but it seemed}} an hour. The bells ceased, as they had begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking noise, deep down below, as if some person were <b>dragging</b> a heavy <b>chain</b> over the casks in the wine merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were {{described}} as <b>dragging</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|R
60|$|He never {{finished}} the sentence. From {{the depths of}} the cellar came the sound of a clanking chain. Something scratched heavily upon the wooden steps. Whatever it was it was evidently ascending, while behind it clanked the heavy links of a <b>dragged</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R

50|$|Krampus is {{a terrifying}} figure found {{in parts of}} Austria, Slovenia, and Croatia, most {{probably}} originating in the Pre-Christian Alpine traditions.

5000|$|Located {{two miles}} west of Cudworth is the {{historic}} Our Lady of Sorrows Shrine. The site consists of an altar, chapel, statue and Stations of the Cross on a hill west of Highway 2. The shrine was established after three children saw a beautiful sad lady <b>dragging</b> <b>chains</b> and carrying a golden cross [...] - [...] when they approached her, she vanished. There is an annual pilgrimage every year on the tenth Sunday after Easter. It is an official pilgrimage of the Saskatoon Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{according}} to professor Jürgen Handke, for some time, {{there was a}} phonetic split between words with the vowel [...] and the diphthong , in words where the Middle English [...] shifted to the Modern English [...] For an example, high was pronounced with the vowel , and like and my were pronounced with the diphthong [...] Therefore, for logical reasons, the close vowels [...] could have diphthongized before the close-mid vowels [...] raised. Otherwise, high would probably rhyme with thee rather than my. This type of chain is called a <b>drag</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R

50|$|If a {{woman had}} {{improper}} relations {{with one of the}} relatives of Almamula, he would punish that woman by transforming her into a series of different forms. First, the woman was transformed in a bogey that would stroll about in the night, seducing, murdering, and devouring any men that she encountered who were alone. Later, Almamula would transform the woman into a mule. The woman, in mule form, would be forced to <b>drag</b> <b>chains</b> during nights on which there were thunderstorms. Finally, Almamula would turn the unfortunate woman into a gigantic black dog with teeth of fire.|$|R
5000|$|Oppenheim, a {{schoolmaster}} in {{the small}} town, concerned that his older male students often missed school loading and spreading manure, patented a wagon that, behind the <b>drag</b> <b>chain</b> and two beaters, incorporated a steel axle with several wooden paddles attached to the shaft {{at an angle to}} throw the manure outward in a broad pattern eliminating the necessity for manual spreading. On October 18, 1899, Oppenheim began to produce his new manure spreader, incorporating the “widespread” paddle device. [...] Neighbors soon referred to it as “Oppenheim’s new idea” and Oppenheim adopted this name for his business.|$|R
50|$|Delamination failure may be {{detected}} in the material by its sound; solid composite has bright sound, while delaminated part sounds dull, reinforced concrete sounds solid, whereas delaminated concrete will have a light drum-like sound when exposed to a <b>dragged</b> <b>chain</b> pulled across its surface. Bridge decks in cold climate countries which use de-icing salts and chemicals are commonly subject to delamination and as such are typically scheduled for annual inspection by chain-dragging as well as subsequent patch repairs of the surface. Other nondestructive testing methods are used, including embedding optical fibers coupled with optical time domain reflectometer testing of their state, testing with ultrasound, radiographic imaging, and infrared imaging.|$|R

5000|$|Joseph Oppenheim of Maria Stein, Ohio was the {{inventor}} of the first modern 'widespreading' manure spreader and is honored as such in the Ohio Agricultural Hall of Fame. [...] Originally manure was thrown from a wagon. Later, “manure unloaders” used a <b>drag</b> <b>chain</b> {{at the bottom of the}} wagon to pull the load of manure to the rear where it was shredded by a pair of beaters. [...] Because the unloaders deposited manure directly behind the wagon but with very little spreading to the sides, farmers still had to take the time-consuming step of heading into the fields with peg-tooth drags or similar implements to spread the manure in order to prevent burning the soil.|$|R

50|$|Grain combine {{fires are}} {{responsible}} for {{millions of dollars of}} loss each year. Fires usually start near the engine where dust and dry crop debris accumulate. Fires can also start when heat is introduced by bearings or gearboxes that have failed. From 1984 to 2000, 695 major grain combine fires were reported to U.S. local fire departments. <b>Dragging</b> <b>chains</b> to reduce static electricity was one method employed for preventing harvester fires, but the role of static electricity linked to causing harvester fires is yet to be established. The application of the appropriate synthetic greases will reduce the friction experienced at crucial points, i.e. chains, sprockets and gear boxes compared to petroleum based lubricants. Engines with synthetic lubricants will also remain significantly cooler during operation.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>drag</b> <b>chain</b> or {{pull chain}} is a chain shift {{in which the}} phoneme at the [...] "leading" [...] edge of the chain changes first. In the example above, the chain shift would be a pull chain if [...] changed to [...] first, opening up a space at the {{position}} of [...] which [...] then moved to fill. A push chain is a chain shift in which the phoneme at the [...] "end" [...] of the chain moves first: in this example, if [...] moved toward , creating a [...] "crowding" [...] effect and causing [...] to move toward , and so forth. It is not known which phonemes changed first during the Great Vowel Shift; many scholars believe the high vowels such as [...] started the shift, but some suggest that the low vowels, such as , may have shifted first.|$|R

CARTOGRAPHIES {{is grounded in}} a theoretical framework which combines post-structural semiotics nd a philosophy of the body. Drawing particularly {{on the work of}} Derrida, Foucault, Deleuze, Irigaray and Benjamin, the chapters variously challenge the distinction between material reality and representation. Richard Rorty's vision of the liberal utopia, which he outlines in the introduction to his recent book, Contingency, Irony and Solidarity, is an explicit example of a narrative that is common, if submerged, in many recent adaptations of post-structuralism. The utopian pleasures of the text promise liberation from the cramping empiricism of science, the leaden labour of politics, and the <b>dragging</b> <b>chains</b> of metaphysics. Or is it a delusional escape? Rorty' book is dedicated: 'In memory of six liberals: my parents and grandparents'.
