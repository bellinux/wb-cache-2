500|$|Early {{precursors}} of {{the word}} beryllium {{can be traced to}} many languages, including Latin Beryllus; French Béry; Greek βήρυλλος, bērullos, beryl; Prakrit veruliya (वॆरुलिय‌); Pāli veḷuriya (वेलुरिय), veḷiru (भेलिरु) or viḷar (भिलर्) – [...] "to become pale", in reference to the pale semiprecious gemstone beryl. The original source is probably the Sanskrit word वैडूर्य (vaidurya), which is of South Indian origin and could be related to the name of the modern city of Belur. For about 160 years, beryllium was also known as [...] <b>glucinum</b> or glucinium (with the accompanying chemical symbol [...] "Gl", or [...] "G" [...] ), the name coming from the Greek word for sweet: γλυκυς, due to the sweet taste of beryllium salts.|$|E
50|$|His {{original}} research {{began in}} Göttingen with investigations on {{the combination of}} alcohol radicles with selenium, in which field {{he was one of}} the earliest workers. Later he examined the compounds of <b>glucinum,</b> and published an account of his investigations in the American Journal of Science. He also made numerous analyses of minerals and meteorites. Of the former, many were contributed to Dana's Mineralogy.|$|E

40|$|During an {{extensive}} {{experimental study of}} ultrasound * we learned that such energy can inhibit the growth of bone in animals. Obviously the use of ultrasound on bone tumours presented itself as a potential therapeutic procedure. Since a method for producing such tumours with beryllium was available we endeavoured to produce in rabbits a series of such tumours upon which the effects of ultrasonic energy might be studied. As we proceeded with tile work of producing and studying such tumours certain pathological changes were observed, particularly in the spleen, which seemed of sufficient interest to justify a separate report. This report, then, is restricted to a consideration of pathological changes developing in the organs of the rabbit after intravenous injections of beryllium material. Particular emphasis {{is given to the}} pathological changes which accompanied the development of bone tumours, and to the apparent relationship between tumour-genesis in the bones and atrophy of the spleen. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Beryllium, a rare metallic element, was discovered by Vauquelin about 1798 and was named <b>glucinum</b> because certain of its salts have a sweet taste. In nature it occurs i...|$|E
