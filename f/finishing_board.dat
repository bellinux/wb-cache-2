40|$|In {{the present}} {{research}} the investigation of <b>finishing</b> wood particle <b>boards</b> is presented. The testing process of wood particle boards involved an original stand. The following three types of <b>finished</b> <b>boards</b> underwent evaluation: <b>finished</b> with veneer on both sides, finished with veneer {{on the one side}} and with compensatory paper on the other side, and finished with melamine impregnated paper on both sides. It was established that the first vibrational modes of <b>finished</b> wood particle <b>boards</b> in two perpendicular directions share similarity with modes of the beam-shaped body in terms of their shape. It was obtained that the modulus of elasticity of wood particle <b>boards</b> with different <b>finishing</b> differs by approximately 30  % – 70  % in two perpendicular directions. It was established that when dealing with <b>boards</b> <b>finished</b> with veneer on both sides, with veneer on the one side and compensatory paper on the other side, and with melamine impregnated paper, the value of the modulus of elasticity in two perpendicular directions differs by 1. 71, 1. 54 and 1. 34 times, respectively. It was found {{that in the case of}} <b>boards</b> <b>finished</b> with veneer on both sides and with veneer on the one side and compensatory paper on the other side, the coefficient of damping change in two perpendicular directions is less than the one of the <b>board</b> <b>finished</b> with melamine impregnated paper by 25 %.

These changes were made in time to capture some explosive growth. Historically, the PCB market had grown about 6% a year, but from 1995-2000 it grew at 10%. By 2000, the company's sales had increased to $30 million. Laser drilling, better solder masking for finishing printed circuitry, and semi-automated systems for electrical testing of <b>finished</b> <b>boards</b> were the major improvements needed to get to industry parity.|$|R

50|$|When {{combined}} with built-in self-test (BIST), the JTAG scan chain enables a low overhead, embedded solution to testing an IC for certain static faults (shorts, opens, and logic errors). The scan chain mechanism does not generally help diagnose or test for timing, temperature or other dynamic operational errors that may occur. Test cases are often provided in standardized formats such as SVF, or its binary sibling XSVF, {{and used in}} production tests. The ability to perform such testing on <b>finished</b> <b>boards</b> {{is an essential part}} of Design For Test in today's products, increasing the number of faults that can be found before products ship to customers.|$|R

40|$|The warp of {{corrugated}} board {{is the most}} prevalent quality problem in{{corrugated board}} industry. Nowadays corrugators provide high quality board but there often occurs a warp problem within the production of some board grades. One {{of the main reasons}} for that are the humidity and the temperature levels of the raw materials. The goal of the research is to find out howthe adjusted corrugator recipe parameters required for appropriate running of the corrugated board are repeatable for the considered board grades, how the temperature and humidity imbalances of the raw material papers influence on the warpformation of the <b>finished</b> <b>board.</b> Furthermore, the solutions for preventing warpof corrugated board are presented in the thesis...|$|R
