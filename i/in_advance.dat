40|$|To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy of megestrol acetate (MA) <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> breast cancer. We searched CBM, CNKI, VIP, Wangfang Data and PubMed, and collected randomized controlled trials (RCT) of adjuvant chemotherapy of MA <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> breast cancer. MA significantly increased treatment efficiency (p = 0. 0010); improve weight (p< 0. 0001), appetite (p = 0. 001) and KPS (p = 0. 06); ameliorate leucopenia (p = 0. 02), thrombocytopenia (p = 0. 02) and hemoglobin (p = 0. 01); reduce gastrointestinal reaction (p = 0. 0005) of the patients of adjuvant chemotherapy <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> breast cancer. MA significantly increased treatment efficiency, improve the nutritional situation, reduce bone marrow suppression, and gastrointestinal reaction of the patients of adjuvant chemotherapy <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> breast cancer. High-quality RCTs are needed to guidance for preliminary studies of the effective treatment of adjuvant chemotherapy of MA <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> breast cancer...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the differences between}} the impacts of fiscal policy <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> versus emerging economies. The emergence of substantial fiscal deficits and a large build-up of government debt <b>in</b> major <b>advanced</b> economies will inevitably lead to a period of fiscal consolidation in coming years. In an earlier paper, McKibbin and Stoeckel explored the effects of this fiscal adjustment <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> economies on the global economic outlook. This paper focuses on {{the differences between the}} impacts of fiscal policy <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> versus emerging economies. In particular, the need for more fiscal spending on infrastructure in emerging economies and the need for fiscal consolidation <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> economies leads naturally {{to the question of what}} this asymmetric fiscal adjustment might do to global trade balances as well as global economic growth over the coming decades...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the effects of Integrated Instructional Model on Students achievement <b>in</b> <b>Advanced</b> Financial Accounting <b>in</b> Nigerian Universities. Poor performance of students <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> financial accounting informed the study. The study employed a non-equivalent control group quasi-experimental design. The sample for the study comprised of five hundred and thirty seven (537) final year students drawn from four universities in the South-East Geopolitical Zone of Nigeria. Three research questions and three null hypotheses tested at 0. 05 level of significance guided the study. Data on students’ achievement <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> financial accounting were collected using accounting achievement test. Data were analysed using mean, standard deviation and analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA). Result revealed that the Integrated Instructional Model (IIM) is superior to the conventional teaching method in enhancing achievement <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> financial accounting. It also revealed that IIM has no significant differential effect on the mean achievement scores {{of males and females}} <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> financial accounting. The test of interaction revealed that gender had no significant interaction with teaching methods on achievement <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> financial accounting. Based on the findings, it was recommended that the IIM should be incorporated in financial accounting curriculum in order to enhance students’ achievement...|$|R

40|$|This paper first compares house price cycles <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> and {{emerging}} economies {{using a new}} quarterly house price dataset covering the period 1990 - 2012. It is found that that house prices in emerging economies grow faster, are more volatile, less persistent and less synchronized across countries than <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> economies. They also correlate more closely with capital flows than <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> economies. The analysis is then conditioned on an exogenous change to global liquidity, broadly understood {{as a proxy for}} the international supply of credit. It is found that in emerging markets a global liquidity shock has a much stronger impact on house prices and consumption than <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> economies. Finally, holding house prices constant in response to this shock tends to dampen its effects on consumption <b>in</b> both <b>advanced</b> {{and emerging}} economies, but possibly through different channels: <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> economies by boosting the value of housing collateral and hence supporting domestic borrowing, and in emerging markets by appreciating the exchange rate and hence supporting the international borrowing capacity of the economy...|$|R
