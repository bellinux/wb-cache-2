5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle's affinities {{beyond the}} Sanford's sea eagle {{are a little}} less clear; {{molecular}} data indicate that {{it is one of}} four species of tropical sea eagle (along with the African <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> and the Madagascar <b>fish</b> <b>eagle),</b> while allozyme data indicate it might have a closer relationship with the sea eagles of the northern hemisphere. A further molecular study published in 2005 showed the white-bellied and Sanford's sea eagles to be basal to the four fish eagles (the two mentioned above plus the two hitherto untested species of the genus Ichthyophaga).|$|E

5|$|The plumage of {{an adult}} bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is {{moderately}} long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism {{is evident in the}} species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> (H. vocifer) (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.|$|E
40|$|African <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> (Haliaeetus vocifer) are {{important}} {{birds of prey}} and indicator of ecosystem integrity in aquatic environments. We assessed the population abundance and spatial distribution of African <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> along three major rivers in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe. Data were collected using walked transect surveys along Mwenezi, Runde and Save rivers in Gonarezhou between March and April 2011. A total of 54 African <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> were recorded with an average density of 0. 62 individuals per km. African <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> were mostly distributed in areas with large water pools along Gonarezhou’s three major rivers. The results suggest that large pools along perennial rivers {{are important}} in the distribution and density of African <b>fish</b> <b>eagles</b> in Gonarezhou. Future studies should aim at establishing the long-term population trends of birds of prey in Gonarezho...|$|R
50|$|Alongside human activities, {{natural enemies}} include cheetahs, leopards and lions, which all {{sometimes}} prey on this species. Eggs may be also {{at risk of}} predation by African <b>fish</b> <b>eagles.</b> At one colony in Kisumu, Kenya, approximately 61% of eggs counted between all nests hatched and 38% were predated by <b>Fish</b> <b>Eagles.</b> The success rate of fledglings was only 0.33 young per nest. However, increased egg predation by <b>Fish</b> <b>Eagles</b> {{has been reported to}} be linked to decline in fish stocks in the Winam Gulf.|$|R

25|$|At one time, {{the golden}} eagle {{lived in a}} great {{majority}} of temperate Europe, North Asia, North America, North Africa, and Japan. Although widespread and quite secure in some areas, {{in many parts of}} the range golden eagles have experienced sharp population declines and have even been extirpated from some areas. The total number of individual golden eagles from around the range is estimated to range somewhere between 170,000 and 250,000 while the estimated total number of breeding pairs ranges from 60,000 to 100,000. Few other eagle species are as numerous, though some species like tawny eagle, wedge-tailed eagle and bald eagle have total estimated populations of a similar size to the golden eagle’s despite having distributions which are more restricted. The world’s most populous eagle may be the African <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> (Haliaeetus vocifer), which has a stable total population estimated at 300,000 individuals and is found solely in Africa. On a global scale, the golden eagle is not considered threatened by the IUCN.|$|E
500|$|In the faunal {{geographical}} {{province of}} the Burkhan Khaldun Mountain in the Khentii district the fauna reported are more than [...] "50 species of 27 genera of six orders including five species of mammals/insectivores, 4 species of hymenoptera, [...] four species of lagomorpha, 19 species of rodents, 13 species of predators, five species of ungulate, one species of reptile, and 253 species of birds". According to the Mongolian Red Data Book the very rare mammal species are musk deer (Moshus moshiferus) and moose (Alces alces); the very rare bird species are the Siberian white crane (Grus luecogeranus), Greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga), Pallas’s <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> (Haliaeetus leucoryphus), white-naped crane (Grus vipio) and hooded crane (Grus monacha); the fish species is the Amur sturgeon (Acipenser schrenckii).|$|E
2500|$|Kaziranga hosts a {{large number}} of raptors, {{considered}} a sign of a healthy ecosystem. This includes the rare eastern imperial eagle, greater spotted eagle, white-tailed fishing eagle, Pallas's <b>fish</b> <b>eagle,</b> grey-headed <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> and the lesser kestrel. Kaziranga was once home to seven species of vultures. About 99% of the stable vulture population was killed by kidney failure caused by consuming the veterinary drug diclofenac in domestic animal carcasses. Of these, the red-headed vulture, and Eurasian black vulture are still near threatened due to their large range, but the Indian vulture, slender-billed vulture and the Indian white-rumped vulture have suffered cataclysmic loss of numbers and are virtually extinct in the wild, including Kaziranga. The Indian populations of the other two vultures have similar losses [...] the griffon vulture and the Himalayan griffon, but they are still well represented outside India. The loss of this many vultures creates a critical void in the scavengers ecological niche in Kaziranga.|$|E

2500|$|The {{conservation}} area or habitat in the Phobhjikha Valley, established in 2003 has, {{not only the}} black-necked cranes, but also 13 other vulnerable species such as rufous-necked hornbill Aceros nipalensis, chestnut-breasted partridge Arborophila mandellii, Pallas's <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> Haliaeetus leucoryphus, nuthatch Sitta Formosa, wood snipe Gallinago nemoricola, Blyth's tragopan Tragopan blythii, greater spotted eagle Clanga clanga, imperial eagle Aquila heliaca, Baer's pochard Aythya baeri, Hodgson's bushchat Saxicola insignis, dark-rumped swift Apus acuticauda, and grey-crowned prinia Prinia cinereocapilla. The black-necked cranes arrive in this valley in late October and depart in mid February. They feed on the particular type of dwarf bamboos that grow in the wetlands of the valley. The thick grasslands of wetlands are also grazing grounds for {{a large number of}} cattle and horses during the summer months that helps the growth of the tender bamboo shoots on which the cranes feed later during the winter season. There were suggestions that the wetlands be drained and used to grow cash crops such as potatoes, which is also the main crop of the valley. Such an action would have deprived the cranes of their main feeding centres. However, Palje [...] "Benjie" [...] Dorji, former Chief Justice of Bhutan, former Minister for Environment and uncle of the present King of Bhutan, as the Chairman of the Royal Bhutan Society and as founder of the Black-necked Conservation Programme prevailed on the Government of Bhutan to drop the proposal to drain the wetlands of the Phobjika Valley to create farms to grow cash rich seed potatoes.|$|E

50|$|Ichthyophaga is a genus of {{two species}} of eagles, {{closely related to the}} sea eagles in the genus Haliaeetus. In fact, some taxonomic {{authorities}} place this genus within Haliaeetus. Both are native to southeastern Asia, from the Indian subcontinent southeast to Sulawesi. They are smaller than the Haliaeetus eagles, though overlapping in size with the smaller species of that genus. They share similar plumage, with grey heads grading into dull grey-brown wings and bodies, and white belly and legs. They differ in tail colour, with the lesser <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> having a brown tail, and the grey-headed <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> having a white tail with a black terminal band, and also in size, with the lesser <b>fish</b> <b>eagle</b> only about half of the weight of the grey-headed <b>fish</b> <b>eagle.</b>|$|E
