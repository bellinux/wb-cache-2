50|$|Even if {{the engine}} {{is up to the}} task, severe damage can occur if a problem occurs in the <b>fuel</b> system; an <b>engine</b> running with nitrous oxide depends heavily on the proper air to fuel ratio to prevent {{detonation}} from occurring. For example, if the <b>engine's</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> were to be reduced, this would cause the engine to run lean by whatever degree the fuel delivery was reduced, which can lead to engine knock or detonation. Depending on the engine, this may only need to occur for a matter of seconds before major damage occurs.|$|R

40|$|A {{facility}} for the precise calibration of mass fuel flowmeters and turbine flowmeters located at AMETEK Aerospace Products Inc., Wilmington, Massachusetts is described. This facility {{is referred to}} as the Test and Calibration System (TACS). It is believed to be the most accurate test facility available for the calibration of <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> <b>fuel</b> density measurement. The product of the volumetric flow rate measurement and the density measurement, results in a true mass flow rate determination. A dual-turbine flowmeter was designed during this program. The dual-turbine flowmeter was calibrated on the TACS to show the characteristics of this type of flowmeter. An angular momentum flowmeter was also calibrated on the TACS to demonstrate the accuracy of a true mass flowmeter having a 'state-of-the-art' design accuracy...|$|R
50|$|The Snarler was pump fed {{rather than}} by {{pressurization}} of the fuel tanks. The installation of the rocket motor required considerable reinforcement of the fuselage as well as completely revised pneumatic and <b>fuel</b> systems. <b>Jet</b> <b>engine</b> <b>fuel</b> capacity was reduced from 395 gal (1,520 l) to 175 gal (675 l) and two tanks for rocket fuel were installed. The cylindrical liquid oxygen tank in the forward fuselage had a capacity of 75 gal (288 l), and the water-methanol tank in the rear fuselage had a capacity of 120 gal (460 l). External differences were limited to a slight bulge in the rear fuselage under the rudder and a fairing on the bottom centerline of the fuselage,covering piping between the tanks and the rocket motor in the tail.|$|R

40|$|Effects {{of a wall}} {{impingement}} jet on atomization {{characteristics of}} a <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> <b>fuel</b> injector were investigated experimentally. Liquid is injected from 0. 2 mm-diam nozzles and the liquid columns impinge onto a wall. The liquid forms thin films on the impingement wall and fine droplets can be produced. Several kinds of impingement wall geometries, such as slope, parallel and cylinder types, were examined and the droplet size and atomization mode were investigated. The droplet size was measured with an LDSA. For the slope type, two kinds of atomization mode, namely, ""air blast atomization"" and ""pressure atomization"" modes were observed. The pressure atomization mode is preferable, since it leads to the atomization improvement of a <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> in low load operations. For parallel types, the atomization characteristics were similar to that for the slope type. For cylinder types, pressure atomization mode can be realized with a small liquid injection pressure. And the droplet size in the pressure atomization mode is smaller {{when compared with the}} parallel types...|$|R

As Vice President and Director of Sales of Delavan Manufacturing Company, he helped build the largest manufacturer of <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> <b>fuel</b> nozzles in the world. Following this, he was recruited by J.H. Whitney & Company, {{one of the two}} original American venture capital firms, as President and CEO of their investee company, Foseco, Inc., one of their investments. He built this into the largest manufacturer of exothermic chemicals for foundries and steel mills in the U.S., and subsequently merged the company with its British licensor. Following this, he became Chairman for North America and helped to build a multinational enterprise of 57 corporations, manufacturing in 22 countries and warehousing and selling in 75 countries.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{two-seater}} car of a coupé {{design with}} a hydroformed aluminum chassis and carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer bodywork. The car contains two separate fuel tanks; one contains the main biodiesel fuel, soybean oil, {{and the other}} contains a conventional clean-burning <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> <b>fuel,</b> <b>Jet</b> A (kerosene). The kerosene is used to start the turbine easily {{at the beginning of}} a trip and also to run the engine at the end of a trip to clean it, since biodiesel fuel tends to gum up the fuel system if not cleared. The exhaust gas temperature is 1000 degrees Fahrenheit in normal operation and 1800 Fahrenheit at full power. Exhaust is directed upward from two ports on the rear deck. In essence, the car runs on refined cooking oil, thus producing the same kind of smell created by cooking French fries.|$|R
5000|$|Up to the 1930s most rural {{houses in}} Europe and North America needed their own {{generating}} equipment if electric light was fitted. Engines would often {{be installed in}} a dedicated 'engine house', which was usually an outbuilding separate from the main house to reduce the interference from the engine noise. The engine house would contain the engine, the generator, the necessary switchgear and fuses, {{as well as the}} <b>engine's</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> and usually a dedicated workshop space with equipment to service and repair the engine. Wealthy households could afford to employ a dedicated engineer to maintain the equipment, but as the demand for electricity spread to smaller homes, manufacturers produced engines that required less maintenance and that did not need specialist training to operate.|$|R

Omitting the <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> and their <b>fuel</b> would reduce complexity and increase payload.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAircraft {{fuel systems}} {{are subject to}} icing at low temperatures. If the flow rate is increased, sudden {{releases}} of large quantities of ice may occur, called "snow showers". They threaten the safety of flights and {{have been the subject}} of several investigations over past years. <b>Jet</b> <b>engines</b> <b>fuel</b> system components may sensitive to clogging. When a snow shower happens, ice particles settle in seconds, forming a porous layer. Modelling such events involves transient hydraulics and solid dynamics. We propose to investigate numerically the dynamics of transient particle clogging. Equations of motion for the incompressible fluid phase are discretized in a high-order finite-volume context and solved using a pressure-based algorithm. The discrete phase is modelled in a Lagrangian frame. Contacts between solids are handled by a dedicated algorithm. Solid volume fraction is calculated in regions occupied by particles. Finally, two-way coupling is achieved by source terms for momentum exchange, viscous and inertial loss. 2 D simulation of the clogging of an ideal filter is performed...|$|R
40|$|Swirling ow {{discharged}} from an injector nozzle {{is important for}} ame stabilization in the <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> combustion process. Inclusion {{of the details of}} the swirl-generating device, i. e., the realistic injector nozzle geometry, in combustor numerical simulation is necessary because the complicated, spatially developing swirl pattern produced by a nozzle is dicult to emulate faithfully using indirect means. An indirect approach of swirl generation for large-eddy simulation was developed by Pierce & Moin (1998). Brankovic et al. (2000) reported comparison of laser velocimetry measurements with unstructured Reynolds-Averaged (RANS) predictions of incompressible swirling ow through a <b>jet</b> <b>engine</b> <b>fuel</b> nozzle rig. The actual hardware studied was a low-emission fuel nozzle and swirler combination, representative of current production engines. Their unstructured mesh has a total of 2. 55 million hexahedral elements covering a 180 periodic sector of the injector, and was generated by simplifying a CAD model. The computations of Brankovic et al. were performed using the National Combustion Code (NCC). They found that quantitative accuracy was not achieved by the calculation. In particular, Brankovic et al. pointed out that the central recirculation zone measured from thei...|$|R

50|$|A related {{concept is}} the dead man's switch, where the {{operator}} must be holding a button or lever any time the vehicle is operating. A common {{example of this is}} the kill switches used by boaters and jetskiers wherein a cord connects the kill switch to the operator (usually by the operator's life jacket), and if the operator is thrown overboard in an accident, the cord will pull the switch and immediately shut down the vessel's engine. This prevents it from becoming a run-away vessel that could impose a danger to other vessels or swimmers at sea, and allows the operator to swim back to the vessel and re-board it. A similar device is featured on most lawnmowers: a lever on the handle blocks the <b>engine's</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> and applies a brake to the blades {{as long as it is}} not held down.|$|R
