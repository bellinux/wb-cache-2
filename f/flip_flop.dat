25|$|Under {{the present}} Olympic AA scoring system — New Life — Davydova {{would have won}} the 1980 AA title by a larger margin and would have won gold on beam. In {{addition}} to the AA gold, Davydova {{won a gold medal}} with the team and a silver medal on balance beam. While recognised as the best vaulter in event finals Davydova failed to stand her second vault and thus failed to medal. This vault is described below in the paragraph on the 1981 World Championships. In 1980 the gymnasts performed 2 different vaults and the scores were averaged instead of taking the best of the 2 scores as in Montreal Olympics ef. Davydova would have won gold with her 1st vault – scoring 9.95 – if the Montreal rules had still applied. Donnerstag 215,11 September 1980,"This gymnast led the way into the future in the vault finals, where she performed a <b>flip</b> <b>flop</b> salto with a pirouette off the board".|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Low power {{flip-flops}} {{which plays}} {{a vital role}} {{for the design of}} low-power digital systems. <b>Flip</b> <b>flops</b> and latches consume a large amount of power due to redundant transitions and clocking system. In addition, the energy consumed by low skew clock distribution network is steadily increasing and becoming a larger fraction of the chip power. Almost, 30 %- 60 % of total power dissipation in a system is due to <b>flip</b> <b>flops</b> and clock distribution network. In order to achieve a design that is both high performances while also being power efficient, careful attention must be paid to the design of <b>flip</b> <b>flops</b> and latches.

50|$|A {{ring counter}} with 15 sequentially-ordered states {{is an example}} of a state machine. A 'one-hot' {{implementation}} would have 15 flip flops chained in series with the Q output of each <b>flip</b> <b>flop</b> connected to the D input of the next and the D input of the first <b>flip</b> <b>flop</b> connected to the Q output of the 15th <b>flip</b> <b>flop.</b> The first <b>flip</b> <b>flop</b> in the chain represents the first state, the second represents the second state, and so on to the 15th <b>flip</b> <b>flop</b> which represents the last state. Upon reset of the state machine all of the flip flops are reset to '0' except the first in the chain which is set to '1'. The next clock edge arriving at the flip flops advances the one 'hot' bit to the second <b>flip</b> <b>flop.</b> The 'hot' bit advances in this way until the 15th state, after which the state machine returns to the first state.|$|E
