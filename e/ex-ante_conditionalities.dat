40|$|The Digital Agenda Toolbox {{provides}} {{support to}} {{regional and national}} authorities to develop {{a thorough understanding of}} the digital growth potential stemming from the Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE). It highlights the opportunities Information and Communication Technology (ICT) entails as a key element in their national or regional research and innovation strategies for smart specialisation (RIS 3) and related Operational Programmes (OPs). At the same time, this Toolbox provides guidance for the fulfilment of the DAE-related <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionalities</b> that will form the basis for using European Regional Development Funds (ERDF) for ICT investments. It thus complements the RIS 3 Guide and other related policy documents such as the Guide on Broadband Investment. The Toolbox furthermore provides hands-on assistance for developing a strategic policy framework for digital growth by discussing the dos and don'ts of the process and giving examples of good practises.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the impact of smart {{specialization}} policies in an economically already well-developed and politically experienced environment. Arguably, German regions were quite experienced with strategic innovation policy long before the <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> was imposed and their first reaction to it was accordingly reserved. Nonetheless, our case studies illustrate that the process related to the development of regional innovation strategies has in many German regions led to advances in methodology as well as improved communication and coordination in polities where information failures constitute a relevant challenge. Accordingly, a number of key challenges remain, in part related to many German regionsâ understanding of their own mandate within the country's multi-level governance system...|$|R
40|$|The smart {{specialization}} {{strategy is}} now a reality. With regions and nations having completed the technical fulfillment of the <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> and the related action plans, the first evaluation studies have been launched with the aim to assess {{the consistency of the}} concept, once moving from the design (theory) to the implementation phase (practice). From these first evaluation exercises, strengths and weaknesses emerge in the way the smart specialization strategy has been conceived that lead to reflections on its possible future adjustment trends. The paper highlights emerging bottlenecks (e. g. the lack of local pre-conditions in the local economy and limits of governance) as well as possible future trajectories to overcome such bottlenecks, like the shift from a compulsory to a voluntary RIS, and from an industry-focused to a territorial development strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{insight that}} this booklet {{provides}} - {{thanks to the}} precious contribution of national and regional authorities - shows that smart specialisation has gone far beyond the mere fulfilment of the <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> criteria linked to Cohesion policy allocations. It has triggered {{a change in the}} way innovation-driven regional development policies are dealt with across Europe, confirming the outcome of a number of surveys recently run on this topic. These 'Smart Stories' will drive the reader through the features of smart specialisation as it has been applied in a number of EU countries and regions, with a view to stimulating to further explore the concept and its policy implications, to identify complementarities and potential for mutual learning and collaboration. The period of strategy development has in one sense finished; however, the process of implementing and monitoring S 3 will hopefully lead to many more 'Smart Stories' to be shared across all territories of the European Union.

40|$|To {{utilize the}} Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization (CMIM) for crisis management, {{macroeconomic}} surveillance {{of the member}} economies should be <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality.</b> Hence, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus Three Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) was established to detect possibilities of economic crises and to prompt the restructuring or reforming of a rigid structure or system. Although monitoring the exchange rates of the currencies of these countries vis-à-vis the U. S. dollar is essential for surveillance, the AMRO should have an original tool to consider region-specific factors and more efficient tools than the International Monetary Fund (IMF) surveillance. Therefore, this paper proposes utilizing a regional monetary unit (RMU) in monitoring exchange rates. Empirical analysis has confirmed that deviation indicators of RMUs such as the Asian Monetary Unit Deviation Indicators (AMU DI) {{are expected to be}} useful for macroeconomic surveillance. This paper also tries to define the country’s equilibrium exchange rate vis-à-vis a RMU to provide useful statistical information about exchange rate misalignments among East Asian currencies by employing the permanent-transitory decomposition proposed by Gonzalo and Grange...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a principal-agent model of IMF conditional lending, {{in the aftermath}} of a "capital-account" liquidity crisis. We show that traditional ex-post conditonality can be effective in safeguarding the Fund's resources, allowing for the provision of efficient emergency lending and reducing inefficient ex-ante credit rationing if the capital outflow which triggers the crisis is not excessive. We apply the baseline model to analyse the issues of debtor moral hazard and private sector involement (PSI), which have characterised the recent debate on reforming the International Financial Architecture. We show that debtor moral hazard is only a concern if the IMF cannot commit to make the post-crisis participation constraint of the debtor country binding, and that it can only be resolved via <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> (or pre-qualification). Attempts to reduce debtor moral hazard may however compromise the Fund's ability to safeguard its resources ex-post. We also show that PSI in the solution of balance of payments crisis is a central determinant of the effectiveness of both crisis prevention and resolution efforts on the part of the IMF. PSI may be an enabling condition for efficient crisis resolution, and may therefore be imposed even by a "PSI-averse" IMF. Moreover, there are conditions under which it is optimal for the IMF to ex-ante precommit to a tough, and ex-post sup-optimal, PSI policy,in order to mitigate investor moral hazard.

40|$|The {{conditionality}} {{employed by}} the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its lending policy {{is one of the}} main themes of controversy in the debate on the new international financial architecture. The purpose of this paper is to propose an analytical framework integrating the diverse explanations of the failure of IMF conditionality. Our analysis is based on the idea that the IMF is a key player in the running of markets in a global economy. More precisely, we explain that most of the criticisms concerning conditionality should be analyzed through what we agree to call the institutional failures of IMF conditionality. These institutional failures must be appreciated at two complementary levels: the first level refers to the intrinsic bureaucratic bias of the IMF while the second deals with the inability of the IMF to manage the institutional change required for the development of market processes and hence to maintain the institutional order in recipient countries. Although the first level failures have been particularly well studied via the international public choice approach, those of the second are, at best, often reduced to a simple statement. However, analyzing both levels of institutional failure of the IMF together is not without implications for the way in which the reforms of conditionality are conceived. Indeed, by including an analysis of the second level of failures, i. e. those relating to the relationship between conditionality and domestic institutional change, the recommendation of <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> emanating from the public choic...|$|R

40|$|We {{determine}} he optimal {{combination of}} a universal benefit, B, and categorical benefit, C, for an economy in which individuals differ in both their ability to work - modelled as an exogenous zero quantity constraint on labour supply - and, conditional {{on being able to}} work, their productivity at work. C is targeted at those unable to work, and is conditioned in two dimensions: ex-ante an individual must be unable to work and be awarded the benefit, whilst ex-post a recipient must not subsequently work. However, the <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> may be imperfectly enforced due to Type I (false rejection) and Type II (false award) classification errors, whilst, in addition, the ex-post conditionality may be imperfectly enforced. If there are no classification errors - and thus no enforcement issues - it is always optimal to set C> 0, whilst B= 0 only if the benefit budget is sufficiently small. However, when classification errors occur, B= 0 only if there are no Type I errors and the benefit budget is sufficiently small, while the conditions under which C> 0 depend on the enforcement of the ex-post conditionality. We consider two discrete alternatives. Under No Enforcement C> 0 only if the test administering C has some discriminatory power. In addition, social welfare is decreasing in the propensity to make each type error. However, under Full Enforcement C> 0 for all levels of discriminatory power. Furthermore, whilst social welfare is decreasing in the propensity to make Type I errors, there are certain conditions under which it is increasing in the propensity to make Type II errors. This implies that there may be conditions under which it would be welfare enhancing to lower the chosen eligibility threshold - support the suggestion by Goodin (1985) to "err on the side of kindness"...|$|R

40|$|Elaborated in 2008 {{as part of}} the new {{industrial}} policy, {{the concept}} of smart specialisation has quickly become of key importance for the EU 2020 innovation strategy. New activities are to be nominated at the regional level that aim at exploring and discovering new technological and market opportunities in the process of entrepreneurial discovery. Smart specialisation is about defining a method to help policy-makers identify desirable areas for innovation policy intervention [Foray 2013]. Moreover, setting up national and regional smart specialisations constitutes an <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> for the cohesion policy programmes in the perspective 2014 - 2020. Smart specialization principles provide strategies and roles for all regions: leaders and less developed regions in the field of innovation and R&D. The main objective of the paper is to assess the advancement of selected Polish and French regions in the process of smart specialisation as examples of the above mentioned two types of regions present on the S 3 platform. In order to achieve the main objective of the paper, the following detailed objectives are expected to be met: - presentation of the economic fundamentals of smart specialization; - analysis of the transposition of the smart specialisation concept into strategic national and regional documents in Poland and in France; - assessment of the advancement of the smart specialisation process in selected Polish and French regions (sector analysis of smart specialisations in selected regions with regard to the innovation potential emphasized in the regional innovation strategies). There is an accepted rule in Poland that smart specialisations at national and regional level should be identified independently, which means that national specialisations cannot be treated as superior to regional ones. The progress of identifying regional smart specialisations is diversified. Fifteen Polish regions are registered in S 3 Platform, of which only five are peer-reviewed and eight have adopted RIS 3 priorities. Worth mentioning is the fact that specialisations identified at both national and regional level are convergent which indicates that both approaches selected effective specialisations, focused on whole country's economic growth. In France, where smart specializations are only identified at regional level, 20 out of 26 regions are registered in S 3 Platform, 24 of them being regions with encoded RIS 3 priorities. It is expected that the research results concerning the advancement of the smart specialisation process in selected regions under analysis will give recommendations for regional authorities of Polish and French regions in terms of the smart specialisation elaboration and monitoring...|$|R
5000|$|During {{his term}} as European Commissioner for Regional Policy (February 2010-November 2014) Johannes Hahn {{implemented}} {{the most ambitious}} and comprehensive reform of EU Regional Policy so far. The main achievement of the reform is the transformation of Regional Policy from a subvention- into a genuine investment policy, closely linked with EU economic governance and macro-economic conditions. This allows e.g. to modify programmes to support key structural reforms.The reform refocuses investments in the real economy and on priority areas which create sustainable jobs and foster growth such as the low carbon economy, support for small and medium enterprises, innovation & research, education and training. The introduction of clearly defined conditions {{as well as a}} better evaluation system make sure that the principle of [...] "better spending" [...] is actually safeguarded. Countries and regions will have to announce upfront what objectives they intend to achieve with the available resources and identify precisely how they will measure progress towards those goals. This will allow better monitoring and more focused investments.Based on the new regulation, European regions have developed so called smart specialisation strategies to identify their particular strengths and potentials as the basis for investments. The adoption of smart specialistion strategy was an <b>ex-ante</b> <b>conditionality</b> for the approval of regional programs for the period 2014-2020.Despite cuts in the overall EU budget, EU Commissioner Johannes Hahn succeeded to keep the high level of financial support for strategic investments in the new period (2014-2020): Funding for regional and cohesion policy in 2014-2020 amounts to 351,8 billion Euro. Taking into account the national contribution of member states, and the leverage effect of financial instruments, the overall impact of investments is likely to be about 600 billion Euro.Parts of the reform were already implemented {{in the last year of}} the Barroso term. Thanks to increased flexibility, allowing reprogramming of structural funds, the reformed Cohesion Policy paid also an important role in overcoming coping with the economic crisis. Measures in this context were e.g. reallocation of unused funds for education, training and employment as well as for providing urgently needed liquidity for enterprises [...]The reform, endorsed by the Council and European Parliament with overwhelming majority and strongly supported also by stakeholders and the Committee of the Regions, established Hahn's reputation as a [...] "forward looking, bold reformer".|$|R
