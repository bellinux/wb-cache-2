40|$|OBJECTIVE: Cardiac vein arterialization {{is seldom}} applied for {{treating}} right coronary artery disease. This study aimed to improve outcomes of cardiac vein arterialization in a porcine model <b>using</b> <b>intramammary</b> artery anastomosis. METHODS: A chronic, stenotic coronary artery model {{was established in}} 12 of 14 Chinese experimental miniature pigs of either sex, which were randomly divided into equal control (n = 6) and experimental (n = 6) groups. In experimental animals, blood flow was reconstructed in the right coronary artery <b>using</b> <b>intramammary</b> artery. Arterialization involved dissection of right internal mammary artery from bifurcation to apex of thorax followed by end-to-side anastomosis of internal mammary artery and middle cardiac vein plus posterior descending branch of right coronary artery. Intraoperative heart rate was maintained at 110 beats/min. Graft flow assessment and echocardiography were performed when blood pressure and heart rate normalized. RESULTS: The experimental group had significantly higher mean endocardial and epicardial blood flow postoperatively than control group (mean endocardial blood flow: 0. 37 vs. 0. 14 ml/(g*min), p< 0. 001; mean epicardial blood flow: 0. 29 vs. 0. 22, p = 0. 014). Transmural blood flow was also higher in experimental group than in control group (0. 33 vs. 0. 19, p< 0. 001); ejection fraction increased from 0. 46 % at baseline to 0. 51 % (p = 0. 0038) at 6 hours postoperatively, and mean blood flow of internal mammary artery was 44. 50, perfusion index 0. 73 at postoperative 6 months, 43. 33 and 0. 80 at 3 months. CONCLUSION: Successful cardiac vein arterialization via intramammary artery in a porcine model suggests {{that this may be}} a viable method for reconstructing blood flow in chronic, severe coronary artery disease...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{erythromycin}} ribosomemethylase gene, erm(44), that confers {{resistance to}} macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B (MLSB) antibiotics was identified by whole-genome sequencing of the chromosome of Staphylococcus xylosus isolated from bo-vine mastitis milk. The erm(44) gene is {{preceded by a}} regulatory sequence that encodes two leader peptides responsible for the inducible expression of the methylase gene, as demonstrated by cloning in Staphylococcus aureus. The erm(44) gene is located on a 53 -kb putative prophage designatedJW 4341 -pro. The 56 predicted open reading frames ofJW 4341 -pro are structurally organized into the five functional modules found in {{members of the family}} Siphoviridae. JW 4341 -pro is site-specifically inte-grated into the S. xylosus chromosome, where it is flanked by two perfect 19 -bp direct repeats, and exhibits the ability to circu-larize. The presence of erm(44) in three additional S. xylosus strains suggests that this putative prophage has the potential to dis-seminate MLSB resistance. Staphylococcus xylosus is a ubiquitous bacterium and a com-mensal of human and animal skin (1). It is also used in the fermentation and production of cheeses and raw meat products (2, 3). Although rarely associated with human infections (4 – 6), S. xylosus {{plays a major role in}} the pathogenesis of subclinical bovine mastitis, in which it is in frequent contact with <b>intramammary</b> antibiotics <b>used</b> for mastitis treatment, such as macrolides and lincosamides (7 – 10). Simultaneous resistance to both of these drugs is due mainly to the acquisition of erythromycin ribosome methylase (erm) genes (11). Erm methylases are enzymes that add one or two methyl groups to adenine A 2058 of the 23 S rRNA, preventing the binding of macrolide, lincosamide, and strepto-gramin B (MLSB) antibiotics. To date, 35 Erm methylases have been identified in bacterial species (12, 13), 10 of which [Erm(A) ...|$|R

The research {{reported in this}} dissertation includes two multi-state multi-herd clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of on-farm programs for the diagnosis and selective treatment of clinical and subclinical mastitis in dairy cattle. The use of an OFC system for the selective treatment of clinical mastitis during lactation reduced <b>intramammary</b> antibiotic <b>use</b> by half and tended to reduce withholding time by one day, without significant differences in days to clinical cure, bacteriological cure risk, new infection risk and ICR risk (where the ICR risk represented the presence of infection risk, clinical mastitis risk, or removal from herd risk) within 21 days after the clinical mastitis event. Similarly, {{there were no differences}} between both treatment programs in long-term outcomes such as recurrence of clinical mastitis in the same quarter, somatic cell count, milk production, and cow survival {{for the rest of the}} lactation after the clinical mastitis event. The treatment with intramammary Cephapirin Sodium of cows and quarters based on CMT results alone, or sequential testing using OFC to diagnose Gram-positives in CMT-positive quarters resulted in a higher bacteriological cure risk and reduced the ICR risk within 21 days after enrollment (significantly and only numerically, respectively for treatment each program). The implementation of both treatment programs required the administration of intramammary treatment and extended the time that milk is withhold from the market. Both programs resulted in a significantly lower clinical mastitis risk and lower milk SCC during lactation (significantly and only numerically, respectively for each treatment program). However, the implementation of both treatment programs did not result in higher milk production, improved reproductive performance or lower risk for removal from the herd. A secondary objective of both clinical trials was to validate the use of the Minnesota Easy Culture Bi-Plate System. This OFC system is a useful cow-side test to correctly identify bacterial growth, Gram-positive bacterial growth, or Gram-negative bacterial growth in quarter secretion samples from clinical mastitis cases and in CMT-positive quarter milk samples collected after parturition. Treatment decisions based on identification of bacterial growth, or Gram-positive bacterial growth specifically, were correct over 73 % of the time...|$|R

40|$|A {{divergent}} selection {{experiment in}} sheep was implemented {{to study the}} consequences of log-transformed somatic cell score (SCS) -based selection on resistance to natural <b>intramammary</b> infections. <b>Using</b> dams and progeny-tested rams selected for extreme breeding values for SCS, we created 2 groups of ewes with a strong divergence in SCS of approximately 3 genetic standard deviations. A survey of 84 first-lactation ewes of both the High and Low SCS lines indicated favorable responses to SCS-based selection on resistance to both clinical and subclinical mastitis. All clinical cases (n = 5) occurred in the High SCS line. Additionally, the frequency of chronic clinical mastitis,as detected {{by the presence of}} parenchymal abscesses, was much greater in the High SCS line (n = 21) than in the Low SCS line (n = 1). According to monthly milk bacterio-logical examinations of udder halves, the prevalence of infection was significantly greater (odds ratio = 3. 1) in the High SCS line than in the Low SCS line, with predicted probabilities of 37 and 16 %, respectively. The most frequently isolated bacteria responsible for mastitis were staphylococci: Staphylococcus auricularis(42. 6 % of positive samples), Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus haemoliticus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus lentus, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus aureus. The incidence of positive bacteriology was greater in the High SCS line (39 %) than in the Low SCS line (12 %) at lambing, indicating that High SCS line ewes were especially susceptible to postpartum subclinical mastitis. Negativation of bacteriological results from one sampling time point to the next was markedly different between lines after weaning (e. g., 41 and 84 % in the High and Low SCS lines, respectively). This result was consistent with differences in the duration of infection, which was much greater in the High SCS line compared with the Low SCS line. Finally, ewes from the High SCS line consistently had greater SCS in positive milk samples than did ewes from the Low SCS line (+ 2. 04 SCS, on average), with an especially large difference between lines during the suckling period (+ 3. 42 SCS). Altogether, the preliminary results suggest that the better resistance of Low SCS line ewes, compared with High SCS line ewes, was principally characterized by a better ability to limit infections during the peripartum period, to eliminate infections during lactation, and quantitatively to limit the inflammation process and its clinical consequences...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{primary purpose}} of this study was to develop a set of {{criteria}} to serve as a pseudo-gold standard for what constitutes an <b>intramammary</b> infection <b>using</b> data from 3 consecutive quarter milk samples taken 1 wk apart. Data from lactating cows in 90 dairy herds in 4 Canadian provinces were used to generate the data sets (profiles) used in the conjoint analysis to elicit expert opinions on the topic. The experts were selected from the participants (n= 23) in the 2007 Mastitis Research Workers’ Conference in Minneapolis and from a series of mastitis laboratory courses for bovine practitioners (n= 25) in the Netherlands. Three-week udder quarter profiles with specific combinations of somatic cell count, bacterial species isolated, and plate colony count were selected and included in the conjoint analysis based on the desire to achieve even distributions in the categories of 6 constructed variables. The participants were presented with 3 sets of cards with 20 cards in each set. On each card, they were asked to assign a probability of infection on the middle day (test day) in the 3 -wk profile. Depending on the set of cards, they were asked only to be concerned with the probability of infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus aureus. These 3 organisms were chosen to represent a minor pathogen, a major environmental pathogen, and a major contagious pathogen, respectively. The assigned probabilities for each organism were cross-tabulated according to the number of times the organism of interest was isolated in the 3 -wk period, how many colonies of the organism of interest were isolated on the test day, and the somatic cell count (≤ or > 200, 000 cells/mL). There was considerable variation in the assigned probabilities within each of the combinations of factors. The median, minimum, and maximum values of the assigned probabilities for each combination were computed. The combinations with a median probability > 50 % were considered intramammary infection-positive and included as a criterion in the consensus standard. This yielded 4 possible criteria, which were condensed to the following 2 by consensus at the 2008 Mastitis Research Workers’ Conference in Toronto: 1) the organism of interest was isolated on the test day with at least 10 colonies (1, 000 cfu/mL), and 2) the organism of interest was isolated at least twice in the 3 -wk period...|$|R
40|$|Mastitis, {{inflammation}} of the mammary gland, {{is the most common}} and costly disease of dairy cattle in the western world. It is primarily caused by bacteria, with Streptococcus uberis {{as one of the most}} prevalent causative agents. To characterize the proteome during Streptococcus uberis mastitis, an experimentally induced model of <b>intramammary</b> infection was <b>used.</b> Milk whey samples obtained from 6 cows at 6 time points were processed using label-free relative quantitative proteomics. This proteomic analysis complements clinical, bacteriological and immunological studies as well as peptidomic and metabolomic analysis of the same challenge model. A total of 2552 non-redundant bovine peptides were identified, and from these, 570 bovine proteins were quantified. Hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis showed clear clustering of results by stage of infection, with similarities between pre-infection and resolution stages (0 and 312 h post challenge), early infection stages (36 and 42 h post challenge) and late infection stages (57 and 81 h post challenge). Ingenuity pathway analysis identified upregulation of acute phase protein pathways over the course of infection, with dominance of different acute phase proteins at different time points based on differential expression analysis. Antimicrobial peptides, notably cathelicidins and peptidoglycan recognition protein, were upregulated at all time points post challenge and peaked at 57 h, which coincided with 10 000 -fold decrease in average bacterial counts.

40|$|Data on {{antimicrobial}} use play a {{key role}} in the development of policies for the containment of antimicrobial resistance. On-farm data could provide a detailed overview of the antimicrobial use, but technical and methodological aspects of data collection and interpretation, as well as data quality need to be further assessed. The aims of this study were (1) to quantify antimicrobial use in the study population using different units of measurement and contrast the results obtained, (2) to evaluate data quality of farm records on antimicrobial use, and (3) to compare data quality of different recording systems. During 1 year, data on antimicrobial use were collected from 97 dairy farms. Antimicrobial consumption was quantified using: (1) the incidence density of antimicrobial treatments; (2) the weight of active substance; (3) the used daily dose and (4) the used course dose for antimicrobials for intestinal, intrauterine and systemic use; and (5) the used unit dose, for antimicrobials for <b>intramammary</b> <b>use.</b> Data quality was evaluated by describing completeness and accuracy of the recorded information, and by comparing farmers' and veterinarians' records. Relative consumption of antimicrobials depended on the unit of measurement: used doses reflected the treatment intensity better than weight of active substance. The use of antimicrobials classified as high priority was low, although under- and overdosing were frequently observed. Electronic recording systems allowed better traceability of the animals treated. Recording drug name or dosage often resulted in incomplete or inaccurate information.

40|$|Abstract Background Various {{intramammary}} suspensions containing cloxacillin benzathine {{are registered}} {{for use in}} cattle as antibiotics for <b>intramammary</b> <b>use</b> at drying off. To ensure antibacterial efficacy, the glandular tissue concentration of an antimicrobial agent must be sufficient. Since the possibilities to measure concentrations in the {{different areas of the}} glandular tissue in vivo are very limited, it was the aim of the present study to examine the distribution of cloxacillin in vitro using the isolated perfused bovine udder. Methods Mammary glands taken at slaughter from healthy lactating cows were perfused in vitro with warmed and gassed Tyrode solution. 600 mg cloxacillin benzathine were administered as Orbenin Extra Dry Cow by the intramammary route to six front and rear quarters each. Samples of glandular tissue - at different distances from and vertical to the teat right up to the udder base - were gathered from the treated quarters after 6 h. Perfusate was also sampled before and hourly after treatment for 6 h. The cloxacillin content of the tissue samples and perfusate samples was analysed by high performance liquid chromatography. Results The concentration of cloxacillin in the glandular tissue of front quarters measured 6 h after administration tended to decrease with increasing vertical distance from the teat. The decrease pattern of the concentration was not quite clear in rear quarters. A considerable variation in the tissue concentrations of cloxacillin was obvious, which reflects in vivo conditions. The concentrations measured in the perfusate samples were below the limit of quantification at all time points, indicating limited absorption of the antibiotic from the glandular tissue. Conclusion After intramammary administration of the dry off product containing cloxacillin benzathine concentrations of more than 0. 5 μg/g (MIC) were reached in all regions of the front and rear quarters. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} drug {{utilization}} research has attracted increasing interest since its infancy in the 1960 s. At a symposium in Oslo in 1969 entitled The Consumption of Drugs, {{it was agreed}} that an internationally accepted classification system for drug consumption studies was needed. At the same symposium the Drug UtilizationResearch Group (DURG) was established and tasked with the development of internationally applicable methods for drug utilization research. By modifying and extending the European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association (EPhMRA) classification system, Norwegian researchers developed a system known as the Anatomical TherapeuticChemical (ATC) classification. In order to measure drug use, {{it is important to have}} both a classification system and a unit of measurement. To deal with the objections against traditional units of measurement, a technical unit of measurement called the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) to be used in drug utilisation studies was developed. The purpose of the ATC/DDD system is to serve as a tool for drug utilization research in order to improve quality of drug use. One component of this is the presentation and comparison of drug consumption statistics at international and other levels. The classification of a substance in the ATC/DDD system is not a recommendation for use, nor does it imply any judgements about efficacy or relative efficacy of drugs and groups of drugs. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system for veterinary medicinal products, ATCvet, has been developed by the Nordic Council on Medicines (NLN) in collaboration with the NLN’sATCvet working group, consisting of experts from the Nordic countries. The ATCvet system for the classification of veterinary medicines is based on the same overall principles as the ATC system for substances used in human medicine. In most cases an ATC code exists which can beused to classify a product in the ATCvet system. The ATCvet code is then created by placing the letter Q in front of the ATC code. In some cases, however, specific ATCvet codes are created, e. g. antibacterials for <b>intramammary</b> <b>use</b> (QJ 51) and immunologicals (QI) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study in 3 dairy herds {{was conducted to}} profile the distribution of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) species causing bovine <b>intramammary</b> infection (IMI) <b>using</b> molecular identification and to gain more insight in the pathogenic potential of CNS as a group and of the most prevalent species causing IMI. Monthly milk samples from 25 cows in each herd as well as samples from clinical mastitis were collected over a 13 -mo period. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were identified to the species level using transfer-RNA intergenic spacer PCR. The distribution of CNS causing IMI was highly herd-dependent, but overall, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus xylosus, Staphylococcus cohnii, and Staphylococcus simulans were the most prevalent. No CNS species were found to cause clinical mastitis. The effect of the most prevalent species on the quarter milk somatic cell count (SCC) was analyzed using a linear mixed model, showing that Staph. chromogenes, Staph. simulans, and Staph. xylosus induced {{an increase in the}} SCC that is comparable with that of Staphylococcus aureus. Almost all CNS species were able to cause persistent IMI, with Staph. chromogenes causing the most persistent infections. In conclusion, accurate species identification cannot be ignored when studying the effect of CNS on udder health, as the effect on SCC differs between species and species distribution is herd-specific. Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staph. simulans, and Staph. xylosus seem to be the more important species and deserve special attention in further studies. Reasons for herd dependency and possible cow- and quarter-level risk factors should be examined in detail for the different species, eventually leading to cost-benefit analyses for management changes and, if needed, treatment recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Mastitis is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} and major cause of economic losses in dairy farms. Bovine mastitis caused by strains of S. aureus is a major economically important disease affecting the dairy industry worldwide. S. aureus {{is one of the}} most common udder pathogens that cause either clinical or sub-clinical mammary gland infections. Different treatment regimes have failed to cure S. aureus intramammary infections. Most mastitis vaccination strategies have focused on the enhancement of systemic humoral immunity rather than strengthening local intramammary immunity. Vaccines aimed at enhancing intramammary immunity of dairy cows against S. aureus mastitis have had limited success. Commercially available vaccines show various degrees of success and work in research laboratories with experimental vaccines suggest that in part, the failure of these vaccines lies in the limited antigenic repertoire contained in the vaccine formulations. Moreover, not only does variation in the antigenic composition but also presence of capsular polysaccharide in most pathogenic strains and decreased activity of immune effectors in milk affect the success of vaccines. In addition to these, the ability of S. aureus to attach and internalize into mammary epithelial cells, enables bacteria to escape from the effect of immunity and antibiotics by being hidden in the intracellular niche and thereby causing chronic recurrent intramammary infection. S. aureus also has the ability to become electron-transport-defective and to form slow-growing small colonies that are non haemolytic and less virulent. These small colony variants might hide from the immune surveillance in the intracellular area and revert to the parental strain causing chronic recurrent infections. If immunization targets antigenic molecules that are conserved throughout all pathogenic strains, even the small colony variants can be controlled since the immune system will clear the parental strain which causes lethal infection. Thus, immunization trials should focus on conserved immunogenic antigen molecules among pathogenic strains formulated with an adjuvant and delivered by a route of immunization to induce maximum stimulation of the immune system. Moreover, immunization should focus on inducing Th 1 responses, which is protective against S. aureus mastitis. It has been reported that proteins with glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity might be used as such antigens to induce protection against parasitic and microbial infections. Previous study in our laboratory on mastitis-causing streptococci indicates that GapC proteins of S. uberis and S. dysgalactiae have potential as vaccine antigens to protect dairy cows against mastitis caused by environmental streptococci. Two conserved cell wall associated proteins with iii glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity, GapB and GapC have been identified from S. aureus isolates from bovine intramammary infections. The overall goal of this study was to improve our understanding on <b>intramammary</b> immunity <b>using</b> the GapC and GapB proteins of S. aureus as model antigens for mastitis and to determine the regulation of expression of gapB and gapC genes and their roles in the pathogenesis of bovine S. aureus mastitis. We hypothesized that strengthening local <b>intramammary</b> immunity <b>using</b> GapB and GapC proteins of S. aureus as antigens will protect against bovine S. aureus mastitis. To test this hypothesis we took the approach of using the gapB and gapC genes and constructed plasmids encoding GapB, GapC and GapB::GapC (GapC/B) chimeric proteins. We set six objectives to test our hypothesis using these proteins to enhance the intramammary immunity. In aim 1 we constructed plasmids encoding the GapB, GapC proteins and also constructed a chimeric gene encoding the GapC and GapB proteins as a single entity (GapC/B chimera) as the basis for a multivalent vaccine. In this objective the humoral and cellular immune responses to GapC/B were compared to the responses to the individual proteins alone or in combination in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Our results showed that the GapC/B protein elicited strong humoral and cellular immune responses as judged by the levels of total IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2 a, IL- 4 and IFN-ã secretion and lymphocyte proliferation. These results strongly suggest the potential of this chimeric protein as a target for vaccine production to control mastitis caused by S. aureus. In aim 2 we continued our studies on GapC/B by testing the effects of DNA vaccination with plasmids encoding the individual gapB and gapC genes as well as the gapC/B protein gene with or without a boost with the recombinant proteins. The results showed that DNA vaccination alone was unable to elicit a significant humoral response and barely able to elicit a detectable cell-mediated response to the recombinant antigens but subsequent immunization with the proteins elicited an excellent response. In addition, we found that DNA vaccination using a plasmid encoding the GapC/B chimera followed by a boost with the same protein, although successful, is less effective than priming with plasmids encoding GapB or GapC followed by a boost with the individual antigens. In aim 3 we optimized immune responses in cows by comparing route of vaccination (subcutaneous versus intradermal), site of vaccination (locally at the area drained by the supramammary lymph node versus distantly at area drained by parotid lymph node. Our results showed that both subcutaneous and intradermal immunizations with the GapC/B protein at the area drained by the supramammary and parotid lymph nodes resulted in significantly increased serum and milk titers of total IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2, iv and IgA in all vaccinated groups as compared to placebo. The anti-GapC/B IgG 1 serum and milk titers were significantly higher in all vaccinated group as compared to the placebo group. These results indicated that vaccination at the area drained by the supramammary lymph node resulted in better immune responses. In aim 4 we tested different formulations of the GapC/B antigen with adjuvants such as PCPP, CpG, PCPP + CpG and VSA- 3. We found that the VSA- 3 formulation induced the best immune responses in cows. In this objective we also monitored immune responses longitudinally over one lactation cycle to determine the duration of immune responses by measuring IgG, IgG 1, IgG 2, and IgA on monthly blood and milk samples. We found that the duration of immune responses was about four months. In aim 5 we tested the role of GapC in the virulence of S. aureus mastitis using the S. aureus wild type strain RN 6390 and its isogenic GapC mutant strain H 330. Our results from both in vitro adhesion and invasion assays on MAC- T cells and in vivo infection of ovine mammary glands showed that GapC is an important virulence factor in S. aureus mastitis. In aim 6 we examined the role of sar and agr loci on the expression of gapC and gapB genes by qRT- PCR using S. aureus RN 6390 and its isogenic mutants defective in agrA, sarA and sar/agr (double mutant) at exponential and stationary phases of growth. Our results showed that both gapB and gapC expression were down regulated in the mutant strains, indicating that the expression of the gapB and gapC genes is controlled by the universal virulence gene regulators, agr and sar. We also checked the role of environmental factors such as pH, growth media, and oxygen tension on the expression of gapB and gapC using q-RT-PCR. Our results showed that the expression of gapB and gapC genes in different strains of S. aureus was not consistent under the above-mentioned environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Indication-based {{data on the}} use of {{antimicrobials}} {{in animals}} were collected using a prospective cross-sectional survey, similarly as for surveys carried out in human medicine, but adapting the questionnaire to include veterinary-specific issues. The participating veterinarians were randomly selected from a sample population of practising veterinarians. The sampling was stratified {{to take into account the}} proportions of different types of veterinary practice in the country. All patients consulting the veterinary practice during a 1 -week period were included in the study and veterinarians returned a completed questionnaire for each patient receiving antimicrobial treatment. As cattle received most of the treatments, results from the survey are given using cattle as an example species. Results The survey was sent to 681 veterinarians, of whom 262 (39 %) responded. In total 2850 questionnaires were completed. The largest quantities of antimicrobials, measured in kilograms, were used for cattle, followed by pigs, dogs and horses. The species that were treated most were cattle (n = 1308), dogs (n = 989) and cats (n = 311). For cattle, the most common reason for treatment was acute mastitis (52 %), followed by dry-cow therapy (21 %), subclinical mastitis (6 %) and treatment for acute enteritis (4 %). The remaining treatments covered 17 % of cattle patients and 15 different indications. For acute mastitis, parenteral or <b>intramammary</b> treatment was <b>used</b> in 36 % and 34 % of the cases, respectively. The remaining 30 % received both treatments simultaneously. Of the parenteral treatments (n = 459), benzyl penicillin was used in 83 % of the treated animals (n = 379), while fluoroquinolones were used in 49 cases (11 %). Of the 433 cows receiving intramammary treatment, ampicillin combined with cloxacillin was most commonly used (n = 157; 36 %), followed by cephalexin+streptomycin (n = 113; 26 %). Conclusion This cross-sectional prospective survey provided a useful method for the collection of information on the indication-based use of antimicrobials in different animal species. Cattle were the most commonly treated animal species during the study period. The most common indication for antimicrobial use in cows was mastitis.

A mastite é a doença mais frequente e importante dos rebanhos leiteiros, afetando a qualidade e a produção do leite, podendo ainda acarretar na presença de resíduos de antibióticos no alimento. Por estas razões a descoberta de novos agentes preventivos ou terapêuticos tem sido justificada, destacando-se a busca na natureza. Nesse contexto, extratos de própolis são candidatos em potencial, uma vez que estão descritos na {{literatura}} como antimicrobianos, anti-inflamatórios, antifúngicos, entre outros. Desse modo, o presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar {{in vitro}} a atividade antimicrobiana de extratos de própolis de origens geográficas distintas, e determinar a viabilidade celular em explantes mamários bovinos após exposição a estes extratos. Foram testadas amostras de própolis dos municípios catarinenses de Água Doce, Urupema e São Joaquim e o extrato típico de Minas Gerais (própolis verde). A extração foi realizada com etanol 70 % (1 : 10, p/v) por 24 h. Após a remoção do solvente em estufa a 60 º C, os resíduos foram analisados pelos testes de Folin-Ciocalteau, reação com Cloreto de Alumínio e 1, 1 -difenil- 2 -picrilidrazil (DPPH). A atividade antimicrobiana foi determinada através da técnica de Pour Plate, após dois períodos de contato (6 e 24 h) com um inóculo de 105 UFC/mL de cepas padronizadas de S. aureus e E. coli e isolados de leite mastítico, utilizando diferentes concentrações dos extratos (de 0 à 1000 µg/mL). A citotoxicidade foi avaliada em explantes de glândula mamária bovina cultivadas em meio DMEM-F 12, após exposição aos extratos de própolis, nas concentrações de 0, 17. 5, 35, 70, 140, 280 e 560 µg/mL por 48 h. O teor de fenólicos não diferiu entre os extratos variando de 97, 97 à 116, 29 µg de EAG/mg (P Abstract : Mastitis {{is the most}} frequent and significant disease among dairy herds, affecting not only the production and quality of milk, but also causing antibiotic residues in the milk. As such, the discovery of new preventative agents or therapies are necessary, especially those coming from natural sources. In this context, propolis extracts are potential candidates as they are described in the literature as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, among others. In the present study, the objective was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of propolis extracts in vitro from distinct geographic locations and determine the cellular viability in bovine mammary explants after exposure to these extracts. Propolis extracts {{used in the study}} included samples from the municipalities of Agua Doce, Urupema, and São Joaquim in Santa Catarina State, and a typical extract from Minas Gerais State (green propolis). Extraction was realized with 70 % ethanol (1 : 10, w/v) for 24 h. To remove the solvent, the solution was heated to 60 º C, and the residue was then analysed using Folin-Ciocalteau test, Aluminium Chloride assay and 1. 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The antimicrobial activity was determined using the Pour Plate technique, after two contact periods (6 and 24 h) between an inoculum of 105 UFC/mL of standard strains and isolated from mastitic milk of S. aureus and E. coli treated with different concentrations of propolis extracts (from 0 to 1000 µg/mL). The cytotoxicity was evaluated in bovine mammary gland explants cultivated in DMEM-F 12 medium, after exposure to propolis extracts in concentrations of 0, 17. 5, 35, 70, 140, 280 and 560 µg/mL for 48 h. The level of phenolics did not differ between the extracts and ranged between 97. 97 and 116. 29 µg of GAE/mg (P< 0. 05). However, the greatest content of flavonoids were found in the extract from Minas Gerais (15. 91 µg of Q-Eq/mg) and the lowest in the extract from Urupema (7. 33 µg of Q-Eq/mg) (P< 0. 05). The extract from Urupema also presented the lowest antioxidant activity, while the others showed no differences between them (P< 0. 05). Growth of S. aureus was reduced after extract exposure. However, its efficacy was dependent on the origin of the propolis and the concentration. Extracts from Urupema, Minas Gerais, and São Joaquim reduced the growth of S. aureus by 4 log 10 times using a concentration of 500 µg/mL and growth was reduced to zero at a concentration of 1000 µg/mL. On the other hand, there was weak antimicrobial activity on the strains of E. coli. Only the extract from Minas Gerais reduced the bacteria growth by 152 log 10 times at a concentration of 500 µg/mL, while the others reduced bacteria growth only with concentrations at 750 µg/mL and greater. The in vitro tests with bovine mammary gland explants were adequate for the evaluation of cytotoxicity as there was no drop in cellular viability after 96 h of cultivation (P< 0. 05). However, the geographical origin and concentration of the propolis affected the viability of mammary tissue. The extract from Agua Doce showed the lowest cytotoxicity for bovine udder cells (P< 0. 05). The IC 50 values found were 272. 4 µg/mL, 171. 8 µg/mL, 63. 85 µg/mL, and 13. 26 µg/mL for extracts from Agua Doce, Urupema, São Joaquim, and Minas Gerais, respectively. Considering that at a concentration close to the IC 50 the Urupema extract reduced S. aureus growth by 1. 2 log 10, the potential for its use in treating mastitis is evident. The results showed that the efficacy of propolis for the treatment of mastitis is dependent on its geographical origin, which is related to its chemical composition. Furthermore, the results showed that concentrations that produce higher levels of antimicrobial activity are harmful to the mammary gland, restricting <b>intramammary</b> <b>use</b> and justifying the need for further studies with nano-emulsions or purified fractions...|$|E
40|$|Background Antimicrobial use in {{livestock}} production {{is an important}} contemporary issue, which is of public interest worldwide. Antimicrobials are not freely available to Austrian farmers and can only be administered to livestock by veterinarians, or by farmers who are trained members of the Animal Health Service. Since 2015, veterinarians have been {{required by law to}} report antimicrobials dispensed to farmers for use in food-producing animals. The study presented here went further than the statutory framework, and collected data on antimicrobials dispensed to farmers and those administered by veterinarians. Methods Seventeen veterinary practices were enrolled in the study via convenience sampling. These veterinarians were asked to contact interested dairy farmers regarding participation in the study (respondent-driven sampling). Data were collected from veterinary practice software between 1 st October 2015 and 30 th September 2016. Electronic data (89. 4 %) were transferred via an online interface and paper records (10. 6 %) were entered by the authors. Antimicrobial treatments with respect to udder disease were analysed by number of defined daily doses per cow and year (nDDDvet/cow/year), based on the European Medicines Agency technical unit, Defined Daily Dose for animals (DDDvet). Descriptive statistics and the Wilcoxon rank sum test were used to analyse the results. Results Antimicrobial use data from a total of 248 dairy farms were collected during the study, 232 of these farms treated cows with antibiotics; dry cow therapy was excluded from the current analysis. The mean number of DDDvet/cow/year for the antimicrobial treatment of all udder disease was 1. 33 DDDvet/cow/year. Of these treatments, 0. 73 DDDvet/cow/year were classed as highest priority critically important antimicrobials (HPCIAs), according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition. The Wilcoxon rank sum test determined a statistically significant difference between the median number of DDDvet/cow/year for acute and chronic mastitis treatment (W = 10, 734, p <  0. 001). The most commonly administered antimicrobial class for the treatment of acute mastitis was beta-lactams. <b>Intramammary</b> penicillin was <b>used</b> at a mean of 0. 63 DDDvet/cow/year, followed by the third generation cephalosporin, cefoperazone, (a HPCIA) at 0. 60 DDDvet/cow/year. Systemic antimicrobial treatments were used at a lower overall level than intramammary treatments for acute mastitis. Discussion This study demonstrated that Austrian dairy cows in the study population were treated with antimicrobial substances for udder diseases at a relatively low frequency, however, a substantial proportion of these treatments were with substances considered critically important for human health. While it is vital that sick cows are treated, reductions in the overall use of antimicrobials, and critically important substances in particular, are still possible...|$|R
40|$|A presente tese estudou o diagnóstico e tratamento da mastite bovina pela avaliação do uso de um teste prático de CCS, pela utilização de cultura bacteriológica a campo e pela definição de protocolos de tratamento. Para rápida determinação da CCS, o teste Somaticell® foi usado em amostras de leite tendo o resultado comparado à contagem eletrônica e avaliado por tipo de amostra e pessoa. O Somaticell determinou corretamente a CCS de amostras frescas de leite de quartos mamários. A correlação registrada entre o Somaticell e a CCS eletrônica foi 0, 92 e o coeficiente de concordância 0, 82. O teste mostrou adequada validade para determinar infecções intramamárias (sensibilidade 91, 3 %; especificidade 96, 0 %) e apresentou contagens mais elevadas em amostras contendo patógenos. Pequena variação foi verificada nos resultados do teste quando realizado em duplicata. Entretanto na análise geral dos dados, a variação observada não foi significativa nem afetou a quantidade de amostras com mastite subclínica. Amostras de leite conservadas a 4 ºC por até 5 horas não influenciaram os resultados do Somaticell, mas amostras congeladas ou adicionadas do conservante {{bronopol}} não devem ser usadas. Quanto ao diagnóstico da mastite clínica, as infecções causadas por bactérias Gram positivas foram em maioria isoladas de casos clínicos com alteração visual do leite e edema de úbere, de vacas reincidentes e com CCS mensal média maior de 200. 000 céls/mL. Por outro lado, as mastites causadas por bactérias Gram negativas apresentaram em maioria casos clínicos com comprometimento sistêmico em vacas de alta produção. Enquanto isso, as amostras mastíticas com ausência de crescimento na cultura laboratorial apresentaram grau da mastite e perfil do animal variado. A cultura bacteriológica realizada na propriedade leiteira com o conjunto dos meios Sangue Base Azida, MacConkey e Vogel-Johnson, mostrou adequada recuperação dos patógenos causadores de mastite clínica. Do total de 203 cultivos realizados na fazenda e em laboratório 79, 3 % mostraram concordância. A taxa de concordância das culturas foi afetada pelo número de unidades formadoras de colônia presente na amostra de leite. A sensibilidade e especificidade registradas para a cultura a campo foram 83, 0 e 76, 5 %, respectivamente, as quais foram positivamente influenciadas pelo isolamento de bactérias Gram positivas, e negativamente pelo isolamento de bactérias Gram negativas e resultados com ausência de crescimento. O cultivo feito na fazenda mostrou vantagens em usar amostras de leite frescas, porém a leitura precoce do crescimento bacteriano e a metodologia simples reduzem sua acurácia. Para o tratamento das mastites clínicas com base no resultado da cultura a campo, foi encontrada taxa geral de cura bacteriológica de 69, 7 %. A CCS da maioria dos tetos que apresentaram mastite se manteve elevada até 21 dias pós-detecção da doença. Mastites causadas por bactérias Gram negativas mostraram taxas de cura mais altas. Já as mastites causadas por Staphylococcus aureus tiveram as menores taxas de cura apesar da utilização de tratamento antibiótico estendido. As mastites de grau 1 e 2, com isolamento de bactérias Gram negativas e ausência de crescimento na cultura bacteriológica, não apresentaram diferença em cura sendo ou não tratadas com antibiótico intramamário. The present thesis {{investigated the}} {{diagnosis and treatment of}} bovine mastitis by using a simple test for somatic cell count, on-farm bacteriological culture and guided treatment protocols. To rapidly determine SCC, Somaticell® test was used on milk samples having the results compared to electronic count and evaluated by sample type and reader. The Somaticell test correctly determined the SCC in fresh milk samples of mammary quarters. The correlation between Somaticell and electronic SCC was 0. 92, being kappa coefficient equals to 0. 82. This test presented good reliability to determine <b>intramammary</b> infections <b>using</b> a threshold of 205. 000 cells/mL (sensitivity = 91. 3 % and specificity = 96. 0 %) and showed greater SCC in samples containing major mastitis pathogens. Minor intra-individual variation was detected when performing the test. Probably, the homogenization procedure of the test is the most likely explanation for the observed variation. However, the final analysis indicated that this variation was not significant and did not affect the amount of samples classified as having subclinical mastitis. Milk samples preserved at 4 ºC up to 5 hours did not change test results. Nevertheless, frozen or bronopol preserved samples were not suitable for this test. Clinical mastitis data indicated that infections caused by Gram positive bacteria were mainly seen on clinical cases with visual milk abnormalities and udder edema of clinical recurrent animals showing monthly average SCC greater than 200, 000 cells/mL. In contrast, clinical mastitis caused by Gram negative bacteria was frequently associated with systemic signs in high producing cows. In addition, mastitic samples without bacterial growth in the laboratory did not present a defined pattern in relation to mastitis grade and animal characteristic. The on-farm bacteriological culture using Azide Blood Agar Base, MacConkey Agar and Vogel-Johnson Agar, showed adequate recovery of mastitis causing pathogens. In 79. 3 % of the cultures (n = 203) the on-farm results agreed with the standard laboratory culture. Interestingly, the concordance rate was affected by the number of colony forming units in the milk sample. The sensitivity and specificity of on-farm culture were 83. 0 and 76. 5 %, respectively. These results were positively influenced by growth of Gram positive bacteria and negatively influenced by growth of Gram negative bacteria and samples with no growth. The use of fresh milk samples in on-farm culture seemed advantageous for bacterial recovery, although premature plate reading of bacterial growth and simplicity of this methodology might reduce its accuracy. Mastitis treatment guided by on-farm culture showed an overall bacteriological cure rate of 69. 7 %. In the majority of quarters, SCC remained elevated within 21 days after detection of clinical mastitis. Gram negative bacteria presented greater cure rates. On the contrary, Staphylococcus aureus mastitis displayed the lowest cure rate even by using extended antibiotic treatment. Intramammary antibiotic treatment did not show effect on cure rates of grade 1 and 2 clinical mastitis caused by Gram negative bacteria or with negative growth in the on-farm culture...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to determine the comparative prevalence of streak canal infections in buffalo and cow and to determine the comparative dimensional features of streak canal these two dairy species. In addition, comparative efficacy of partial or full insertion of teat cannula of a dry period antibiotic formulation in buffalo and cow was determined. Duplicate streak canal swab and quarter foremilk samples taken from 20 lactating buffaloes and 20 lactating cows were cultured and isolates identified. Length and width of streak canal of buffalo and cow (n = 20 each) was determined by Vernier caliper after incising the teats collected from abattoir. An in vivo comparative radiographic analysis of streak canal of buffaloes and cows (n = 20 each) was performed after infusion of 0. 25 ml of 5 % barium sulphate into each teat followed by radiographic imaging and measurement of streak canal length and width from the image. In another phase of the study, efficacy of partial insertion vs. full insertion of teat cannula of a commercial cephapirin benzathine dry period antibiotic formulation (Cefa-DriÂ®) {{in the prevention of}} new intramammary infections and treatment of existing infections was evaluated on 20 buffaloes and 20 cows. Results: Seventy three (91. 25 %) and 59 (73. 75 %) of streak canal swab samples of cow and buffalo respectively were found infected. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent isolate both in cow and buffalo accounting respectively for 34 and 18 of total isolates (n = 106 for cow; n = 78 for buffalo) recovered from streak canal. Forty four (55 %) and 18 (22. 5 %) of quarter foremilk samples of cow and buffalo respectively were infected. Staphylococcus aureus was the frequent isolate recovered from milk samples of both cows and buffaloes accounting respectively for 25. 49 % and 18. 18 % of total milk isolates. The mean values of streak canal length determined by Vernier caliper in cow and buffalo respectively were 9. 78 Â± 1. 20 and 9. 96 Â± 1. 44 mm whereas the mean width was 0. 9 Â± 0. 12 and 0. 98 Â± 0. 23 mm; both dimensions being non significantly different in the two dairy species. The mean length (9. 34 Â± 1. 01 mm) of streak canal of cow determined from radiographic image differed nonsignificantly (p = 0. 105) from the mean length (9. 97 Â± 1. 36 mm) of streak canal of buffalo. Similarly, mean width of streak canal of cow (0. 9 Â± 0. 09 mm) differed non-significantly (p = 0. 192) from the mean width of streak canal of buffalo (0. 94 Â± 0. 10 mm). Thickness of epithelium of streak canal of buffalo (357. 19 Â± 4. 8 Ã¬) was highly significantly (p = 0. 001) more than thickness of epithelium of streak canal of cows (327. 25 Â�} 5. 91 Æ’ÃŠ). Similarly, thickness of keratin layer of streak canal of buffalo (154. 7 Â�} 6. 34 Æ’ÃŠ) was highly significantly (p = 0. 001) greater than the thickness of keratin layer of streak canal of cow (101. 3 Â�} 4. 11 Æ’ÃŠ). As also was the case for muscle sphincter thickness around streak canal. FurstenbergÂ�fs rosette folds were highly significantly (p = 0. 001) thicker in buffalo (13. 4 Â�} 0. 12) than in cow (12. 75 Â�} 0. 2). Mitotic index of streak canal of cow and buffalo also differed significantly (p = 0. 038); being greater in cow than in buffalo. Seventeen new intramammary quarters infections were detected in 40 quarters of cows treated by full insertion of dry intramammary treatment syringe (Cefa-DriR, Forte Dodge, USA) cannula. The corresponding figure for 40 cow quarters treated by partial insertion of the same antibiotic dry period formulation was 6. Nine new intramammary infections developed over dry period in 40 quarters of buffaloes treated by full insertion of treatment syringe (Cefa-DriR, Forte Dodge, USA) cannula. The corresponding figure for 40 buffalo quarters treated by partial insertion of the same antibiotic dry period formulation was 3. A total of 20 quarters of 10 cows were found infected by various mastitis pathogens at drying off in full insertion treatment group. Thirteen of these quarters were found cured after calving as no organism could be isolated from samples collected at calving and those collected biweekly for 3 months after calving. In the partial treatment group, of the 22 quarters, 18 were cured. Thus the cure rate (81. 8 %) in the partial insertion treatment group was significantly higher than in the full insertion treatment group in cows. Ten of the 14 (71. 4 %) infected quarters of buffaloes were cured when Cefa-DriR <b>intramammary</b> tube was <b>used</b> by full insertion method. The corresponding cure rate by partial insertion of the same intramammary preparation was 84. 6 % (11 of 13 infected quarters being microbiological negative at calving as well as 3 months following calving of buffaloes). All in all, the results of comparative histomorphological examination of streak canal of cow and buffalo as well as the results of comparative efficacy trial of partial vs. full insertion of cannula of dry period antibiotic treatment syringe suggest that both the dairy species should be treated at drying off by using partial insertion of dry period intramammary antibiotic formulation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} withdrawal periods and tissue tolerance of intramammary antibiotics (Curaclox LC, Spectrazol Milking Cow and Rilexine 200 LC) in goats, measured in different ways, and to evaluate the effects of related factors. Method: Three experimental trials were conducted. Trial 1 and Trial 2 were conducted at the Faculty of Veterinary Science, Onderstepoort using the goat herd of the Onderstepoort Teaching Animal Unit (OTAU) (Herd A), while Trial 3 was conducted on a commercial goat dairy in the Limpopo Province of South Africa (Herd B). In addition, four goats with clinical mastitis from a smallholding close to the Faculty of Veterinary Science at Onderstepoort were studied (Herd C). This herd consisted of 13 lactating Saanen and Saanen/Toggenburg crossbred dairy goats. In all trials foremilk was stripped, teats were disinfected and a milk sample was taken from each udder half of each goat (half-milk samples). In all three trials the following milk samples were taken: two sets of half samples and a composite sample (before, during and after treatment). The California Milk Cell Test (CMCT) and conductivity measurements were performed. In Trial 3 the conductivity meter became non-functional on the second day, and thus the conductivity test was eliminated from then on. Each udder half was milked separately and milk volume was recorded. The temperature of goats was taken and recorded to identify sick animals. All goats in the treatment group were treated. In all three trials after treatment, sampling continued until SCC returned to baseline and until there were at least two consecutive negative TRIS tests for each goat, approximately 10 days. Milk production was based on the following milk production groups: low (less than 1. 3 L), medium (1. 3 L to 1. 5 L) and high (greater than 1. 5 L) daily milk production. The antibiotics used in these trials were selected for being commonly used, broad-spectrum preparations. Trial 1, a semi-synthetic penicillin based intramammary preparation (Curaclox LC, which contains 75 mg sodium ampicillin and 200 mg sodium cloxacillin per dose plus blue dye). Curaclox LC G 2615, (Norbrook (Pharmacia AH) P. O. Box 10698 Centurion, 0046), cloxacillin 200 mg, ampicillin 75 mg, blue dye/ 4. 5 g syringe. Trial 2, a cefuroxime 250 mg based intramammary product (Spectrazol Milking Cow, Schering-Plough). Spectrazol milking cow, cefuroxime, 250 mg, S 4 Intramammary Injection 83 / 594, (Schering-Plough Animal Health, P. O. BOX 46, Isando, 1600). Trial 3, a cephalexin 100 mg, neomycin sulphate 100 mg and prednisolone based intramammary product, Rilexine (SA) 200 LC injection 83 / 638, (Logos Agvet (Virbac), Private bag X 115, Halfway House, 1685). Curaclox LC G 2615, Norbrook (Pharmacia AH), cloxacillin 200 mg, ampicillin 75 mg, blue dye/ 4. 5 g syringes. In the clinical mastitis cases (Herd C); Goat 1 was treated with Spectrazol milking cow (as above), Goat 2 was treated with Curaclox LC (as above), Goat 3 was treated with Curaclox LC in the left udder half and Goat 4 was treated with Curaclox LC in the right udder half (as above). Results: Trial 1 : Curaclox LC The mean withdrawal periods for the product Curaclox LC (intramammary) as measured by Thermo Resistant Inhibitory Substances (TRIS), colour dye, Parallux testing for cloxacillin and ampicillin, on eight relatively low producing Saanen dairy goats (Trial 1) were 74 h ± 19. 21; 90 h ± 16. 97; 99 h ± 9. 07 and 93 h ± 11. 41 respectively. The withdrawal period for Curaclox LC recommended for use in cattle (72 h) was significantly shorter than the withdrawal periods as measured by colour dye (P < 0. 001), Parallux testing for cloxacillin (P < 0. 001) and Parallux testing for ampicillin (P < 0. 05) in Trial 1. There was a significant difference of withdrawal periods as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 05) and colour dye (P < 0. 05) between goats with and without clinical mastitis in Trial 1 Trial 3 : Curaclox LC The mean withdrawal periods for Curaclox LC as measured by TRIS, colour dye, Parallux testing for cloxacillin and ampicillin, on 12 relatively high producing Saanen and Saanen-Toggenburg crossbreed dairy goats (Trial 3) were 42 h ± 7. 08; 65 h ± 60. 26; 77 h ± 13. 56 and 71 h ± 12. 65 respectively. The withdrawal period for Curaclox LC recommended for use in cattle (72 h) was significantly longer than the withdrawal periods as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 001) and colour dye (P < 0. 001) in Trial 3. Curaclox LC: Trials 1 & 3 combined The mean withdrawal periods for Curaclox LC as measured by TRIS, colour dye, Parallux testing for cloxacillin and ampicillin, for Trials 1 & 3 combined were 59 h ± 24. 31; 76 h ± 17. 70; 87 h ± 16. 10 and 80 h ± 16. 23 respectively. The withdrawal period for Curaclox LC recommended for use in cattle (72 h) was significantly longer than the withdrawal periods as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 001) in Trials 1 & 3 combined. Trial 2 : Spectrazol Milking Cow The mean withdrawal periods for Spectrazol Milking Cow (intramammary) as measured by TRIS on seven relatively low producing Saanen dairy goats (Trial 2) was 95 h ± 17. 23. The withdrawal period for Spectrazol Milking Cow recommended for use in cattle (60 h) was significantly shorter than the withdrawal period as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 001) in Trial 2. Trial 3 : Rilexine 200 LC The mean withdrawal periods for Rilexine 200 LC (intramammary) as measured by TRIS on 20 relatively high producing Saanen and Saanen-Toggenburg crossbreed dairy goats (Trial 3) was 37 h ± 9. 94. The withdrawal period for Rilexine 200 LC recommended for use in cattle (96 h) was significantly longer than the withdrawal period as measured by TRIS (P < 0. 001) in Trial 3. The regression model for goats with clinical mastitis was: Withdrawal period as measured by TRIS = 30. 21 + 4. 692 (sampling time) + 22. 11 (udder palpation) – 13. 6 (floccules) – 0. 00649 (volume) (R 2 = 95. 7 %, standard error of regression = 3. 41) There was great variation in Somatic Cell Count (SCC) between trials, ranging from 1928 X 103 cells/mL to 9274 X 103 cells/mL for infected udder halves and from 1817 X 103 cells/mL to 3639 X 103 cells/mL for non-infected udder halves, at the morning milking. At the evening milking SCC ranged from 1927 X 103 cells/mL to 6415 X 103 cells/mL for infected udder halves and from 2103 X 103 cells/mL to 3304 X 103 cells/mL for non-infected udder halves. SCC of udder halves with clinical mastitis ranged from 7053 X 103 cells/mL to 7948 X 103 cells/mL for udder halves in which bacteria could not be isolated and from 6476 X 103 cells/mL to 8479 X 103 cells/mL in udder halves from which bacteria was isolated. Most of the variation in SCC was unexplained. In this research all SCC values were determined using the Fossomatic 90 counter and the arithmetic means were reported. The factors valid for determining clinical mastitis were the presence of floccules in the milk and high SCC, with or without udder damage and/ or bacteria. Intramammary infection (IMI) was determined by the presence or absence of bacteria only. Conclusions and Recommendations: The variability in SCC was largely unexplained, and an increased SCC did not necessarily indicate an intramammary infection in goats, as it does in cows. Therefore further, research is required to assess SCC and all possible factors affecting it. Further research is also required to find a more reliable method for mastitis diagnosis apart from SCC, for example, NAGase. The “Goatside” tests used (California Milk Cell Tests, CMCT) and SCC on their own were not reliable methods of mastitis diagnosis and should be accompanied by microbiological tests. However, CMCT and SCC were indicators of tissue tolerance and udder irritation. Tissue irritation is considered to indicate the limit of tissue tolerance. In healthy goats Spectrazol Milking cow caused the least tissue irritation, followed by Rilexine 200 LC, and Curaclox LC. However, for goats with clinical mastitis Rilexine 200 LC caused the least tissue irritation followed by Curaclox LC; and Spectrazol Milking cow caused the most tissue irritation in goats with clinical mastitis. Withdrawal periods of healthy goats and goats with clinical mastitis also differed for each product. Further research is necessary to determine withdrawal periods and tissue irritation of different intramammary products on goats with clinical mastitis. Withdrawal period was affected by volume of milk produced, due to the dilution factor of continuous milk secretion. High producers had shorter withdrawal periods than low producers. However, treatment with intramammary antibiotics did not significantly affect the volume of milk produced. Further research is required to assess the effect of milk production volume on withdrawal periods when comparing withdrawal periods of different products. Antibiotic withdrawal periods on goat milk were different from those recommended for use in cattle for each of the products used and for the different <b>intramammary</b> antibiotics <b>used.</b> The withdrawal periods recommended for use cattle have a 24 h safety margin added to the longest withdrawal period in the trial. In this research 24 h safety margins were not added in the original tables. Therefore, in practice 24 h safety margins should be added to all withdrawal periods in this research. Later the 24 h safety margins were subtracted from the withdrawal periods recommended for use in cattle in order to obtain a rough estimate of the actual withdrawal periods in cattle. In this analysis all withdrawal periods measured by different methods for goats were significantly different from withdrawal periods recommended for use in cattle (- 24 h safety margin). However, in the original tables not all withdrawal periods for goats as measured by different methods were significantly different from those in cattle (with 24 h safety margin). Conductivity was found to be an unreliable “Goatside” test. Dissertation (MSc (Veterinary Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008. Production Animal Studiesunrestricte...|$|R
