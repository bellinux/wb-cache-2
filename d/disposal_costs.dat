A standard multi-region CGE model based on GTAP database Ver. 5. 0 and Korean air pollution inventories in 1998 {{were used to}} give a quantitative feature of trade and environment linkage in Korea.

40|$|The {{growth in}} {{environmental}} regulations governing the landfilling of used products {{and in the}} environmental awareness of consumers poses two challenges for manufacturers as they go to market with their products. First, landfilling fees and bans increase the cost of disposing of used products that they maintain ownership of, such as products coming off operating leases or previously sold products recovered via trade-in programs. Second, it is becoming important for firms {{to have a better}} understanding of the total environmental impact of their decisions. In this paper, we characterize the optimal integrated pricing, recovery, remarketing and disposal strategy of a monopolist manufacturer under leasing and selling. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we provide insights to manufacturers about how production <b>cost,</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>cost</b> and durability should shape their decisions. Second, while the question of whether a firm should lease or sell its product has been studied, little is known about which strategy dominates when disposal is costly and when a firm can recover previously sold products through trade-ins. We find that leasing performs at least as well as selling with respect to profitability. Third, to investigate claims in the industrial ecology literature that leasing is environmentally preferable to selling, we characterize under what conditions each strategy dominates from an environmental impact perspective. We find that while leasing dominates in the presence of high production cost, environmental impact depends on <b>disposal</b> <b>cost</b> when production cost is low: For low <b>disposal</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R

The results of the cost analysis showed that the <b>disposal</b> <b>cost</b> of radioactive wastes treated by vitrification facility reduced to 85 percent compared with that by current waste treatment system.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the difference in}} the value of the nuclear fuel cycle cost calculated by the deterministic and probabilistic methods on the basis of an equilibrium model. Calculating using the deterministic method, the direct <b>disposal</b> <b>cost</b> and Pyro-SFR (sodium-cooled fast reactor) nuclear fuel cycle cost, including the reactor cost, were found to be 66. 41 Â mills/kWh and 77. 82 Â mills/kWh, respectively (1 millÂ =Â one thousand of a dollar, i. e., 10 â 3 $). This is because the cost of SFR is considerably expensive. Calculating again using the probabilistic method, however, the direct <b>disposal</b> <b>cost</b> and Pyro-SFR nuclear fuel cycle cost, excluding the reactor cost, were found be 7. 47 Â mills/kWh and 6. 40 Â mills/kWh, respectively, on the basis of the most likely value. This is because the nuclear fuel cycle cost is significantly affected by the standard deviation and the mean of the unit cost that includes uncertainty. Thus, it is judged that not only the deterministic method, but also the probabilistic method, would also be necessary to evaluate the nuclear fuel cycle cost. By analyzing the sensitivity of the unit cost in each phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, it was found that the uranium unit price is the most influential factor in determining nuclear fuel cycle costs...|$|R
