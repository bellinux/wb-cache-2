40|$|Propellant slosh is a {{potential}} source of disturbance that can significantly impact the stability of space vehicles. The slosh dynamics are typically represented by a mechanical model of a spring-mass-damper. This mechanical model is then included in the equation of motion of the entire vehicle for Guidance, Navigation and Control analysis. The typical parameters required by the mechanical model include natural frequency of the slosh, slosh mass, slosh mass center location, and the critical damping ratio. A fundamental study has been undertaken at NASA MSFC to understand the fluid damping physics from a ring baffle in the barrel section of a propellant tank. An asymptotic damping equation and CFD blended equation have been derived by NASA MSFC team to complement the popularly used Miles equation at different flow regimes. The new development has found success in providing a nonlinear damping model for the Space Launch System. The {{purpose of this study}} is to further extend the semi-empirical damping equations into the oblate spheroidal dome section of the propellant tanks. First, previous experimental data from the spherical baffled tank are collected and analyzed. Several methods of taking the dome curvature effect, including a generalized Miles equation, area projection method, and equalized fill height method, are assessed. CFD simulation is used to shed light on the interaction of vorticity around the baffle with the locally curved wall and liquid-gas interface. The <b>final</b> <b>damping</b> equation will be validated by a recent subscale test with an oblate spheroidal dome conducted at NASA MSFC...|$|E
40|$|We present recent {{measurements}} demonstrating {{control of}} unstable beam motion in single bunch and bunch train configurations at the SPS. The work {{is motivated by}} anticipated intensity increases from the LIU and HL-LHC upgrade programs, and has included {{the development of a}} GHz bandwidth reconfigurable 4 GS/S signal processor with wideband kickers and associated amplifiers. The system was operated at 3. 2 GS/s with 16 samples across a 5 ns RF bucket (4. 2 ns bunch at injection). The experimental results confirm damping of intra-bunch instabilities in both Q 20 and Q 26 optics configurations for intensities of 2 x 10 ¹¹ P/bunch. Instabilities with growth times of 200 turns are well-controlled from injection, consistent with the achievable gains for the 2 installed stripline kickers with 1 kW broadband power. Measurements from multiple studies in single-bunch and bunch train configurations show achieved damping rates, control of multiple intra-bunch modes, behavior of the system at injection and <b>final</b> <b>damped</b> noise floor. We present an analysis method to study the relative phase of slice motion during a transient to discriminate between TMCI and other types of Head-Tail instabilities...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{coalescence}} behaviour of two single {{droplets of}} industrial kerosene oil {{is an important}} precursor for predicting the stability of a concentrated kerosene emulsion system. In taking such an approach, distinct differences in the dynamic coalescence of fresh and aged binary droplets of analytical and technical grade kerosene was observed which {{we believe to be}} important with regard to the stability of concentrated systems. It was shown from induction time measurements (the time from first contact to rupture of the thin film separating the droplets) that the analytical grade kerosene binary droplets are considerable more stable than the technical grade at higher temperature (up to 65 °C) but the analytical grade shows a gradual decrease in stability up to 65 °C. At 75 °C, both grades of kerosene droplets remained stable to coalescence. After this initial rupture, coalescence proceeded as a series of dynamic oscillations and further insight into the fusion behaviour could be obtained by analysis of the change in the surface area of the aggregated droplets as a function of time. The longer induction times correlated with the more vigorous post rupture oscillations (less damping resulting from an increase in interfacial elasticity) which were recorded during the drop fusion. These experiments reveal preliminary steps in the coalescence of oil droplets where measurements from first contact to <b>final</b> <b>damped</b> equilibrium are quantified. This aspect of coalescence has not been well represented in the earlier literature...|$|R

The design study has been optimized for 3 TeV centre-of-mass energy.

40|$|Linear Multi-Degree of Freedom (MDOF) {{mechanical}} systems having frequency-independent or frequency-dependent viscoelastic behaviors are often studied and modelled in frequency or Laplace domains. Indeed, the experimental characterization of such mechanical properties is also naturally performed in frequency domain via input/output experimental tests {{and it includes}} the linear viscous damping as special case. However, once this identification and modelling process is performed, it is not generally possible to reduce the obtained MDOF damped mechanical system {{to a set of}} uncoupled damped modal oscillators apart from some special cases, such as the proportional viscous damping one. In this paper a general procedure has been proposed to transform a coupled linear mechanical system having genericfrequency-independent or frequency-dependent viscoelastic characteristics to a set of independent damped modal oscillators. The procedure is achieved via a linear co-ordinate transformation procedure using matrices in real field only. The approach is exact and based on the solution of an associated eigenproblem for the specific case of linearly viscous damping and frequency independent stiffness. In the general case of frequency-dependent viscoelastic materials, the approach is extended by an iterative procedure solving local eigenproblems to determine the suitable uncoupling transformation. As <b>final</b> consequence, a <b>damped</b> modal-based Frequency Response Function (FRF) of the system can be obtained so showing how the single damped-mode contribution can be isolated and a limited-frequency-band viscoelastic model can be finally achieved. Some numerical results on simple {{mechanical systems}} and also on a generic Finite Element (FE) models are reported to show the capabilities of the proposed approach...|$|R
