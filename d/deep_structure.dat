25|$|The {{theory of}} false {{necessity}} attempts to understand humans and human history without making ourselves {{the object of}} a law-giving fate. It rejects the assumption that certain and necessary laws of organization and change govern the social, political, and economic institutions of human activity and thereby limit human freedom. It holds that the problem with traditional <b>deep</b> <b>structure</b> theory, such as Marxism, is that it couples the distinction of <b>deep</b> <b>structure</b> and routine practice with both indivisible types of social organization, and deep seated constraints and developmental laws. The theory rejects the constraints and focuses on how human behavior is shaped by the deep structures of these institutions, and how they can be remade at will, either in whole or in part. The aim is to rescue social theory and recreate the project of self-affirmation and society.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how <b>deeper</b> psychosocial <b>structures</b> can be {{examined}} utilising a contemporary provocative theory within workplace reflection to generate more radical insights and innovation. Design/methodology/approach This paper outlines a provocative theory and then presents case examples of how <b>deeper</b> <b>structures</b> can be examined at the micro, meso and macro levels. Findings Deeper psychosocial structures are the forces that keep the status quo firmly in place, but deeper examination of these structures enable radical insights and therefore the possibility of innovation. Research limitations/implications <b>Deep</b> psychosocial <b>structures</b> shape and constitute daily action, and so work based and practitioner researchers can be tricked into thinking they have identified new ways of working, but maybe demonstrating the same workplace behaviours/outcomes. Workplace behaviours, including emotional responses to apparent change, are key indicators of <b>deeper</b> <b>structures.</b> Practical implications Ideas and processes for examining <b>deeper</b> <b>structures</b> can be integrated into daily reflective practices by individuals, within organisational processes, and wider, system processes. However, because <b>deeper</b> <b>structures</b> can appear in different forms, we can be tricked into reproducing old structures. Social implications (if applicable) Examining <b>deeper</b> <b>structures</b> increases the possibilities for more radical insights into workplace structures, and therefore, how to potentially mobilise innovations which may better serve people and planet.

25|$|Linguistic Wars {{arose from}} the falling out of Noam Chomsky's early {{students}} who decided to focus on Chomsky's concept of conceptual <b>deep</b> <b>structure</b> as having {{a central role in}} the way the mind assigns meaning to specific language structures.

25|$|Chomsky's theory {{posits that}} {{language}} consists of both deep structures and surface structures. Surface structure 'faces out' and {{is represented by}} spoken utterances, while <b>deep</b> <b>structure</b> 'faces inward' and expresses the underlying relations between words and conceptual meaning. Transformational grammar is a generative grammar (which dictates that the syntax, or word order, of surface structures adheres to certain principles and parameters) that consists of a limited series of rules, expressed in mathematical notation, which transform deep structures into well-formed surface structures. The transformational grammar thus relates meaning and sound.|$|E

We argue that a procedural system like the one we present is potentially more efficient for time-critical real-world generation applications as it provides fine-grained control of each processing step on the way from input to output representations. In this way the procedural behaviour of the generator can be tailored to the task at hand. During the generation process, the realizer generates flat <b>deep</b> <b>structures</b> from semantic-pragmatic expressions, then syntactic <b>deep</b> <b>structures</b> from the <b>deep</b> semantic-pragmatic <b>structures</b> and from these syntactic <b>deep</b> <b>structures</b> surface strings.

2500|$|Noam Chomsky’s 1965 book Aspects of the Theory of Syntax {{developed}} {{the idea that}} each sentence in a language has two levels of representation — a <b>deep</b> <b>structure</b> and a surface structure. The <b>deep</b> <b>structure</b> represents the core semantic relations of a sentence, and is mapped onto the surface structure (which follows the phonological form of the sentence very closely) via transformations. [...] Chomsky believed there are considerable similarities between languages' deep structures and that these reveal properties, common to all languages, that surface structures conceal. However, this {{may not have been}} the central motivation for introducing deep structure; transformations had been proposed prior to the development of <b>deep</b> <b>structure</b> as a means of increasing the mathematical and descriptive power of context-free grammars. Similarly, <b>deep</b> <b>structure</b> was devised largely for technical reasons relating to early semantic theory. Chomsky emphasizes the importance of modern formal mathematical devices in the development of grammatical theory: ...|$|E
2500|$|Though transformations {{continue}} {{to be important in}} Chomsky's current theories, he has now abandoned the original notion of <b>Deep</b> <b>Structure</b> and Surface Structure. Initially, two additional levels of representation were introduced (LF — Logical Form, and PF [...] Phonetic Form), and then in the 1990s Chomsky sketched out a new program of research known as Minimalism, in which <b>Deep</b> <b>Structure</b> and Surface Structure no longer featured and PF and LF remained as the only levels of representation.|$|E
2500|$|To {{complicate the}} {{understanding}} of the development of Noam Chomsky's theories, the precise meanings of <b>Deep</b> <b>Structure</b> and Surface Structure have changed over time [...] by the 1970s, the two were normally referred to simply as D-Structure and S-Structure by Chomskyan linguists. In particular, the idea that the meaning of a sentence was determined by its <b>Deep</b> <b>Structure</b> (taken to its logical conclusions by the generative semanticists during the same period) was dropped for good by Chomskyan linguists when LF took over this role (previously, Chomsky and Ray Jackendoff had begun to argue that meaning was determined by both Deep and Surface Structure).|$|E

Relationship between concentration of grey matter (brain-cell containing tissue) in different brain regions and social reward dependence was also studied.
