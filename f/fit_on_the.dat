5|$|Charles {{suffered}} a sudden apoplectic <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> morning of 2 February 1685, and died aged 54 at 11:45am {{four days later}} at Whitehall Palace. The suddenness of his illness and death led to suspicion of poison {{in the minds of}} many, including one of the royal doctors; however, a more modern medical analysis has held that the symptoms of his final illness {{are similar to those of}} uraemia (a clinical syndrome due to kidney dysfunction). In the days between his collapse and his death, Charles endured a variety of torturous treatments including bloodletting, purging and cupping in hopes of effecting a recovery.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} built in the Unity game engine, which enabled faster {{prototyping}} across multiple smartphone platforms. It was also designed first to <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> iPhone's smaller screen—a lesson learned from Hitman Go, which had been designed for tablets. The Square Enix team collaborated with Tomb Raider brand owners Crystal Dynamics to fit the series license. The player-character outfits, in particular, were informed by this exchange.|$|E

5|$|Birmingham {{also had}} doubts over their selection. Captain Len Boyd had {{for some time}} been {{suffering}} from a debilitating back problem, and relied on injections to keep him playing. He missed five of the last seven games of the season, but was passed <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wednesday before the game. Fellow wing half Roy Warhurst had injured his thigh in the sixth-round match and played no further part in the season, while Badham, who damaged an ankle {{three weeks before the}} final, travelled on the Thursday {{with the rest of the}} team to their base in Twyford, Berkshire. Jeff Hall was struggling with a virus. When manager Turner announced his team on the eve of the match, Boyd took Warhurst's position at left-half, Badham, who had proved an able deputy in the semi-final, was omitted, and the inexperienced 22-year-old Johnny Newman came in on the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the original The Legend of Zelda for the NES: the world is viewed from a top-down camera angle, it is divided up into many different squares that can <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen, and the main character can move up, down, left, and right across the screen. The player can interact with individuals within towns by gathering information and buying or selling items and equipment. A variety of enemies can be battled on a field screen to gain experience, GP, and items. Within dungeon areas, a number of puzzles may be present and required to be solved in order for the player to advance. The player can also save at any point. A number of weapons can be found throughout the game to maneuver through obstacles such as cutting through trees and thorns.|$|E
5|$|With their {{timeframe}} extended, {{the development}} team added extra attacks for the ten characters, day–night transition interactions, in-game scores and leaderboards, a cooperative multiplayer splitscreen mode, and a post-release update that extends the cooperative mode over online and local network. The team revisited level ideas {{that did not}} <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> previous console, and transitioned from synthesized music and a text-based story to an orchestral soundtrack and voice acting. The cooperative mode was also added retroactively, which challenged the already finalized level design. The most pronounced improvements were in the game's graphics and upgrades. Levels on the Xbox 360 could hold thousands of characters on-screen at once. The team playtested the feel of each elemental warrior and spent extra time refining the gradual difficulty increase in the opening level. In reflection, the project's biggest influences were ultimately Nintendo, Pokémon, and Resident Evil.|$|E

25|$|The Scout {{is given}} a block of wood made of pine, four plastic wheels, and four nails. The {{finished}} car must use all nine pieces, must not exceed a certain weight (usually five ounces (150 grams)), must not exceed a certain width (usually 2-3/4 inches (7cm)) and length (usually 7 inches (17.8cm)) and must <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track used by that particular scout pack.|$|E
25|$|Both insertions and deletions {{are fast}} {{as long as}} space is {{available}} on a block.

The hope is that enough space is available nearby, such {{that a lot of}} blocks {{do not need to be}} reorganized. Alternatively, some out-of-sequence disk blocks may be used.|$|E
25|$|The third Test, {{which was}} the first time a Test match was played in Leeds, was drawn after rain wiped out the final day with England needing 158 runs with all second innings wickets {{remaining}} to win.

25|$|A {{few years}} later, Philips {{decided to give}} CDs the ability to produce video, just like its Laserdisc counterpart. This led to the {{creation}} of CD Video (CD-V) in 1987. However, the disc's small size significantly impeded the ability to store analog video; thus only 5 minutes of picture information could <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> disc's surface (despite the fact that the audio was digital). Therefore, CD-V distribution was limited to featuring music videos.|$|E
25|$|The 1965 film soundtrack was {{released}} by RCA Victor {{and is one of}} the most successful soundtrack albums in history, having sold over 10 million copies worldwide. Recent CD editions incorporate musical material from the film that would not <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> original LP. The label has also issued the soundtrack in German, Italian, Spanish and French editions. RCA Victor also released an album of the 1998 Broadway revival produced by Hallmark Entertainment and featuring the full revival cast, including Rebecca Luker, Michael Siberry, Jan Maxwell and Fred Applegate.|$|E
25|$|Samples for SEM {{have to be}} {{prepared}} to withstand the vacuum conditions and high energy beam of electrons, and have to be of a size that will <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> specimen stage. Samples are generally mounted rigidly to a specimen holder or stub using a conductive adhesive. SEM is used extensively for defect analyis of semiconductor wafers, and manufacturers make instruments that can examine any part of a 300 mm semiconductor wafer. Many instruments have chambers that can tilt an object of that size to 45° and provide continuous 360° rotation.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{recording}} mastering {{and manufacturing}} limitations, both {{high and low}} frequencies {{were removed from the}} first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record, and noise is reduced.|$|E
25|$|As fifth {{generation}} games {{became more}} complex in content, sound and graphics, games began {{to exceed the}} limits of cartridge storage capacity. Nintendo 64 cartridges had a maximum of 64MB of data, whereas CDs held 650MB. Software ported from other platforms was often heavily compressed or redesigned with the storage limits of a cartridge in mind. Due to the cartridge's space limitations, full motion video was not usually feasible for use in cutscenes. When it was present, it was heavily compressed to <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cartridge and usually of very brief length. Some third party companies also complained that they were at an unfair disadvantage when publishing games for Nintendo consoles, since Nintendo owned the manufacturing plant where cartridges for their consoles are made and therefore could sell their first party games at a lower price.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{clearing}} differ between the half mask, which covers {{the eyes and}} nose, and the full-face mask, which also covers the mouth. If the mask has a purge valve and the strap tension is correct, the diver holds the head so that the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good <b>fit</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> diver's face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along the bottom edge of the skirt. It {{may be necessary to}} press {{the upper part of the}} mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the fit is not perfect, or the strap is too low, contact pressure of the top edge against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.|$|E
