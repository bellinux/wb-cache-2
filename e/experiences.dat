A lack of comprehensive recognition of tourist <b>experience</b> often results in blind point in tourist <b>experience</b> management. The paper firstly analyzed the components of tourist <b>experience</b> and divided them into two categories as of peak touristic <b>experience</b> and supporting <b>experience.</b> On this basis, two-factor theory was borrowed to be applied in tourist <b>experience</b> management.

40|$|This study aims to seek {{a design}} {{strategy}} directivity, by examining <b>experience</b> design elements to apply to space, and analyzing <b>experience</b> design characteristics of corporate brand <b>experience</b> spaces. For this study, the concepts and characteristics of corporate brand <b>experience</b> space and <b>experience</b> design were defined, and design application plans were extracted through a case analysis. The spatial range of this study targeted Hyundai Motor Studio, Kakao Friends Shop and Line Friends Store where are indirect marketing spaces where have been built for the recent 3 years and brand <b>experience</b> spaces that belong to consumption spaces. The study results were extracted from this process. First, Hyundai Motor Studio had the biggest number of <b>experience</b> design characteristics, and {{it was followed by}} Line Friends Store and Kakao Friends Shop. When <b>experience</b> design characteristics were analyzed, an aesthetic <b>experience</b> element had the biggest intensity of <b>experience</b> design characteristics, and it was followed by an entertainment <b>experience</b> element, an escapism <b>experience</b> element and an educational <b>experience</b> element. Second, compared to other characteristics, an aesthetic <b>experience</b> element and an entertainment <b>experience</b> element were mainly revealed, and an educational <b>experience</b> element was hardly revealed. Third, when there were stronger <b>experience</b> design characteristics in brand <b>experience</b> spaces, the store stay time increased, and purchase activities became active. These findings demonstrate {{that there will be a}} need to increase <b>experience</b> design elements for space design and actively introduce various <b>experience</b> elements which escape from existing space design methods...|$|R
