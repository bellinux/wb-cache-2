40|$|Objectives: To {{calculate}} {{the costs of}} blood collection, testing, storage, and transfusion in Greece. Methods: Costing information was collected from two large public hospitals, in Athens and Crete, that also act as blood banks. Given that private health care accounts for 40 percent of total health spending, the same costs were also considered in a private setting by collecting key reagent cost data from a leading private hospital in Athens. Mainly direct costs were considered (advertising campaigns, personnel, storage and maintenance, reagent costs, transportation costs from blood bank to end-use hospitals, and cross-matching and transfusion costs in receiving hospitals) and some <b>indirect</b> <b>costs</b> (<b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of blood donorship). Results: Captive donorship accounts for over 50 {{percent of the national}} blood supply. A unit of blood transfused would cost between € 294. 83 and € 339. 83 in public hospitals and could reach € 413. 93 in a private facility. This figure may be an underestimate, as it excludes <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of blood transfusion for patients and the healthcare system. Conclusions: Blood has a significant cost to the health system. Policy makers and practitioners should encourage its rational use, build on current policies to further improve collection and distribution, encourage further volunteer donorship in Greece, and also consider alternatives to blood where the possibility exists...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{research}} conducted for my dissertation covers topics from labor economics {{and consists of}} three empirical papers. In the first chapter, co-authored with Michal Franta, we analyze the demand for tertiary education in the Czech Republic depending on university proximity. The study explores {{the difference in the}} probability of entering tertiary education for two secondary school graduates who differ only in that the first one resides within commuting distance to a university while the other one does not. We presume that the advantage of having access to a local university follows in two ways: first, attending a non-local university is associated with costs, either for monetary or non-monetary reasons. These include direct costs (travel costs, accommodation outside the parental home) and <b>indirect</b> <b>costs</b> (<b>opportunity</b> <b>costs).</b> If individuals are cost sensitive, these extra costs may affect their decision to attend a university and which particular university to attend. Second, informational advantages from a university environment are beneficial in the enrollment process to a university. The information advantage to a potential applicant transfers through face-to-face contacts with university students and easier access to preparatory courses organized by local faculty for applicants, etc. We [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Avoiding inbreeding, and {{therefore}} avoiding inbreeding depression in offspring fitness, is widely {{assumed to be}} adaptive in systems with biparental reproduction. However, inbreeding can also confer an inclusive fitness benefit stemming from increased relatedness between parents and inbred offspring. Whether or not inbreeding or avoiding inbreeding is adaptive therefore depends on a balance between inbreeding depression and increased parent-offspring relatedness. Existing models of biparental inbreeding predict threshold values of inbreeding depression above which males and females should avoid inbreeding, and predict sexual conflict over inbreeding because these thresholds diverge. However, these models implicitly assume that if a focal individual avoids inbreeding, then both it and its rejected relative will subsequently outbreed. We show that relaxing this assumption of reciprocal outbreeding, and the assumption that focal individuals are themselves outbred, can substantially alter the predicted thresholds for inbreeding avoidance for focal males. Specifically, the magnitude of inbreeding depression below which inbreeding increases a focal male’s inclusive fitness increases with increasing depression in the offspring of a focal female and her alternative mate, and it decreases with increasing relatedness between a focal male and a focal female’s alternative mate, thereby altering the predicted zone of sexual conflict. Furthermore, a focal male’s inclusive fitness gain from avoiding inbreeding is reduced by <b>indirect</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> if his rejected relative breeds with another relative of his. By demonstrating that variation in relatedness and inbreeding can affect intra- and inter-sexual conflict over inbreeding, our models lead to novel predictions for family dynamics. Specifically, parent-offspring conflict over inbreeding might depend on the alternative mates of rejected relatives, and male-male competition over inbreeding might lead to mixed inbreeding strategies. Making testable quantitative predictions regarding inbreeding strategies occurring in nature will therefore require new models that explicitly capture variation in relatedness and inbreeding among interacting population members...|$|R

According to certification theory, companies backed by private equity investors are expected to have lower underpricing at the moment of an initial public offering, as they have fewer adverse selection problems, and there is less ex-ante uncertainty. However, the relationship between private equity backing and the cost of going public to issuers is less clear. We use a data set of 66 private equity-backed and 94 non-private equity-backed companies that went public on the Milan Stock Exchange between January 1998 and June 2008.

The work enclosed in this thesis demonstrates that there is a considerable requirement for accurately modelling cost components of the maintenance model, to be used in maintenance scheduling for deregulated power system, in order to attain a superior schedule with major financial and operational impact. This research investigates and models most cost factors that affect the maintenance activities of the deregulated GENCOs, and demonstrates the utilization of the developed cost models in maintenance scheduling. It also presents the data gathering process for the developed maintenance cost model. A generator maintenance scheduling model that considers direct and <b>indirect</b> maintenance <b>costs,</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> (i. e. loss of customer goodwill), effective maintenance strategies, failures, and interruptions is developed. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach is employed to achieve maintenance schedules to various generators maintenance scenarios. An Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach is proposed for modelling customer goodwill. The maintenance model was redeveloped under the Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM) strategy to analyze the effect of a maintenance strategy on maintenance costs. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the utilisation of the developed models. The investigation shows that the market prices, <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> and maintenance strategy have an effect on the final maintenance schedule. The research demonstrates that the cost components are critical factors to achieve an effective maintenance schedule, and they must be considered and carefully modelled in order to reflect more realistic situation for maintenance scheduling of generator units in deregulation environment.

The total expenditure on Nigerian health care as a percentage of gross domestic product, and the percentage of federal government expenditure on health care is far below the World Health Organization recommended standard. Thus, caregivers pay out of their pockets to settle health care expenses of their children thereby creating a negative microeconomic impact on parents, households and health workers. Herein, we report the case management of newly diagnosed Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) in an eight-year-old boy from a low socioeconomic class (SEC), and the costs implication of the child’s hospital care. After forgoing <b>indirect</b> <b>costs</b> like <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> which is difficult to determine, the direct total cost involved in patient’s hospital care for DKA was forty eight thousand eight hundred naira only (N 48, 800. 00) equivalent to three hundred and ten United States Dollars and eighty three cents (310. 83 USD).

40|$|The {{scaling up}} of {{antiviral}} treatment (ART) {{coverage in the}} past decade has increased access to care for numerous people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in low-resource settings. Out-of-pocket payments (OOPs) represent a barrier for healthcare access, adherence and ART effectiveness, and can be economically catastrophic for PLWHA and their family. We evaluated OOPs of PLWHA attending outpatient and inpatient care units and estimated the financial burden for their households in the Lao People's Democratic Republic. We assumed that such OOPs may result in catastrophic health expenses in this context with fragile economical balance and low health insurance coverage. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a randomized sample of routine outpatients and a prospective survey of consecutive new inpatients at two referral hospitals (Setthathirat in the capital city, Savannaket in the province). After obtaining informed consent, PLWHA were interviewed using a standardized 82 -item questionnaire including information on socio-economic characteristics, disease history and coping strategies. All OOPs occurring during a routine visit or a hospital stay were recorded. Household capacity-to-pay (overall income minus essential expenses), direct and indirect OOPs, OOPs per outpatient visit and per inpatient stay as well as catastrophic spending (greater than or equal to 40 % of the capacity-to-pay) were calculated. A multivariate analysis of factors associated with catastrophic spending was conducted. A total of 320 PLWHA [280 inpatients and 40 outpatients; 132 (41. 2 %) defined as poor, and 269 (84. 1 %) on ART] were enrolled. Monthly median household income, essential expenses and capacity-to-pay were US$ 147. 0 (IQR: 86 - 242), $ 126 (IQR: 82 - 192) and $ 14 (IQR: 19 - 80), respectively. At the provincial hospital OOPs were higher during routine visits, but three fold lower during hospitalization than in the central hospital ($ 21. 0 versus $ 18. 5 and $ 110. 8 versus $ 329. 8 respectively (p< 0. 01). The most notable OOPs were related to transportation and to loss of income. A total of 150 patients (46. 8 %; 95 %CI: 41. 3 - 52. 5) were affected by catastrophic health expenses; 36 outpatients (90. 0 %; 95 %CI: 76. 3 - 97. 2) and 114 inpatients (40. 7 %; 95 %CI: 34. 9 - 46. 7). A total of 141 (44. 0 %) patients had contracted loans, and 127 (39. 6 %) had to sell some of their assets. In the multivariate analysis, being of Lao Loum ethnic group (Coef. - 1. 4; p = 0. 04); being poor (Coef. - 1. 0; p = 0. 01) and living more than 100 km away from the hospital (Coef. - 1. 0; p = 0. 002) were positively associated with catastrophic spending. Conversely being in the highest wealth quartile (Coef. 1. 6; p< 0. 001), living alone (Coef. 1. 1; p = 0. 04), attending the provincial hospital (Coef. 1. 0; p = 0. 002), and being on ART (Coef. 1. 2; p = 0. 003), were negatively associated with catastrophic spending. PLWHA's households face catastrophic OOPs that are not directly attributable to the cost of ART or to follow-up tests, particularly during a hospitalization period. Transportation, distance to healthcare and time spent at the health facility are the major contributors for OOPs and for <b>indirect</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs.</b> Being on ART and attending the provincial hospital were associated with a lower risk of catastrophic spending. Decentralization of care, access to ART and alleviation of OOPs are crucial factors to successfully decrease the household burden of HIV-AIDS expenses...|$|R

40|$|Every {{consumer}} decision incurs a cost. An hour spent researching {{products is}} an hour not spent working. Vacation days {{used in the}} winter are vacation days not used in the summer. A dollar spent on a car payment is a dollar not spent dining out. What determines {{the extent to which}} consumers consider such <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> when making decisions? Although every purchase requires an outlay cost (i. e., spending dollars in order to obtain a good), outlay costs only have economic significance because some other good or service must be given up as a result. Consumers have unlimited wants but limited resources, so satisfying one want means not satisfying another (the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost).</b> An <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> is "the evaluation placed on the most highly valued of the rejected alternatives or opportunities" (Buchanan 2008) or "the loss of other alternatives when one alternative is chosen" (Oxford English Dictionary 2010). <b>Opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> are foundational to the science of economics and, normatively, consumers should account for <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> in every decision they make. I define <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> consideration as "considering alternative uses for one's resources when deciding whether to spend resources on a focal option. " Because consumers face <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs,</b> every purchase decision is effectively a choice among alternative resource uses, not just a decision of whether or not to make a particular purchase. When consumers consider their <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs,</b> alternative resource uses specify the broadest form of competition that products face: each resource use competes for share-of-wallet with all other potential resource uses. Understanding when consumers consider a purchase decision as an allocation across multiple options, and what those considered options are, allows researchers and practitioners to better understand why consumers make the purchases that they do, why they restrain from making the purchases that they do not, and how to influence purchases of focal options by increasing or decreasing consideration of alternative resource uses. What determines when consumers consider <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs?</b> In Essay 1, I propose that consumers consider <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> when they perceive immediate resource constraints. In Essay 2, I propose that consumers consider <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> when the resource in use increases the accessibility of alternative resource uses in memory. Beyond addressing when consumers consider <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs,</b> I address three additional questions. First, who is more likely to consider <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs?</b> Individuals with a high propensity to plan are likely to consider <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> even when they are not immediately constrained. Second, which <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> are consumers more likely to consider? Consumers are more likely to consider <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> that are more typical of the category of possible resource uses than <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> that are less typical of the category of possible resource uses. Third, what are the consequences of <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> consideration? Individuals who consider their <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> are more sensitive to their value than those who do not consider them. In addition to aiding our understanding of the consumer decision process, understanding <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> consideration has important implications for consumers' sensitivities to the structure of the decision environment, understanding the nature of competition and cross-price elasticities, memory for foregone options, and construction of preferences.

Methods: We used the nationally representative 2003 - 2010 ATUS to estimate <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> associated with ambulatory medical visits. We estimated <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> for employed adults using self-reported hourly wages and for unemployed adults using a Heckman selection model. We used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to compare <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> with direct costs (ie, patient out-of-pocket, provider reimbursement) in 2010. Results: Average total time per visit was 121 minutes (95...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel account of why intertemporal {{decisions}} tend to display impatience: People {{pay more attention}} to the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of choosing larger, later rewards than to the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of choosing smaller, sooner ones. Eight studies show that when the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of choosing smaller, sooner rewards are subtly highlighted, people become more patient, whereas highlighting the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of choosing larger, later rewards has no effect. This pattern is robust to variations in the choice task, to the participant population, and is observed for both incentivized and hypothetical choices. We argue that people are naturally aware of the <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> associated with delayed rewards, but pay less attention to those associated with taking smaller, sooner ones. We conclude by discussing implications for theory and policy...|$|R

The explicit <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> {{of the factors}} of production not already owned by a producer is the price that the producer {{has to pay for}} them. For instance, if a firm spends $100 on electrical power consumed, its explicit <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> is $100. This cash expenditure represents a lost opportunity to purchase something else with the $100.|$|R
5|$|The {{marginal}} rate {{of transformation}} {{can be expressed}} in terms of either commodity. The marginal <b>opportunity</b> <b>costs</b> of guns in terms of butter is simply the reciprocal of the marginal <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of butter in terms of guns. If, for example, the (absolute) slope at point BB in the diagram is equal to 2, to produce one more packet of butter, the production of 2 guns must be sacrificed. If at AA, the marginal <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of butter in terms of guns is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets of butter, and the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of guns in terms of butter is 4.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT __________________________________________________________________________________ The flow <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> {{of moving}} from {{unemployment}} to employment consists of foregone public benefits and the foregone value of non-working time in units of consumption. We construct a time {{series of the}} <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of employment using detailed microdata and administrative or national accounts data to estimate benefit levels, eligibility and take-up of benefits, consumption by labor force status, hours per worker, taxes, and preference parameters. Our estimated <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> is procyclical and volatile over the business cycle. The estimated cyclicality implies far less unemployment volatility in many lead-ing models {{of the labor market}} than that observed in the data, irrespective of the level of the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R

Our purpose is to investigate whether these rules {{can be interpreted as}} near-rational investment strategies for rational investors. We analyze four di. erent exchange rates and find that the <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of using chartist rules tends to be prohibitively high. We also present a method to decompose this <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> into parts related to investor's irrationality and misallocation of wealth. The results show that irrationality of chartist beliefs is {{an important component of the}} total <b>opportunity</b> <b>cost</b> of using technical trading rules. exchange rate;technical trading rule...|$|R
