5|$|State Highway 34 {{was first}} {{designated}} on June 15, 1931. At that time, the highway {{began at the}} free bridge over the Red River north of Quanah, Texas, and followed what is today SH-6 {{to the point that}} is now SH-34's southern terminus. There, it turned north, following its current alignment. Its 1931 alignment <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> <b>significantly</b> from that of the present day (although it followed US-66 through Elk City prior to the establishment of I-40) until it got to Woodward. Rather than continue north out of town, the SH-34 of that day instead turned west, then north, passing through Fort Supply and crossing into Harper County just north of that town. It then began a concurrency with US-60 in Buffalo, turning east and connecting with its final segment, bringing it to the Kansas state line. Thus, SH-34 started life as a border-to-border highway.|$|E
25|$|Heavy metal {{toxicity}} {{has been}} proposed as a hypothetical etiology of autism, and dysfunction of MT synthesis and activity {{may play a role}} in this. Many heavy metals, including mercury, lead, and arsenic have been linked to symptoms that resemble the neurological symptoms of autism. However, MT dysfunction has not specifically been linked to autistic spectrum disorders. A 2006 study, investigating children exposed to the vaccine preservative thiomersal, found that levels of MT and antibodies to MT in autistic children <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> <b>significantly</b> from non-autistic children.|$|E

This study however was comparing one small Swedish-speaking municipality of 4652 inhabitants to Finnish-speaking provinces and only tells about the origin of two different Y-DNA haplotypes.|$|E
