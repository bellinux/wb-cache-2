500|$|During World War II, Citizen Kane was {{not seen}} in most European countries. It was shown in France {{for the first time}} on July 10, 1946 at the Marbeuf theatre in Paris. Initially [...] most French film critics were {{influenced}} by the negative reviews of Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945 and Georges Sadoul in 1946. At that time many French intellectuals and filmmakers shared Sartre's negative opinion that Hollywood filmmakers were uncultured. Sartre criticized the film's flashbacks for its nostalgic and romantic preoccupation with the past instead of the realities of the present and said that [...] "the whole film is based on a misconception of what cinema is all about. The film is in the past tense, whereas we all know that cinema has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the present tense." ...|$|E
500|$|Amanda Mealing plays Colonel Eleanor Grant, a [...] "smart, tough {{military}} leader who is skilled {{with a gun}} and diplomacy, but knows when to break a rule or two." [...] She is the new head of Section 20, replacing Hugh Collinson from the first series. Mealing described Grant as [...] "hard as nails," [...] "very contained, very direct," [...] and [...] "very driven." [...] Grant is also very distant from her team; [...] "she commands so she is not their pal but, at the same time, the guys are like her family. They spend so much time together moving from place to place. But, in a kind of motherly way, she has to keep them in check and sometimes they need a firm hand." [...] The actress called her role [...] "the best role I've ever had," [...] adding [...] "when I'm doing action scenes like flying in helicopters, the hardest thing is to keep a serious face as all I want to do is scream for joy." [...] She researched for her role by taking advice from a female officer in a similar high-ranking position as Grant is. One piece of advice the officer gave Mealing was [...] "you mustn't try {{to be one of the}} boys or they'll lose respect for you, but you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> charge." ...|$|E

[...] On August 24, 2007, his 42nd birthday, Miller decided against any comeback, stating: [...] "Physically, I know I could have done it.

500|$|Julia Ward AOL's TV Squad {{said that}} while the episode [...] "delivered plenty of funny" [...] it [...] "seemed a bit off-kilter. It had fewer laughs-per-minute than the past few episodes, and structurally, I think the writers couldn't decide which story to foreground." [...] She complimented the series for having [...] "an {{interesting}} take" [...] on the hip-hop satire that was featured in [...] "The Source Awards". [...] "From where I sit, it's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the top five, if not three", said TV Guides Matt Mitovich in regards to this episode. Mitovich noted, [...] "...I can only bow with great reverence to the effort that goes into 30 Rock, where in an episode like this week's, every other line is funny and/or fantastically absurd." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning opined than an episode like this one, with its guest stars and taking on the issue of race, got [...] "some decent laughs", though it [...] "failed to produce a solid half hour." [...] Canning disliked LL Cool J's guest spot, observing that it was [...] "nothing more than a generic caricature put in the role of a sub-par straight man", but enjoyed Wayne Brady's, as he was [...] "a successful part of the episode's best storyline." [...] Canning said that Tracy as Oprah was [...] "more weird than funny, unfortunately", but liked that Jason Sudeikis made a brief appearance as [...] "Flower Guy" [...] in the episode. In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. Mekeisha Madden Toby for The Detroit News found the episode a [...] "side-splitter".|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E

Stallholders are protesting at the council’s decision to bring in a “commercial operator” to manage the market. Why would the council would do that? Not only for efficiency reasons, but as a councillor mentions, the market needs to “wash its face”. Bringing in a market organiser for Berwick Street is a way of changing {{the look and feel of}} the market and the area; as a market campaigner says in the article “the reinvention of markets has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done <b>in</b> a curated way”...|$|R

40|$|By {{combining}} the agar gel electrophoresis method with {{the method of}} specifically demonstrating oxaloacetate using diazonium salt, a simple method was developed for the detection on glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) isozyme of human organs. This method showed two types of <b>GOT</b> isozyme <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present <b>in</b> human organs. In the heart, liver, kidney, spleen, stomach and pancreas there were the band between α_ 2 globulin fraction and β-globulin fraction and γ-globulin fraction.

2500|$|In December 1990, Chrétien {{returned}} to the House of Commons after winning a by-election in the safe Liberal riding of Beauséjour, New Brunswick. The incumbent, Fernand Robichaud, stood down in Chrétien's favour, which is traditional practice when a newly elected party leader {{does not have a}} seat in House of Commons. Initially, Chrétien had planned to wait until the next general election before running, but was advised by Herb Gray that: [...] "To have credibility, you're <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the House. You can't afford to wait two more years until a general election". Gray's appeal changed Chrétien's mind about when to seek a seat in the House of Commons. For much of 1991–92, Chrétien found himself emotionally exhausted after his adopted son Michel was charged with kidnapping, rape, and sodomy against a Montreal woman and was convicted. Michel Chrétien suffered from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and had a long history of legal trouble.|$|E
2500|$|Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said of Cornell: [...] "I’ve {{always said}} that Chris was the {{greatest}} songwriter to ever come out of Seattle. Jimi Hendrix could play the guitar like crazy, but Chris had the song-writing chops that we all sort of hoped to get to {{at different points in}} our songwriting careers. He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and all of those things. I think that’s part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there’s not too many people that have that many options with their voice. He could do {{a lot of different things}} with it, and have a lot of different characters in that voice. I feel so lucky that I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a project with him, got to hang out with him, and just sort of witness his greatness." ...|$|E

500|$|Against that backdrop, the Browns {{finished}} the 1974 {{season with a}} 4–10 record, only the second losing season in the team's history. Phipps' woes persisted, and he shared playing time with rookie quarterback Brian Sipe, who Cleveland selected in the 13th round of the 1972 draft out of San Diego State. Modell fired Skorich after the season. [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a winner <b>in</b> this game, and I just didn't produce", Skorich said at the time. After pursuing Dolphins offensive line coach Monte Clark, Modell hired Forrest Gregg as Skorch's replacement. Gregg, an assistant coach and former Green Bay Packers offensive lineman, preached a hard-nosed, physical brand of football, learned as an offensive lineman on Green Bay's dynastic 1960s teams under Lombardi. His success as a player, however, did not immediately translate into success as a coach. The regular season began with the worst losing streak in Cleveland's history. Gregg's first win did not come until November 23 against Paul Brown's Cincinnati Bengals, and Cleveland finished with a 3–11 record.|$|R

500|$|At {{the heart}} of this scene is Cable's song [...] "You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Carefully Taught", <b>in</b> which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less [...] "briskly", as there <b>was</b> much bigotry <b>in</b> Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taught <b>to</b> hate and fear?'... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough." [...] Nevertheless, another wrote, [...] "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself <b>is</b> not helpful <b>to</b> the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".|$|R

2500|$|The Layla LP was {{actually}} recorded by a five-piece {{version of the}} group, thanks to the unforeseen inclusion of guitarist Duane Allman of the Allman Brothers Band. A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowd—who was also producing the Allmans—invited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his slide guitar to [...] "Tell the Truth" [...] and [...] "Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out".

30|$|Second, {{climate change}} {{potential}} security risks on Europe could also {{come from the}} climate impacted energy producing and exporting countries to the European market. That is, if countries such as Nigeria, Algeria, and Equatorial Guinea among others <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> severely affected by climate change, gas and oil supply and distribution into the European market could easily <b>be</b> disrupted. <b>In</b> this scenario, many European countries will face economic and security problems because oil prices will likely rise and that can have negative impacts on economic growth. In addition, this potential energy security risk will not just <b>be</b> confined <b>to</b> Europe; the risks will be shared worldwide. Therefore, {{we believe that the}} EU should do its utmost to integrate its diverse foreign policy commitments to Africa and make them more coherent in order for the Partnership on climate change to not encroach on other policy areas. Moreover, we also believe that the EU and its African partners should engage all development actors operating in Africa to incorporate and link climate change issues in their development projects.
