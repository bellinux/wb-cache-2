5|$|On Allward's {{urging the}} Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission hired Oscar Faber, a Danish {{structural}} engineer, in 1924 to prepare foundation plans and provide general {{supervision of the}} foundation work. Faber had recently designed the substructure for the Menin Gate at Ypres, and he selected a design that employed cast-in-place reinforced concrete to which the <b>facing</b> <b>stone</b> would be bonded. Major Unwin Simson served as the principal Canadian engineer during {{the construction of the}} memorial and oversaw much of the daily operations at the site. Allward moved to Paris in 1925 to supervise construction and the carving of the sculptures. Construction commenced in 1925 and took eleven years to complete. The Imperial War Graves Commission concurrently employed French and British veterans to carry out the necessary roadwork and site landscaping.|$|E
25|$|The {{cost of the}} Elan valley scheme {{ran over}} budget because of the failure to find {{suitable}} building stone near any of the dams apart from Caban-coch, {{as well as the}} necessity of bringing in <b>facing</b> <b>stone</b> from other quarries in mid and south Wales.|$|E
500|$|Allward had {{initially}} hoped to use white marble for the memorial's <b>facing</b> <b>stone,</b> but Percy Nobbs suggested {{this would be}} a mistake because marble was unlikely to weather well in northern France and the memorial would have a [...] "ghost like" [...] appearance. Allward undertook a tour of almost two years to find stone of the right colour, texture, and luminosity. He found it in the ruins of Diocletian's Palace at Split, Croatia; he observed that the palace had not weathered over the years, which Allward took as evidence of the stone's durability. His choice—Seget limestone—came from an ancient Roman quarry located near Seget, Croatia. The difficulties with the quarrying process, coupled with complicated transportation logistics, delayed delivery of the limestone and thus construction of the memorial. The first shipment did not arrive at the site until 1927, and the larger blocks, intended for the human figures, did not begin to arrive until 1931.|$|E
50|$|The wall is {{constructed}} predominantly of large stone blocks concreted together, {{with a large}} <b>face</b> <b>stone,</b> placed {{at the intersection of}} the wall lengths, addressing the Gregory Mine Road. The <b>face</b> <b>stone</b> contains spaces for four plaques. Some pieces of petrified timber have also been used {{in the construction of the}} wall.|$|R

500|$|The keep {{occupies}} the southern corner of Peveril Castle. Construction probably began in around 1176, instigated by HenryII. Its plan is square, measuring less than , and the parapet is [...] above the keep's base; {{as the ground}} is uneven, {{on the other side}} it rises [...] above ground level. It is smaller than contemporary royal keeps such as those at Dover and Scarborough Castles. Today the exterior is coarse, but originally the facing would have been smooth; the south-east side, where the steep natural slope prevented removal of the <b>facing</b> <b>stone,</b> gives an idea of how it may once have appeared. A projection in the south-east face of the keep housed a garderobe. As was usual with Norman keeps, Peveril's was entered through the first floor and was accessed by a staircase. This entrance level would have been a large public room and the basement used for storage. A narrow staircase in the east corner allowed access to the basement and the wall walk around the top of the keep.|$|E
500|$|John of Gaunt's {{ownership}} {{marked the}} start of Peveril Castle's decline. He was the richest nobleman in England and held several castles. As Peveril Castle was relatively unimportant, John decided not to maintain it and in 1374 gave orders to strip the lead from the buildings for re-use at Pontefract Castle. It was inherited by his son Henry Bolingbroke, later King HenryIV, and remained under royal control, administered by the Duchy of Lancaster. During the 15th century, Peveril became less important as administrative functions were moved elsewhere. Although other castles administered by the Duchy of Lancaster were repaired in 1480, {{there is no indication}} that this happened at Peveril. A survey conducted for the Duchy in 1561 revealed that Peveril was in a state of decay, and as a result, along with Donnington, was one of two castles that were subsequently abandoned. The castle however hosted local courts until 1600. A survey in 1609 found that Peveril was [...] "very ruinous and serveth for no use". At some point in the post-medieval period the keep's <b>facing</b> <b>stone</b> was removed from three sides. The steep slope prevented the removal of the stone from the fourth side. At one point, the castle was used to house animals.|$|E

The corners of the arcade have parapets of ashlar stonework with curved copings which rise to form the solid corner balustrading of the verandah above. Timber verandah posts support curved verandah beams and eaves brackets and are of a scale and detail that suggest the domestic function of the first floor.|$|R

2500|$|Gemologically speaking, ammolite can {{be grouped}} with the shell-based marbles. This group {{includes}} lumachella or [...] "fire marble", a similarly iridescent marble composed of fossilized clam and snail shells. Found in Italy and Austria, lumachella is rarely if ever used in jewelry; rather, {{it is used}} as a decorative <b>facing</b> <b>stone</b> or in mosaics. The iridescence of lumachella is fragmentary and not nearly as brilliant as that of ammolite. Despite these differences, lumachella may be considered synonymous with ammolite in some circles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{middle section}} rises to four stories, with various decks and {{terraces}} rising to five stories, and the central [...] tower rising to six stories. [...] There are six doors at the northeast base (<b>facing</b> <b>Stone</b> Alley) of the middle section, some accessing the first floor, others accessing stairways leading to the upper floors. [...] A brick between stories five and six in the tower is stamped with [...] "1946," [...] and a marble slab in the tower's open-air pavilion is stamped with [...] "1949," [...] giving {{some idea of the}} dates of completion. [...] Along with the tower, the roof of the middle section consists of a series of irregular marble terraces, some accessed by exterior stairways, and some accessed by interior stairways.|$|E

[...] The bridge is an Warren through-truss bridge. [...] There is a similar span over the intersection of East Third and Iowa Streets. [...] The second contributing structure is approximately [...] of the second elevated crescent-shaped rail bed. [...] It lies just north of East Fourth Street in {{the southeast corner of}} the district. [...] The rest of the berm and the bridge that spanned Fourth Street were removed in the 1970s. [...] The original stone bridge abutments {{on the north side of}} Fourth Street remain in a deteriorated condition and without the <b>facing</b> <b>stone.</b>|$|E

50|$|The William Ogburn House is a {{historic}} ruin located north of East Peru, Iowa, United States. This 1½-story limestone structure is an early example of a vernacular farm house, and the only known saltbox residence known to exist in Madison County. It is attributed to David Harris who used innovative design variations that were not used by other local masons. The stone of the main facade is composed of finished cut quarry <b>faced</b> <b>stone</b> laid two against one with broken bond within courses. The other elevations are composed of rubble limestone. It also features quoins and jambs of finished cut quarry <b>faced</b> <b>stone.</b> The house suffered a fire so only the stone walls remain. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.|$|R
