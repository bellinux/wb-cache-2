40|$|A {{mechanism}} for the transition between low/hard, high/soft, and steep power law (SPL) spectral states in black hole X-ray binaries is proposed. The low/hard state is explained {{by the development of}} a magnetically arrested accretion disk attributable to the accumulation of a vertical magnetic field in a central bundle. This disk forms powerful jets and consists of thin spiral accretion streams of a dense optically thick plasma surrounded by hot, magnetized, optically thin corona, which emits most of the energy in hard X-rays. State transition occurs because of the quasi-periodic or random inversion of poloidal magnetic fields in the accretion flow supplied by the secondary star. The inward advection of the <b>inverted</b> <b>field</b> results in a temporal disappearance of the central bundle caused by the annihilation of the opposed fields and restoration of the optically thick disk in the innermost region. This disk represents the high/soft state. The SPL state develops at the period of intensive field annihilation and precedes the high/soft state. The continuous supply of the <b>inverted</b> <b>field</b> leads to a new low/hard state because of the formation of another magnetically arrested disk. Comment: 5 plot files are attached separately.

40|$|Idealized {{numerical}} {{experiments are}} conducted {{to understand the}} effect of upper-tropospheric potential vorticity (PV) anomalies on an environment conducive to severe weather. Anomalies are specified as a single isolated vortex, a string of vortices analogous to a negatively tilted trough, {{and a pair of}} string vortices analogous to a position error in a negatively tilted trough. The anomalies are placed adjacent to the tropopause along a strong upper-level jet at a time just prior to a major tornado outbreak and inverted using the nonlinear balance equations. In addition to the expected destabilization beneath and adjacent to a cyclonic PV anomaly, the spatial pattern of the inverted balanced streamfunction and height fields is distorted by the presence of the horizontal PV gradient along the upper-tropospheric jet stream. Streamfunction anomalies are elongated in the cross-jet direction, while height and temperature anomalies are elongated in the along-jet direction. The amplitude of the <b>inverted</b> <b>fields,</b> as well as the changes in CAPE associated with the inverted temperature perturbations, are linearly proportional to the amplitudes of the PV anomalies themselves, and the re-sponses to complex PV perturbation structures are approximated by the sum of the responses to individual simple PV anomalies. This is true for the range of PV amplitudes tested, which was designed to mimic typical 6 -h forecast or analysis errors and produced changes in CAPE beneath the trough of well over 100 J kg 1. Impacts on <b>inverted</b> <b>fields</b> are largest when the PV anomaly is on the anticyclonic shear side of the jet, where background PV is small, compared with the cyclonic shear side of the jet, where background PV is large. 1...|$|R

The flowmeter profiles contain information about relative vertical distributions of hydraulic conductivity, while drawdown measurements of pumping tests provide information about horizontal fluctuation of the depth-averaged hydraulic conductivity.

However, when the same mice are allowed access to visual cues, {{they are able to}} orient themselves towards home despite the presence of <b>inverted</b> magnetic <b>fields.</b> This indicates that when woodmice are displaced, they use magnetic fields to orient themselves if there are no other cues available. However, early studies of these subjects were criticized because of the difficulty of completely removing sensory cues, and in some because the tests were performed out of the natural environment. In others, the results of these experiments do not conclusively show a response to magnetic fields when deprived of other cues, because the magnetic field was artificially changed before the test rather than during it.|$|R

40|$|Our {{research}} {{introduced a}} method to monitor saturation in the near surface. In agricultural settings, methods measuring electrical conductivity can provide useful information about soil type, moisture content, and salinity extent. Electrical conductivity meters {{have been used in}} a number of studies to determine soil properties in a qualitative sense. We examined the range of structures in which the use of low-induction number instruments can be used successfully to determine layered-earth electrical conductivity. We used an inversion routine which employs a Bayesian modification to the ridge-regression technique with a priori conductivity assumptions typical of agricultural areas. We performed joint inversion of horizontal and vertical dipole configurations at two coil separations for layer over half-space models with electrical properties of silt, loam, clay, and saline waters. Generally, the inversion code resolved layer thickness to better than 25 % and electrical conductivity to better than 20 % if the layer is less than 3 -m thick. We then <b>inverted</b> <b>field</b> measurements acquired in salt-scalded areas in the Yass River Valley, New South Wales, Australia, to determine a layer over a half-space. With Kennedy&# 039;s formulation concerning the relationship between porosity, water saturation and electrical conductivity, we used the field results to predict autumn water saturation for the top layer to be 13 % and the bottom layer to be 15 %. In the spring, we used the field results to predict saturation of 50 % for the top layer and 51 % for the bottom layer, leading to a seasonal variation in soil saturation of approximately 36 %.

40|$|International audienceWe describe, {{date and}} {{constrain}} the P­T conditions of a syntectonic inverted metamorphic sequence associated with continental collision and crustal-scale thrusting {{in one of}} the key regions of the late Palaeozoic Variscan belt of Western Europe ­ the Champtoceaux Complex (Armorican Massif, France), interpreted as a trace of the Variscan suture zone between Laurussia and Gondwana. The Complex consists of several stacked units, some of them eclogite-bearing, that are sandwiched between two main pieces of continental crust ­ the Parautochthon and the Upper Allochthon. Moderately to steeply dipping foliation parallels the main lithological boundaries. From the bottom {{to the top of the}} metamorphic rock pile, the following sequence testifies to the syntectonic temperature increase: chlorite­ biotite-bearing metagreywackes (Parautochthon); orthogneisses with eclogite lenses; micaschists with chloritoid­chlorite­garnet; orthogneisses; micaschists with staurolite­biotite­garnet with chloritoid inclusions (Lower Allochthon); and migmatites with boudins of eclogite and kyanite­biotite­garnetbearing metapelitic lenses (Upper Allochthon). Mylonitic amphibolites with lenses of serpentinized peridotite mark the boundary between the Lower Allochthon and the overlying Upper Allochthon, suggesting the presence of a major thrust. It is inferred that the latter is responsible for the development of the inverted metamorphic zoning. Multiequilibrium thermobarometry and pseudosections calculated with THERMOCALC indicate that equilibration temperatures of the syntectonic peak metamorphic assemblages increase upwards in the rock pile from 650 C in the Upper Allochthon. All units equilibrated at similar pressures between 7 and 10 kbar. In the Upper Allochthon, chronological results on muscovite suggest initial cooling from c. 343 Ma (muscovite Rb­Sr) to c. 337 Ma (muscovite 40 Ar­ 39 Ar). A subsequent very rapid temperature decrease is suggested by the synchronous closure of the muscovite and biotite K­Ar and biotite Rb­Sr isotopic systems (c. 337 ­ 335 Ma). This cooling is also recorded in the Upper Micaschists of the Lower Allochthon and in the Parautochthon with muscovite 40 Ar­ 39 Ar ages of c. 336 ­ 334 and 332 Ma, respectively. Ages of c. 343 Ma inferred from disturbed muscovite spectra from the Parautochthon are possibly linked to a previous higher pressure metamorphic event in this unit. It is suggested that the development of the inverted metamorphic zoning in the Champtoceaux Complex is due to the emplacement of a hot nappe over colder units and is contemporaneous with major crustal thrusting and associated pervasive ductile deformation. The preservation of this <b>inverted</b> <b>field</b> gradient was possible because of fast cooling, tentatively associated with the syn-compressional denudation of the tectonic pile, expressed by the detachment at the top of the nappe pile. The efficiency of cooling is best shown by the near-coincidence of Rb­Sr and 40 Ar­ 39 Ar ages, obtained on both sides of the major thrust. Finally, we highlight similarities with other regions of the West-European Variscan belt (Iberian massif, French Massif Central) and suggest that inverted metamorphic zoning is systematically associated with the contact between the Lower and Upper Allochthons...|$|E
40|$|Phase {{images of}} the human brain {{acquired}} using gradient echo based Magnetic Resonance Imaging techniques show excellent contrast at 7 T. This contrast is attributed to small variations in magnetic susceptibility that perturb the main magnetic field and thus yield a spatial variation of the NMR frequency. The work described in this thesis is primarily concerned with mapping the distribution of magnetic susceptibility within the human brain using these phase images. The main technical challenges of the project were first to extract accurate field maps based on phase data, and then to solve the ill-posed problem of <b>inverting</b> these <b>field</b> maps to reconstruct susceptibility (ϰ) maps. In initial work, simulations of field shifts based on known ϰ -distributions are compared to field maps acquired in vivo to highlight the non-local relationship between measured field offsets and the underlying susceptibility. These simulations were carried out using a recently derived Fourier method. The bulk of the thesis is then devoted to a detailed study of the process of <b>inverting</b> <b>field</b> maps generated from phase data using the Fourier relationship to yield quantitative 3 D ϰ -maps. Unfortunately, the inversion problem is ill-posed and requires careful conditioning, either through rotation of the sample being imaged or through regularisation. A simple k-space threshold is introduced to condition the inversion and the preliminary results of applying this method to brain data from healthy subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis are presented. The results suggest that susceptibility mapping is sensitive to iron deposition and could be a useful tool in investigating the progression of neurodegeneratived diseases. Iterative inversion algorithms, which deal with noise more robustly and allow more sophisticated filtering techniques to be employed, are then presented. These powerful regularisation methods are compared to previously described techniques, and are shown to yield high quality whole-brain ϰ -maps.
