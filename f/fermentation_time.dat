40|$|Abstract. Bioethanol {{is widely}} used as {{renewable}} resource due to its safe to produce and environmentally friendly. However, knowledge on ethanol production from pineapple peel juice (Pattawia spp) is far from sufficient. In this work, pineapple peel juice (initial pH at 5) was fermented at various yeast contents (1, 3 and 5 % by wt.) and <b>fermentation</b> <b>times</b> (3, 5 and 7 days) in order to investigate ethanol production characteristics. Yeast, Sacchromyces cerevisiae was grown on pineapple peel juice. The squeezed juice contained 11 % of total sugar and 5 % of reducing sugar. The {{results indicated that the}} optimum ethanol production was yeast contents of 5 % by wt. and <b>fermentation</b> <b>times</b> of 5 days which gave the ethanol production of 9. 08 g/l. The ethanol at a higher yeast content also had a higher ethanol concentration...|$|R
500|$|The {{alcohol in}} beer comes {{primarily}} from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that {{determine the amount of}} alcohol in the final beer. Additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily [...] "light" [...] beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to fermentable sugars. Alcohol is a by-product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast; typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12% by volume. Low temperatures and too little <b>fermentation</b> <b>time</b> decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{at least}} the 11th century, and {{probably}} earlier, hops {{have been used in}} beer for their natural preservative qualities {{as well as for the}} pleasant bitterness, flavour, and aroma they impart. Since the method of inoculation and long <b>fermentation</b> <b>time</b> of lambic beers increases the risk of spoilage, lambic brewers use large amounts of hops for their antibacterial properties. Lambic in the early 19th century was a highly hopped beer, using 8–9 g/l of the locally grown Aalst or Poperinge varieties. Modern lambic brewers, however, try to avoid making the beer extremely hop forward and utilise aged, dry hops which have lost much of their bitterness, aroma and flavour. Consequently, lambics often have a strong, cheese-like, [...] "old hop" [...] aroma, in contrast to the resiny, herbal, earthy hop bitterness found in other styles. The favourite hop used for lambic in the nineteenth century was a variety called Coigneau which was cultivated in the Aalst-Asse area in Belgium.|$|E

Results show that fermentation of dough with maltose-negative strains relies {{on the presence of}} fructan and sucrose as fermentable substrates and can be used for regular bread making. Levels of fructan and sucrose, endogenously present or added, hence determine the extent of fermentation and timing at the proofing stage.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} Candida norvegensis (C. norvegensis) viable yeast culture on in vitro ruminal fermentation of oat straw. Ruminal fluid was mixed with buffer solution (1 : 2) and anaerobically incubated with or without yeast at 39 °C for 0, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h. A fully randomized design was used. There was a decrease in lactic acid (quadratic, p = 0. 01), pH, (quadratic, p = 0. 02), and yeasts counts (linear, p< 0. 01) across <b>fermentation</b> <b>times.</b> However, in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD) and ammonia-N increased across <b>fermentation</b> <b>times</b> (quadratic; p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 02, respectively). Addition of yeast cells caused a decrease in pH values compared over all <b>fermentation</b> <b>times</b> (p< 0. 01), and lactic acid decreased at 12 h (p = 0. 05). Meanwhile, yeast counts increased (p = 0. 01) at 12 h. C. norvegensis increased ammonia-N at 4, 8, 12, and 24 h (p< 0. 01), and IVDMD of oat straw increased at 8, 12, and 24 h (p< 0. 01) of fermentation. Yeast cells increased acetate (p< 0. 01), propionate (p< 0. 03), and butyrate (p< 0. 03) at 8 h, while valeriate and isovaleriate increased at 8, 12, and 24 h (p< 0. 01). The yeast did not affect cellulolytic bacteria (p = 0. 05), but cellulolytic fungi increased at 4 and 8 h (p< 0. 01), whereas production of methane decreased (p< 0. 01) at 8 h. It is concluded that addition of C. norvegensis to in vitro oat straw fermentation increased ruminal fermentation parameters as well as microbial growth with reduction of methane production.

50|$|Stretch and folds or degassing: When {{the dough}} reaches a {{specified}} size or scheduled {{time it is}} removed from the bowl and stretched and folded on a flour-dusted surface for the purposes of degassing the bubbles that have formed as well as stretching and aligning the gluten, then it is returned to the bowl for continued bulk fermentation. Prior to folding, the dough surfaces that are folded together should be brushed to remove excess dry flour. This is also called knock back or punch down, and may occur in an oiled bowl followed by a few folds, then flipped over so the seam side is down. This stretching and folding develops the gluten and equalizes the dough temperature. Long bulk fermentations may have as many as 4 to 5 folding sessions. Some schedules begin degassing at half the total <b>fermentation</b> <b>time,</b> while others degas once just before the peak begins to fall. A fermentation ratio is described as the time the dough takes from leaving the mixer to just before the peak begins to fall — when degassing occurs — relative to the remaining bulk <b>fermentation</b> <b>time</b> afterwards.

30|$|Assays were {{performed}} in NGM supplemented with the minimum and twice {{the amounts of}} these calculated concentrations. The minimum level of supplementation improved the fermentation parameters of BY 4741. However, although the final biomass was closer to that of S 288 C in NGM, the sugar consumption by BY 4741 was still significantly slower than that of S 288 C (Table  1, Figure  1). Supplementing NGM with the highest concentrations of auxotrophic supplements (120  mg/l uracil, 80  mg/l methionine, 400  mg/l leucine, and 100  mg/l histidine) further increased the final biomass of BY 4741 to levels of the prototrophic parental strain S 288 C and the enological commercial strain ISA 1000 fermenting NGM without auxotrophic supplements (Table  1, Figure  1). In addition, the AF 1 and AF 2 <b>fermentation</b> <b>times</b> in the 2 × supplemented NGM were reduced to approximately 30 % of {{the time required to}} ferment NGM without extra supplementation.

In phase one of the study, small-scale, well-controlled laboratory fermentation was carried out on eleven batches of coffee at the farm La Canavalia in Matagalpa, Nicaragua. With otherwise identical treatment, fermentation of the small samples was halted by washing when the pH of the fermenting mass decreased to approximately 4. 6, 4. 3, or 3. 9. After drying and roasting, these samples were individually evaluated by two certified cupping laboratories. The results indicate a weak positive correlation between pH at washing and subsequent roasted coffee quality. In phase two of this study, 100 small-holder coffee producers were asked to character-ize their customary procedures using standard pH paper and then to “optimize ” the <b>fermentation</b> <b>times.</b> Generally, this required somewhat shortening <b>fermentation</b> <b>times,</b> with termination at higher pH. The coffee from the “usual ” and “optimized ” proce-dures was dried, roasted, and evaluated by two cupping laboratories.
