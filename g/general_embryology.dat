40|$|Introduction: Quantitative and {{qualitative}} enhancement of educational activities {{is an essential}} issue. Learners’ cooperation in the teaching process {{in order to increase}} teaching effectiveness and promotion is considered significant. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the effect of establishment of student working group on the teaching <b>general</b> <b>embryology</b> course to medical students. Methods: Ten students (1 %) of medical embryology course were selected to analyze the topics to be taught before each session according to lesson plan, and observe the whole teaching process during lesson presentation. Then, having asked the other students’ viewpoints and discussing with one another, they provided the teacher with a written report on the strengths and weaknesses of the teaching and its problems. The teacher analyzed the problems proposed by the working group to improve teaching process in the next session. At the end of the semester, a questionnaire was administered to all the participants. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: The mean of students’ scores was 74. 26 %. The most important findings obtained in this study included positive role of film projection in teaching the materials (95. 34 %), significance of presentation of various pictures from different books (88. 4 %), changing students’ attitude toward application of embryology in different diseases (86 %), and repetition of previous session’s pictures (83. 75 %). The weak points mentioned, however, were physical problems of the classroom and deficiency of audio visual equipment. Conclusion: Student working group has a positive impact on the teaching medical <b>general</b> <b>embryology...</b>|$|E
50|$|Five {{years after}} he became {{professor}} at Strasbourg, he published a book called Nouveaux éléments d'anatomie descriptive et d'embryologie with his colleague Abel Bouchard, {{who was also a}} medic in the army. The book was a synthesis of the anatomical and embryological knowledge for students of science and medicine. The authors used their knowledge of German {{to stay in touch with}} the latest discoveries, which were often published in German during this period. Beaunis wrote the sections on osteology, articulations, myology, viscera, senses, the human body in <b>general,</b> and <b>embryology.</b> Bouchard wrote the sections on angiology and neurology.|$|R
50|$|In 1895, {{at the age}} of 20, Snodgrass entered Stanford University and {{majored in}} zoology, taking classes such as <b>general</b> zoology, <b>embryology,</b> {{entomology}} with Dr. Vernon Lyman Kellogg, ichthyology with then Stanford president Dr. David Starr Jordan, and comparative vertebrate anatomy. His first opportunity to conduct research came from Dr. Kellogg, who set him to work on the biting lice (Mallophaga). The excitement of research, and the prospect for publishing original work led to his giving up the desire to become an ornithologist, and the publication of his first two science articles (works 1,2). During this time, Snodgrass also participated in his first two field expeditions, the first to the Pribilof Islands led by Dr. Jordan, and the second to the Galapagos Islands, led by Edmund Heller. Snodgrass eventually published seven papers with Heller regarding organisms collected during the Galapagos expedition (works 3, 5, 6, 7, 12, 16, 19). Snodgrass graduated from Stanford University with his A.B. degree in Zoology in 1901.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: To {{encourage}} {{student participation}} in the learning process, the authors introduced a modified team based learning (TBL) method to cover two <b>general</b> <b>embryology</b> topics in the 1 st year MBBS curriculum. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate students&#x 2032; perception of this method vis-&#x 00 E 0;-vis the lecture method of teaching. Settings and Design: A questionnaire was used to survey and evaluate the perceptions of 1 st year MBBS students at the Department of Anatomy at our medical college in India. Materials and Methods: A total of eight classes were allotted to cover <b>General</b> <b>Embryology.</b> Six of these classes were conducted using the traditional didactic lecture method. Two topics were covered using the modified TBL method. Five teams of students were constituted, and each team was given handouts which contained basic factual material, four clinical case histories, and previous university exam questions from the topic. On the day of the session, these were discussed in the presence of the faculty facilitator. Students evaluated these sessions through a questionnaire. Results: A majority of students felt that the modified TBL sessions were better at fulfilling learning objectives (46 students, 85 &#x 0025;), enabled better understanding (43 students, 79 &#x 0025;), were more interesting (43 students, 81 &#x 0025;), ensured greater student participation (51 students, 94 &#x 0025;) and involved greater effort on the part of students (53 students, 98 &#x 0025;), as compared to traditional teaching methods. Most of the students (43 students, 79 &#x 0025;) opined that more such sessions should be organized in the future. Conclusions: Responses from students show that the modified TBL classes could be utilized judiciously along with the traditional didactic lectures for teaching embryology...|$|E
40|$|The {{longest time}} that an egg in a {{specified}} medium remains re sponsive to insemination by yielding normal cleavages is spoken {{of as the}} fertilizable period of that egg. The structural changes and their relation to the fertilizable period of the egg of the brackish water mm now, Funduius heteroclitus, are discussed. The literature dealing with the embryology of Fundulus lacks uni formity {{in regard to the}} names for the different structures. The termi nology used here is that which is common to most of those who have dealt with morphology. (Kellicott, <b>General</b> <b>Embryology,</b> 1913.) The membrane which is normally separated soon after fertilization is the vitelline membrane. Between the vitelline membrane and the cytoplasm is the perivitelline space. The vitelline membrane has also been called the fertilization membrane, a term which may be misleading since fer tilization is not necessary for its separation. The jelly substance which surrounds the vitelline membrane is termed the chorion. The platelet...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} paper of this series, 1 the early {{embryology}} of the whitefish from fertilization {{up through the}} closure of the blastopore (Stage 128, O. S. U. series) was described. The later stage marked the completion of the first third of the incubation period in terms of thermal units, although the embryo had been incubated only one-sixth the number of days usually required by this species before hatching in lake water of winter temperatures. The embryo was about 3 mm. long, and it lay without torsion and clearly outlined over the curvature of the yolk. In its anterior end, the three primary brain lobes were present and the neural keel of the head region lay deeply imbedded in the yolk. The optic primordia were prominent, lateral to the forebrain and were attached to the latter by broad optic stalks. Neither the brain nor the optic anlagen possessed cavities in this stage and hence have not yet acquired the vesicular condition. A thickened ectodermal plate lay {{on each side of the}} neural keel lengthwise. This sensory plate possessed an indistinct sensory furrow. The notochord had extended its full length forward to end beneath the midbrain. Eleven pairs of somites were present, with the most anterior one lying at the level of the hind brain. The entoderm was described as being thin and unfolded throughout its length. Kupffer's vesicle was seen here in its stage of maximum size. From this condition as a point of departure, the present paper describes the <b>general</b> <b>embryology</b> and development of the whitefish up through Stage 400 of this series, which marks the completion of the first half of the incubation period...|$|E
