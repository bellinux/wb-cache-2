5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez. Before leaving England, he {{returned}} to the farmhouse, gaining entry by the downstairs bathroom window. He said he did this because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>his</b> keys in London and needed some papers from the house for the trip to France; he entered through the window rather than borrow keys from the farm's housekeeper who lived nearby. When he returned to England on 29 September, he was re-arrested and charged with the murders.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his Shakespearean commitments, Hordern joined the St Pancras People's Theatre, a London-based company partly funded by the theatrical manager Lilian Baylis. Hordern enjoyed his time there, despite the tiresome commute between Sussex and London, and stayed with the company for five years. By the end of 1936 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>his</b> sales job in Beaconsfield to pursue a full-time acting career. He moved into a small flat at Marble Arch {{and became one of}} the many jobbing actors eager {{to make a name for}} themselves on the London stage.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of the Privy Council {{moved out of the}} Tower before switching their allegiance. Becoming aware of his colleagues' change of mind, Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, abandoned his command of the fortress and proclaimed Mary I on nearby Tower Hill. After <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>left,</b> <b>his</b> wife was told she could also go home, while Jane, Guildford, and the Duchess of Northumberland were not allowed to. Jane was later moved from the royal apartments to the Gentleman Gaoler's lodgings and Guildford was imprisoned in the Bell Tower. There he was soon joined by his brother, Robert. His remaining brothers were imprisoned in other towers, as was his father, who was for the moment the only prominent person to go to the scaffold; Mary was prepared to spare Jane's and Guildford's lives.|$|E

At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement that detailed his movements on December 11.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, before Yankey {{transferred}} the funds from Wichita to Kerrville, {{he suffered a}} severe stroke, and he died in December 1953. None of Yankey's heirs had any interest in the aviation business, and although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>his</b> company stock to the two Mooney brothers, that stock had little value without further investment. The company was {{on the point of}} declaring bankruptcy when two investors, Hal Rachal and Norm Hoffman of Midland, Texas, decided to step in and save the company. The M20 was certified in September 1955. Shortly thereafter, Albert Mooney left the company for unknown reasons and {{went to work for the}} Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in Marietta, Georgia.

500|$|Captain Sir Edward Hulse {{reported}} how {{the first}} interpreter he met from the German lines was from Suffolk where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend and a 3.5hp motorcycle.

500|$|... "Climbing over rocky mountain" [...] is {{the best}} known piece from Thespis, as it was transplanted in 1879 into one of Gilbert and Sullivan's most {{successful}} operas, The Pirates of Penzance. In 1902, Gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally. He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>his</b> sketches behind in England. Fortunately, the entrance chorus from Thespis fitted the situation almost exactly, so it was substituted instead.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Wallachia and Hungary soon deteriorated. In {{a letter written}} late in 1445 to the townspeople of Brașov, Vlad complained that Wallachian merchants were arrested in Transylvania, although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>his</b> [...] "little children to be butchered for Christian peace so that [...] and [...] country [...] be subjects" [...] of the king of Hungary. His words evidence that {{he was convinced that}} his two sons had been murdered in the Ottoman Empire, but the sultan did not harm the boys. In 1446 or 1447, Vlad made peace with the Ottomans, even agreeing to return the Bulgarian refugees to the Ottoman Empire. He intervened in the fight for the Moldavian throne in favor of Roman II of Moldavia in July 1447. The Poles also supported Roman, but Roman's opponent, Peter II, was Hunyadi's protegé.|$|E

500|$|At this moment, cries {{are heard}} from the Knights (""): a flying swan has been shot, and a young man is brought forth, a bow {{in his hand and}} a quiver of {{matching}} arrows. Gurnemanz speaks sternly to the lad, saying this is a holy place. He asks him outright if he shot the swan, and the lad boasts that if it flies, he can hit it ("") Gurnemanz tells him that the swan is a holy animal, and asks what harm the swan had done him, and shows the youth its lifeless body. Now remorseful, the young man breaks his bow and casts it aside. Gurnemanz asks him why he is here, who his father is, how he found this place and, lastly, his name. To each question the lad replies, [...] "I don't know." [...] The elder Knight sends his squires away to help the King and now asks the boy to tell what he does know. The young man says he has a mother, Herzeleide (Heart's Sorrow) and that he made the bow himself. Kundry has been listening and now tells them that this boy's father was Gamuret, a knight killed in battle, and also how the lad's mother had forbidden her son to use a sword, fearing that he would meet the same fate as his father. The youth now recalls that upon seeing knights pass through his forest, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>his</b> home and mother to follow them. Kundry laughs and tells the young man that, as she rode by, she saw Herzeleide die of grief. Hearing this, the lad first lunges at Kundry but then collapses in grief. Kundry herself is now weary for sleep, but cries out that she must not sleep and wishes that she might never again waken. She disappears into the undergrowth.|$|E
