5|$|After the Duke of Northumberland's {{attainder}} {{the entire}} Dudley inheritance had disappeared. His sons {{had to start}} from scratch in rebuilding the family fortunes, as they had renounced any rights to their father's former possessions or titles when their own attainders had been lifted in January 1558. Robert Dudley financed the lifestyle expected of a royal favourite by large loans from City of London merchants until in April 1560 Elizabeth granted him his first <b>export</b> <b>licence,</b> worth £6,000 p.a. He also received some of his father's lands, but since he was not the family heir {{it was a matter of}} some difficulty to find a suitable estate for his intended peerage. In June 1563 the Queen granted him Kenilworth Manor, Castle, and Park, together with the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk in North Wales. Other grants were to follow. Eventually, Leicester and his elder brother Ambrose, Earl of Warwick, came to preside over the greatest aristocratic interest in the West Midlands and North Wales.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s British {{intelligence}} {{learned that the}} ANO held accounts with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in London. BCCI was closed in July 1991 by banking regulators in six countries after evidence emerged of widespread fraud. Abu Nidal himself {{was said to have}} visited London using the name Shakar Farhan; a BCCI branch manager, who passed information about the ANO accounts to MI5, reportedly drove him around several stores in London without realizing who he was. Abu Nidal was using a company called SAS International Trading and Investments in Warsaw as cover for arms deals. The company's transactions included the purchase of riot guns, ostensibly for Syria, then when the British refused an <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> to Syria, for an African state; in fact half the shipment went to the police in East Germany and half to Abu Nidal.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{estimate}} was passed within {{seconds of the}} auction opening. Six bidders pushed the price towards a million pounds and Tullie House was forced to drop out at £1.7 million. Two remaining bidders took the bid past £2 million; the winning bidder, an anonymous UK resident and fine art collector bidding by phone, paid a total of £2,330,468.75 including the buyer's premium and VAT. The outcome aroused controversy and prompted calls for the Treasure Act to be revised, though British Archaeology noted that {{the circumstances of the}} helmet's discovery may have resulted in it being outside the scope of even a revised act. It is still possible that the helmet could come into public ownership; if the winning bidder wishes to export it, an <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> would have to be applied for and if a temporary export bar was placed on it an opportunity could arise for funds to be raised by a public institution to purchase the helmet.|$|E

40|$|The Australian Meat Board (AMB) can {{influence}} the quantities sent to and the prices received for Australian beef and veal in the domestic and various export markets. Through its power to grant <b>export</b> <b>licences</b> and the conditions to be met in obtaining <b>export</b> <b>licences</b> the AMB can adopt {{the role of a}} price discriminating monopolist without supply control. This paper evaluates the price, quantity, efficiency and distribution effects of the export diversification scheme introduced by the AMB in 1968, of some modified schemes proposed in 1976, and of an alternative system whereby rights to export to premium export markets with quota restrictions are auctioned.

500|$|Initially in the {{possession}} of a Syrian dealer, who may have acquired the plaque in southern Iraq in 1924, the relief was deposited at the British Museum in London and analysed by Dr. H.J. Plenderleith in 1933. However, the Museum declined to purchase it in 1935, whereupon the plaque passed to the London antique dealer Sidney Burney; it subsequently became known as the [...] "Burney Relief". The relief was first brought to public attention with a full-page reproduction in The Illustrated London News, in 1936. From Burney, it passed to the collection of Norman Colville, after whose death it was acquired at auction by the Japanese collector Goro Sakamoto. British authorities, however, denied him an <b>export</b> <b>licence.</b> The piece was loaned to the British Museum for display between 1980 and 1991, and in 2003 the relief was purchased by the Museum for the sum of £1,500,000 as part of its 250th anniversary celebrations. The Museum also renamed the plaque the [...] "Queen of the Night Relief". Since then, the object has toured museums around Britain.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2016, the International Business Times {{stated that}} the U.S. {{government}} was testing {{a version of the}} EmDrive electromagnetic microwave thruster on the fourth flight of the X-37B. In 2009, an EmDrive technology transfer contract with Boeing was undertaken via a State Department TAA and a UK <b>export</b> <b>licence,</b> approved by the UK MOD.

[...] Travel bans {{are also being}} imposed on the nine individuals. [...] This was done {{in concert with the}} US, which imposed escalating sanctions of its own, including <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> applications for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities. The US Commerce and State Departments revoked any existing export licences that meet these conditions. [...] Tit-for-tat economic sanctions had begun in March 2014.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{byproducts}} at Rjukan was {{the production}} of heavy water—a key component in nuclear weapons, and necessary as a moderator in German nuclear designs. The hydrogen plant at Vemork was the first mass producer of heavy water, and in 1939 the German company IG Farben, owning 25% of the shares in Norsk Hydro, asked for permission to import five liters of heavy water into Germany, later denied {{due to a lack}} of an <b>export</b> <b>licence.</b> [...] In 1939–40 production at Vemork was 20 kilograms, by 1942 production had increased to five kilograms per day.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 May 1951, Nancy Moller {{departed}} from Singapore, bound for Whampoa China. She {{was carrying a}} cargo of [...] of rubber destined for China in contravention of an export ban. On 18 May, she was intercepted by [...] off Hainan Island, China and escorted back to Singapore. The interception was carried out under regulation 53 of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939, which gave the British government powers to requisition any ship on the British or Colonial register and order the ship to proceed as directed. An agreement had been made between the British government and {{the governments of the}} Federation of Malaya and Singapore to limit exports of rubber to China to [...] per month from 9 April 1951. The embargo was part of a United Nations embargo against China, which was supplying arms to Kim Il-Sung's forces in the Korean War. Nancy Moller reached Singapore on 23 May. Her cargo was stated to be worth S$2,000,000 (then £1,000,000). Her cargo had been covered by an <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> that had been issued before the embargo came into force.|$|E

He was refused an <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> (see Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of Art) while the Tate Gallery sought funding to make an offer to acquire the work. An anonymous donation allowed the gallery to make an offer of £12.5 million, but Magnier refused to sell, {{and in the meantime}} he refused to allow the painting to be displayed in public in the UK. The British government refused a permanent <b>export</b> <b>licence,</b> but a temporary <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> was granted in 2005 for 6½ years, and the painting went on display at the National Gallery of Ireland. It was included in the Reynolds exhibition at Tate Britain in 2005. In 2012, an application for a second temporary <b>export</b> <b>licence</b> was refused, and the painting returned to the UK.|$|E
