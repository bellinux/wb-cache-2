40|$|A fifteen-year-old {{severely}} disturbed {{girl was}} treated for aphonia. Because {{of the extent of}} her withdrawal, the subject was conditioned in a laboratory setting and received tokens for speaking loudly enough to operate a voice-operated relay. Conditioning at first consisted of saying 100 monosyllabic words, with the possibility of reinforcement on each word. Later, the subject was required to say a polysyllabic word, and finally, five or six words per token. The subject was shaped to speak with normal loudness in the laboratory, and generalization to a reading situation in the laboratory was measured and observed to occur, at first for a <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> and <b>later</b> for a longer period. Generalization to a reading situation in the classroom did not occur, but the subject's voice loudness also increased in the classroom when several new reinforcement contingencies were put into effect there...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{cationic}} detergent, cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC), on toad bladder epithelium were studied by means of electrophysiologic and sodium-flux measurements, chemical analysis, time-lapse phase-contrast cinemicrography and electron microscopy. At 10 - 5 M, CPC caused a rapid loss of net sodium transport as reflected by the short-circuit current (SCC) but except for striking prominence of the glycocalyx, this dose caused no ultrastructural changes for at least 18 hours. Only a moderate decrease in resistance and increase in passive sodium flux were noted. At 10 - 4 M, CPC caused a transient 1 to 2 -minute increase in the bladder's rate of oxygen consumption followed by a decrease, and a rapid decline in SCC, followed a <b>few</b> <b>minute</b> <b>later</b> by a decrease in resistance accompanied by a greatly increased passive leak to sodium. A sequence of ultrastructural changes typical of other forms of lethal cell injury progressed to extensive cellular disruption by 1 hour after treatment with 10 - 4 M CPC. In addition, unusual surface membrane changes were observed, consisting of extensive formation of vesicles and myelin figures at the cell surface. A significant fraction of the bladder's cholesterol content appeared in the incubation medium after 10 - 4 M CPC treatment. With 10 - 3 M CPC, a similar pattern of cellular degeneration proceeded much more rapidly, and in addition, the cellular remains reorganized into complex lamellar arrays resembling phospholipid crystalloids. The results are interpreted as indicating {{that in addition to}} inhibiting net sodium transport, CPC lethally injures cells by interfering with the function of the surface membrane as a permeability barrier, and in addition, leads to a drastic structural reorganization of membrane constituents...|$|R
