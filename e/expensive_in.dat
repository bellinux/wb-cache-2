The flesh is white, soft in mature specimens and does not change colour upon bruising. The taste and smell is pleasant. People of La Malinche have likened the flavour to pork and pork crackling. It is easily misidentified as the porcini Boletus edulis, due to the similar habitat and appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in {{eucalyptus}} woodlands, or along water courses. In the more northerly {{parts of the}} country, these cockatoos are commonly seen in large flocks. They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend on trees with fairly large diameters, generally Eucalyptus. Populations in southeastern Australia are threatened by deforestation and other habitat alterations. Of the black cockatoos, the red-tailed is the most adaptable to aviculture, although black cockatoos are much rarer and much more <b>expensive</b> <b>in</b> aviculture outside Australia.|$|E

5|$|A {{deal for}} the sale of Constitution Center was agreed to in December 2012. MetLife and an {{unidentified}} investor (represented by Clarion Partners LLC) each purchased a 50 percent interest in the building. The sale price was $734 million, or $524 per square foot (0.093 square meters). The sale price was the most <b>expensive</b> <b>in</b> D.C. history for a single building. (It was not the most paid per square foot, however. That record went to two-building Market Square at 701 and 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, which sold in 2011 to Wells Real Estate Investment Trust for $905 per square foot.) When the deal closed in February 2013, David Nassif Associates announces it would wind down its operations and liquidate its remaining obligations.|$|E

5|$|Noé {{first tried}} to get the film funded in the early 2000s. Several {{producers}} responded positively to the script, and it was briefly under development for Tom Tykwer's German company X-Filme Creative Pool. It was considered too expensive and the producers dropped out. Prospects changed when Irréversible (2002) became a commercial success. Noé had written and directed Irréversible for StudioCanal, and it was sold internationally by their subsidiary, Wild Bunch. When the producers at Wild Bunch asked Noé {{what he wanted to do}} next, he answered Enter the Void. The project was once again considered too <b>expensive</b> <b>in</b> relation to its commercial potential, but when Wild Bunch discovered that Noé had started to develop the film for Pathé instead of them, they said that they were willing to fund it. Since development went slowly at Pathé, Noé chose to not renew his contract with the studio and accepted Wild Bunch's offer.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{discouraged}} {{manufacturing in}} its colonies and limited trade to Spanish goods handled by Spanish merchants and carried on Spanish vessels. Most of the ports, including {{all of those}} in Texas, were closed to commercial vessels {{in the hopes of}} dissuading smugglers. By law, all goods bound for Texas had to be shipped to Veracruz and then transported over the mountains to Mexico City before being sent to Texas. This caused the goods to be very <b>expensive</b> <b>in</b> the Texas settlements. Settlers were often forced to turn to the French for supplies, as the fort at Natchitoches was well-stocked and goods did not have to travel as far. Without many goods to trade, however, the remaining Spanish missionaries and colonists had little to offer the Indians, who remained loyal to the French traders.|$|E
5|$|The academy {{is one of}} {{the most}} <b>expensive</b> <b>in</b> Europe, {{operating}} at a cost of £5million a year. The main cost is the dormitory, La Masia itself. The minimum age for the youth program is six years; each year, more than 1,000boys from the ages of six to eight try out for admittance. The best 200 are selected. The club also actively seeks for prospective students; it employs a system in which 15scouts are deployed in Catalonia, 15 in the rest of Spain and 10 scattered throughout the world. To alleviate the expenses of this scouting, the club has an agreement with 15 local clubs for them to train players who are not ready for entry into the youth academy. In return, FC Barcelona gives money, coaching and technical advice to these clubs for their services. While expanding its operations abroad, the club established five schools in Mexico and one in Egypt; successful applicants to these schools become full-time students, receiving academic education and football training.|$|E

This was despite the two candidates' having agreed not to allow outside money to influence the race. Opinion polling indicated a close race for much of the campaign, though Warren opened up a small but consistent lead in the final few weeks. She went on to defeat Brown by over 236,000 votes, 54% to 46%.|$|E
5|$|The median house {{price in}} Canberra as of September 2009 was $511,820, lower than only Sydney among capital cities {{of more than}} 100,000 people, having surpassed Melbourne and Perth since 2005.

As at January 2014 the median unit rent in Canberra was $410 per week and median housing rent was $460, making the city the third most <b>expensive</b> <b>in</b> the country. Factors contributing to this higher weekly rental market include; higher average weekly incomes, restricted land supply, and inflationary clauses in the ACT Residential Tenancies Act.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{strategic}} threat changed dramatically during the period that Zeus was being developed. Originally expected to face only a few dozen ICBMs, a nationwide defense was feasible, although <b>expensive.</b> <b>In</b> 1957, growing fears of a Soviet sneak attack led it to be repositioned {{as a way to}} protect Strategic Air Command's bomber bases, ensuring a retaliatory strike force would survive. But when the Soviets claimed to be building hundreds of missiles, the US faced the problem of building enough Zeus missiles to match them. The Air Force suggested they close this missile gap by building more ICBMs of their own instead. Adding to the debate, a number of technical problems emerged that suggested Zeus would have little capability against any sort of sophisticated attack.|$|E

5|$|After 1976, gaps in {{the belt}} route were present from 2100 North near the airport to SR-201 and from State Street in Murray to 4600 South in Holladay. The first step in {{completing}} the gap was taken in June 1979, when construction of the interstate from State Street to 700 East began. This {{was followed by the}} Cottonwood Inc. lawsuit being awarded in favor of UDOT in November 1979. In July 1985, the route from 280 East to Union Park Avenue was completed. At the time, this portion of road was the most <b>expensive</b> <b>in</b> the state in terms of cost per mile, due to the road being depressed below surrounding neighborhoods. The next section to open was from 2100 North south to I-80 in 1987. This was followed by a section between Union Park Avenue and 2000 East, opened in November 1987, which was also built as a sunken freeway. The western quadrant of the freeway was completed in October 1988, closing the gap between SR-201 and I-80 (however, the California Avenue interchange wasn't opened until mid-1989). In August 1989, the road from 2000 East to 6200 South was finished, and the belt route was completed with the opening of freeway between 4500 South and 6200 South in October 1989.|$|E
5|$|After the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, which {{featured}} Mars as the headline act and the Red Hot Chili Peppers as the special guests, tickets for Mars second North American tour experienced high demands. He became the fastest entertainer {{to sell out}} three concerts at the Blaisdell Arena in Hawaii. Since the morning of February 3, 2014, many shows were sold out {{and only a few}} tickets were available on the primary market, the average price of a ticket was around $500 (US) on the secondary market. Ticketmaster also struggled to keep with demand, having to switch from their interactive seating maps for most events. The price for tickets on the primary market ranged from $49 (US) to $100 (US), however in bigger cities the price was between $70 (US) and $181 (US). On the secondary market, tickets for big venues had a wider price range of between $150 (US) to $600 (US). At these prices, Mars tour ranked amongst the most <b>expensive</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. during the summer of 2014, ahead of One Direction and Jason Aldean shows, which had the highest prices for an American tour on the same period. Two months after the Super Bowl, 27 of the 48 dates booked for the second leg on North America were sold out on the primary market. The only tickets left for those shows were available on the secondary market for a lower price than after the game. Nevertheless, the tour {{became one of the most}} expensive of 2014 due to the latter market.|$|E
5|$|As {{prosperity}} {{began to}} return in the 1980s, the city {{was stunned by the}} Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International District. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most <b>expensive</b> <b>in</b> the country. In 1993, the movie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong, but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001.|$|E
