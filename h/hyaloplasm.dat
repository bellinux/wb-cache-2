The absolute volume of nucleus and relative volume of cytoplasm were respectively estimated by the Bach² caryometric method and by point-counting volumetry, carried out in 0. 5 mm thick araldite sections. The relative volume, the surface-to-volume ratio and the total surface of RER, SER, mitochondria, dense bodies, Golgi complex and the relative volume of <b>hyaloplasm</b> {{inside and outside the}} Nissl bodies were estimated from electronmicrographs by the Weibel et al. 58 method.

40|$|The {{considerable}} {{concentration of}} mitochondria {{found in the}} different zones of the adrenal cortex has been described with the light and with the electron microscope (1). (Palade, (2) in his general description of the fine structure of mitochondria, pointed out the special tubular structures found within the mitochondrial matrix. In addition to the adrenal cortex and other sites of steroid secretion (3), the lack of typical mitochondrial "cristae" has also been recognized in protozoa (see reference 4), and insects (5).) Recent biochemical work demonstrating the intimate relationship of mitochondria to the synthesis of steroid hormones (6, 7), has {{also contributed to the}} development of interest in studies on the submicroscopic form of this cell organelle (8). Within a general program of study of the histophysiology of the adrenal cortex of different species, we became interested in certain changes observed in the morphology and structure of mitochondria in the deeper regions of the cortex of normal hamsters. These changes lead to a flattening and lamination of certain mitochondria and then to the concentric apposition of several of them to form large lamellated chondriospheres. The adrenal cortex of male hamsters were fixed in an isosmotic solution of osmium tetroxide containing polyvinylpyrrolidone and balanced ions (9) and thin sections were observed with an RCA 2 E microscope with a compensated objective lens. The cytoplasm of all the zones of the cortex is filled with large number of mitochondria while the amount of lipides is scarce in this species (Fig. 1). The interspersed <b>hyaloplasm</b> is also very scanty and shows few elements that can be recognized as endoplasmic reticulum, dense particles, or Golgi substance.

To obtain further quantitative data, biochemical estimations of hepatic glycogen, glucose- 6 -phosphatase, acid phosphatase, and blood glucose were made. Inhibition of glycogen breakdown was associated with inhibition of the normal increase in vesicular elements of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, a failure bf the normal rise in glucose- 6 -phosphatase and an inhibition of lysosome formation. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum played no role in glycogen breakdown in these cells. The glycogen content of the autophagic vacuoles correlated positively with the glycogen of the <b>hyaloplasm.</b> The hypothesis is formulated that those factors which regulate hyaloplasmic glycogen breakdown similarly influence lysosomal glycogen breakdown...|$|E

The influence of microgravity varied with different stages of cellular differentiation.

No conclusive studies were conducted yet on human liver biopsies. This paper describes the ultrastructural findings of hepatitis C virus components in liver biopsies. METHODS: Liver specimens from acutely and chronically HCV-infected chimpanzees (five each) and 29 chronic hepatitis C patients were studied. Diagnosis of HCV infection was based on clinical, serological, light microscopic and immunohistochemical data and on HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In HCV-infected chimpanzees, tubular aggregates were observed in the cytoplasm of {{a significant number of}} hepatocytes and proven by immuno-electron microscopy to contain HCV-E 2 viral envelope material. Identical tubular aggregates were seen in hepatocytes of chronic HCV-infected patients, although in smaller quantity and less frequently.

No lesion was seen in rats infused with glucose and galactose and mannitol was found to produce vacuolation of the hepatocytes.

The glycogen particles had a mean diameter of 256 Å, and the density of glycogen deposits was similar to that observed in human platelets. Glycogen related to the open channel system was seen in proximity to granular structures and frequently was membrane bound. Addition of thrombin, ADP or collagen to platelet-rich plasma, as well as storage of platelets at 21 C, was associated with a loss of glycogen in sites adjacent to the open channel system, but many dispersed glycogen particles appeared to be preserved. The collection of platelets in ethylenediamine tetracetic acid and chilling of platelets reduced the number of glycogen particles contiguous to the open channel system but did not entirely eliminate those glycogen deposits.

40|$|A large {{fraction}} of the intermediary metabolism of eukaryotic ells occurs in the cytoplasm, and much of that has traditionally been considered to occur {{in what has been}} variously called the cytosol, cytoplasmic ground substance, <b>hyaloplasm,</b> or soluble phase of the cell (Anderson and Green 1967; Schneider 1976). These soluble metabolic pathways are generally believed to take place in solution within the cytoplasm, their op-eration and regulation occurring by random collisions of the participants of the pathway, governed by simple mass-action principles. According to this view, such pathways exist in that volume of the cytoplasm not occupied by the very considerable amount of archi-tecture that is present, including the latest addition to an already crowded cytoplasm, the microtrabecular lattice (MTL) (Buckley and Porter 1975; Wolosewick and Porter 1979). For convenience I refer to that vol-ume as the aqueous cytoplasm and use the term soluble enzyme to refer to those nzymes believed to exist in solution within this compartment. The accepted existence of these soluble pathways has had considerable influence on the development of current views of cell metabolism and its regulation, and elaborate models have been constructed on this basis (see, e. g., Winfree 1972; Borowitz et al. 1977).

However, leaves of LAB 1 - 4 plants obtained after two steps of self-fertilization were characterized by a mere 3 -fold stimulation, whereas calli obtained from these plants retained a typical sterol-overproducing mutant phenotype (i. e. a 10 -fold increase of sterol content).

Most of the sterols accumulating in the mutant tissues were present as steryl-esters, which were minor species in wild-type tissues. Subcellular fractionation showed that in both mutant and wild-type tissues, free sterols were associated mainly with microsomal membranes. In contrast, the bulk of steryl-esters present in mutant tissues was found in the soluble fraction of cells. Numerous lipid droplets were detected in the <b>hyaloplasm</b> of LAB 1 - 4 cells by cytochemical and cytological techniques.

Staining of trophoblast sinusoidal microvilli was similar during early and late gestation, whereas the staining of the basement membrane and endothelial cells was most prominent during the second and third trimesters. Staining of ferric iron was encountered in rare cytoplasmic granules of epithelial cells during late gestation, but not during early gestation.

Significant staining or radiolabeling was not observed in mitochondria, trophoblast granules, or nuclei.

Abundant pyritized vegetal debris have also been found inside the amber nuggets and the surrounding sediments. This vegetal debris usually contained numerous pyrite framboids and very densely packed polycrystalline pyrite formations infilled with different elements of the secondary xylem. Conclusion Embedding in amber and pyritization are not always alternative modes of biological preservation during geological times, but double fossilization is possible under certain environmental conditions.

CTLA- 4 shares important sequence homology with CD 28 and binds {{to the same}} ligands, CD 80 (B 7 - 1) and CD 86 (B 7 - 2). CTLA- 4 probably functions as a negative regulator of T lymphocyte activation in the mouse, although this remains to be proven for human T lymphocytes. We have developed new monoclonal antibodies against human CTLA- 4 and have investigated the in situ expression of CTLA- 4 {{in a wide variety}} of normal and pathological human tissues expressing CD 80 and CD 86. As revealed in this study, CTLA- 4 is expressed on thymocytes in thymic medulla, on a subset of CD 4 + T lymphocytes in germinal centers of follicular hyperplasia, on T cells, mainly CD 8 +, infiltrating skin affected by graft-versus-host disease, and on T cells, mainly CD 4 +, infiltrating Hodgkin's disease lesions. In immunoelectron microscopy, CTLA- 4 was found on the plasma membrane as well as in the <b>hyaloplasm</b> and cytoplasmic vesicles, in agreement with its pattern of expression on in vitro activated T cells. Interestingly, no or at most scarce expression of CTLA- 4 was found in granulomatous lymph nodes, T-cell-mediated inflammatory diseases, or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, regardless of their expression of CD 80 or CD 86. Thus, expression of CTLA- 4 appears to be induced in selective pathological conditions in vivo. The pathways leading to selective induction of CTLA- 4 and its role in the pathophysiology of these conditions need to be further investigated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{determining}} the qualitative and quantitative composition of essential oil Juniperus communis, growing under the canopy of spruce blueberry sphagnum subzone middle taiga. Juniperus communis essential oil is liquid light yellow color. The content of essential oil was 0. 46 % in shoots with needles. 37 substances of components identified. Mass fraction of components in the essential oil of Juniperus communis reached 89 %. The highest percentage of occupied fraction of monoterpenes (82. 3 %), the proportion of sesquiterpenes less than 0. 5 % of the total composition of essential oils, alcohols 3. 5 and 0. 7 % esters. In monoterpenes fraction predominant α-pinene (24. 5 – 32. 6 %), β-pinene (15 – 20. 3 %) and α-phellandrene (6. 4 – 8. 8 %). Essential oil of Juniperus communis is characterized by high content of monoterpenoids in contrast to other conifers of the taiga zone. All stages of biosynthesis essential oils occur in the epithelial cells of the resin channel (terpenoidogennyh cells). An oval shape have epithelial cells of the resin channel needles in transverse sections the Juniperus communis, which is situated vacuole in the center. Large number of lipid globules (up to 40) noted in the <b>hyaloplasm</b> of explored cells. Leucoplasts surrounded by membranes of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in cross sections of epithelial cells in resin channel of juniper. Endoplasmic reticulum is poorly developed in epithelial cells, which corresponds to the low content of sesquiterpenes in the needles during the study period.

40|$|Nafenopin (2 -methyl- 2 [p-(1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 1 -naphthyl) phenoxy]-propionic acid; Su- 13437), {{a potent}} hypolipidemic compound, was {{administered}} in varying concentrations in ground Purina Chow to {{male and female}} rats, wild type (Csa strain) mice and acatalasemic (Csb strain) mice to determine the hepatic microbody proliferative and catalase-inducing effects. In all groups of animals, administration of nafenopin at dietary levels of 0. 125 % and 0. 25 % produced a significant and sustained {{increase in the number}} of peroxisomes. The hepatic microbody proliferation in both male and female rats and wild type Csa strain mice treated with nafenopin was of the same magnitude and was associated with a two-fold increase in catalase activity and in the concentration of catalase protein. The increase in microbody population in acatalasemic mice, although not accompanied by increase in catalase activity, was associated with a twofold increase in the amount of catalase protein. The absence of sex difference in microbody proliferative response in nafenopin-treated rats and wild type mice is of particular significance, since ethyl-α-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate (CPIB) -induced microbody proliferation and increase in catalase activity occurred only in males. Nafenopin can, therefore, be used as an inducer of microbody proliferation and of catalase synthesis in both sexes of rats and mice. The serum glycerol-glycerides were markedly lowered in all the animals given nafenopin, which paralleled the increase in liver catalase. All the above effects of nafenopin were fully reversed when the drug was withdrawn from the diet of male rats. During reversal, several microbody nucleoids were seen free in the <b>hyaloplasm</b> or in the dilated endoplasmic reticulum channels resulting from a rapid reduction in microbody matrix proteins after the withdrawal of nafenopin from the diet. Because of microbody proliferation and catalase induction with increasing number of hypolipidemic compounds, additional studies are necessary to determine the interrelationships of microbody proliferation, catalase induction, and hypolipidemia...|$|E
40|$|L-cells prelabelled with [14 C]leucine and [3 H]thymidine {{were placed}} in either fresh growth medium (minimal {{essential}} medium with 10 % serum) or stepdown medium (minimal essential medium) for 3 days. The 14 C/ 3 H ratio remained constant in the growing cultures and decreased in the stationary-phase cultures, indicating no protein turnover in growing cultures and a degradative rate of 0. 6 %/h in the stationary-phase cultures. Media analysis, however, indicated that 14 C-labelled proteins were being degraded at approx. 1. 2 %/h in growing cultures and 1. 7 %/h in stationary-phase cultures. Additional studies indicated that a subpopulation of L-cells in the monolayer, comprising approx. 20 [...] 30 % of the total, {{were lost in the}} original processing procedure. Experiments in which recoveries approached 100 % by fixation of the monolayer in situ indicated that a protein-degrading subpopulation accounted for all the observed proteolysis in the growing cultures. Proteolysis in these cultures was only partially inhibited with NH 4 Cl, indicating that {{only a small part of}} the protein degradation was occurring in an activated lysosomal-autophagic system. NaF produced a more effective inhibition of proteolysis, but we were not able to distinguish whether this effect was on an ATP-requiring basal-turnover mechanism or a direct effect on unregulated activity of proteinases in the cell <b>hyaloplasm.</b> However, NH 4 Cl inhibited the proteolysis induced when cells {{were placed in}} stepdown medium, suggesting that the induced proteolysis was occurring via the autophagic system. We conclude that L-cells exist in at least two states with respect to protein degradation: (a) a subpopulation that is actively replicating and does not degrade cellular proteins, and (b) a second subpopulation of cells, derived from the preceding one, which degraded most of their labelled proteins, are not capable of further replication, and are not sedimented in an iso-osmotic EDTA buffer solution. In addition, proliferating L-cells, when placed in stepdown medium, begin to degrade cell protein through a mechanism involving autophagolysosomes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, efferent ductules and epididymal duct from male {{foetuses}} {{as well as}} from sexually mature bulls were investigated using conventional light and electron microscopical techniques as well as glycohistochemical and immunohistochemical staining techniques. The prenatal development of the bovine epididymis was studied in foetuses ranging from 10 cm CRL (75 pcd) to 90 cm CRL (285 pcd). In foetuses with 10 cm CRL (75 pcd) the main event was the establishment of the urogenital junction between the extratesticular rete testis and mesonephric duct via the growing efferent ductules. At the foetal age of 110 pcd (24 cm CRL), efferent ductules underwent a strong coiling. At the same time the mesonephric duct began to lengthen and coil, forming three distinct regions, namely caput, corpus and cauda epididymidis. The coiling was much more distinct in caput and cauda than in corpus epididymidis. At 130 pcd (30 cm CRL) and upwards efferent ductules were organized in lobules which are then arranged in groups separated from each other by connective tissue septa. A similar organization involved the highly convoluted epididymal duct, particularly in the head and tail regions. In addition to the macroscopical modifications in the morphology of extratesticular excurrent duct system, histological differentiation involved both the tubular epithelium and the peritubular mesenchymal cells. The epithelium of efferent ductules was differentiated into ciliated and nonciliated columnar epithelium. The simple epithelium of the epididymal duct increased in height and developed stereocilia on its apical surface. Distribution of WGA-, PNA- and GSA-I-binding sites on luminal surface of the epithelium of efferent ductules, but not of epididymal duct may indicate earlier differentiation of the former. WGA-binding to the peritubular and interstitial mesenchymal cells, but not to the epididymal epithelium indicated that the mesenchymal structures differentiate before epithelial ones. S- 100, FGF- 1, FGF- 2, ACE, laminin and GT were immunolocalized in the epithelium both of efferent ductules and epididymal duct as early as at 75 pcd (10 cm CRL). Also ?-SMA was immunolocalized in the peritubular mesenchymal cells at 75 pcd (efferent ductules) and at 95 pcd (epididymal duct, CRL 18 cm). The epithelium of the adult bovine efferent ductules is simple columnar including ciliated and nonciliated cells as well as some scattered intraepithelial leucocytes. On the basis of their cytological characteristics, nonciliated cells could be categorized into three sub-types. The epididymal duct of the adult bull is lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium. It consists mainly of tall, slender, stereocilia-bearing columnar cells and small basal cells. On the basis of several morphometric parameters like epithelial height, luminal diameter and width of peritubular muscle coat the epididymal duct could be subdivided into six segments. Ultrastructural studies revealed a well developed Golgi apparatus, numerous profiles of sparsely granulated endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria as well as rER in the cytoplasm of principal cells particularly in those of the first three segments. Apical surfaces of principal cells particularly those of the proximal segments were equipped with long stereocilia and their apical cell membrane and cytoplasm displayed a well developed endocytotic apparatus. The narrow basal extensions of principal cells were crowded with numerous pleomorphic mitochondria, lysosomes, heteromorphic electron dense granules and residual bodies. Basal cells were insinuated between the narrow basal extensions of principal cells and the basal lamina. They possessed kidney-shaped, mostly deeply-invaginated nuclei and were characterized by a paucity of organelles. Apical mitochondria-rich cells were frequently found in segments II and III and rarely in segments IV and V. Their <b>hyaloplasm</b> was lighter than that of the neighbouring principal cells and their apical surfaces were provided with short microvilli. Apart from a reasonable number of mitochondria, small Golgi apparatus and sporadic strands of rER, they displayed a paucity of organelles. Intraepithelial macrophages were occasionally encountered in the basal third of the epithelium. They possessed many mitochondria, well developed Golgi apparatus and rER as well as small heterochromatic nuclei. Various profiles of lysosomes and dark residual bodies were found in their cytoplasm. Intraepithelial lymphocytes were characterized by their heterochromatic, round and mostly indented nuclei and narrow peripheral cytoplasmic rim. They were often encountered in immediate proximity to subepithelial capillaries. Fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC) -labelled lectins (GSA-I, PNA, ECA, WGA, Con A, LCA, PSA, DBA, HPA, SBA, VVA, LTA and UEA-I) were also used {{for the study of the}} regional distribution of saccharide groups in adult bovine epididymal tissues. WGA, Con A, LCA, PSA, DBA and HPA bound distinctly to stereocilia of principal cells in the different segments. However, DBA- and HPA-binding sites were confined to stereocilia in caput region. WGA, LCA, PSA, DBA and HPA possessed distinct binding sites in Golgi zone of principal cells, mostly of the caput epididymidis. Basal cells reacted distinctly with WGA, Con A, LCA, PSA and HPA. Intraepithelial leucocytes displayed moderate binding sites for PNA, WGA, LCA and PSA. The basal membrane reacted moderately only with WGA. Epididymal connective tissue showed weak to moderate binding only with ECA and WGA. GSA-I bound distinctly to vascular endothelium and could be applied as a good marker for bovine endothelium. Sperm cell mass bound WGA and PNA distinctly. No binding sites could be found for VVA, LTA or UEA-I. Immunohistochemical studies used the Avidin-Biotin-peroxidase Complex (ABC) method for localization of S- 100, FGF- 1, FGF- 2, ACE, GT, VEGF, ?-SMA, laminin, connexin 43, CD 4, CD 8 and CD 68 in the epididymis. The epithelium of the efferent ductules showed intense immunoreaction for S- 100, FGF- 1 and FGF- 2 and a moderate immunostaining for ACE and GT. Principal cells of the first three epididymal segments exhibited a distinct immunostaining for S- 100. They also showed a distinct immunoreactivity for FGF- 1 throughout the different segments. Principal cells in the first, second and sixth segment displayed intense immunostaining for ACE. Immunostaining for GT in Golgi zone of the principal cells was intense (segments II and III), distinct (segments IV and V) and moderate (segments I and VI). Basal cells showed moderate (FGF- 1) or intense (FGF- 2) immunostaining in different epididymal segments. Intense immunostaining for ACE, laminin and ?-SMA was found respectively in the endothelium, endothelial basal lamina and smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. The basal lamina of the epithelium and the peritubular smooth muscle cells displayed a moderate immunoreactivity for laminin. The peritubular smooth muscle cells manifested an intense immunostaining for ?-SMA. CD 4 + T cells and CD 68 + macrophages were found within the epithelium and in the interstitium. Mast cells were conventionally stained with Alcian blue and Toluidin blue. They also displayed a distinct immunostaining for VEGF and FGF- 2. In conclusion, my study supports the previously proposed 6 -segment scheme of bovine epididymis. Moreover, lectin histochemistry and immunohistochemistry were not only helpful tools in emphasising this scheme but also in correlating specific functional activities to certain regions. Lectins- and GT-binding sites as well as ultrastructural characteristics point to high synthetic and secretory activities of principal cells in the first three segments, as indicated by the well developed Golgi apparatus. Ultrastructurally, principal cells of the proximal three epididymal segments displayed a well developed endocytotic apparatus. This was reinforced by intense immunostaining for ACE in this region, which reflects extensive absorptive activities in this region. Existence of mast cells in the epididymal interstitium and T-lympho-cytes and macrophages in the interstitium and within the epithelium may reflect their harmonized co-operation in the induction of immune tolerance in the bovine epididymis...|$|E
