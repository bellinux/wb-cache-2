Methodology : Seven patients (pts), (6 males and 1 female) with mean age 40. 8 years (range: 26 - 64 years) were included. The diagnosis of pancreatitis was based upon clinical symptoms, serum and urine amylase levels and/or abdominal Computed Tomography (C/T) findings. Diagnosis of HLP was confirmed, as all pts had serum triglyceride (TG) levels of more than 1000 mg/dl. All pts underwent 1 - 3 sessions of plasma treatment, by using <b>double</b> cascade <b>filtration.</b> During each session of plasmapheresis, three liters of plasma were exchanged. All pts were followed-up monthly after their discharge, for 6 months. Results : In 3 / 7 (43 %) a significant reduction of serum TG and pancreatic enzymes was noted, within a few hours from lipapheresis. In the remaining pts, the same results were noted after a second (2 / 7, 28. 5 %) or third (2 / 7, 28. 5 %) session of the procedure. Also, an impressive improvement of pts&# 146; clinical signs was observed. All sessions were well tolerated. During the follow-up period, none of the pts reported any episodes of abdominal pain or vomiting, while their serum TG levels were well below 1000 mg/dl. Moreover, serum and urine amylase were within normal limits over the same period. Conclusion : It seems that lipapheresis is a promising and safe treatment in pts with HLP.

Whereas 0 -quasi-isotopy coincides with link homotopy, 1 -quasi-isotopy is not implied by concordance, because of the generalized (lk ̸ = 0) Sato–Levine invariant. Thus k-quasi-isotopy is not completely described by the lower central series quotients of the fundamental group. More intriguingly, it is almost certainly not determined by the derived series quotients, since the natural quotient with respect to k-quasiisotopy, while isomorphic to Milnor’s link group for k = 0, is in general an Engel-type group whose derived subgroups are interposed between the lower central subgroups. A special case of the Isotopic Realization Problem motivates the question, whether this quotient is always nilpotent, which seems highly unlikely yet hard to disprove; indeed we show that all of its finite epimorphic images are nilpotent. Nevertheless, we prove k-quasi-isotopy invariance of Milnor’s ¯µ-invariants of length ≤ 2 k + 3 (leading to invariance of certain coefficients of Conway’s polynomial) and sharpness of this restriction.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} address the knowledge gaps in the literature regarding the removal of waterborne pathogens (viruses and protozoa) by modified multistage slow sand filtration. In the current study, two pilot-scale multistage slow sand filtration systems were operated continuously for over two years. The pilot systems treated agricultural- and urban-impacted raw river water of variable quality with turbidity peaks over 300 NTU and seasonal cold temperatures 4. 4 logs for Cryptosporidium oocysts and ranged from > 3. 8 to > 4. 5 logs for Giardia cysts. This was consistent with findings in the literature, where oocyst and cyst removals of > 4 logs have been reported. Cryptosporidium oocyst removals improved with increased biological maturity of the slow sand filters. At a water temperature of 2 °C, average removal of oocysts and cysts were 3. 9 and > 4. 5 logs, respectively, in a biologically mature SSF. <b>Doubling</b> the <b>filtration</b> rate from 0. 4 to 0. 8 m/h led to a marginal decrease in oocyst removals. Sand depths in the range tested (37 - 100 cm) had no major impact on oocyst and cyst removals, likely because they are removed primarily in the upper section of slow sand filter beds by straining. In general, good oocyst and cyst removals can be achieved using shallower slow sand filter bed depths and higher filtration rates than recommended in the literature. There are very few studies in the literature that quantify virus removal by slow sand filtration, especially at high filtration rates and shallow bed depths. There are no studies that report virus removal by slow sand filtration below 10 °C. As such, 16 MS 2 bacteriophage challenge tests were conducted at varying water temperatures (20 °C) and filtration rates (0. 1 vs. 0. 4 m/h) between February and June 2006 on biologically mature slow sand filters with varying bed depths (40 vs. 90 cm). Biologically mature roughing filters were also seeded with MS 2. Average MS 2 removals ranged from 0. 2 to 2. 2 logs in the SSFs and 0. 1 to 0. 2 logs in the RFs under all conditions tested. Virus removal by slow sand filtration was strongly dependant on hydraulic loading rate, sand depth, and water temperature. Virus removal was greater at a sand depth of 90 cm vs. 40 cm, at an HLR of 0. 1 m/h vs. 0. 4 m/h, and at warm (20 - 24 °C) vs. cold (< 2 - 10 °C) water temperatures when sufficient warm water acclimation time was provided. Increased sand depth likely increased MS 2 removal because of greater detention time for predation and greater contact opportunities for attachment to sand grains and biofilms. A lower HLR would also increase MS 2 removal by increasing detention time, in addition to decreasing shear and promoting attachment to filter media and biofilms. Greater MS 2 removal at warmer water temperatures was attributed to improved biological activity in the filters. Schmutzdecke scraping {{was found to have}} only a minor and short-term effect on MS 2 removals. Virus removal can be optimized by providing deep SSF beds and operating at low filtration rates. Virus removal may be impaired in cold water, which could affect the viability of using SSF/MSF at northern climates if communities do not use disinfection or oxidation. As a stand-alone process, slow sand filtration (with or without roughing filtration) may not provide complete virus removal and should be combined with other treatment processes such as disinfection and oxidation to protect human health...|$|R
40|$|TEP are gel-like and {{extremely}} sticky particles, consisting of polysaccharides and formed out of exudates from algae and bacterial mucus. Membrane technologists recently started recognizing {{the importance of}} these particles as biofouling initiators since they are ubiquitous in all natural waters, sticky and well colonised by bacteria and hereby ideally designed to induce biofouling. Once attached to membrane surfaces, these particles start poreblocking and serve as both an attachment site and nutritious substrate for microbial growth. Earlier studies observed 70 % of TEP in influent water sticking on reverse osmosis (RO) membranes and limited TEP removal efficiency in RO-pretreatment systems. It was also seen that early EPS deposition on membranes only originates from TEP present in the feed water, an indication that TEP can be an important factor for the initiation of biofilms. However, not a single study described the occurrence of TEP in drinking water treatment trains. The limited removal efficiencies in several systems and the conclusions about TEP as a possible important factor in biofilm initiation suggest that TEP can be present in drinking water and play a role in drinking water safety. Therefore, this study {{was the first one to}} evaluate the occurrence of TEP in drinking water facilities. The TEP concentrations in raw water and throughout different drinking water production trains were measured and common water treatment methods were evaluated on their TEP removal. A focus was laid on ‘Torreele’, a Belgian installation treating effluent from a wastewater treatment plant via ultrafiltration (UF) and RO. This water is infiltrated in the dunes and recharges the local groundwater reserves. After infiltration, this water is pumped up and treated to drinking water. Hereby, this is one of the only installations worldwide based on the re-use of wastewater to drinking water. Next to this plant (‘Plant A’), 2 other plants treating respectively surface water and groundwater were comprised in this research (‘Plant B’ and ‘Plant C’). The waste water effluent in plant A contained the considerable amount of 1571 μg/L TEP. In comparison, Plant B had raw water containing 699 μg/L TEP while not any considerable amount of TEP could be detected in the groundwater of plant C. In plant A, TEP-concentrations were raised after addition of chlorine. This was probably due to cell lysis and TEP release induced by chlorine. In this installation, UF proved to be a very efficient abatement technique for TEP. RO is known to be a very powerful method and completely removed the whole TEP fraction, however the aquatic life in the infiltration pond caused the reappearance of TEP. Infiltration reduced the TEP amounts again until a minimal and stable level. In plant B, coagulation efficiently sticked the TEP together, enabling the <b>double</b> sand <b>filtration</b> to efficiently remove this bigger TEP-fraction. The following ozonation, activated carbon filtration and chlorination was able to minimize TEP concentrations so that only a very limited amount of TEP could reach the final drinking water. Finally, 13 more chemical and biological parameters were measured: pH, conductivity, COD, TOC, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+, K+, NO 3 -, SO 4 2 -, Cl-, viable and total bacteria concentration. All data was merged together in one data set and statistics were used in search for significant associations between TEP and other parameters. A significant association was found for TEP versus either viable or total cell concentrations, TOC and COD. It could be concluded that limited or no TEP could reach the final drinking water. In the re-use system, TEP was not a possible contaminant endangering the final drinking water quality. The applied membrane treatments proved efficient for a total TEP removal, dune infiltration completed this task once again...|$|R

This thesis describes the removal of arsenic in a reverse osmosis system. Arsenic is usually present in water in two oxidation states, as arsenite (As(III)) or arsenate (As(V)). Arsenate is usually easier to remove than arsenite, and the experiments have emphasized the removal of arsenite in <b>double</b> <b>filtration</b> process and compared to the removal of arsenate.

40|$|Nanofiltration (NF) {{can be used}} {{in water}} and {{wastewater}} treatment as well as water recycling applications, removing micropollutants such as hormones. Due to their potential health risk it is vital to understand their removal mechanisms by NF membranes aiming at improving and developing more effective and efficient treatment processes. Although NF should be effective and efficient in removing small molecular sized compounds such as hormones, the occurrence of adsorption onto polymeric membranes results in performances difficult to predict and with reduced effectiveness and efficiency. This study aims firstly at defining, understanding and quantifying the relevant filtration operation parameters and, secondly, in identifying the physical mechanisms of momentum and mass transfer controlling the adsorption and transport of hormones onto polymeric NF membranes in cross-flow mode. The hormones estrone (E 1) and 17 -b-estradiol (E 2) were chosen as they have very high endocrine disrupting potency. The NF membranes used and tested were the NF 270, NF 90, BW 30, TFC-SR 2 and TFC-SR 3 since they have a wide span of pore sizes. The first step is to experimentally acquire the knowledge of how fluid flow hydrodynamics and mass transfer close to the membrane affect hormone adsorption. The focus will be particularly on the effect of operating pressure, circulating Reynolds numbers (based on channel height, Reh) and hormone feed concentration. These hydrodynamic parameters {{play an important role in}} concentration polarisation development at the membrane surface. A Reh increase from 400 to 1400 for the NF 270 membrane caused the total mass adsorbed of E 1 and E 2 to decrease from 1. 5 to 1. 3 ng. cm- 2 and 0. 7 to 0. 5 ng. cm- 2, respectively. In contrast, a pressure increase from 5 to 15 bar yielded an increase in the adsorbed mass of E 1 and E 2 from 1. 0 to 1. 8 ng. cm- 2 and 0. 5 to 0. 7 ng. cm- 2, respectively. Moreover, increasing hormone feed concentration caused an increase in the mass adsorbed for both hormones. These observations led to the conclusion that adsorption is governed by the initial concentration at the membrane surface which, in turn, depends on the hormone feed concentration, operating Reh and pressure. Membrane retention, however, depends on the initial polarisation modulus, defined as the ratio between the initial concentration at the membrane surface and the initial feed concentration. The same trends were obtained for the TFC-SR 2 membrane. However, this membrane has a much lower permeability compared to the NF 270 one (7. 2 vs 17 L. h- 1. m- 2. bar- 1, respectively) and concentration polarisation is less severe. The experimental variations in mass adsorbed and retention as a function of the operating filtration parameters (Reh and pressure) were therefore lower. Based on these experimental results, a sorption model was developed. This model predicts well both feed and permeate transient concentrations for both hormones and membranes (NF 270 and TFC-SR 2) in the common range of operating pressures and Reh of spiral-wound membrane modules. The model was further applied for E 2 in the presence of background electrolyte, yielding good predictions. These findings are an important advancement in determining which membrane would be more suitable to effectively remove hormones with a substantial reduction of experimental work. The above-mentioned developed model does not give insight into the phenomena occurring inside the membrane since it focuses on the feed conditions. However, membrane characteristics, such as material and pore radius were found to have an impact in adsorption and retention of hormones. It was found experimentally that polyamide, from which the active layer of the NF membranes is made, adsorbs three times more mass of hormone than any other polymers constituting the membranes. Since this active layer is the membrane selective barrier of the membrane that is in contact with the largest hormone concentration (due to concentration polarization in the feed solution) it is concluded that the active layer adsorbs most of the hormones. Further experimental work carried out in this thesis showed that increasing the pore radius from 0. 32 nm to 0. 52 nm increased the E 2 mass adsorbed from 0. 17 ng. cm- 2 to 1. 1 ng. cm- 2 and decreased the retention from 88 % to 34 %. These results show that the wider the pore, the larger the quantity of hormone that penetrates (i. e. partitions) inside the membrane and, therefore, the more the membrane adsorbs the hormone. For membranes of similar pore radius, the membrane with larger internal surface area was found to adsorb more. All the previous results led to the establishment of a new model for the hormone transport inside the membrane pore taking convection, diffusion and adsorption into account. Since the differential equation describing the transport with adsorption inside the pore has no analytical solution, a numerical model based on the finite-difference approach was applied. With such a model, its validation against experiments and parametric studies it was possible to understand the transport mechanisms of adsorbing hormones through NF membranes. The results show that for low pressures the hormone transport is diffusion dominated. In contrast, for higher pressures (above 11 bar) the transport is convection dominated, showing that a purely diffusion transport model does not describe well the actual transport phenomena of hormones in NF membranes. Furthermore, it was found that two similar molecules can behave very differently in terms of adsorption on the membrane. E 1, which adsorbs 20 % more than E 2 in static mode, being slightly smaller than E 2, partitions more inside the membrane pore and adsorbs <b>double</b> under <b>filtration</b> conditions. This study contributes to illuminating the adsorption mechanisms of hormones onto NF membranes by understanding what parameters control adsorption such as hydrodynamics, materials, structure, etc. This not only identifies a potential problem in large scale applications, but it also provides an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the removal of these hormones and a tool that can be used to design future membranes for the improvement of micropollutant removal.
