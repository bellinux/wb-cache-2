5|$|Gray was {{not chosen}} for camouflage, however, it did, at times, provide {{enough of a}} mask along tree lines during battle; keeping the line of Infantry hidden long enough to strike effectively. At {{the time of the}} American Civil War, the {{usefulness}} of camouflage was not generally recognized. Gray was chosen for Confederate uniforms because gray dye could be made relatively cheaply and it was the standard uniform color of the various State Militias. The gray uniforms worn by <b>early</b> <b>State</b> volunteers was normally a shade of cadet gray, which is not suitable for combat wear, as it gives away the position of the individual easily from its bright blue-gray tones, and for this reason it was preserved by some men for dress-parade functions. The gray mentioned is dull toned, often varying in color depending on the region and time during the conflict, resulting in a uniform that could blend in with the tree lines, or hide the men in the field wearing them.|$|E

25|$|Studies on the {{formation}} of early states {{tend to focus on}} processes that create and institutionalize a state in a situation where a state did not exist before. Examples of early states which developed in interaction with other states include the Aegean Bronze Age Greek civilizations and the Malagasy civilization in Madagascar. Unlike primary state formation, <b>early</b> <b>state</b> formation does not require the creation of the first state in that cultural context or development autonomously, independently from state development nearby. <b>Early</b> <b>state</b> formation causation can thus include borrowing, imposition, and other forms of interaction with already existing states.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Marcella Alsan argues the {{prevalence}} of the tsetse fly hampered <b>early</b> <b>state</b> formation in Africa. Because the tsetse virus was lethal to cows and horses, communities afflicted by the insect could not rely on the agricultural benefits provided by livestock. African communities were prevented from stockpiling agricultural surplus, working the land, or eating meat. Because the disease environment hindered the formation of farming communities, early African societies resembled small hunter-gatherer groups and not centralized states.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{momentum}} in sequential voting systems, such as the U. S. presidential primary. In particular, we develop and estimate a simple discrete choice econometric model with social learning, which generates momentum eects. In the model, voters are uncertain about candidate quality, and voters in late states attempt to infer the information held by voters in <b>early</b> <b>states</b> from aggregate voting returns. Candidates experience momentum eects when their performance in <b>early</b> <b>states</b> exceeds voter expectations. The magnitude of momentum eects depend upon prior beliefs {{about the quality of}} candidates held by voters, expectations about candidate performance, and the degree of variation in state-level preferences. The empirical application focuses on the 2004 Democratic primary. We nd that Kerry bene tted substantially from surprising wins in <b>early</b> <b>states</b> and took votes away from Dean, who stumbled in <b>early</b> <b>states</b> after holding strong leads in polling data prior to the primary season. The estimated model demonstrates that social learning is strongest in <b>early</b> <b>states</b> and, {{by the end of the}} campaign, returns in other states are virtually ignored by voters in the latest states. Finally, we simulate the election under a counterfactual simultaneous primary and nd that the primary would have been much closer under such a system due to the absence of momentum eects...|$|R

The CHC composition of the larvae and adults are very different, in that the larvae's relative abundance of low-molecular-weight CHCs is higher and that the larval profiles are more uniform than those of adults. Adults are also able to distinguish odors of their own colonial larval CHCs from those of foreign colonys.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{findings of}} imported iron blades and local iron working appear in 500 BC. From about 50 AD, {{there are indications}} of a more intense long-distance exchange of goods in coastal Finland. Inhabitants exchanged their products, presumably mostly furs, for weapons and ornaments with the Balts and the Scandinavians {{as well as with}} the peoples along the traditional eastern trade routes. The existence of richly furnished burials, usually with weapons, suggests that there was a chiefly elite in the southern and western parts of the country. Hillforts spread over most of southern Finland at the end of the Iron and early Medieval Age. There is no commonly accepted evidence of <b>early</b> <b>state</b> formations in Finland, and the presumably Iron Age origins of urbanization are contested.|$|E

25|$|Goguryeo {{developed}} from a league of various Yemaek tribes to an <b>early</b> <b>state</b> and rapidly expanded its power from their original basin {{of control in}} the Hun River drainage. In the time of Taejodae in 53 CE, five local tribes were reorganized into five centrally ruled districts. Foreign relations and the military were controlled by the king. Early expansion might be best explained by ecology; Goguryeo controlled territory in what is currently central and southern Manchuria and northern Korea, which are both very mountainous and lacking in arable land. Upon centralizing, Goguryeo might {{have been unable to}} harness enough resources from the region to feed its population and thus, following historical pastoralist tendencies, would have sought to raid and exploit neighboring societies for their land and resources. Aggressive military activities may have also aided expansion, allowing Goguryeo to exact tribute from their tribal neighbors and dominate them politically and economically.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the impact and creation of institutions during <b>early</b> <b>state</b> formation, economic historians Stanley Engerman and Kenneth Sokoloff examined the economic development of the Americas during colonization. They found that the beginnings of {{the success or failure of}} American colonies were based on the specific factor endowments available to each colony. These endowments included the climate, soil profitability, crop potential, and even native population density. Institutions formed to take advantage of these factor endowments. Those that were most successful developed an ability to change and adapt to new circumstances over time. For example, the development of economic institutions, such as plantations, was caused by the need for a large property and labor force to harvest sugar and tobacco, while smallholder farms thrived in areas where scale economies were absent. Though initially profitable, plantation colonies also suffered from large dependent populations over time as slaves and natives were given few rights, limiting the population available to drive future economic progress and technological development.|$|E

Etruria's finances were in deplorable state; the country was ruined by war, bad harvest and the cost to have to maintain the unpopular French troops stationed in Etruria, that only much later where replaced by Spanish troops sent by Charles IV. In 1802, Maria Luisa and her husband were invited to Spain to attend the double wedding of her brother Ferdinand with Maria Antonia of Naples, and of her youngest sister, Maria Isabel, with Francis I of Naples. With Etruria's financial and economic difficulties, Louis' health failing and Maria Luisa in an <b>early</b> <b>state</b> of pregnancy, going abroad was clearly not expedient and therefore Maria Luisa was reluctant to go, but under the pressure of her father and the French, they started the journey to her native country.|$|E
