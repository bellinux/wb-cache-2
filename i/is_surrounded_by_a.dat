When stimulated by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), these secrete the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. They do this by transporting and metabolising the thyroglobulin contained in the colloid. Follicular cells vary in shape from flat to cuboid to columnar, depending on how active they are.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Crosse {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments with electricity, including the development of large voltaic piles, at the house during his ownership in the early 19th century. The main building of Fyne Court burnt down in 1894. The buildings which survived the fire have been used as offices and a visitor centre by organisations such as the Somerset Wildlife Trust and Quantock Hills AONB Service since it came into the ownership of the National Trust in 1967. It <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large country estate of woodland, ponds and meadows. Within the grounds are a folly and boathouse.|$|E

5|$|Basic indoor venues may {{be adapted}} gymnasiums, which can easily {{accommodate}} high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 200-metre oval track with {{four to eight}} lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track {{is used for the}} 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E

Capon Chapel, along with its cemetery, {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 2012, in recognition of its representation of the rural religious architecture of the Potomac Highlands region, and for its service as an important rural church in Hampshire County.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium(III) oxide (Es2O3) was {{obtained}} by burning einsteinium(III) nitrate. It forms colorless cubic crystals, which were first characterized from microgram samples sized about 30 nanometers. Two other phases, monoclinic and hexagonal, are known for this oxide. The formation of a certain Es2O3 phase depends on the preparation technique and sample history, {{and there is no}} clear phase diagram. Interconversions between the three phases can occur spontaneously, as a result of self-irradiation or self-heating. The hexagonal phase is isotypic with lanthanum(III) oxide where the Es3+ ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 6-coordinated group of O2− ions.|$|E

5|$|Fort Eliza, {{also known}} as The Salt Battery, is a {{freestanding}} five-sided four-gun battery, constructed around 1812, and standing {{on the east side}} of the River Shannon. Three sides face the river and were formed of broad parapets. The other two sides meet at the rear salient angle at a guardhouse, which is now ruined. The battery <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> dry moat, with the entrance originally across a drawbridge close to the guardhouse. At the centre of the enclosure was the brick-vaulted powder magazine. This fort, combined with Cromwell's Castle, the Martello tower and Fort Falkland would have protected both the town and the river crossing from all angles.|$|E
5|$|In colonial corals, growth {{results from}} the budding of new polyps. There {{are two types of}} budding, intratentacular and extratentacular. In intratentacular budding, a new polyp {{develops}} on the oral disc, inside the ring of tentacles. This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate oral disc with a series of mouths. Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated oral disc and not around the individual mouths. This <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single corallite wall, {{as is the case in}} the meandroid corallites of brain corals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is {{believed}} to be a supermassive black hole at its center.

The disk <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> spheroid halo of older, population II stars, as well as relatively dense concentrations of stars known as globular clusters.|$|E
