25|$|Emissions are {{inherent}} to the combustion of diesel fuels that are {{regulated by the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.). As these emissions are a byproduct of the combustion process, {{in order to ensure}} E.P.A. compliance a fuel system must be capable of controlling the combustion of fuels as well as the mitigation of emissions. There are a number of new technologies being phased in to control the production of diesel emissions. The exhaust gas recirculation system, E.G.R., and the <b>diesel</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>filter,</b> D.P.F., are both designed to mitigate the production of harmful emissions.|$|E
25|$|The main {{change for}} the 2012 models was the {{installation}} of a different engine from the Ford Duratorq engine range. Ford decided, due to cost reasons, not to modify the 2.4-litre engine introduced in 2007 to meet the upcoming Euro V emissions standards and so the engine was replaced with the ZSD-422 engine, essentially a 2.2-litre variant of the same engine. Although smaller than the existing unit the power and torque outputs remained unchanged and the same six-speed gearbox was used as well. The engine included a <b>diesel</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>filter</b> {{for the first time}} on a Defender. The only other change was the reintroduction of the soft top body style to the general market. This had been a popular option for the Land Rover Series but by the introduction of the Defender had been relegated to special order and military buyers only. Land Rover stated that the option was being brought back due to customer feedback.|$|E

However, further {{reduction in the}} pressure drop of catalyzed and non-catalyzed cordierite filters is desirable. In order to derive a fundamental {{understanding of the relationship}} between clean and sootloaded pressure drop and the pore microstructure of the ceramic, and to optimize the microstructure for filter performance, cordierite filters have been fabricated spanning an extended range in porosity, pore size distribution, and pore connectivity. Analysis of the results has been applied to the development of several new cordierite <b>diesel</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>filters</b> that possess a unique combination of high filtration efficiency, high strength, and very low clean and soot-loaded pressure drop. Furthermore, catalyst systems have been developed that result in a minimal pressure drop increase of the catalyzed filter.

But which filters are most efficient at extracting the noxious particles? How do the geometrical details of the filter material affect the filter properties? The new simulation software FilterDict could in the future significantly {{reduce the number of}} prototypes required, cutting time and cost of development - and offer some powerful new features, as well. It allows simulation of how fast and how far particles penetrate into the filter, for example - using any kind of filter material. As input parameters, FilterDict requires a filter material model from the 3 -D microstructure generator GeoDict, various physical parameters, and the particle size distribution. The software computes the path of the soot particles through the filter medium. The simulation shows how much soot is deposited in which part of the filter. Therefore, the design of the filter can b e optimized to achieve long regeneration intervals, low fuel consumption and a high engine rating. The simulation program has already passed its first practical test.

40|$|One {{emerging}} {{application for}} ceramics is <b>diesel</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>filters</b> being used {{order to meet}} EPA regulations going into effect in 2008. <b>Diesel</b> <b>particulates</b> {{are known to be}} carcinogenic and thus need to be minimized. Current systems use filters made from ceramics such as mullite and corderite. The filters are brittle and must operate at very high temperatures during a burn out cycle used to remove the soot buildup. Thus the filters are subjected to thermal shock stresses and life time reliability analysis is required. NASA GRC has developed reliability based design methods and test methods for such applications, such as CARES/Life and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) C 1499 “Standard Test Method for Equibiaxial Strength of Ceramics. ...|$|R
40|$|Exhaust {{noise in}} engines {{has always been}} a major source of {{automotive}} noise. Challenges for muffler design have been constraints on size, back pressure, and, of course, the cost. Designing for sufficient insertion loss at the engine firing frequency and the first few harmonics has been the biggest challenge. Most advances in the design of efficient mufflers have resulted from linear plane wave theory, making use of the transfer matrix method. This review paper deals with evaluating approximate source characteristics required for prediction of the unmuffled intake and exhaust noise, making use of the electroacoustical analogies. In the last few years, significant advances {{have been made in the}} analysis of variable area perforated ducts, transverse plane wave analysis of short elliptical as well as circular chambers, double-tuned expansion chambers and concentric tube resonators, catalytic converters, <b>diesel</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>filters,</b> air cleaners, etc. The development of long strand fibrous materials that can be used in hot exhaust systems without binders has led to the use of combination mufflers in exhaust systems. Breakthroughs have been achieved in the prediction and control of breakout noise from the elliptical and circular muffler shell as well as the end plates of typical mufflers. <b>Diesel</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>filters</b> and inlet air cleaners have also been modeled acoustically.
