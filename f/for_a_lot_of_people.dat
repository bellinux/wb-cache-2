500|$|After Neil Young {{played a}} few concerts with Pearl Jam and {{recorded}} the album Mirror Ball with them, {{some members of}} the media gave him the title [...] "Godfather of Grunge". This was grounded not only in his work with his band Crazy Horse and his regular use of distorted guitar—most notably on the album Rust Never Sleeps—but also his dress and persona. A similarly influential yet often overlooked album is Neurotica by Redd Kross, about which Jonathan Poneman said, [...] "Neurotica was a life changer for me and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in the Seattle music community." ...|$|E
500|$|Yermolinsky also {{agrees with}} Alekhine's {{criticism}} of 1.g3 e5 2.Nf3, a reversed Alekhine's Defense, in Réti–Alekhine, Baden-Baden 1925, writing that Alekhine [...] "understood {{the difference in}} opening philosophies for White and Black, and realized they just can't be the same! White is supposed to try {{for more than just}} obtaining a comfortable game in reversed colour opening set-ups, and, as the statistics show—surprisingly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> but not for me—White doesn't even score as well as Black does in the same positions with his extra tempo and all." [...] Howard Staunton, generally considered to have been the strongest player in the world from 1843 to 1851, made a similar point over 160 years ago, writing that Owen's Defense (1.e4 b6) is playable for Black, but that 1.b3 is inferior to [...] "the more customary [...] moves, from its being essentially defensive". The current view is that Owen's Defense is slightly better for White, while 1.b3 is playable but less likely to yield an opening advantage than 1.e4 or 1.d4.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jenna Bans and {{directed}} by Tom Verica. Edward Ornelas edited the episode, and Donald Lee Harris served as production designer. The episode's title refers to the song [...] "", by American alternative rock group Community Trolls. Featured music includes The Voluntary Butler Scheme's [...] "Trading Things In" [...] and Dragonette's [...] "Come On Be Good". Pompeo was pregnant during the episode, so the filming crew had to work around it. In the episode, Lexie advocated for Meredith to donate her liver, because she was unable to. Bans commented on this: [...] "It was REALLY {{easy for me to}} understand Lexie in this episode – 'cause that's how I imagine she grew up with [...] and Thatcher. There was taco night, and movie night, and if she had homework issues, one of them was always around to help. So now that her Dad needs some of her liver, recovering alcoholic or not, she’s gonna do it. She's not even thinking about the Chief's upcoming merger – and the fact that recovering from a major surgery will put her on the bench, out of the game, for at least a month. Lexie doesn't blink, because family isn't an obligation to her like it is <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> - [...] it's a gift." [...] The scene in which Meredith offers her liver to Thatcher was originally intended to rekindle their relationship. Bans later changed this, following a request from Pompeo, and offered her insight: ...|$|E

500|$|Coe's {{interpretation}} {{was repeated}} by other scholars {{through the early}} 1990s. In contrast, later researchers said that, while {{the end of the}} 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration, it did not mark the end of the calendar. [...] "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," [...] said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. [...] "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention."

[...] Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, stated that, [...] "We have no record or knowledge that [...] would think the world would come to an end" [...] in 2012.

[...] "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this." [...] Commenting on the new calendar found at Xultún, one archaeologist said [...] "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We keep looking for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in November 2006, Billboard {{magazine}} was {{curious as to}} why the artist is credited as just his first name, [...] "Yusuf" [...] rather than [...] "Yusuf Islam".

It’s not exactly {{mainstream}} manga, you know? Where it might overlap with the moe phenomenon, though, {{is that you have}} really cute characters and people who are into those characters." [...] Furthermore, he commented on the restriction of the Imouto Paradise! 2 manga, saying that, [...] "I don’t think that it’s surprising that they took on Imouto Paradise, because it’s got a decent fan following, has an emphasis on incest, which is one act specifically mentioned in the ordinance, and the characters are marked by a kind of cuteness that’s worrisome <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people,</b> because cuteness often bleeds into youthfulness."

[...] Although the band and Trombino spent little time together in the studio, Trombino joined Jimmy Eat World [...] "a couple of times", with Adkins travelling to Los Angeles to join Trombino during the mixing process. Regarding the overall recording process, Adkins stated: [...] "I could definitely see our approach being a standard working method in the future <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b> It frees up a lot of our geographic restrictions for both the producer and the band; it's not just someone next door." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens {{describes}} New Labour {{as being}} formed by struggles in the 1980s and a programme of [...] "social liberalism, egalitarian {{education and the}} sexual revolution" [...] envisaged in the 1950s by figures such as Anthony Crosland and Roy Jenkins. He believes that its beliefs are Eurocommunist, and has criticised Labour for its [...] "attacks on the constitution", describing Tony Blair's constitutional reforms as a [...] "slow-motion coup d'état". [...] Hitchens believes the most significant changes introduced by New Labour concentrated {{power in the hands}} of the executive, with Blair effectively chief executive, and Orders in Council installing Alastair Campbell and Jonathan Powell in Whitehall. Hitchens also mocked Blair's public relations, previously calling him [...] "Princess Tony" [...] (in reference to Blair's calling Princess Diana [...] "the people's princess"), and [...] "Anthony Blair", as well as casting doubt on Blair's accounts of his early legal and political career. Hitchens also described Gordon Brown, as a [...] "dismal Marxoid", but criticised what he saw as [...] "prejudiced, shallow" [...] attempts by the media to destroy Brown after he became Prime Minister. However, Hitchens has shown some sympathy for Jeremy Corbyn, writing that the Labour leader [...] "speaks <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who feel left out of the recovery we are supposed to be having" [...] and who represents a split from [...] "the same cult, the Clinton-Blair fantasy that globalism ... will save the great nations of the West", likening him to Donald Trump in his anti-Establishment rhetoric.|$|E

On whether Luke Cage would address current race issues, including Black Lives Matter, given the character's past (a wrongfully imprisoned black man), Colter said, [...] "this {{is not necessarily the}} platform to hit it head on" [...] but [...] "the things that he's going through will ring true <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> in law enforcement" [...] and on the street.

[...] Coker stated that Cage is [...] "someone that the community can touch and go to", adding, [...] "There’s never been a time in history where having a bulletproof black man" [...] has been so important. Luke Cage was also the first MCU property to use the word [...] "nigger" [...] or [...] "nigga", with Marvel having complete trust in Coker's use of it: the word is used casually in the series, though some characters, including Cage, prefer not to use it. Coker said the intent was never to use it [...] "in a way where it's flippant. I used it from the standpoint of, if we were going to eavesdrop on a conversation with African American people, with nobody else around, when would this word be used and how would it get used." [...] Coker also likened the use in the series to [...] "the way music used to treat it," [...] not having it be [...] "every other word of every other chorus, because at that point, it just gets silly." ...|$|E
