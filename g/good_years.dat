5|$|According to legend, the Nez Perce tribe {{was first}} {{founded in the}} valley of the Clearwater River, one of the Snake River's {{lowermost}} major tributaries. At its height, there were at least 27 Nez Perce settlements along the Clearwater River and 11 more on the Snake between the mouth of the Clearwater and Imnaha Rivers. There were also villages on the Salmon River, Grande Ronde River, Tucannon River, and the lower Hells Canyon area. The Snake River's annual salmon run, which was estimated at that time to exceed four million in <b>good</b> <b>years,</b> supported the Nez Perce, who lived in permanent, well-defined villages, unlike the nomadic southeastern tribes along the Snake River. The Nez Perce also were involved in trade with the Flathead tribe to the north and other middle Columbia River tribes. However, they were enemies to the Shoshone and the other upstream Snake River tribes.|$|E
5|$|Political {{tensions}} {{amongst the}} working classes in Glamorgan had grown during the 1820s: although wages were impressive by contemporary standards during <b>good</b> <b>years,</b> they deteriorated quickly during depressions, plunging many into destitution; sanitation and health {{standards in the}} fast-growing industrial communities were appalling, child mortality rates were extremely high. 1831 saw a severe economic depression, with wages falling quickly and food prices rising, and complaints against the local debt courts and their bailiffs were numerous. Nationally, the electoral reform movement was making considerable protests and protests against the Corn Laws—which kept the prices of food high—were growing. In South Wales, several of the major ironmasters were associated with these movements, promoting reform under the Whig administration voted into power between April and June 1831.|$|E
5|$|After {{mismanagement}} {{during the}} late 1980s, Hibs were {{on the brink of}} financial ruin in 1990. Wallace Mercer, the chairman of Hearts, proposed a merger of the two clubs, but the Hibs fans believed that the proposal was more like a hostile takeover. They formed the Hands off Hibs group to campaign for the continued existence of the club. This succeeded when a prominent local businessman, Kwik-Fit owner Sir Tom Farmer, acquired a controlling interest in Hibs. The fans were able to persuade Farmer to take control {{despite the fact that he}} had no great interest in football. Farmer was persuaded in part by the fact that a relative of his had been involved in the rescue of Hibs from financial ruin in the early 1890s. After the attempted takeover by Mercer, Hibs had a few <b>good</b> <b>years</b> in the early 1990s, winning the 1991 Scottish League Cup Final and finishing in the top five in the league in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Soon after Alex McLeish was appointed as manager in 1998, Hibs were relegated to the First Division, but immediately won promotion back to the SPL in 1999.|$|E

Juan Guzmán slumped considerably from his first three years (40–11, 3.28 ERA), finishing 1994 at 12–11 with a 5.68 ERA.

25|$|The warming {{environment}} presents {{challenges to}} local communities {{such as the}} Inuit. Hunting, which is a major way of survival for some small communities, will be changed with increasing temperatures. The reduction of sea ice will cause certain species populations to decline or even become extinct. In <b>good</b> <b>years,</b> some communities are fully employed by the commercial harvest of certain animals. The harvest of different animals fluctuates each year and {{with the rise of}} temperatures it is likely to continue changing and creating issues for Inuit hunters. Unsuspected changes in river and snow conditions will cause herds of animals, including reindeer, to change migration patterns, calving grounds, and forage availability.|$|E

25|$|The {{weather was}} not in itself a {{hardship}} for those accustomed to long winters. The real problem lay in the weather's effect on crops and thus on the supply of food and firewood. At higher elevations, where farming was problematic in <b>good</b> <b>years,</b> the cooler climate did not quite support agriculture. In May 1816, frost killed off most crops in the higher elevations of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, as well as upstate New York. On June 6, snow fell in Albany, New York, and Dennysville, Maine. In Cape May, New Jersey, frost was reported five {{nights in a row}} in late June, causing extensive crop damage.|$|E
25|$|Phloem of {{pine trees}} {{has been used}} in Finland as a {{substitute}} food in times of famine and even in <b>good</b> <b>years</b> in the northeast. Supplies of phloem from previous years helped stave off starvation in the great famine of the 1860s. Phloem is dried and milled to flour (pettu in Finnish) and mixed with rye to form a hard dark bread, bark bread. The least appreciated was silkko, a bread made only from buttermilk and pettu without any real rye or cereal flour. Recently, pettu has again become available as a curiosity, and some have made claims of health benefits. However, its food energy content is low relative to rye or other cereals.|$|E
25|$|With {{the sudden}} {{death of the}} Emperor at a young age, his heir was an infant son named Bang Co. He was the second son of his father but the elder son Nghi Dân had been officially passed over due to his mother's low social status. Bang Co was renamed Lê Nhân Tông (Vietnamese: Lê Nhân Tông; ruled: 1442–1459) but the real rulers were Trịnh Khả and the child's mother, the young Empress Nguyễn Thị Anh. The next 17 years were <b>good</b> <b>years</b> for Vietnam – there were no great {{troubles}} either internally or externally. Two things of note occurred: first, the Vietnamese sent an army south to attack the Champa kingdom in 1446; second, the Dowager Empress ordered the execution of Trịnh Khả, for reasons lost to history, in 1451.|$|E

25|$|The 1980s {{were fairly}} <b>good</b> <b>years</b> for Colt, but the coming-end of the Cold War would change all that. Colt had long left {{innovation}} in civilian firearms to their competitors, {{feeling that the}} handgun business could survive on their traditional revolver and M1911 designs. Instead, Colt focused on the military market, where they held the primary contracts for production of rifles for the US military. This strategy dramatically failed for Colt {{through a series of}} events in the 1980s. In 1984, the U.S. military standardized on the Beretta 92F. This was not much of a loss for Colt's current business, as M1911A1 production had stopped in 1945. Meanwhile, the military rifle business was growing because the U.S. military had a major demand for more upgraded M16s; the M16A2 model had just been adopted and the Military needed hundreds of thousands of them.|$|E
25|$|Harvest was in {{the late}} spring and during the dry summer months. Nomadic Amorites from the {{northwest}} would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on the stubble and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, {{they would have to}} pay a tax in wool, meat, milk, and cheese to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In <b>good</b> <b>years,</b> all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem, and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.|$|E
