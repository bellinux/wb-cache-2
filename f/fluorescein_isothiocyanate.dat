5000|$|Fluo-3 is a {{fluorescence}} {{indicator of}} intracellular calcium (Ca2+). It {{is used to}} measure Ca2+ inside living cells in flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy using visible light excitation (compatible with argon laser sources operating at 488 nm). Fluo-3 is an essentially nonfluorescent compound, but upon binding of Ca2+ its fluorescence increases sharply with an emission maximum at 525 nm suitable for conventionally used detectors designed for <b>fluorescein</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (FITC) measurements. This large change in fluorescence coupled with a good yield of photons provides very high contrast which allowed the detection of microscopic Ca2+ release events inside cells called [...] "Calcium sparks". Whereas the salts of fluo-3 are unable to penetrate cells, loading can be achieved using its acetoxymethyl (AM) ester derivative. Once inside the cell, unspecific esterases cleave the ester effectively trapping fluo-3.|$|E
50|$|FTC-κ-casein method affords {{accurate}} and precise determinations of κ-caseinolytic degradation, {{the first step}} in the milk-clotting process. This method is the result of a modification to the one described by S.S. Twining (1984). The main modification was substituting the substrate previously used (casein) by -casein labeled with the fluorochrome <b>fluorescein</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (FITC) to yield the fluorescein thiocarbamoyl (FTC) derivative. This variation allows quantification of the -casein molecules degraded in a more precise and specific way, detecting only those enzymes able to degrade such molecules. The method described by Twining (1984), however, was designed to detect the proteolytic activity of a considerably large variety of enzymes. FTC-κ-casein allows the detection of different types of proteases at levels when no milk clotting is yet apparent, unveiling its higher sensitivity over currently used assay procedures.Therefore, the method may find application as an indicator during the purification or characterization of newmilk-clotting enzymes.|$|E
50|$|DuoCISH is a {{variation}} of CISH that addresses the need for two different probes on the same slide. It is a well-established technique for HER-2/neu amplification detection {{even though it is}} sometimes reported to be less effective than FISH. In this technique, one probe binds the reference which, in the case of HER-2/neu amplification detection, is CEN17 (the centromere of chromosome 17) while the other probe binds the target sequence which is HER-2/neu. DuoCISH combines both FISH and CISH in that it converts signals from FISH probes to chromogenic substrates. It works on the principle that blue cyanine dye is a substrate for HRP and red dye is a substrate for AP. For example, green <b>fluorescein</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (FITC) signals are converted to blue chromogenic precipitates through an anti-FITC antibody conjugated to HRP, and Texas Red signals are converted to red chromogenic precipitates through an anti-Texas Red antibody conjugated to AP. An advantage of DuoCISH is {{that it is possible to}} distinguish between chromosomal aneuploidy and gene amplification as the reference gene will also be amplified in aneuploidy but not in gene amplification detection.|$|E
5000|$|Rabies can be {{difficult}} to diagnose, because, in the early stages, it is easily confused with other diseases or with aggressiveness. The reference method for diagnosing rabies is the fluorescent antibody test (FAT), an immunohistochemistry procedure, which is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). [...] The FAT relies on the ability of a detector molecule (usually <b>fluorescein</b> <b>isothiocyanate)</b> coupled with a rabies-specific antibody, forming a conjugate, to bind to and allow the visualisation of rabies antigen using fluorescent microscopy techniques. Microscopic analysis of samples is the only direct method that allows for the identification of rabies virus-specific antigen in a short time and at a reduced cost, irrespective of geographical origin and status of the host. It has to be regarded as the first step in diagnostic procedures for all laboratories. Autolysed samples can, however, reduce the sensitivity and specificity of the FAT. The RT PCR assays proved to be a sensitive and specific tool for routine diagnostic purposes, particularly in decomposed samples or archival specimens. The diagnosis can be reliably made from brain samples taken after death. The diagnosis can also be made from saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid samples, but this is not as sensitive and reliable as brain samples. Cerebral inclusion bodies called Negri bodies are 100% diagnostic for rabies infection but are found in only about 80% of cases. If possible, the animal from which the bite was received should also be examined for rabies.|$|E
50|$|The {{availability}} of GFP and its derivatives has thoroughly redefined fluorescence microscopy {{and the way}} it is used in cell biology and other biological disciplines. While most small fluorescent molecules such as FITC (<b>fluorescein</b> <b>isothiocyanate)</b> are strongly phototoxic when used in live cells, fluorescent proteins such as GFP are usually much less harmful when illuminated in living cells. This has triggered the development of highly automated live-cell fluorescence microscopy systems, which can be used to observe cells over time expressing one or more proteins tagged with fluorescent proteins. For example, GFP had been widely used in labelling the spermatozoa of various organisms for identification purposes as in Drosophila melanogaster, where expression of GFP {{can be used as a}} marker for a particular characteristic. GFP can also be expressed in different structures enabling morphological distinction. In such cases, the gene for the production of GFP is incorporated into the genome of the organism in the region of the DNA that codes for the target proteins and that is controlled by the same regulatory sequence; that is, the gene's regulatory sequence now controls the production of GFP, in addition to the tagged protein(s). In cells where the gene is expressed, and the tagged proteins are produced, GFP is produced at the same time. Thus, only those cells in which the tagged gene is expressed, or the target proteins are produced, will fluoresce when observed under fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of such time lapse movies has redefined the understanding of many biological processes including protein folding, protein transport, and RNA dynamics, which in the past had been studied using fixed (i.e., dead) material. Obtained data are also used to calibrate mathematical models of intracellular systems and to estimate rates of gene expression.|$|E

40|$|Inactivation of the {{wild-type}} {{human plasma}} membrane Ca 2 + pump (isoform 4 b) by <b>fluorescein</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> {{is accompanied by}} covalent modification of Lys 591. The mutation of Lys 591 to arginine reduced the Ca 2 + transport activity to 35 % of the wild-type, and diminished the amount of acylphosphate formed from ATP by a corresponding amount. When this mutant was treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate; the enzyme was still irreversibly inactivated, even though no reactive residue was available at position 591. The results show that, although Ca 2 + pump function is sensitive to the residue at position 591, Lys 591 is not essential for enzyme activity. They also demonstrate that irreversible inhibition of the plasma membrane Ca 2 + pump by <b>fluorescein</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> {{does not require the}} covalent modification of Lys 591.

40|$|The binding of {{vanadate}} and <b>fluorescein</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> to the Ca 2 +-transport ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum (EC 3. 6. 1. 3) was analyzed. Monovanadate binds to the Ca 2 +-transport ATPase at {{a single}} high affinity site (site l), that is presumably related to the binding site for inorganic orthophosphate, and {{to one of the}} two sites for decavanadate. Binding of vanadate to this site stabilizes the enzyme in the E 2 conformation, with inhibition of ATPase activity and the formation of crystalline arrays of Ca 2 '-ATPase. Decavanadate also binds with high affinity to a second site on the Ca 2 +-ATPase (site 2), that is blocked by <b>fluorescein</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> and may be part of the binding site for ATP. Crystallization of Ca 2 +-ATPase in sarcoplasmic reticulum, labeled with <b>fluorescein</b> <b>isothiocyanate,</b> by either monovanadate or decavanadate implies that occupation of site 1, but not of site 2, by vanadate is required for the conformational change of Ca 2 +-ATPase leading to the formation of crystalline arrays. <b>Fluorescein</b> <b>isothiocyanate</b> (FITC) inhibits the ATPase activity and ATP-dependent Ca 2 +-transport of sarcoplasmic reticulum [l], by reaction with a lysine residue near the TI tryptic cleavage site of the Ca 2 +-ATPase [2].
