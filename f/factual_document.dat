In curating this exhibition my {{intention was to}} reconsider {{the importance of this}} female British sculptor and educator by focussing on a specific group work made within a five year period. My intention was to introduce this original work made at a crucial moment in this emerging artist's development and to raise more general questions about what {{it was to be a}} female artist in the UK at the end of the 1970 's. The curatorial concept was to exhibit the sculptures in a contemporary context alongside photographs of the work taken in the artist's studio around the time that the work was made, thus giving the viewer a temporal shift. The photographs were beautiful but had never been intended for exhibition and my decision to display them was part of one of the recurring themes of my curatorial practice - the presentation of archives as <b>factual</b> <b>document</b> and aesthetic artefact simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Photography is an enigma. The {{features}} that distinguish it most from other art forms — the camera’s automatism and the photograph’s verisimilitude — have throughout its history also provided {{the basis for}} critics to claim that a photographer is not an artist nor the photograph a work of art. Because every photograph is the product of an automatic, mechanical device, critics argue that a photographer is a mere technician relegated to clicking a shutter button. Moreover, because every photograph displays an exact likeness of whatever happened to be sitting before the camera, critics consider that image to be a <b>factual</b> <b>document</b> devoid of creativity. Looking to the technology’s automatism and verisimilitude, modern legal skeptics have joined this chorus by arguing that most photographs are inevitably uncreative facts — {{in the words of one}} scholar, the “automated representation of reality” — and thereby undeserving of copyright protection. This is the first Article to propose that borrowing the concept of depiction from art theory can shed considerable light on photographic originality. As a depiction, a photograph has what philosopher Richard Wollheim has described as “two folds. ” The “first fold” refers to the design markings on the surface of the photographic paper. The “second fold” refers to the real world object or scene that a viewer perceives in those design markings. This Article’s fundamental thesis is that, for purposes of copyright law, a photograph’s originality inheres primarily in a photographer’s creative choices that result in the placement of surface design markings. In contrast, the object or scene that a viewer sees in a photograph rarely impacts the image’s originality. Accordingly, the claim by legal skeptics that most photographs are uncreative facts locates photographic originality in the wrong place — in the object or scene that a viewer sees in the picture (depiction’s second fold). If, instead, a photograph’s originality depends primarily on a photographer’s creative choices in placing surface design markings (depiction’s first fold), the attack on originality based on automatism and verisimilitude — on a photograph’s inevitably being an uncreative fact — collapses...|$|E

40|$|American Landscape is a {{constant}} strand in Frank Lloyd Wrights early publications on his Prairie Style. According to Wright, the new, natural homes’ formal elements were deduced from the pictorial notion of the Great Plains. Thus, Wright could advertise his and the "New School of the Middle West's" architecture as truthful to the American Spirit. Its transatlantic impact on European modernism has been subject to numerous research. It becomes apparent that only by skillfully reinforcing these connotations through his publications of both words and images, photographical as well as hand drawn, Wright was able to maintain the natural character of his Prairie Houses. So readers of his 1911 Wasmuth volumes could assume the buildings were situated in an "open, wind-blown landscape" (Richard Neutra), although they actually stood on crowded lots in suburbs like Oak Park. Interestingly enough, these carefully constructed images became alive and lived through photography’s triumph of becoming the key medium of architectural representation. This article examines Wright's editorial strategies in preparation of his Ausgeführte Bauten (1911) and emphasizes his cooperation with Chicago photographer Clarence Albert Fuermann. The photographs of Avery Coonley House {{can be used as}} an example of how they both expanded the boundaries of 1900 's professional photography. In close reading of Wright's early writings and in recourse to his transcendentalist ardor it is possible to introduce/propose a concept of 'organic photography' as a comprehension of the intrinsic nature of photography. As it turns out, Wright's published photographs represent much more than neutral, <b>factual</b> <b>documents</b> of architectural quality: they have been subtly used to emotionally address and visually guide the beholder towards a carefully constructed, persuading image of Prairie Style architecture...|$|R
40|$|As {{information}} retrieval becomes more focussed, so too must the techniques {{involved in the}} retrieval process. More precise responses to queries require more precise linguistic analysis of both the queries and the <b>factual</b> <b>documents</b> from which the information is being retrieved. In this thesis, I present research into using existing linguistic tools to analyse questions. These tools, as supplied, often underperform on question analysis. I present my work on adapting these tools, and creating new resources for use in developing new tools tailored to question analysis. My work has shown {{that in order to}} adapt the treebank- and f-structure annotation algorithmbased wide coverage LFG parsing resources of Cahill et al. (2004) to analyse questions from the ATIS corpus, only the c-structure parser needs to be retrained, the annotation algorithm remains unchanged. The retrained c-structure parser needs only a small amount of appropriate training data added to its training corpus to gain a significant improvement in both c-structure parsing and f-structure annotation. Given the improvements made with a relatively small amount of question data, I developed QuestionBank, a question treebank, to determine what further gains can be made using a larger amount of question data. My question treebank is a corpus of 4000 parse annotated questions. The questions were taken from a number of sources and the question treebank was “bootstrapped” in an incremental parsing, hand correction and retraining approach from raw data using existing probabilistic parsing resources. Experiments with QuestionBank show that it is an effective resource for training parsers to analyse questions with an improvement of over 10 % on the baseline parsing results. In further experiments I show that a parser retrained with QuestionBank can also parse newspaper text (Penn-II Treebank Section 23) with state-of-the-art accuracy. Long distance dependencies (LDDs) are a vital part of question analysis in determining semantic roles and question focus. I have designed and implemented a novel method to recover WH-traces and coindexed antecedents in c-structure trees from parser output which uses the f-structure LDD resolution method of Cahill et al (2004) to resolve the dependencies and then “reverse engineers” the corresponding syntactic components in the c-structure tree...|$|R

This work contains evidence collected {{through the lens of}} the camera. Its sense of reality and immediacy is an illusion promoted by the detailed rendering capabilities of the mechanical process of photography. The photographs appear factual, but in addition to their representation of the physical world, they reveal the photographer 2 ̆ 7 s opinion. As the photographer, I attempt to influence the viewer 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of the image. The people, {{who may or may not}} appear, have created the environments in these photographs. When photographed, these environments seem to offer circumstantial visual evidence about the lives of the people who created them. The objects shown may have been selected and displayed without regard for meaning, or with an intent that is different from the one communicated. I have tried to either emphasize the implied meaning, reinterpret it, or effect a combination of the two. Places, people and things provide the evidence of their own existence through their depiction. Any conclusions drawn are inferred through the image. While it can be used as a fact-finding medium, photography as art goes beyond the veracity of detailed representation to its underlying symbolic implications. Taking into consideration the dual photographic properties of scientific fact-finding and artistic interpretation, the resulting visual information embodies both knowledge and puzzlement. After arriving at a conclusion, an engaging photograph continues to present unanswerable questions. These are not intended as strictly <b>factual</b> <b>documents,</b> rather, they are personal observations made with an interest in such diverse human qualities as conflict, humor, love, greed, tedium, perseverance and so on. While using the highly subjective elements, poetry and beauty, in conjunction with formal elements such as suspension of time, quality of light, the edges of the frame, rhythm, repetition, emphasis, form, and symbolism, I hope to make images that evoke the layered meanings of the subject at hand. I have attempted to provide insight while leaving behind engaging questions. This work comprises several interwoven themes. The connecting thread leads through modem western society and its various configurations. Within our social structure, children symbolize the present as well as the future. Their methods of play and interpretation of the adult world are of interest here. As are the houses we live in, the gardens we make, and the products we buy, in general, the ways in which we project our perceived identities. These photographs present details of our lives that are simultaneously mundane and significant. It is a personal view of people interacting with their environments.

40|$|This article {{argues that}} {{documents}} {{have always been}} central to {{the debate on the}} origins of the First World War, from their first publications in the early weeks of the war, in the so-called Coloured Books, to the official document collections on which so much of our knowledge of the period is still based. For nearly 100 years, we have been engaged in the hunt for the truth about the outbreak of the war, and documents have been seen as the key to unlocking this truth about the past. Not surprisingly, documents (many of them only recently discovered by Fischer in the archives by the time he wrote Griff nach der Weltmacht) have been seen as the key to unlocking the truth about the past. And yet, the long debate on the origins of the war has throughout been characterised by deliberate deceptions, misinterpretations and outright lies. This article attempts to unravel the connection between truth, lies and documents in the debate on the origins of the war, and suggests that primary sources, if used judiciously and within an international context, can serve as a way of explaining events the past, despite their obvious shortcomings. International documents can, for example, highlight the intersection of military and political decision-making in July 1914, and how mismatches here led to cues and triggers which had different significance in different countries. However, the article also aims to reflects more broadly on the limitations of a document-based analysis which aims at <b>factual</b> truth. <b>Documents</b> are always subjective, not only in the way we interpret them, but also in the way they were created. It suggests that the search for that key document, that smoking gun, is almost certainly futile, but rather that the goal should be an analysis of sources for the mechanisms and cultures of military and diplomatic decision-making which they reveal. As much as any truth can ever be told about how the war started, this is the area where, with the help of documents, {{we might be able to}} find it. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Devil in the Mirror: Arne Garborg’s Doubt. Master thesis in {{religious}} studies by Odd Magnus Grimeland The study is {{an investigation of}} the religious themes of the writer Arne Garborg, who was born in Jæren on the west coast of Norway in 1851. The title refers to the writer’s tense and adverse commitment to the strict pietistic Christianity of his native region. The landscape of Jæren (and the southern and western parts of Norway in general) has an extraordinarilaly rich religious heritage. The hardworking peasants and fishermen of this wet and windy region have often embraced rather stern interpretations of the Christian message. Hans Nielsen Hauge was the foremost Norwegian layman of the early 19 th Century. Hauge’s call to serve as God’s housekeeper appealed strongly to the rural working class, and even though he was persecuted by the authorities early in his career, his popular teaching was eventually recognized as a resource for the theology of the Lutheran state church. The learned theologian Gisle Johnson sought to reconcile Hauge’s popular pietism with Lutheran orthodoxy. Johnson managed to set in motion a major religious revival. The Johnsonian Awakening dominated the religious atmosphere of Norway {{in the second half of}} the 19 th Century. The legacy of Hauge and Johnson remains a considerable force in the lay movement and in church societies for inner and outer mission. Pietism emphasises the individual sinner’s conversion. The threatening prospect of an eternity in Hell for the unconverted is the downside of the glorious message. Arne Garborg experienced the dramatic results of the call for religious awakening during his childhood and adolescence. His father was overcome by religious fervour and fell into endless speculations on his possible damnation. Arne was barely twenty years old when his troubled father hanged himself. It is hard to pinpoint the exact motive for the suicide, but the mirthless religious understanding of life and death certainly contributed to the sad outcome. Thus, religion and religious fanaticism became inevitable topics in Arne Garborg’s writing. He was particularly committed to the unveiling of the dark side of pietism, a critical project which is evident in the books A Free-Thinker (Ein Fritenkjar, 1878 / 81) and Peace (Fred, 1892). The novel Peace is particularly important. It is in my opinion one of the most intimate portraits of a religious fanatic ever written. The unfortunate fate of Garborg’s father was of course the main inspiration for the novel. The constructive element of Garborg’s criticism verges on the utopian. The teaching of Jesus as presented in the synoptic Gospels is the guideline for his ethics. The writer’s utopian leanings became apparent in the final phase of his career. Garborg’s ideal religious thinker, the former revivalist Paulus Hòve, was introduced in the play The Teacher (Læraren, 1896). Garborg investigated Paulus’ humane interpretation of Christ’s message further in The Lost Father (Den burtkomne Faderen, 1899) and The Returned Son (Heimkomin Son, 1908). The study Jesus Messiah (Jesus Messias, 1906) expresses his personal understanding of The New Testament and also contains a fervent criticism of Lutheran orthodoxy and pietism. The experimental aim of this thesis is the investigation of a religious environment on the basis of fictional accounts. I am aware of the dangers of treating literature as <b>factual</b> <b>documents.</b> Both the German theorist Hans-Georg Gadamer and many of his opponents are highly suspicious of art as a source for historical knowledge. Although I do not fully share this view, I consider it an important reminder of the possible shortcomings of my approach. Sufficient understanding of art and history is essential for the success of the project. Ultimately, I have found that Arne Garborg’s accounts are saturated by first hand experiences. They do in fact offer a unique and valuable insight into the religious milieu of Norwegian 19 th Century pietism. The books and essays where he presents his own views on religion are authentic documents in their own right. Garborg’s obsession with the traumatic loss of faith foreshadows the concerns of 20 th Century writers such as Albert Camus and Samuel Beckett. And his polemical dissections of the traditional interpretations of Jesus Christ are still richly illuminating...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{aggression}} {{is a relatively}} new communication phenomenon, the mental health impacts of which among youth are an emerging and increasingly critical health problem. The problem is important as many researchers, policy makers, educators, parents and young people are finding it difficult to identify and prevent this form of violence. Moreover, the means and media of this movement continue to evolve at a rapid rate. The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine the phenomena of electronic aggression in youth and the corresponding impact to their psychological health. The current exploratory analysis examines the similarities and differences between traditional bullying and electronic aggression and the significance of the resulting mental health outcomes for youth shown in the bully, victim and bystander roles. A line of inquiry was developed by the researcher to determine whether there may be a potential coliseum effect, amplifying the psychological harm to those involved. Theoretical sampling was used to examine three cases chosen for their social notoriety and ongoing proliferation. In addition to the <b>factual</b> and <b>documented</b> data relative to the vii cases, the original posted comments and interactions of third-party bystanders on the Internet were collected and analyzed in order to examine their contributing role in and potential impact on electronic aggression. Upon analyzing the themes found within these cases, a critical factor emerged relative {{to the role of the}} electronic bystander. The ability for a dissociated online persona to be anonymous and invisible in an environment – the Internet – that is relentless and the stage to infinite audiences has the potential to amplify the aggression's negative effect on the target by prolonging the victimization indefinitely. At the same time, this virtual coliseum seems to evoke aggressive behaviors among some youth who otherwise might not engage in this form of violence. The researcher determined that potential negative mental health impacts may be increased as a result of a coliseum effect, where peripheral spectators to acts of electronic aggression contribute to and nourish its existence. As unmonitored access to the Internet and other electronic media increases, electronic aggression will likely follow a similar trajectory. It is therefore critical to conduct further research on this phenomenon in order to understand how and why it occurs and how various short and long term repercussions on the mental health of the youth involved evolve. Only then can preventive measures be developed, implemented and systematically evaluated. Health EducationMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Helgo Zettervall (1831 – 1907) {{was one of}} Sweden’s {{principal}} {{architects and}} design talents. He was professionally active for 40 years, from the late 1850 s to the mid- 1890 s – a period of intensive building activity in Sweden. For the first twenty years of his career, he had his practice in Lund, and in the subsequent twenty years he lived in Stockholm as head of Sweden’s state authority for public buildings. Zettervall was very productive. His portfolio contains 281 projects, of which 160 were executed, ranging from large cathedral restorations with thousands of detailed drawings and large public buildings to porch extensions and smaller residences. This dissertation highlights Zettervall’s works by putting them in a context and by analysing their qualitative aspects. Carried out as a historiographical case study, the framework for the dissertation is the architectural monograph. The individual architectural projects are {{the core of the}} presentation, assembling and making archive material readily accessible, and the method is leaning towards that of an oeuvre complète raisonné. The method includes three distinct approaches: a <b>factual</b> accounting of <b>documents</b> and drawings, a context-setting frame story that provides the conditions, and an architectural analysis. Zettervall belonged to the first generation of architects who could receive a well-planned and broad training in Sweden. All of this training took place against a backdrop of what a specific assignment demanded in terms of responsiveness and understanding. Zettervall developed a special talent for utilizing new construction methods and materials. Each assignment was a challenge to investigate new design principles and new spatial ideas. The investigation shows that every project was unique for Zettervall, and that his various solutions depended on the specific situation, regarding site and program. Zettervall was a distinct pragmatic. Every assignment had its unique conditions, and thus had a unique solution. QC 20170511 </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Referrals of {{patients}} from primary care to medical specialist care {{are an important}} activity in any health care system. German data show {{that the number of}} referrals by GPs have increased since 2004, but detailed insight into the experiences {{of patients}}, GPs and consultants regarding referrals is very limited. This study aimed at describing the experiences of consultants, GPs and patients with referrals from primary care to medical specialist care. An additional objective was to examine the impact of purpose regarding the referral and of the referrer on the experiences of GPs and patients. Methods Referrals of 26 general practitioners (GPs) from 25 practices in Marbach, a rural region in the south of Germany were studied. All adult patients referred after consulting these GPs in a period of five weeks were eligable for the study. GPs, consultants and patients completed short structured forms to <b>document</b> <b>factual</b> characteristics of each referral and their experiences with the referral. GPs and patients completed forms before and after the referral was made, while the consultants completed forms after the patient had consulted them. Results Overall, consultants were very positive about appropriateness of the referral (91 %). They were somewhat more critical regarding the information provided on the patients' medical history (61 %) and prescriptions (48 %). In 258 referrals (63 %) GPs perceived clear diagnostic benefits, while in 202 referrals (49 %) they perceived clear treatment benefits. GPs' experiences were more positive if the GP's purpose was to reduce diagnostic uncertainty (beta = 0. 318, p Patients' expectations regarding the referrals mostly referred to diagnosis, including increased diagnostic certainty (80 %), detailed information about the illness (66 %) and exclusion of serious illness (62 %). They were overall satisfied with the referral (83 %). Their experiences with the referral were more positive if the initiative for the referral came from the physician (beta = 0. 365, p Conclusion Patients, GPs and consultants have positive views on the value of referrals from primary care to medical specialists. Patients were most positive if the physician had initiated the referral, which supports the gate keeper role of the GP. </p...|$|R

GPs' experiences were more positive if the GP's purpose was to reduce diagnostic uncertainty (beta = 0. 318, p < 0. 001) or if the purpose was to exclude serious illness (beta = 0. 143, p < 0. 010). Other purposes of the referral had no impact on their experiences. Patients' expectations regarding the referrals mostly referred to diagnosis, including increased diagnostic certainty (80 %), detailed information about the illness (66 %) and exclusion of serious illness (62 %). They were overall satisfied with the referral (83 %). Their experiences with the referral were more positive if the initiative for the referral came from the physician (beta = 0. 365, p < 0. 000).
