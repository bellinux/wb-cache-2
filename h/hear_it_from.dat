500|$|McEntire {{signed with}} MCA Nashville Records in 1984 and {{released}} her seventh studio album, Just a Little Love. Harold Shedd was originally the album's producer; however, McEntire rejected his suggestions towards country pop arrangements. It was instead produced by Norro Wilson, although the album {{still had a}} distinguishable country pop sound. Dissatisfied with the album's sound, she went to MCA president, Jimmy Bowen, who told McEntire to find material that was best-suited to her liking. Instead of finding new material, she found previously recorded country hits from her own record collection, which was then recorded for the album. The album's material included songs originally released as singles by Ray Price ("Don't You Believe Her", [...] "I Want to <b>Hear</b> <b>It</b> <b>from</b> You"), Carl Smith ("Before I Met You"), Faron Young ("He's Only Everything") and Connie Smith ("You've Got Me [...] ). The album spawned two number-one singles: [...] "How Blue" [...] and [...] "Somebody Should Leave". It was given positive reviews from critics, with Billboard praising McEntire as [...] "the finest woman country singer since Kitty Wells" [...] and Rolling Stone critics honoring her {{as one of their}} Top 5 favorite country artists. Upon its release, My Kind of Country became her highest-peaking album on the Top Country Albums chart, reaching No. 13. The album also included instruments such as a fiddle and pedal steel guitar, and was aimed more towards a traditional country sound. McEntire was later praised as a [...] "new traditionalist", along with Ricky Skaggs, George Strait, and Randy Travis. That year, she won the Country Music Association Awards' Female Vocalist of the Year, her first major industry award. The album was certified Gold.|$|E

However, the band looked at the show as a [...] "warm-up" [...] and the show at Los Angeles' Troubadour, July 29, 2006, was {{referred}} to as their [...] "first show to the public in 15 months" [...] by Ward. They played three songs off the upcoming album: [...] "Crawl", [...] "Weather The Storm", and the single [...] "Taking Back Control". At this show Ward also told the crowd about what happened when he left the band the previous year, saying he would rather have the crowd <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> him, than the press in the following months. Sparta played at Chicago's Lollapalooza festival the following week. The band toured the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe heavily after the release of the album with bands such as Lola Ray, Aloha, As Tall As Lions, Sound Team, Moneen, MeWithoutYou, Lovedrug, Straylight Run, Deftones and My Chemical Romance. On February 19, 2007, the band played a free concert with [...] in Las Vegas for the XPOZ Coalition, an anti-smoking organization.

2500|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether James Dean and Adams met before his {{service in the}} United States Coast Guard (1952–1955) and subsequent role in Rebel Without a Cause (1955). In his 1986 gossip book about gay Hollywood, Conversations with My Elders, Boze Hadleigh claimed actor Sal Mineo told him in 1972, [...] "I didn't <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> Jimmy (James Dean), who was sort of awesome to me when we did Rebel. But Nick told me they had a big affair." [...] Journalist, screenwriter and author of books about Hollywood, John Gregory Dunne wrote that [...] "James Dean was bisexual, as were Nick Adams and Sal Mineo." [...] In his book Elvis (1981) Albert Goldman wrote, [...] "Nick Adams ingratiated himself with James Dean precisely as he would do {{a year or so}} later with Elvis. He offered himself to the shy, emotionally contorted and rebellious Dean, as a friend, a guide, a boon companion, a homosexual lover -- whatever role or service Dean required." [...] According to Eric Braun, [...] "Elvis was attracted by Adams' outgoing personality and the young actors caused quite a stir, cruising round Los Angeles with Natalie Wood, Russ Tamblyn and others on their Hondas." [...] In 2005, Byron Raphael and Presley biographer Alanna Nash wrote that Adams may have [...] "swung both ways" [...] like [...] "Adams' good pal (and Elvis' idol) James Dean. Tongues wagged that Elvis and Adams were getting it on." ...|$|E

Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: [...] "The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." [...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them to <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His offense {{has nothing to do with}} low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have told you the whole story." ...|$|E
