50|$|In Neotropical {{gardens and}} parks, their nectar is popular with many hummingbirds, {{such as the}} black-throated mango (Anthracothorax nigricollis), the black jacobin (Florisuga fusca), or the <b>gilded</b> <b>hummingbird</b> (Hylocharis chrysura). The wood of the tree is soft and is used for nesting by many hole-building birds such as barbets.|$|E
50|$|The gilded {{sapphire}} (Hylocharis chrysura), {{also known}} as the <b>gilded</b> <b>hummingbird,</b> is a species of hummingbird in the Trochilidae family. It is found {{in a wide range of}} open and semi-open habitats in southern Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and northern Argentina. It is generally common, and therefore considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International and consequently the IUCN. It is overall greenish-golden with a coppery tail, whitish-buff underparts, a rufous chin, and a slightly decurved, black-tipped red bill.|$|E
50|$|The food of {{this species}} is nectar, often taken from the flowers of large trees. This hummingbird is also notably insectivorous, often {{hovering}} in open areas to catch flying insects. It appears to be somewhat picky regarding favorite foodplants and often does not visit ornamental plants popular with many other hummingbirds, such as Erythrina speciosa or Stifftia chrysantha; certain ornamental Bignoniaceae like the fountain tree (Spathodea campanulata) seem more to this bird's liking. While feeding, {{it has been observed}} to dominate over a glittering-bellied emerald (Chlorostilbon lucidus) and to be displaced by a <b>gilded</b> <b>hummingbird,</b> both considerably smaller species.|$|E
