5|$|The Student Residence {{supports}} several cultural projects {{developed by}} voluntary and worker students {{and open to}} the participation of internal and external community. It encourages interdisciplinary training and integration between the resident students and the external community. The diversity of races and cultures, brought by colleagues from other states and countries <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> for the residents who live in the house, facilitating full citizenship, through the exercise of their rights and duties within the community.|$|E
5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator. All the birds in the groups will be vigilant in looking for a predator because there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> to seeing the predator first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the birds will fly up into the trees. It was found the birds did not however give this signal {{when there was a}} snake.|$|E
5|$|SkyDome (Rogers Centre since 2004) has {{provided}} the Argonauts a marquee venue since 1989, but also been criticized for its football sightlines and atmosphere. Even crowds of about 30,000 can look sparse in a stadium that seats up to 50,000 people. The domed environment does, at least, remove the elements and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> to passers and comfortable for fans. Two critical opportunities {{to find a new}} home were missed in 2004 and 2005: plans for a revamped Varsity Stadium to accommodate CFL-sized crowds were thwarted by community opposition in 2004, and the Argonauts withdrew from an alternate plan at York University the following year.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E
5|$|A pony-sized Finnhorse must measure no {{more than}} 148cm (14.2-1/2 hands, 58-1/2inches) at the withers or the croup. Both sexes are also {{required}} to pass either a drivability or a ridability test. The horse's pedigree is also evaluated, and uncharacteristically small individuals descending from larger-sized lines are not accepted. The horse should be proportionately small all over, and express all the qualities of a full-size Finnhorse. Especially thorough {{attention is paid to}} the pony-sized horse's character, obedience and cooperation. The pony-sized Finnhorse is suited to practically any use the larger Finnhorse is, with the exception of heavy draught work because of its smaller size and proportionally reduced strength. However, some individuals have been able to compete with and even win against full-size Finnhorses in work horse competitions. Many pony-sized individuals are cross-registered for trotter section breeding, as small Finnhorses can be equal competitors in harness against larger ones. In combined driving, the pony-sized Finnhorse's size <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage,</b> allowing for greater agility. The section is popular for therapy and riding school use.|$|E
5|$|Optimum {{growth of}} E. coli occurs at 37°C (98.6°F), but some {{laboratory}} strains can multiply at temperatures up to 49°C (120°F). E. coli {{grows in a}} variety of defined laboratory media, such as lysogeny broth, or any medium that contains glucose, ammonium phosphate, monobasic, sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium phosphate, dibasic, and water. Growth can be driven by aerobic or anaerobic respiration, using a large variety of redox pairs, including the oxidation of pyruvic acid, formic acid, hydrogen, and amino acids, and the reduction of substrates such as oxygen, nitrate, fumarate, dimethyl sulfoxide, and trimethylamine N-oxide. E. coli is classified as a facultative anaerobe. It uses oxygen when it is present and available. It can, however, continue to grow in the absence of oxygen using fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The ability to continue growing in the absence of oxygen <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> to bacteria because their survival is increased in environments where water predominates.|$|E

25|$|The {{chain speed}} is {{specified}} in the manual for a chainsaw. Higher class trousers are more expensive, hotter, and heavier, so there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> to choosing the trousers to match the saw.|$|E
25|$|The low {{thickness}} of geosynthetics, {{as compared to}} their natural soil counterparts, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> insofar as light weight on the subgrade, less airspace used, and avoidance of quarried sand, gravel, and clay soil materials.|$|E

25|$|Politicians and {{businesses}} want the most knowledgeable and well-connected individuals working for them, which keeps {{the pool of}} potential hires quite small. The most influential lobbying strategy– access– <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> of the corporate media lobby.|$|E
25|$|CD-R discs (CD-Rs) are {{readable}} by most plain CD readers, i.e., CD readers manufactured {{prior to}} the introduction of CD-R. This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> over CD-RW, which can be re-written but cannot be played on many plain CD readers.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, such as Chile, {{the midwife}} is the {{professional}} who can direct {{neonatal intensive care}} units.

30|$|The Trilogis-Monsenso {{wristband}} (Nokia Health): The {{design of}} the wristband was generally evaluated low from the patients. Some patients only wore it at night because of the design.

25|$|Tax efficiency: ETFs {{generally}} generate {{relatively low}} capital gains, because they typically have low turnover of their portfolio securities. While this <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> they share with other index funds, their tax efficiency is further enhanced {{because they do}} not have to sell securities to meet investor redemptions.|$|E
25|$|The {{dielectric}} constant of uranium dioxide is about 22, {{which is almost}} {{twice as high as}} of silicon (11.2) and GaAs (14.1). This <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> over Si and GaAs in construction of integrated circuits, as it may allow higher density integration with higher breakdown voltages and with lower susceptibility to the CMOS tunneling breakdown.|$|E
25|$|Some {{challenges}} of community-based program design are the limited availability of resources, propensity for {{high levels of}} staff turnover, the reliance upon unpaid volunteers, participant retention, and the evaluation of a dynamic task environment. For the same reasons that sustainability <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> of this approach, utilizing limited available resources is a challenge. Based on free market principals and resource scarcity, programs often operate below pareto efficiency.|$|E

25|$|Only a few {{animals are}} known to have {{specialised}} in soaring: the larger of the extinct pterosaurs, and some large birds. Powered flight is very energetically expensive for large animals, but for soaring their size <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage,</b> as it allows them a low wing loading, that is a large wing areas relative to their weight, which maximizes lift. Soaring is very energetically efficient.|$|E
25|$|Operations {{are mostly}} {{targeted}} at cruise ship tourists visiting Bergen. The {{proximity to the}} cruise ship port <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> for Fonnafly. However, the airport {{is located in a}} mixed commercial and residential area and there is a high degree of noise pollution impact due to this. Fonnafly operates about 250 annual aircraft movements at the water airport and 450 for the heliport. However, the concession permits 900 and 800, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{aldosterone}} {{production is}} also affected to one extent or another by nervous control, which integrates the inverse of carotid artery pressure, pain, posture, and probably emotion (anxiety, fear, and hostility) (including surgical stress). Anxiety increases aldosterone, {{which must have}} evolved {{because of the time}} delay involved in migration of aldosterone into the cell nucleus. Thus, there <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>advantage</b> to an animal's anticipating a future need from interaction with a predator, since too high a serum content of potassium has very adverse effects on nervous transmission.|$|E
