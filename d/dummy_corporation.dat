When a couple of con artists arrive in Smallville promoting miracle cures created by the meteor rocks, Lex becomes interested in what they are really after, as he believes their plans could hinder the research he is doing on the meteor rocks. After Jacobi and Wolfe's con is realized, Lex uses a <b>dummy</b> <b>corporation</b> to steal all of the meteor rocks Jacobi's Ascendence Foundation has collected.

5|$|In December 2009, Tucker is {{introduced}} as J.T. Hellstrom’s (Thad Luckinbill) employer, while pursuing a business deal with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and beginning {{an affair with}} Jill Abbott (Jess Walton). Tucker secretly gains control of Katherine’s company, Chancellor Industries, after she buys stock in a <b>dummy</b> <b>corporation</b> and at a shareholders' meeting, Tucker reveals that he is Kay's long-lost son, and he was behind a woman named Jojo Glover pretending to be her daughter. After years of planning, Tucker had finally gotten his revenge on Katherine for giving him away and he begins slowly dismantling Chancellor Industries by selling its subsidiaries. Meanwhile, Katherine's other son, Brock Reynolds (Beau Kazer) advises Tucker {{to get to know}} their mother, but Katherine refuses to accept him, and Tucker is hurt. He hires Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) and plans to sell off Chancellor Industries piece by piece, including Jabot Cosmetics. Adam’s father Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) wins Jabot in a bidding war; Tucker refuses to hire Jill at Chancellor Industries. Katherine threatens to reveal Tucker's bribing of Alexander Thomas until she begins feeling guilty and backs off; an impressed Tucker puts a hold on the selling of her company. While Katherine and Tucker bond, he asks about his father, Arthur Hendricks (David Hedison), while Jill finds the information on Tucker and runs it in Restless Style magazine. Tucker and Katherine come to an agreement where she gets 51% of Chancellor Industries, but Tucker mistakenly believes Jill and Katherine were working together, and he promises to dismantle the company before their agreement comes into effect. Thanks to Jill, Tucker is investigated by the SEC while he bonds with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), who is struggling with letting go of the child she thought was her daughter. Tucker supports her, much to the dismay of her boyfriend, Neil Winters (Kristoff St. John), while he announces his plans to purchase Jabot for himself. Tucker blackmails Katherine into giving him back control of Jabot in exchange for him keeping quiet about Adam giving Victor access to the bids and he offers Ashley the CEO position.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dummy</b> <b>{{corporation}}s</b> may {{be created}} to avoid tax through disguising the true profits of a corporation {{through the use}} of tax havens. The use of tax havens are particularly popular in the British Virgin Islands and many <b>dummy</b> <b>corporations</b> are created on the islands as a way to evade taxes. After a treaty enabling the islands to enjoy favourable tax treatment was terminated by the United States under the Reagan administration, the growth of the number of <b>dummy</b> <b>corporations</b> [...] "exceeded beyond our wildest imaginations", according to the Financial Secretary Robert A. Mathavious. Although the tax havens itself are not illegal, the avoidance of taxation through the vehicle of tax havens are inherently illegal.|$|R

25|$|The Dirty War {{likewise}} {{served as}} cover for numerous ransom kidnappings, which continued {{even after the}} return of democracy in 1983 at {{the hand of a}} number of the same officers. The Director of Battalion 601, the Army Intelligence unit where most of these ransom kidnappings originated, was the hard-line General Guillermo Suárez Mason. His appointment as head of YPF of in 1981 was followed by a period of severe mismanagement at the state oil concern. He installed many of his hard-line Army Intelligence colleagues in managerial posts, and they in turn diverted large quantities of fuel into the director's newly established company Sol Petróleo – a <b>dummy</b> <b>corporation</b> used by Suárez Mason and his appointees for embezzlement as well as to divert funds to the Contras and the fascist organization P2 (to which Suárez Mason belonged). YPF debts thus rose 142-fold during Suárez Mason's tenure, {{at the end of which}} in 1983 the company recorded a US$6 billion loss.|$|E
500|$|Rififi was {{a popular}} success in France which led to several other Rififi films based on le Breton's stories. These films include Du rififi chez les femmes (1959), Du rififi à Tokyo (1961), and Du rififi à Paname (1965). On its United Kingdom release, Rififi was paired with the British science fiction film The Quatermass Xperiment as a double bill; this went on {{to be the most}} {{successful}} double-bill release in UK cinemas in all of 1955. The film was offered distribution in the United States on the condition that Dassin renounce his past, declaring that he was duped into subversive associations. Otherwise, his name would be removed from the film as the writer and director. Dassin refused and the film was released by United Artists who set up a <b>dummy</b> <b>corporation</b> as the distributing company. The film was distributed successfully in America with Dassin listed in the credits; in this way {{he was the first to}} break the Hollywood blacklist. Rififi was released in the United States first with subtitles and then later with an English dub under the title Rififi...Means Trouble!. The film caused controversy on its release from The Roman Catholic Legion of Decency. The film endured three brief cuts in it and opened with a title card quoting the Book of Proverbs stating [...] "When the wicked are multiplied, crime shall be multiplied: but the just shall see their downfall". After this change, the film passed with a B rating. In 2005, Variety announced that Stone Village Pictures had acquired the remake rights to Rififi, the producers intending to place the film in a modern setting with Al Pacino taking the lead role.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I, the German {{armed forces}} became subject to the {{restrictions}} of the Treaty of Versailles.

2500|$|He speculated {{with his}} {{personal}} funds and, especially, {{with the money}} of the corporations he controlled. The preceding statement should be seen {{in light of the}} fact that Kreuger treated most of his companies as if they were exclusively his personal property. He frequently transferred funds from one corporation to another with little or no formality. A number of <b>dummy</b> <b>corporations</b> and holding companies [...] (e.g. Garanta and Continental Investment Corporation) helped him to hide what he was doing. He also used others as front men to conceal his actions, e.g. when he acquired almost half of the outstanding shares of Diamond Match Company so as not to raise anti-trust concerns in the USA. Towards the end, in 1932, when he frantically gambled with the securities of corporations he controlled in the vain attempt to reverse their falling prices, he played the markets himself and had friends help him in the effort to prop up share prices. Between the end of February and early March 1932 he needed to make over $10 million (equivalent to more than $150 million in today's money) for payments, including Kreuger & Toll dividends.|$|R

Although Carl has repaid them, the vengeful gangsters want [...] "interest, compounded in blood" [...] and plan to use the information to have him killed. They send a hitman, who would later become the Joker, to kill Carl. Andrea encounters him as he leaves her villa, and discovers her murdered father only seconds afterward.|$|R
