5|$|Cameron, Hadfield {{and other}} {{available}} crew members also {{spent the morning}} answering questions posed by Canadian reporters located in Montreal and Toronto. Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency astronaut, was the fourth Canadian astronaut to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shuttle.|$|E

5|$|Pilots {{noted that}} in a crosswind, {{the nose of the}} plane would not point {{directly}} at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, to compensate for the wind. Since making the beams bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> curving approach path which keeps the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind.|$|E

50|$|Studied {{with the}} Saturn A-1 in 1959, the Saturn A-2 was deemed more {{powerful}} than the Saturn I rocket, consisting of a first stage, which actually <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Saturn IB, a second stage which contains four S-3 engines that <b>flew</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Jupiter IRBM and a Centaur high-energy liquid-fueled third stage.|$|R
5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles from beyond visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability {{at the expense of}} top speed.|$|E
5|$|Pattle {{had flown}} several patrols {{that morning and}} was {{suffering}} from a high temperature and fever. He had downed a Ju 88 and two Bf 109s on a morning interception to interdict German air operations. One of his victims, a Bf 109 from III./JG 77 crash-landed at Larissa. His success took Pattle's total from 47 to 49. At 17:00 in the afternoon, another raid approached. He was seen, just before an air raid alarm, in the mess, lying on a couch, shivering under the blankets. He was detailed to take a patrol over the lines but during the mission briefing, around 100 German bombers with fighter escort attacked the capital, seeking to attack Allied shipping in the harbour. He ran for the door towards a Hurricane. His adjutant, George Rumsey, tried to stop him, but Pattle was determined to <b>fly.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> way to his fighter, he narrowly avoided being killed in a strafing attack by a low-flying Bf 110. He took to the skies minutes later. Pattle climbed to gain altitude and headed for Piraeus Harbour at 20,000 feet.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness {{as if she was}} flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt it was fun to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> harness, but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E

25|$|As {{the shuttle}} program {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 1980s, NASA began a Space Flight Participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly. Christa McAuliffe {{was chosen as the}} first Teacher in Space in July 1985 from 11,400 applicants. 1,700 applied for the Journalist in Space program. An Artist in Space program was considered, and NASA expected that after McAuliffe's flight two to three civilians a year would <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shuttle. After McAuliffe was killed in the Challenger disaster in January 1986, the programs were canceled. McAuliffe's backup, Barbara Morgan, eventually got hired in 1998 as a professional astronaut and flew on STS-118 as a mission specialist. A second journalist-in-space program, in which NASA green-lighted Miles O'Brien to <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> space shuttle, was scheduled to be announced in 2003. That program was canceled {{in the wake of the}} Columbia disaster on STS-107 and subsequent emphasis on finishing the International Space Station before retiring the space shuttle.|$|E

25|$|ANA {{surveyed}} 800 {{passengers who}} flew the 787 from Tokyo to Frankfurt: expectations were surpassed for 90% of passengers; features that met or exceeded expectations included air quality and cabin pressure (90% of passengers), cabin ambiance (92% of passengers), higher cabin humidity levels (80% of passengers), headroom (40% of passengers) {{and the larger}} windows (90% of passengers). 25% said they would {{go out of their}} way to again <b>fly</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 787.|$|E
25|$|The US {{space shuttle}} program {{included}} payload specialist positions which were usually filled {{by representatives of}} companies or institutions managing a specific payload on that mission.
