40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To locate {{fibronectin}} ultrastructurally in {{the most}} superficial layer of normal articular cartilage of rabbits, in order to clarify its role in joint physiology. METHODS [...] Articular cartilage {{was obtained from the}} femoral condyle of seven normal adult rabbits and prepared by a method that included tannic acid fixation. Polyclonal antibodies against rabbit fibronectin were used in an immunohistochemical electron microscopic study, without any enzymic digestion but with a pre-embedding method for the transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS [...] The cartilage surface was successfully preserved by tannic acid fixation. The most superficial layer in <b>electron</b> <b>photomicrographs</b> was approximately 200 - 300 nm thick, cell free, and appeared to have two parallel components: the more superficial lamina and the deeper lamina. Gold labelled fibronectin lined this layer in immunohistochemical <b>electron</b> <b>photomicrographs.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Fibronectin covering the surface of the articular cartilage may have a role in joint lubrication and protection of the cartilage by binding with the collagenous matrix and hyaluronic acid in synovial fluid.

Knowing that microvascular maturation (transformation of double- to single-layered capillary networks in alveolar septa) and septal thinning prevent further alveolarization, we measured septal maturation on <b>electron</b> <b>photomicrographs</b> in treated and control animals. In treated rats and before day 10, we observed a premature nonreversing microvascular maturation and a transient septal thinning, which both appeared focally. In vascular casts of both groups, we observed contacts between the two capillary layers of immature alveolar septa, which were predictive for capillary fusions. Studying serial electron microscopic sections of human lungs, we were able to confirm the postulated fusion process for the first time. We conclude that alveolar microvascular maturation indeed occurs by capillary fusion and that the dexamethasone-induced impairment of alveolarization is associated with focal premature capillary fusion.

The holes were first demonstrated directly on <b>electron</b> <b>photomicrographs</b> by Dourmashkin and Humphrey (3). When membranes of sheep red cells lysed by rabbit antibody and guinea pig complement were negatively stained, the holes were seen as distinctive defects filled with negative stain and scattered randomly over the red cell surface.
