5|$|Before {{developing}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{worked as}} a literature professor for the University of Chicago, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and DePauw University. He also delved into fiction writing, having developed a <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> it {{as a graduate student}} at the University of Arkansas. His first published work was the short story collection Between Here and the Yellow Sea, released in 2006. The author published his debut novel, titled Galveston, four years later, and around the same time began preparing to branch out into the television industry (earlier attempts were never realized due to lack of capital).|$|E
5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> {{the old country}} {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had begun in the 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E
5|$|The Great Wall of China visible today largely {{dates from}} the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often {{extending}} its line through challenging terrain. Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons, deconstructed for their building materials, or lost due to the ravages of time. For long an object of <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.|$|E
60|$|Presently, Freddie {{having given}} his shoes a flick with a silk {{handkerchief}} and thrust the latter carefully up his sleeve, they passed out {{and down into}} the main lobby of the hotel, where they parted--Freddie to his bit of breakfast; his father to potter about the streets and kill time until luncheon. London was always a trial to the Earl of Emsworth. His heart was {{in the country and}} the city held no <b>fascinations</b> <b>for</b> him.|$|R
60|$|He {{assured her}} that he didn't care {{what he did for}} her sake; and it was true. Forty-five is the age of {{recklessness}} for many men, as if in defiance of the decay and death waiting with open arms in the sinister valley {{at the bottom of the}} inevitable hill. Her shrinking form, her downcast eyes, when she had to listen to him, cornered at the end of an empty corridor, he regarded as signs of submission to the overpowering force of his will, the recognition of his personal <b>fascinations.</b> <b>For</b> every age is fed on illusions, lest men should renounce life early and the human race come to an end.|$|R
60|$|When breakfast was over, Ethelberta sat {{leaning on}} the window-sill {{considering}} her movements for the day. It was the time fixed for {{the meeting of the}} Imperial Association at Corvsgate Castle, the celebrated ruin five miles off, and the meeting had some <b>fascinations</b> <b>for</b> her. For one thing, she had never been present at a gathering of the kind, although what was left in any shape from the past was her constant interest, because it recalled her to herself and fortified her mind. Persons waging a harassing social fight are apt {{in the interest of the}} combat to forget the smallness of the end in view; and the hints that perishing historical remnants afforded her of the attenuating effects of time even upon great struggles corrected the apparent scale of her own. She was reminded that in a strife for such a ludicrously small object as the entry of drawing-rooms, winning, equally with losing, is below the zero of the true philosopher's concern.|$|R
5|$|Themes {{from these}} social {{investigations}} {{have been drawn}} out in fiction. Crime, poverty, vice, sexual transgression, drugs, class-conflict and multi-cultural encounters and fantasies involving Jewish, Chinese and Indian immigrants are major themes. Though the area has been productive of local writing talent, {{from the time of}} Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891) the idea of 'slumming it' in the 'forbidden' East End has held a <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> a coterie of the literati.|$|E
5|$|Tigers {{and their}} superlative qualities {{have been a}} source of <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> mankind since ancient times, and they are {{routinely}} visible as important cultural and media motifs. They are also considered one of the charismatic megafauna, and are used as the face of conservation campaigns worldwide. In a 2004 online poll conducted by cable television channel Animal Planet, involving more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries, the tiger was voted the world's favourite animal with 21% of the vote, narrowly beating the dog.|$|E
5|$|The main {{influence}} in fourteen-year-old Will Burrow's life is his father, Dr. Burrows, {{and together they}} share an interest in archaeology and a <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> the buried past. When Dr. Burrows begins to notice strange 'pallid men' where they live in Highfield, and then promptly goes missing, Will and his friend Chester go search for him. They discover a blocked passageway behind bookshelves in the cellar of the Burrows home and re-excavate it, finding the passage leads to a door set into the rock, and beyond the door is an old lift that takes them down to another set of doors. A cobblestone street lies beyond, lit by a row of orb-like street lamps; houses {{that appear to be}} carved out of the walls themselves flank the street.|$|E
50|$|The {{supporting}} characters, five in all, {{were split}} roughly along gender lines, with {{three men and}} two women. The women included Doris (Kathryn Rossetter), a middle-aged aficionado of romantic drama stories, and Becky (Laura Galusha) a girl in her early twenties who offered a young feminist perspective to the movies. The men included Jack (F. Richards Ford), Fitzy (Patrick Garner), and Chan (Philip Nee). Jack, {{as well as the}} being the love interest of Becky, was also Limekirk's newspaper reporter who was required to review the movies. Together with the middle-aged Fitzy, the two manifested the stereotypical male-oriented <b>fascinations</b> <b>for</b> lowbrow action, crude sexual innuendos, and took morbid pleasure in making fun of some of the movies' more macabre themes (such as nuclear warfare in the feature Rocket Attack U.S.A.).|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} hints of {{homosexual}} themes in Go Tell It on the Mountain, <b>for</b> example John's <b>fascination</b> and attraction <b>for</b> Elisha.|$|R

5|$|Tightrope (1984) had Eastwood {{starring}} opposite Geneviève Bujold in {{a provocative}} thriller, inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist. Set in New Orleans to avoid confusion with the Dirty Harry films, Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target's tortured psychology and <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> sadomasochism. Tightrope {{was a critical}} and commercial hit and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated film of 1984. Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy City Heat (1984) alongside Burt Reynolds, a film about a private eye and his partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the prohibition era of the 1930s. The film grossed around $50million domestically, but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop.|$|E
5|$|After the reclusive and bookish scholar Vasily Ordynov is {{compelled}} {{to leave his}} apartment he wanders aimlessly through Saint Petersburg, contemplating his despair over a loveless life, his childhood and his future. Through this distraction he finds himself within a church, where he notices an old man, Ilia Murin, with his young wife, Katerina. His <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> the couple, particularly Katerina, causes him to contrive further encounters, {{with the intention of}} securing a lodging at their home. He becomes their house guest. The gloomy Murin is a perceived Old Believer, with powers of clairvoyance that have perturbed his neighbours and the local police, and which appear to control his wife. Katerina implies that Murin was her mother's lover, that she might be Murin's biological daughter, and that the pair ran-off together after he killed her father. There is an unresolved suggestion that Murin caused the death of Katerina's fiancé during their escape.|$|E

6000|$|The noblest {{character}} {{in the book is}} Lord Aubrey. As he is not a genius he, naturally, behaves admirably on every occasion. He begins by pitying the neglected Lady Guilderoy, and ends by loving her, but he makes the great renunciation with considerable effect, and, having induced Lady Guilderoy to receive back her husband, he accepts 'a distant and arduous Viceroyalty.' He is Ouida's ideal of the true politician, for Ouida has apparently taken to the study of English politics. A great deal of her book is devoted to political disquisitions. She believes that the proper rulers of a country like ours are the aristocrats. Oligarchy has great <b>fascinations</b> <b>for</b> her. She thinks meanly of the people and adores the House of Lords and Lord Salisbury. Here are some of her views. We will not call them ideas: ...|$|R
40|$|Autism-spectrum {{disorders}} (ASDs) are a {{group of}} neurodevelopmental disorders that are becoming increasingly more prevalent. A diagnostic criterion for autism {{is the presence of}} restricted, repetitive behaviours (RRBs), one of which is the intense <b>fascinations</b> <b>for</b> virtually any topic: circumscribed interests (CIs). CIs have the potential to be used for motivational purposes. This study employed semi-structured interviews using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) with individuals with ASDs and their parents. In total, 11 families participated in this study, comprising 33 individuals (16 parents and 17 individuals with ASDs). This study found five themes: He's Very Unique; They Don't Realize that Not Everyone Lives and Thinks the Same Thing All the Time; We Couldn't even Pronounce the Names of These Dinosaurs, and Jason was Telling Us; You Can't Change Them, You Can Only Love Them; and So I Can Do My Job at the Same Time and Observe the Weather at the Same Time.

25|$|The name Pentangle {{was chosen}} to {{represent}} the {{five members of the}} band, and is also the device on Sir Gawain's shield in the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight which held a <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> Renbourn.|$|E
25|$|Alejandro Honda {{was born}} in San Martin Texmelucan in 1952. This painter’s works show his <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> Mesoamerica, which began when he was young. They can also have a sensual edge to them, even his {{religious}} paintings such as the María de Magdalena.|$|E
25|$|A growing <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> {{natural history}} and zoology, coupled with the {{tremendous}} expansion in the urbanization of London, led to a heightened demand for {{a greater variety of}} public forms of entertainment to be made available. The need for public entertainment, as well as the requirements of scholarly research, came together in the founding of the first modern zoos.|$|E

25|$|Another {{appeal of}} the railroads is the {{business}} side of railroading. Railroads were long central to economic growth and commerce, and still are to some extent.

25|$|His father {{bought him}} a drum set during his late teens when he left school and he learned these in his spare time, {{when he was not}} selling prams at Swift's Furniture store at Stanley Road, Liverpool.

60|$|Although the Dervishes were {{steadily}} advancing, {{a belief}} that their musketry was inferior encouraged a nearer view, and we trotted round the south-west slopes of Surgham Hill until we reached the sandhills on the enemy's side, among which the regiment had waited the day before. Thence the whole array was visible in minute detail. It seemed that every single man of all the thousands could be examined separately. The pace of their march was fast and steady, and {{it was evident that}} it would not be safe to wait long among the sandhills. Yet the wonder of the scene exercised a dangerous <b>fascination,</b> and <b>for</b> a while we tarried.|$|R
25|$|In 2000 {{an account}} of Williams's life and career {{appeared}} in the Swedish book Esther Williams — Skenbiografin (Esther Williams — The Fake Biography) written by Jane Magnusson, in which the author shares with readers her own <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> art swimming as a genre and, here, in particular, Williams as — to the author — both a bewildering and mesmerizing front figure and icon in this field.|$|E
25|$|Sophie Germain {{thought that}} if the {{geometry}} method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics, could hold such <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study. So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father's library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek so she could read works like those of Sir Isaac Newton and Leonhard Euler. She also enjoyed Traité d'Arithmétique by Étienne Bézout and Le Calcul Différentiel by Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin. Later, Cousin visited her in her house, encouraging her in her studies.|$|E
25|$|Carlo Gesualdo da Venosa (30 March 1566 – 8 September 1613) was Prince of Venosa and Count of Conza. As a {{musician}} {{he is best}} known for writing intensely expressive madrigals and pieces of sacred music that use a chromatic language not heard again until the late 19th century. He is also known for his cruelty and lewdness: the best known fact of his life is his gruesome killing of his first wife and her lover upon finding them in flagrante delicto. The <b>fascination</b> <b>for</b> his extraordinary music and for his shocking acts have gone hand in hand.|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} main {{objectives}} of the article. The first one is to outline the existence of Faust motif in the Czech culture, both popular and high. The second one is to present the book Doktor Faustus podle Gustava Schwaba vypravuje Fr. Táborský, which was edited in Prague in 1921. The illustrations by Josef Mánes enriched originally Schwab’s work, which persuaded the Czech editors to make the book available to Czech readers in the mentioned year. The third goal is to discuss Mánes’ illustrations {{as a kind of}} an interpretative reading, and not only the decorative pictures which should be regarded as being subordinated to the literary senses. This painting commentary, made by Mánes, introduced irony and such erotic motives which are absent in that literary world. Schwab’s book is presented as the example of narration that mixes the elements of popular version of the Faust myth with much more sophisticated, philosophical commentary formulated by the author. Thus, the funny and fantastic story about Faust, full of grotesque and fantasy elements, changes into a serious, moral treatise concerning predestination, sin, guilt and punishment. During the interwar period, Czech interest in Schwab’s book could resulted not only from the reason of Mánes’ illustrations, but also from the cultural tendencies of the time. I mean the <b>fascinations</b> <b>for</b> the popular form of circus-like magic, a sense of folk humor, a creative fantasy, which used to change a predictable world into a fairy tale. All those attractive qualities were characteristic for Schwab’s book...|$|R
