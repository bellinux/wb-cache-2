25|$|In June 2010, the Australian Competition Tribunal {{ruled that}} FMG would be granted access to Rio Tinto's Robe River line and BHP Billiton's Goldsworthy line {{but not to}} the busier Hamersley and Mount Newman lines. Treasurer Wayne Swan {{suggested}} that several advantages would accrue from access to the rail lines by third parties. It would increase competition, reduce duplication of infrastructure, and reduce environmental damage. Atlas Iron, another junior iron ore miner, <b>is</b> <b>hopeful</b> {{to come to terms with}} BHP Billiton in regards to using some of the company's rail infrastructure, the Goldsworthy railway, in the future.

25|$|Lavdas et al. (2006) {{investigated}} whether sustained {{expression of}} PSA on Schwann cells enhances their migration. Schwann cells were tranduced with a retroviral vector encoding STX {{in order to}} induce PSA expression. PSA-expressing Schwann cells did obtain enhanced motility as demonstrated in a gap bridging assay and after grafting in postnatal forebrain slice cultures. PSA expression did not alter molecular and morphological differentiation. The PSA-expressing Schwann cells were able to myelinate CNS axons in cerebellar slices, which is not normally possible in vivo. It <b>is</b> <b>hopeful</b> that these PSA-expressing Schwann cells {{will be able to}} migrate throughout the CNS without loss of myelinating abilities and may become useful for regeneration and myelination of axons in the central nervous system.|$|E

Although Icke regards Christian patriots as the only Americans who understand the New World Order, he also told a Christian patriot group: [...] "I don't know which I dislike more, the world controlled by the Brotherhood, or the one you want to replace it with". James Ward argues that Icke's underlying message <b>is</b> <b>hopeful,</b> and that therein lies his appeal: as Icke said at Wembley in 2012, [...] "If we want a world of love and peace, {{we have to be}} loving and peaceful with everyone, even people we don't like." ...|$|E

500|$|Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun {{assessed}} {{that her}} phobia is [...] "comical" [...] and that Emma's initial {{role in the}} series is comic relief. Mays has explained that [...] "the character is not a stereotypical TV-style husband-stealer who immediately would be luring the dude into the sack, but rather seems like a real person facing real issues." [...] Mays added: [...] "This is something that’s part {{of a lot of}} people’s lives. But Emma is not a cheater. They’ve portrayed her as being somewhat virginal. There’s purity there. She doesn’t just hone in [...] and say, ‘I want to destroy this guy’s relationship.' So Emma <b>is</b> <b>hopeful</b> and sad at the same time. Funny, too. Sounds like real life, where, as stated earlier, you can’t help who you love." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News described her as [...] "good-hearted and smart.

Bawinkel stated {{in an interview that}} [...] "a bunch of the tunes cover what we wanted to say to them during those times [...]" [...] Michael Weaver, writing for Jesus Freak Hideout, interpreted the song as an attempt to convince this individual to turn his or her life around and return to the Christian faith. The next track, named [...] "The Rich, The Strong and The Poor", tells the story of three men looking for happiness. The first tries to find it in money, but he returns unfulfilled. The second tries looking for happiness in physical strength. He believes that if he proves himself, that he will find peace. Like the first man, he ends up unfulfilled. The final man looks for happiness in basic life needs and likewise ends up in the same position as the first two men. Bawinkel explains that, [...] "all three are very much in the same position in that happiness hasn’t been found in chasing these various desires. There is something more which <b>is</b> <b>hopeful</b> for some and frustrating for others." ...|$|E

It was confirmed that Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, who are producing the Uncharted film, will be producing the movie via Atlas Entertainment. In early 2013, s Game Director, Todd Papy, {{said he did not}} know the status of the film. The writer behind the God of War video games, Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: [...] "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words. So I think it will be hard to get that across," [...] but she <b>is</b> <b>hopeful</b> that it can be done.

His rural idyll is shattered when CIA agent Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer) extradites Jack and Gwen to America—believing {{them to be}} connected to a phenomenon where humans can no longer die—whilst forcing Rhys to stay in Wales. With the aid of computer expert Esther Drummond (Alexa Havins), Gwen is able to establish communications with Rhys in the episode [...] "Dead of Night". Whilst on a mission in Los Angeles, Gwen asks Rhys to remove her father Geraint (William Thomas) from a hospital which she believes to be unsafe. Rhys subsequently has Geraint sent to an [...] "overflow camp", unaware that it contains a facility for burning the severely injured alive, and [...] in [...] "The Categories of Life" [...] and [...] "The Middle Men" [...] has to go undercover to help rescue his father-in-law. After escaping from the facility with Geraint, Rhys is briefly held hostage in an attempt to force Gwen to surrender Jack Harkness, but is rescued by Andy and his team. In [...] "The Gathering", Rhys figures out the antipodal connection between Buenos Aires and Shanghai, which directs the Torchwood team to their final mission. Because of Rhys' violent disposition towards murderer-paedophile Oswald Danes (Bill Pullman), Gwen fears that he may enact vigilante justice and so takes the latter to Shanghai to protect her husband. In the series finale, Rhys gains entry to the overflow camp where Geraint has been recaptured in order to sit by his side as [...] "Miracle Day" [...] ends and death is restored. After Esther's funeral, he <b>is</b> <b>hopeful</b> that Jack will not reform Torchwood.|$|E

2500|$|As Body Farm {{research}} {{continues to}} evolve, [...] the {{researchers at the}} Anthropological Research Facility continue to identify new methods to calculate the postmortem interval, body identification, and any other variables that might aid criminal investigations. Time of death in a homicide case {{can make the difference}} between bringing criminals to justice and a cold case. Therefore, this has been the main focus of the Body Farm since it was opened. With the progression of research, [...] Bass <b>is</b> <b>hopeful</b> that in the future, entomologists will be able to declare time of death within a half-day. What makes this a difficult task to accomplish is that every minute that passes after death, the range of time they can correctly estimate time of death is broadened dramatically. The Body Farm's success over the past 36 years is directly responsible for a vast amount of the overwhelming progress in narrowing that range. When asked about the growth of the Body Farm in the future, [...] Bass insinuated that the Body Farm is too small right now and a higher percentage of land area that has not been contaminated by other burials is needed for future achievements. [...] Bass has proposed the need for more territory to the University of Tennessee, and the university has granted the ARF at least [...] in addition the original [...] lot.|$|E
