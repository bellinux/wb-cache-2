50|$|During the 1980s (1987), Sako {{started using}} the AI/AII/AV designations (previously used for models {{imported}} to the US) {{for the three}} action lengths in Europe. The complete rifles were still designated L461/L579/L61. The bolt was given a slight cosmetic makeover, with the <b>hammer</b> <b>covered</b> by a conical shell.

The instrument has five notes; each note has six strings (three are tuned to the fundamental pitch, and three an octave higher). The strings are struck by large <b>hammers,</b> <b>covered</b> with cotton-wool, which the performer sets in motion by a strong elastic blow from his or her fist, similar to the motion of playing a carillon.|$|R

500|$|Upon its release, Unreal Tournament {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, earning {{an overall}} score of 92 out of 100 on aggregate review website Metacritic. Mainstream press reviews lauded the title for its graphics, gameplay, and level design. Computer and Video Games concluded [...] "Unreal Tournament {{is nothing short}} of a technical and game-playing marvel destined to hold you - as it did us - wailing with happiness and wasting far too many precious <b>hours</b> <b>hammering</b> keyboards. An absolute joy to behold." [...] In March 2000, Unreal Tournament was second on a list of best-selling games in Computer Dealer News trade magazine. However, the development team believed sales would have been higher if the game was released in October 1999.|$|R
50|$|On January 2, 1993, Van Hammer lost to Tony Atlas in {{the quarterfinals}} of a tournament for the vacant United States Heavyweight Championship on Saturday Night. A day later he lost to World Heavyweight Champion Big Van Vader {{on a house}} show in Bristol, TN, after which he took time off to have surgery to repair the broken nose {{that he had been}} wrestling with, causing him to miss the Thunderdome match at the Clash of the Champions on January 13.

5000|$|On January 14, 2009 DeVault {{entered the}} master bedroom that she and Harrell shared, and struck Harrell {{several times in the}} head while he was sleeping. Harrell {{received}} multiple skull fractures and was taken to the hospital. DeVault initially claimed that Harrell was beaten by an unknown assailant who had broken into the home. She later confessed that she had beaten Harrell as an act of self-defense and alleged that Harrell was physically and sexually abusive. DeVault was arrested the same night on charges of aggravated assault and was held at a local jail, but was later released on bail. Officers noted that DeVault had reddened marks upon her neck and that they had found a <b>hammer</b> <b>covered</b> with blood at the crime scene.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate effectiveness of surface coating repairs after 20 years since their application on façade panels of two existing concrete buildings. The repairs involved coatings and electrochemical treatment systems comprising Silane and Siloxane (S/S), Amino Alcohol Corrosion Inhibitor (AACI), acrylic coating, and re-alkalisation (Re-Alk). Altogether, 11 selected façade panels were evaluated in this study. The field investigations comprised visual survey, non-destructive tests (NDT) for compressive strength using Schmidt <b>hammer,</b> <b>cover</b> depth, reinforcement bar size, Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity Test (UPV), Torrent permeability. Limited carbonation depth tests were also conducted on selected panels. It was found that, UPV and permeability values indicated poor or very poor concrete quality in the repaired panels except for those repaired using acrylic coatings, which showed retention of good concrete quality. AACI coatings with or without S/S gave similar performance as control, implying no significantly improved protection by these repair materials...|$|R

25|$|Orangutans (genus Pongo) {{were first}} {{observed}} using {{tools in the}} wild in 1994 in {{the northwest corner of}} Sumatra. As with the chimpanzees, orangutans use tools made from branches and leaves to scratch, scrape, wipe, sponge, swat, fan, hook, probe, scoop, pry, chisel, <b>hammer,</b> <b>cover,</b> cushion and amplify. They will break off a tree branch that is about 30cm long, snap off the twigs, fray one end and then use the stick to dig in tree holes for termites. Sumatran orangutans use a variety of tools—up to 54 types for extracting insects or honey, and as many as 20 types for opening or preparing fruits such as the hard to access Neesia Malayana. They also use an 'autoerotic tool'—a stick which they use to stimulate the genitals and masturbate (both male and female). In parts of Borneo, orangutans use handfuls of leaves as napkins to wipe their chins while orangutans in parts of Sumatra use leaves as gloves, helping them handle spiny fruits and branches, or as seat cushions in spiny trees. There have been reports that individuals in both captivity and in the wild use tools held between the lips or teeth, rather than in the hands. In captivity, orangutans have been taught to chip stone handaxes.|$|R

25|$|Certain revolvers, called double-action-only (DAO) or, more {{correctly}} {{but less}} commonly, self-cocking, lack the latch {{that enables the}} hammer to be locked to the rear, and thus can only be fired in the double-action mode. With no way to lock the hammer back, DAO designs tend to have bobbed or spurless hammers, and may even have the <b>hammer</b> completely <b>covered</b> by the revolver's frame (i.e., shrouded or hooded). These are generally intended for concealed carrying, where a hammer spur could snag when the revolver is drawn. The potential reduction in accuracy in aimed fire is offset by the increased capability for concealment.|$|R

5000|$|This pistol was {{actually}} fired by action of a hammer striking and driving a firing pin into a center-fire cartridge's primer. The <b>hammer</b> was <b>covered</b> by {{the rear of}} the slide. The [...] "hammerless" [...] designation was merely an advertising designation pointing out the pistol's particular suitability for concealed carry. Special features include a serrated slide to prevent slippage during manual cycling of the slide, and two safety mechanisms (a grip safety and a manual safety). The grip safety is a spring-loaded piece making up the back strap of the pistol. The grip safety, though not solely restricted to them, was a typical feature of Colt automatic pistols. A magazine safety was added on later models; this feature prevents the pistol from being fired with a round in the chamber and the magazine removed.|$|R
6000|$|By {{night it}} was clearer, and Maybole more visible than during the day. Clouds coursed over the sky in great masses; the full moon battled the other way, and lit up the snow with gleams of flying silver; the town came down the hill in a cascade of brown gables, bestridden by smooth white roofs, and {{spangled}} here and there with lighted windows. At either end the snow stood {{high up in the}} darkness, on the peak of the Tolbooth and among the chimneys of the Castle. As the moon flashed a bull's-eye glitter across the town between the racing clouds, the white roofs leaped into relief over the gables and the chimney-stacks, and their shadows over the white roofs. In the town itself the lit face of the clock peered down the street; an <b>hour</b> was <b>hammered</b> out on Mr. Geli's bell, and from behind the red curtains of a public-house some one trolled out--a compatriot of Burns, again!--"The saut tear blin's my e'e." ...|$|R

40|$|What is Blaxploitation? In {{the early}} 1970 s {{a type of}} film emerged that {{featured}} all-black casts, really cool soul, R 'n' B and disco music soundtracks, characters sporting big guns, big dashikis, and even bigger 'fros, and {{had some of the}} meanest, baddest attitudes to shoot their way across our screens. More than that, for African-American audiences these films were an antidote to the sanitised 'safe' images of blackness that Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby presented to America. These films depicted a reality about the world which African-American audiences could identify with, even if the stories themselves were pure fantasy.

2500|$|Further {{extensions}} to the South Dock {{were opened}} in 1907 and 1914. The Newport Docks Disaster occurred on 2 July 1909 when, during {{construction of the}} new south lock connecting the South Dock to the Severn Estuary, supporting timbers in an excavation trench collapsed and buried 46 workers. The rescuers included 12-year-old paper boy Thomas ‘Toya’ Lewis who was small enough to crawl into the collapsed trench. Lewis worked for two <b>hours</b> with <b>hammer</b> and chisel in an attempt to free one of those trapped who was released the next day. Several hundred pounds was later raised through public subscription in gratitude for the boy's efforts, and he was sent on an engineering scholarship to Scotland. Lewis was awarded the Albert Medal for Lifesaving by King Edward VII in December 1909. A Wetherspoons pub in the city centre is named [...] "The Tom Toya Lewis" [...] after the young hero. The building in which the pub is housed was formerly the Newport YMCA, the Foundation Stone for which was laid by Viscount Tredegar, also in 1909.|$|R

I was sitting there watching a band playing 70s disco covers. They blasted into 'Rasputin,' and I realised that it would fit perfectly for Turisas."

[...] Slant Magazine's Cole Mathews thought that the song returned West to his hard rap origins, commenting [...] "with the posse cuts 'Monster' and 'So Appalled', Kanye kicks out the two hardest rap tracks of his career." [...] Becky Bain of Idolater described the song as a [...] "dramatic, gloomy epic of a tune that has each artist taking turns at the mic." [...] He expressed that trying to find Kanye's verse was [...] "virtually a musical Where's Waldo". It was noted for its impressive roster of features and was described as [...] "another Kanye West-helmed all-star collabo" [...] by MTV's Hawuse Ziegbe. He noted that Cyhi managed to hold his own against several much more regarded rappers. Embling of Tiny Mix Tapes described the song as a super-sized cypher, stating that the track was packed with plenty of [...] "shitalking" [...] from the group of rappers.|$|R
50|$|After rolling, {{the ribbon}} of gold is cut into one-inch squares. The {{first step in}} the beating process is called the cutch. The cutch is made up of {{approximately}} 150 skins. In {{the early days of the}} trade, ox intestine membrane (Goldbeater's skin) was used to interleave the gold as it was beaten. Today other materials, such as Mylar, are used. Using wooden pincers, the preparer picks up each square of gold and places it in the center of each skin. When the cutch is filled with the small gold squares, it is wrapped in several bands of parchment which serve to hold the packet together during the beating. Parchment is still the best material known to withstand the <b>hours</b> of repeated <b>hammer</b> blows needed to beat the gold.|$|R
