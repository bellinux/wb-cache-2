There was a smaller interval between the waves, which seemed to become steeper and less regular. They curled over and broke about the boat with a sound that reacted unpleasantly upon Frank's nerves, and he was thankful that he could, after all, see very little of them. The sloop's motion also changed. One moment she seemed to be moving almost slowly, and the next she swung up in a quick, savage rush, with her bows in the air and the white foam boiling high about her. Sometimes, too, there was a thud and a splash astern, and the decks were swept by a deluge of seething water.|$|E

The hulk steered wildly, and if the sea got worse, he doubted if they could hold her. He knew where he was, because he had steamed along the coast on board the cattle boat. The Anglesey shore was fringed by reefs, the tide-races ran in white turmoil across the ledges.

Off the coast of Makurazaki, the current to the east had the maximum speed of about 1 knot near the time of low water in the neap tide but its direction reversed to the west-southwest before the spring tide. Off the coastal area between Bono Misaki and Noma Misaki, there were offshore currents at the early period of <b>flood</b> <b>stream</b> in the neap tide and onshore currents at the last period of <b>flood</b> <b>stream</b> and then the current flowed to the south near the time of low water before the spring tide. In the Amakusa Nada, there were onshore currents at the time of high water in the neap tide and offshore current at the last period of <b>flood</b> <b>stream</b> before the spring tide. In the west channel of Tusima Strait, the currents flowed to the north-northwest with a speed of about 0. 5 knots at the time of <b>flood</b> <b>stream</b> in the neap tide but its direction turned to the south-southeast before the spring tide...|$|E

50|$|Although Fabio did not impact land, its {{remnants}} produced {{heavy rainfall}} in Hawaii. In a 24-hour period, 2.89 inches (73 mm) of rainfall was recorded at Glenwood {{on the island}} of Hawaii; this was the highest daily rainfall total for the month on the island. However, the heaviest precipitation fell on Mount Waiʻaleʻale on Kauai, where 15.08 inches (383 mm) fell in 24 hours; this total alone was greater than all other monthly rainfall totals in the state. The heavy rainfall flooded the Hanalei River, which forced the closure of the Kuhio Highway when a bridge was inundated.

40|$|We {{develop a}} path-planning {{algorithm}} to guide autonomous amphibious vehicles (AAVs) for flood rescue support missions.

The goal is to control the AAVs such that each target gets rescued while optimizing a certain performance objective.

40|$|A {{procedure}} involving simultaneous {{experimental and}} numerical research is described {{for the purposes}} of understanding the mechanisms involved when extreme precipitation is transformed to <b>flood</b> <b>stream</b> discharge. It is shown that experiments and model applications by themselves are not sufficient for process identification, but that their combined application provides considerable insight into the subsurface flow processes. The proposed approach is unconventional in that a numerical model, based on stringent continuity and momentum criteria, is used as a tool for process identification only. Unlike other studies, it is not intended to demonstrate the applicability of the utilised model for general hydrological applications, or to provide evidence of the suitability of particular model simplifications. Rather, different and sometimes conflicting model realisations are used to examine the plausibility of flow processes which may occur on natural hill slopes. Hereby, small scale effects such as those relating to the mechanisms of water entry into the macropores, and the movement of water to the surrounding matrix are identified from the results of well instrumented field experiments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSince many infrastructures, such as sea walls, sand beaches, forests, etc., were {{severely}} {{damaged or destroyed}} by the tsunami that occurred due to the 2011 Off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake, {{it is said that}} the resistant functions of the above structures against tsunami attacks did not perform well. However, some structures are known to have resisted the tsunami, based on field surveys conducted after the earthquake by the authors and others; and thus, the resistant functions of those infrastructures against tsunami should be estimated more properly. This paper focuses on earth structures, including river levees and road embankments, both damaged and undamaged, at 13 sites in Miyagi Prefecture, Chiba Prefecture, and Ibaraki Prefecture. They have been investigated through field surveys and other related data, such as satellite photographs taken before and/or after the tsunami. Furthermore, 10 dug pools, eroded by the <b>flood</b> <b>stream</b> on the back side of sea walls and banks during the tsunami, are also investigated to clarify their effects against tsunami attacks for use as future hardware countermeasures. Based on the above field investigations, several important lessons on hardware countermeasures against tsunami, using earth structures, are discussed. And, performance-based design concepts for reconstruction after this earthquake and for the reduction of future tsunami damage are discussed and proposed...|$|E
40|$|The Netherlands {{is a low}} lying {{country with}} 2 / 3 of its area below sea level. The country is {{protected}} against the sea by an expanded water defence system consisting of dunes, dikes, dams and storm surge barriers. In the south western part, the province of Zeeland, the coastline was shortened by closing of many estuaries with closure dams during the decades after the 1953 storm surge disaster. Separated marine and fresh water systems were born. Also for safety reasons {{in the northern part}} of the country in the former Zuider Sea, a 32 km long closure dam was constructed in 1932 : the Afsluitdijk. This dam connects the provinces of North-Holland and Friesland and separates the salt Wadden Sea (an international protected wetland) from the lake IJsselmeer. Nowadays this lake is a very important fresh water reservoir, a source for the preparation of drinking water, which is fed by the river IJssel, a branch of the river Rhine. The surplus of fresh water is drained daily through two large discharge sluices at low tides in the Wadden Sea. During high tides the sluices are closed preventing sea water to enter. Also during very dry summer periods the sluices remain closed for several weeks. It 2 ̆ 7 s obvious that this dam is an immense barrier for many migratory fish species. The adults of the strong anadromous counter current swimmers can hardly enter the fresh IJsselmeer due to the very high current velocities in the discharge sluices, already reached several minutes after opening. The anadromous juveniles, together with the katadromous adults are able to reach the Wadden Sea via the open discharge sluices, but during dry periods they have to wait several weeks which might be a problem. Flounder larvae and glass eel want to enter the fresh water at high tides floating in the <b>flood</b> <b>stream</b> (selective tidal transport). Also weak swimmers as smelts and sticklebacks normally use this water movement to enter inland water bodies. At the seaside, just behind the closed discharge sluices huge amounts of fish are gathering, waiting to enter, attracted by the fresh water discharge flow during the previous ebb tide. But it is uncertain if fish are able to stay close to the discharge sluices during the flushing period. And even if fish are able to resist this flow, it is very difficult to create an extra attraction flow in a fish way which can be competitive with the huge discharge flow. The European Water Framework Directive demands an improvement of the ecological quality of water systems. As a result many fish migration routes in The Netherlands have to be restored; also at the Afsluitdijk. This paper describes the ecological demands and design criteria for fish ways at this location as well as several possible solutions to eliminate this fish migration barrier...|$|E

50|$|Conversely, {{the beach}} profile is {{lower in the}} storm season (winter in {{temperate}} areas) due to the increased wave energy, and the shorter periods between breaking wave crests. Higher energy waves breaking in quick succession tend to mobilise sediment from the shallows, keeping it in suspension where it is prone to be carried along the beach by longshore currents, or carried out to sea to form longshore bars, especially if the longshore current meets an outflow from a river or <b>flooding</b> <b>stream.</b> The removal of sediment from the beach berm and dune thus decreases the beach profile.|$|R
