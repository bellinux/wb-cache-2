5|$|In one of {{his last}} acts as governor, he {{appointed}} Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The lame duck appointment was occasioned by the sudden resignation of Otis Lord, a Republican who may <b>have</b> <b>resigned</b> in order to deny the appointment opportunity to the incoming Democratic Governor, Benjamin Butler. The appointment was made on December 8, 1882, the last day of Long's term when the Governor's Council (which had to approve the appointment) was scheduled to meet.|$|E

Appointees to the order are recommended by an advisory board and formally inducted by the governor general or the sovereign. , 6,898 people have been appointed to the Order of Canada, including scientists, musicians, politicians, artists, athletes, business people, and film stars, benefactors, and others.

5000|$|The term [...] "Derby Dilly" [...] {{was coined}} by Irish Nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell. Besides Stanley, the other {{principal}} {{members of the}} Dilly were Sir James Graham, who <b>had</b> <b>resigned</b> as First Lord of the Admiralty; Lord Ripon, who <b>had</b> <b>resigned</b> as Lord Privy Seal; and the Duke of Richmond, who <b>had</b> <b>resigned</b> as Postmaster General. These four ministers had all come from notably different political backgrounds - Stanley and Graham were old Whigs, Ripon was a former Canningite Tory, while Richmond was an arch-conservative Tory who had incongruously {{found himself in the}} Grey cabinet.|$|R

5|$|In {{the later}} part of Richard's reign, the {{pressures}} mounted on Walter. Conflicts between his ecclesiastical duties {{and his government}} duties made him the target of criticism from both sides. A dispute in December 1197, over Richard's demand that the magnates of England provide 300knights to serve in France, led to renewed grumbling among the clergy and barons. Richard was also dissatisfied {{with the results of}} the carucage in 1198, so Walter resigned his position of chief justiciar on 11 July of that year. Walter may <b>have</b> <b>resigned</b> willingly, as he had talked of resigning his secular duties since 1194. Some medieval sources, however, stated that he was forced out of office by the king.|$|E
5|$|Seven men <b>have</b> <b>resigned</b> {{the office}} of {{governor}} {{before the end of}} their terms—John J. Crittenden, Beriah Magoffin, John W. Stevenson, Augustus O. Stanley, Happy Chandler, Earle C. Clements, and Wendell H. Ford. Six resigned to accept a higher office: Crittenden was appointed Attorney General of the United States and the other five were elected to the U.S. Senate. Only Beriah Magoffin resigned under duress. A Confederate sympathizer during the Civil War, Magoffin's power was entirely checked by a hostile, pro-Union legislature. With the state's government in gridlock, Magoffin agreed to resign in exchange for being able to name his successor. Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and the Speaker of the Senate, John F. Fisk, was not acceptable to Magoffin as a successor. Fisk resigned as Speaker, and the Senate elected Magoffin's choice, James Fisher Robinson as Speaker. Magoffin then resigned, Robinson was elevated to governor, and Fisk was re-elected as Speaker of the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The crisis flared again {{two years}} later when the Canadian {{military}} called for overseas reinforcements. Ralston wanted King to impose conscription, but at Macdonald's urging, seemed willing to compromise by going along with the prime minister's plan for one last voluntary recruitment campaign. King however, suddenly dismissed Ralston during a cabinet meeting on November 1, 1944. Macdonald considered resigning, but said later he would have struck King if he had risen to leave. Instead {{he sat in his}} chair ripping sheets of notepaper into small shreds and dropping them on the floor. Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald's decision not to resign probably saved the King government. King himself seemed to recognize that if Macdonald had left, Ilsley would <b>have</b> <b>resigned</b> too, possibly taking other ministers with him and causing the government's collapse.|$|E

5|$|Warelwast went {{blind in}} his later years, {{starting}} in about 1120, which William of Malmesbury regarded as a fitting punishment for Warelwast's alleged attempts to remove his predecessor from office early. He died about 26 September 1137, and {{was buried in the}} priory at Plympton. He may <b>have</b> <b>resigned</b> his see prior to his death. The 16th-century antiquary John Leland thought that Warelwast resigned his see before 1127, became a canon at Plympton, and died in 1127. Although Leland's year of death is incorrect, it is possible that Warelwast became a canon shortly before his death. The Annales Plymptonienses records that Robert of Bath, the Bishop of Bath, gave Warelwast his last rites on 26 September 1137, and records that the dying bishop was made a member of the collegiate church at Plympton. Warelwast's nephew Robert Warelwast succeeded as Bishop at Exeter in 1138; Robert had been appointed archdeacon of Exeter by his uncle.|$|E

25|$|At {{least one}} {{prominent}} labor commentator sharply criticized Holt Baker's elevation.

Moreover, his years of absence made his allies worry that the Filipinos might <b>have</b> <b>resigned</b> themselves to Marcos' strongman rule and that without his leadership the centrist opposition would die a natural death.|$|E
