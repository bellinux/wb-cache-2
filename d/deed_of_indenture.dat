The practice of raising up a younger son in this way was common {{in the case of}} a wealthy heiress who married an already wealthy husband, and frequently the younger son beneficiary was required to adopt the maternal surname and armorials.

50|$|Indentured labourers on sugar {{plantations}} {{were frequently}} mistreated, {{and lived in}} unsanitary conditions. A large percentage <b>of</b> <b>indentured</b> labourers returned to India following the expiry of their terms, {{and some of those}} who returned alerted authorities in India to abuses taking place in Natal, which led to new safeguards being put in place before further recruiting <b>of</b> <b>indentured</b> labourers was allowed to take place.|$|R
5000|$|Given {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of colonial export industries in the 17th and 18th Century, natural population growth and immigration were unable to meet the increasing demand for workers. As a result, the cost <b>of</b> <b>indentured</b> servants rose substantially. In the Chesapeake Bay, for example, the cost <b>of</b> <b>indentures</b> rose as much as 60% in the 1680s. [...] The increase in the price <b>of</b> <b>indentures</b> did not however act as an incentive for European workers to emigrate for they were not affected by the price at which they were sold in American ports. As a result, the companies that generated indentures disrupted the price signaling effect and thus the supply of immigrants did not expand sufficiently to meet demand. Some actors in the market attempted to generate incentives for workers by shortening the length <b>of</b> <b>indenture</b> contracts based on the productivity of the prospective emigrant. [...] Some American firms also opted to incentivize workers by paying small wages or by negotiating early expiration <b>of</b> <b>indentures.</b> [...] The rising cost <b>of</b> <b>indentured</b> labour and its inelastic supply pushed American producers towards other forms of labour. Slaves were substantially cheaper and the supply of them was more abundant for it was not constrained by the slaves’ willingness to emigrate. Additionally, slave traders were directly incentivised by the price mechanism to expand “production” (in the form of raiding expeditions), so supply was relatively elastic. Slavery thus was better able to satisfy labour demands in colonies requiring large quantities of unskilled workers (for example plantation colonies in the Caribbean). Indentures however prevailed in colonies that required skilled workers (in which the cost of training a slave was higher than the price differential between a slave and an indentured servant). Alison Smith and Abbott E Smith’s analysis of London port records shows how destination <b>of</b> <b>indentured</b> emigrants shifted from the West Indies towards New England as early as the 1660s, supporting the theory that indentured servitude might have declined in some regions because of labour market dynamics.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} acts passed {{by both the}} American and the British governments fostered the decline <b>of</b> <b>indentures.</b> The English Passenger Vessels Act of 1803, which {{regulated}} travel conditions aboard ships, attempted to make transportation more expensive {{in order to stop}} emigration. The American abolition of imprisonment of debtors by federal law (passed in 1833) made prosecution of runaway servants more difficult, increasing the risk <b>of</b> <b>indenture</b> contract purchases.|$|R

On a larger picture, the migration <b>of</b> <b>indentured</b> laborers is but {{a small portion of the}} Indian diaspora, which has continued through the 20th century to contemporary times.

40|$|The {{historical}} circumstances {{which led}} to the end <b>of</b> the <b>indentured</b> labor trade suggest that its abolition was only partially the result of humanitarian concern for the welfare of workers. It was the development of nationalism, both in sending and receiving countries, that prompted a rethinking of the racialized labor organization <b>of</b> <b>indenture.</b> In Australia, the introduction of the White Australia policy in 1901, with its restrictions on non-white immigration and employment, is usually thought to coincide with the abolition <b>of</b> the <b>indentured</b> labor trade. But the Australian pearl-shelling industry continued to employ indentured Asian workers up until the 1970 s. This case study extends the historical analysis <b>of</b> <b>indenture</b> well beyond its supposed international abolition. In doing so, it demonstrates a degree of continuity of colonial thought and practice which persisted in the face of global decolonization...|$|R
