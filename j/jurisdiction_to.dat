5|$|United States v. More, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that it had no <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> hear appeals from {{criminal}} cases in the circuit courts by writs of error. Relying on the Exceptions Clause, More held that Congress's enumerated grants of appellate <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> the Court operated as an exercise of Congress's power to eliminate all other forms of appellate jurisdiction.|$|E

5|$|Section 3(c) {{contains}} its own preclearance {{language and}} differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to a covered jurisdiction {{until such time}} as the jurisdiction may bail out of coverage under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance {{for as long as the}} court orders. Moreover, the court may require the <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from Section 5 preclearance, which requires a covered <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> preclear all of its voting changes.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court heard six {{original}} habeas {{cases of}} a criminal nature. All of the cases involved detention in the District of Columbia and prior proceedings in the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia. Because the D.C. circuit court did not utilize the practice of riding circuit, certificates of division {{could not have been}} granted in these cases. In the first two cases, the Court held that it had <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> issue the writ in pre-conviction situations. In the next two cases, the Court held that it did not have <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> issue the writ in post-conviction cases.|$|E

5|$|A more narrow bail-in process {{pertaining}} to federal observer certification is prescribed in Section 3(a). Under this provision, {{a federal court}} may certify a non-covered <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> receive federal observers if the court determines that the jurisdiction violated the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments. Jurisdictions certified to receive federal observers under Section 3(a) {{are not subject to}} preclearance.|$|E
5|$|Gonzales v. Raich 545 U.S. 1 (2005) was a {{decision}} in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled (6–3) that even where individuals or businesses in accordance with state-approved medical cannabis programs are lawfully cultivating, possessing, or distributing medical cannabis, such persons or businesses are violating federal marijuana laws. Therefore, under federal law violators are prosecuted because the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution grants the federal government <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> prosecute marijuana offenses, here defendants violation of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.|$|E

5|$|He {{appealed to}} the House of Lords, who decided (led by Lord Birkenhead) {{that they did not}} have the <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> hear the appeal, since a rule of English law {{specifies}} that once a writ of habeas corpus is issued (as it was by the Court of Appeal) no superior court can overrule it.

5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of a juror under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of a juror under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the second}} time the Supreme Court had granted certiorari to the Oneida's land claim. Over a decade earlier, in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (1974), the Supreme Court had allowed the same suit to proceed by {{unanimously}} holding that there was federal subject-matter <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> hear the claim. Since then, Justices William O. Douglas and Potter Stewart had departed, replaced by John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.|$|E
5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had <b>jurisdiction</b> <b>to</b> hear the case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not hear the case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
