5|$|Optics {{developed}} {{rapidly in}} this period. By the ninth century, there were works on physiological, <b>geometrical</b> and physical optics. Topics covered included mirror reflection.|$|E
5|$|Regularity {{and order}} are common {{features}} in Toraja wood carving (see table below), {{as well as}} abstracts and <b>geometrical</b> designs. Nature is frequently {{used as the basis}} of Toraja's ornaments, because nature is full of abstractions and geometries with regularities and ordering. Toraja's ornaments have been studied in ethnomathematics to reveal their mathematical structure, but Torajans base this art only on approximations. To create an ornament, bamboo sticks are used as a <b>geometrical</b> tool.|$|E
5|$|This {{provides}} the <b>geometrical</b> interpretation of : {{it is the}} best approximation to x by elements of V.|$|E
5|$|Another form of {{the goddess}} in the Tantrasara {{describes}} her seated in her own navel, formless and invisible. This form {{is said to be}} realised only via a trance. Another aniconic representation of the goddess is her yantra (a mystical <b>geometrical</b> diagram used in Tantric rituals), which figures the inverted triangle and lotus found in her iconography.|$|E
5|$|At 162km, Puck is {{the largest}} of the inner moons of Uranus and the only one imaged by Voyager 2 in any detail. Puck and Mab are the two {{outermost}} inner satellites of Uranus. All inner moons are dark objects; their <b>geometrical</b> albedo is less than 10%. They are composed of water ice contaminated with a dark material—probably radiation-processed organics.|$|E
5|$|Directly {{named for}} Kepler's {{contribution}} to science are Kepler's laws of planetary motion, Kepler's Supernova (Supernova 1604, which he observed and described) and the Kepler Solids, {{a set of}} <b>geometrical</b> constructions, two of which were described by him, and the Kepler conjecture on sphere packing.|$|E
5|$|Galileo's {{early works}} {{describing}} scientific instruments include the 1586 tract entitled The Little Balance (La Billancetta) describing an accurate balance to weigh objects in air or {{water and the}} 1606 printed manual Le Operazioni del Compasso Geometrico et Militare on the operation of a <b>geometrical</b> and military compass.|$|E
5|$|<b>Geometrical</b> optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} model in which light rays are indeed <b>geometrical</b> rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element on a given light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, {{there are two kinds of}} matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces form a basic tool in {{the study}} of partial {{differential}} equations. For many classes of partial differential equations, such as linear elliptic equations, it is possible to consider a generalized solution (known as a weak solution) by enlarging the class of functions. Many weak formulations involve the class of Sobolev functions, which is a Hilbert space. A suitable weak formulation reduces to a <b>geometrical</b> problem the analytic problem of finding a solution or, often what is more important, showing that a solution exists and is unique for given boundary data. For linear elliptic equations, one <b>geometrical</b> result that ensures unique solvability for a large class of problems is the Lax–Milgram theorem. This strategy forms the rudiment of the Galerkin method (a finite element method) for numerical solution of partial differential equations.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of the show's animation style, Stan is composed of simple <b>geometrical</b> shapes and primary colors. He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from only one angle, and his movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion.|$|E
5|$|Later mathematicians {{introduced}} algebraic methods, which {{transform a}} geometric problem into algebraic equations. These methods were simplified by exploiting symmetries {{inherent in the}} problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution, while other mathematicians used <b>geometrical</b> transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify {{the configuration of the}} given circles. These developments provide a <b>geometrical</b> setting for algebraic methods (using Lie sphere geometry) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles.|$|E
5|$|Most {{data about}} the {{encounter}} were acquired using photographic observations by cameras of the European Fireball Network. It was the first event of this type recorded by cameras from two distant locations, at Červená hora and Svratouch (both in the present-day Czech Republic), which enabled the calculation of the meteoroid's orbital characteristics by <b>geometrical</b> methods. Both were equipped with all-sky fisheye objectives.|$|E
5|$|Newton's {{derivation}} of Proposition 43 {{depends on}} his Proposition 2, derived {{earlier in the}} Principia. Proposition 2 provides a <b>geometrical</b> test for whether the net force acting on a point mass (a particle) is a central force. Newton showed that a force is central {{if and only if}} the particle sweeps out equal areas in equal times as measured from the center.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese paper-folding art of origami {{has been}} {{reworked}} mathematically by Tomoko Fusé using modules, congruent {{pieces of paper}} such as squares, and making them into polyhedra or tilings. Paper-folding was used in 1893 by T. Sundara Rao in his Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding to demonstrate <b>geometrical</b> proofs. The mathematics of paper folding has been explored in Maekawa's theorem, Kawasaki's theorem, and the Huzita–Hatori axioms.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} <b>geometrical</b> {{forms in}} Islamic art were occasional isolated geometric shapes such as 8-pointed stars and lozenges containing squares. These date from 836 in the Great Mosque of Kairouan, Tunisia, {{and since then}} have spread all across the Islamic world.|$|E
5|$|Utagawa Toyoharu (歌川 豊春, – 1814) was a Japanese {{artist in}} the ukiyo-e genre, known as {{the founder of the}} Utagawa school and for his uki-e {{pictures}} that incorporated Western-style <b>geometrical</b> perspective {{to create a sense of}} depth.|$|E
5|$|A meter {{in length}} canes, dated between 1850 and 1920, {{are used to}} make an entry into a village or in dance ceremonies. The canes were fired to give black patina over the {{engraved}} parts; the engraving designs consist of <b>geometrical</b> real images from the pilou dance, agricultural motifs and village scenes of fishing or building a Grand Hut or case. These were also stuffed with magic herbs to ward off evil spirits.|$|E
5|$|General vector spaces do {{not possess}} a {{multiplication}} between vectors. A vector space equipped with an additional bilinear operator defining the multiplication of two vectors is an algebra over a field. Many algebras stem from functions on some <b>geometrical</b> object: since functions with values in a given field can be multiplied pointwise, these entities form algebras. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem mentioned above, for example, relies on Banach algebras which are both Banach spaces and algebras.|$|E
5|$|In 1086, 7- and 10-point girih {{patterns}} (with heptagons, 5- and 6-pointed stars, triangles {{and irregular}} hexagons) {{appear in the}} Friday Mosque at Isfahan. 10-point girih became widespread in the Islamic world, except in the Spanish Al-Andalus. Soon afterwards, sweeping 9-, 11-, and 13-point girih patterns {{were used in the}} Barsian Mosque, also in Persia, in 1098; these, like 7-point <b>geometrical</b> patterns, are rarely used outside Persia and central Asia.|$|E
5|$|Samuel {{states that}} Tantrism is a contested concept. Tantra yoga may be described, {{according}} to Samuel, as practices in 9th to 10th century Buddhist and Hindu (Saiva, Shakti) texts, which included yogic practices with elaborate deity visualizations using <b>geometrical</b> arrays and drawings (mandala), fierce male and particularly female deities, transgressive life stage related rituals, {{extensive use of}} chakras and mantras, and sexual techniques, all aimed to help one's health, long life and liberation.|$|E
5|$|The decorations were in wood, stucco and stone, {{including}} marble, with <b>geometrical</b> and floral {{patterns and}} arabesques with Samarran and Byzantine origins. The decorations were {{more complex than}} the earlier Islamic forms and more carefully adapted to structural constraints. The imposing architecture and decoration of Fatimid buildings such as the al-Hakim mosque provided a backdrop that supported the dual role of the Fatimid caliph as both religious and political leader.|$|E
25|$|Discrete {{geometry}} and combinatorial geometry are about combinatorial properties of discrete collections of <b>geometrical</b> objects. A long-standing topic in discrete geometry is tiling of the plane. Computational geometry applies algorithms to <b>geometrical</b> problems.|$|E
25|$|Classical optics {{is divided}} into two main branches: <b>geometrical</b> (or ray) optics and {{physical}} (or wave) optics. In <b>geometrical</b> optics, light is considered to travel in straight lines, while in physical optics, light is considered as an electromagnetic wave.|$|E
25|$|In some materials, {{neighboring}} electrons {{prefer to}} point in opposite directions, {{but there is}} no <b>geometrical</b> arrangement in which each pair of neighbors is anti-aligned. This is called a spin glass and is an example of <b>geometrical</b> frustration.|$|E
25|$|Al-Mahani (born 820) {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} reducing <b>geometrical</b> problems such as duplicating the cube to problems in algebra. Al-Karaji (born 953) completely freed algebra from <b>geometrical</b> operations {{and replaced them with}} the arithmetical type of operations which are at the core of algebra today.|$|E

25|$|The early writers {{discussed}} here treated vision {{more as a}} <b>geometrical</b> than as a physical, physiological, or psychological problem. The first known author of a treatise on <b>geometrical</b> optics was the geometer Euclid (c. 325 BC–265 BC). Euclid began his study of optics as he began his study of geometry, {{with a set of}} self-evident axioms.|$|E

25|$|Later in the Meno, Socrates uses a <b>geometrical</b> {{example to}} expound Plato's view that {{knowledge}} in this latter sense is acquired by recollection. Socrates elicits a fact concerning a <b>geometrical</b> construction from a slave boy, {{who could not}} have otherwise known the fact (due to the slave boy's lack of education). The knowledge must be present, Socrates concludes, in an eternal, non-experiential form.|$|E
25|$|The carpets of Ganja are {{notable for}} {{peculiarity}} of their compositions and ornamental patterns. The Ganja carpets include {{a relatively small}} number of carpet compositions, all in all between 8 and 20 patterns. The Kazakh carpets cover about 16 compositions with various patterns. Kazakh, which is located on the NW of Azerbaijan, is the most famous carpet production region and also accounts for the Kazakh and Borchaly carpet groups. The Kazakh carpets have a <b>geometrical</b> ornamental pattern, the composition is not very complex with a focus on a schematic presentation of the <b>geometrical</b> patterns, plants and animals. The ornamental decor of the Ganja carpets is rich and diverse, with a focus on <b>geometrical</b> motifs as well as schematic presentation of plants and animals.|$|E
