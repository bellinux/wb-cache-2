Direct transmission of data to Earth concluded in late 1977 due to budgetary considerations, but as the stations' lunar laser ranging corner-cube retroreflector arrays are passive instruments, they are still being used.

25|$|A 1998 {{study was}} {{performed}} using three comparable Louisiana medium security prisons, {{two of which}} were privately run by different corporations and {{one of which was}} publicly run.

The study concluded that both privately run prisons had a lower cost per inmate, a lower rate of critical incidents, a safer environment for employees and inmates, and a higher proportional rate of inmates who completed basic education, literacy, and vocational training courses. However, the publicly run prison outperformed the privately run prisons in areas such as experiencing fewer escape attempts, controlling substance abuse through testing, offering a wider range of educational and vocational courses, and providing a broader range of treatment, recreation, social services, and rehabilitative services.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} encounter, Voyager {{navigation}} engineer Linda A. Morabito noticed a plume {{emanating from the}} surface {{in one of the}} images.

The authors calculated that Io's interior must experience significant tidal heating caused by its orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede (see the [...] "Tidal heating" [...] section for a more detailed explanation of the process). <b>Data</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> flyby showed that the surface of Io is dominated by sulfur and sulfur dioxide frosts.
