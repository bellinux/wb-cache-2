Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel skeleton. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. In addition, it sees widespread use in major appliances and cars. Despite growth in usage of aluminium, it is still the main material for car bodies. Steel is used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails, and screws and other household products and cooking utensils.|$|E

25|$|Non-medical use of {{fentanyl}} {{by individuals}} without opiate tolerance {{can be very}} dangerous and has resulted in numerous deaths. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> opiate tolerances {{are at high risk}} for overdoses. Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, it is extremely difficult to stop its course {{because of the nature of}} absorption. Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.|$|E

25|$|The only {{significant}} advantage that bubble sort has over most other implementations, even quicksort, but not insertion sort, {{is that the}} ability to detect that the list is sorted efficiently is built into the algorithm. When the list is already sorted (best-case), the complexity of bubble sort is only O(n). By contrast, most other algorithms, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> better average-case complexity, perform their entire sorting process on the set and thus are more complex. However, not only does insertion sort have this mechanism too, but it also performs better on a list that is substantially sorted (having a small number of inversions).|$|E
25|$|Ovarian cancer {{survival}} varies {{significantly with}} subtype. Dysgerminomas {{have a very}} favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%. Around two-thirds of dysgerminomas are diagnosed at stage I. Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> metastatic disease can survive a decade or more. Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.|$|E

25|$|Seen another way, {{patients}} with heart, liver, lung, or kidney failure have a dismal prognosis for survival, so the toxicity associated with immunosuppression is warranted (the benefits of graft survival outweigh {{the risks associated}} with the medications). But for the subset of {{patients with}} diabetes and preserved kidney function, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> long-standing and difficult-to-control disease, the prognosis for survival is comparatively much better. In addition to the immunosuppressive toxicities, other risks are associated with the islet transplant procedure itself, including intra-abdominal hemorrhage following the transplant, and portal vein thrombosis. The fact that there is already a good alternative to islet transplantation (i.e. the modern intensive insulin regimen) forces us to regard any newer, riskier interventions with a critical eye.|$|E
25|$|Buildings {{have been}} lost to fire, damage or {{demolition}} since the urban area's earliest days, and the frequent replacement of buildings (<b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> architectural merit) by Victorian-era speculators was particularly common along the seafront. After World War II, Brighton's seaside resort function declined, demand for housing rose and it became an important regional commercial centre. Pressure for redevelopment and the prevailing attitudes towards pre-20th-century architecture resulted in widespread demolition; {{many of the new}} buildings were architecturally unsuccessful because their scale, build quality and relationship with their surroundings were poor. In other cases, large sites stayed vacant for decades pending redevelopment. The city faces unusually severe geographical constraints—it lies between the English Channel and the South Downs (an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty), and has continuous urban development to the east and west—and intense pressure for redevelopment continues. Nevertheless, many buildings have also been saved—not least the Royal Pavilion, which was bought by the local authorities when Queen Victoria moved out and which faced another threat in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Absolute {{pitch is}} more common among {{speakers}} of tonal languages such as most dialects of Chinese or Vietnamese, which often depend on pitch variation as the means of distinguishing words that otherwise sound the same; e.g. Mandarin with four possible tonal variations, Cantonese with six, Southern Min with seven or eight (depending on dialect), and Vietnamese with six. Speakers of Sino-Tibetan languages {{have been reported to}} speak a word in the same absolute pitch (within a quarter-tone) on different days; it has therefore been suggested that absolute pitch may be acquired by infants when they learn to speak a tonal language (and possibly also by infants when they learn to speak a pitch-accent language). However, the brains of tonal-language speakers do not naturally process musical sound as language; perhaps such speakers are more likely to acquire absolute pitch for musical tones when they later receive musical training. Many native speakers of a tone language, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> little musical training, are observed to sing a given song consistently with regard to pitch. Among music students of East Asian ethnic heritage, those who speak a tone language very fluently have a much higher prevalence of absolute pitch than those who do not speak a tone language.|$|E

25|$|On the {{historical}} {{examples of the}} application of zero tolerance kind of policies, nearly all the scientific studies conclude that it didn't play {{a leading role in}} the reduction of crimes, a role which is claimed by its advocates. On the other hand, large majorities of people who are living in communities in which zero tolerance policing has been followed believe that in fact has played a key, leading role in reducing crime in their communities. It has been alleged that in New York City, the decline of crimes rate started well before Rudy Giuliani came to power in 1993, and none of the decreasing processes had particular inflection under him. and that in the same period, the decrease in crime was the same in the other major US cities, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> an opposite security policy. But the experience of the vast majority of New Yorkers led them to precisely the opposite conclusion and allowed a Republican to win and retain the Mayor's office for the first time in decades in large part because of the perception that zero tolerance policing was key to the improving crime situation in New York City. On the other hand, some argue that in the years 1984-7 New York already experienced a policy similar to Giuliani's one, but it faced a crime increase instead.|$|E
500|$|In March 1919, President Wilson asked Attorney General A.

[...] Palmer generally favored releasing people convicted under the wartime security acts, but when he consulted with Debs' prosecutors – <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> records as defenders of civil liberties – they assured him that Debs' conviction was correct and his sentence appropriate. The President and his Attorney General both believed that public opinion opposed clemency and that releasing Debs could strengthen Wilson's opponents {{in the debate over}} the ratification of the peace treaty. Palmer proposed clemency in August and October 1920 without success.|$|E
500|$|Going Clear {{made its}} world première on January 25, 2015, at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.

The première was so popular that <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> tickets were unable to find seats, because so many VIP pass-holders chose to watch the film, displacing ordinary festival-goers. It attracted numerous celebrities and media figures, including actors Alec Baldwin and Tobey Maguire, comedian Jason Sudeikis, and New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd. The audience gave Going Clear a standing ovation in an unusual occurrence for a Sundance presentation. 'Spanky' Taylor's appearance on stage, along with the daughter from whom the church had forced her to [...] "disconnect", reduced many in the audience to tears.

500|$|There are {{divergent}} {{views as}} to whether everyone with an unprovoked episode of thrombosis should be investigated for thrombophilia. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> a form of thrombophilia {{may not necessarily be}} at risk of further thrombosis, while recurrent thrombosis is more likely in those who have had previous thrombosis even in those who have no detectable thrombophilic abnormalities. Recurrent thromboembolism, or thrombosis in unusual sites (e.g. the hepatic vein in Budd-Chiari syndrome), is a generally accepted indication for screening. It {{is more likely to be}} cost-effective in people with a strong personal or family history of thrombosis. In contrast, the combination of thrombophilia with other risk factors may provide an indication for preventative treatment, which is why thrombophilia testing may be performed even in those who would not meet the strict criteria for these tests. Searching for a coagulation abnormality is not normally undertaken in patients in whom thrombosis has an obvious trigger. For example, if the thrombosis is due to immobilization after recent orthopedic surgery, it is regarded as [...] "provoked" [...] by the immobilization and the surgery and it is less likely that investigations will yield clinically important results.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{most other}} semiaquatic animals, the {{hippopotamus}} {{has very little}} hair. The skin is [...] thick, providing it great protection against conspecifics and predators. By contrast, its subcutaneous fat layer is thin. The animals' upper parts are purplish-gray to blue-black, while the under parts and areas around the eyes and ears can be brownish-pink. Their skin secretes a natural sunscreen substance which is red-coloured. The secretion is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "blood sweat", but is neither blood nor sweat. This secretion is initially colourless and turns red-orange within minutes, eventually becoming brown. Two distinct pigments have been identified in the secretions, one red (hipposudoric acid) and one orange (norhipposudoric acid). The two pigments are highly acidic compounds. They inhibit the growth of disease-causing bacteria, and their light absorption peaks in the ultraviolet range, creating a sunscreen effect. All hippos, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> different diets, secrete the pigments, so it does not appear that food {{is the source of the}} pigments. Instead, the animals may synthesize the pigments from precursors such as the amino acid tyrosine. Nevertheless, this natural sunscreen cannot prevent the animal's skin from cracking if it stays out of water too long.|$|E
