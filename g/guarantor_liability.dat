On August 30, 2002 WestLB was transformed into an Aktiengesellschaft (joint stock company) and on July 19, 2005 institutional liability and <b>guarantor</b> <b>liability</b> were abolished, allowing the company to concentrate on commercial operations. The public finance tasks of economic and structural development were transferred to the NRW.BANK which now operates as the Landesbank of North Rhine-Westphalia.|$|E

50|$|The buyer {{may want}} to exit from the {{contract}} due to change in market situation or financial situation. When the builder had made use of his contractual remedy to cancel the contract for the future, the buyer’s default indeed will trigger the <b>guarantor’s</b> <b>liability</b> and make the letter of guarantee operative. Moreover, if the buyer fails to take delivery, the builder may sue him for failure to accept. The builder has remedies available when the buyer breaches the contract.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, a {{distinction}} was made between a suretyship arrangement {{and that of}} a guaranty. In both cases, the lender gained the ability to collect from another person {{in the event of}} a default by the principal. However, the surety's liability was joint and primary with the principal: the creditor could attempt to collect the debt from either party independently of the other. The <b>guarantor's</b> <b>liability</b> was ancillary and derivative: the creditor first had to attempt to collect the debt from the debtor before looking to the guarantor for payment. Many jurisdictions have abolished this distinction, in effect putting all guarantors in the position of the surety.|$|R
40|$|A brief {{examination}} {{of the history of}} the guarantee reveals that equity treated the guarantor as a favoured debtor, given the absence of real benefit to the guarantor. However, these protections have largely been removed by standard form guarantee contracts used by, credit providers, and the law is also otherwise deficient in protecting consumer guarantors. As the expansion of the use of credit in recent years has meant that guarantees are now sometimes given carelessly and thoughtlessly, by persons without adequate education and resources to protect their interests, regulation is required (Chapter 1). The statutory regulation of guarantees before the passing of the Credit Act was inadequate. After examining the scope and nature of the Credit Act, the effect of the Credit Act on the regulation of guarantees is examined (Chapter 2). The extent to which the common law and statute law regulate pre-contractual information given to guarantors is then examined. It is concluded that room for improvement exists (Chapter 3). The extent to which the common law and statute law regulate the exercise of undue influence, unfair pressure and the making of unconscionable bargains is then examined and it is concluded that developments will occur rapidly in this area (Chapter 4). Common law and statutory provisions which discharge the <b>guarantor</b> from <b>liability</b> are then examined in the light of the operation of the Credit Act and it is concluded that some flaws exist both in principle and in the operation of the law (Chapter 5). The extent to which the guarantor is entitled to control the appropriation of payments made by the debtor, and the extent to which the <b>guarantor's</b> <b>liability</b> is coextensive with that of the debtor is then examined and some changes suggested (Chapter 6). The guarantor's rights to have action taken first against the debtor and the debtor's assets, the guarantor's rights to notice before action, and the right of indemnification after action, are then examined (Chapter 7). The possible reasons for the non-regulation of guarantees are examined and dismissed; past suggestions for reform and possible future reforms are examined (Chapter 8). Standard form contracts of guarantee are discussed and the text of a draft fair, simple English, standard form guarantee is suggested (Chapter 9). The law is as stated at 30 November, 1985.

40|$|This article explores some of {{the rules}} {{governing}} the liability of joint tenants and their guarantors for rent under a lease. Where a lease is granted {{to more than one}} person, it may be important to decide whether they are liable to the landlord individually or collectively for the rent. Moreover, if a guarantor is made a party to the lease, is he guaranteeing the liability of just one or all the tenants named in the lease? If the <b>guarantor</b> discharges the <b>liability</b> to pay rent to the landlord, can he recover the amount from the defaulting tenant(s) ? Finally, does the guarantor have a right of subrogation in these circumstances...|$|R
40|$|Like the {{doctrines of}} misrepresentation, {{misleading}} or deceptive conduct, and undue influence, {{the taking of}} unfair advantage or unconscionable conduct may be relevant {{to the problem of}} bank guarantees being entered into without adequate understanding or consent. A guarantee or surety of this kind is, incidentally, a contract in which one party (the guarantor) promises another (the lender bank) to meet the debt obligation of a third party (the borrower) should the borrower fail to do so. Typically, a guarantee involves the <b>guarantor</b> accepting a <b>liability</b> in a contractual relationship which appears, on the face of it, to be improvident as the guarantor derives not tangible benefits from it by way of a claim against the creditor or the principal debtor...|$|R
