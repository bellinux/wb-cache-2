40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{integrated}} experimental system of material evidence for <b>fire</b> <b>trace</b> {{was used to}} make fuse residuum by simulating overload and short circuit of electric circuit, bad connection and fire. The scanning electron microscope can be utilized to observe and analyze the morphology characters on fuse fesiduum. The results indicate that in {{the condition of the}} overload and short circuit of electric circuit, bad connection and fire, the melted trace,s morphology is different, besides the amount of the oxide on the fuse residuum's surface is various. When the electric circuit is overload, there is no port in the fuse fesiduum. But there is some bled in the fuse fesiduum of the short circuit and fire.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the fire}} scene, the {{fracture}} trails of fuse were often found. There are various reasons of fracture, such as outside mechanical force, melting fracture due to overheating, short-circuit and high temperature of fire. By the fuse fracture experiments of daily electrothermal apparatus and corresponding trace analysis; this paper summarizes an identification method of fuse fracture properties, which can provide technical {{support for the}} investigators to identify {{the cause of the}} <b>fire.</b> <b>Trace</b> traits {{can be applied to the}} macro method and metallographic method. By macro method it is seen that the cut edge of mechanical force and tensile fracture is right or sharp-angled form. Traces ends formed under the condition of short-circuit are most spherical. The shape of trace formed by high temperature of fire is between the traces shapes of the above, a smooth, but less spherical shape. Using metallographic method, untouched region by the temperature of ruptured fuse by mechanical force is observed with the ferrite microspheres small equiaxial crystal. Deformation organization is noticed of tensile fracture and cut of fuse fracture place. While the microstructure in the high temperature effect is the equiaxial crystal, and the microstructures of short-circuit fusing in molten mark end (or local) show big grain boundaries, inner of which still has not neat columnar crystal, in addition, there is an obvious transition region between the melting parts and matrix...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of the {{problems}} in intelligent fire-fighting mobile robot contest is how the robot can find and can extinguish a fire without a lot of sensors. The fire is located in a white circle area at one of the corner in room with random combinations. The way to solve this problems is conventional method-called-wall tracing. The robot uses wall tracing method to navigate, when entering the room this method still in used by the robot until its find the fire spot then uses one additional sensor to detect the white circle area where the fire located at. After detecting the white circle area, the robot will extinguishes the fire. This paper proposes a new method as optimization of conventional method. The proposed method is implementation of current algorithm (proportional derivatives algorithm) not only to wall tracing but also to TPA 81 sensor (<b>fire</b> <b>tracing)</b> -called-wall and <b>fire</b> <b>tracing</b> method. Furthermore, this method is combination method between wall <b>tracing</b> and <b>fire</b> <b>tracing.</b> The robot will approach directly to the <b>fire</b> without wall <b>tracing</b> and without detecting white circle area. Then, the robot extinguishes the fire quickly. The robot uses only TPA 81 sensor {{that can be used to}} detect the fire spot and its position in the room. Test result shows that 50 % of the fire position variation on Indonesian Intelligent Robot Contest can be optimized using this method...|$|R
