5|$|Jefferson's most {{immediate}} sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own {{draft of the}} preamble of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's draft of the Virginia <b>Declaration</b> of Rights. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the <b>Declaration</b> of Independence. They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English <b>Declaration</b> of Rights, which formally ended the reign of King JamesII. During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English <b>Declaration</b> of Rights {{as a model of}} how to end the reign of an unjust king. The Scottish <b>Declaration</b> of Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's <b>Declaration,</b> but these models are now accepted by few scholars.|$|E

5|$|A <b>declaration</b> is a {{pronouncement}} {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court.

Following that date, changes to Order 53 of the Rules of Court permitted an application for a <b>declaration</b> to be made together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the application for a <b>declaration</b> cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E

5|$|After Congress {{approved}} the final {{wording of the}} <b>Declaration</b> on July 4, a handwritten copy was sent {{a few blocks away}} to the printing shop of John Dunlap. Through the night, Dunlap printed about 200 broadsides for distribution. Before long, the <b>Declaration</b> was read to audiences and reprinted in newspapers throughout the thirteen states. The first official public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the yard of Independence Hall on July 8; public readings also took place on that day in Trenton, New Jersey and Easton, Pennsylvania. A German translation of the <b>Declaration</b> was published in Philadelphia by July 9.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} that France would never accept {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a <b>declaration</b> that was far more liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his <b>Declaration</b> of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the <b>declaration</b> were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E

5|$|Before May 2011, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. In Chan Hiang Leng Colin, the appellants contended that a <b>declaration</b> might be obtained in proceedings taken under Order 53 of the Rules of Court. The Court of Appeal, following Re Application by Dow Jones (Asia) Inc. (1987), held that it had no power to grant a <b>declaration</b> under Order 53 because a <b>declaration</b> is not a form of prerogative order. If a <b>declaration</b> was sought, it had to be applied for by way of writ if there were substantial factual disputes between the parties, or, if not, by originating summons. In Yip Kok Seng v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board (2010), the High Court expressed the view that due to the lack of a unified regime in Singapore for applying for prerogative orders and declarations, it was not an abuse of process for an applicant to seek redress for a public law right by way of a <b>declaration</b> instead of applying for a prerogative order.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} two results concerning Order-Sorted Logic with Term <b>Declarations.</b> First, we {{show that}} linear term <b>declarations</b> can be transformed conservatively into function <b>declarations,</b> thus yielding elementary signatures. This provides a simple proof of the well known fact that unification in linear signatures is decidable. A similar transformation exists for semi-linear term <b>declarations,</b> resulting in shallow term <b>declarations.</b> Secondly, we provide an inference system transforming sort constraints over an arbitrary signature into almost solved form. The step from almost solved forms to solved forms requires a procedure to decide emptiness of sort intersections, which is not possible in general. This shows {{that it is the}} sort intersection problem that accounts for the undecidability of unification in signatures with term <b>declarations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{production}} of 'declarations' (formal, public statements to influence policy, raise awareness and call others to action) is increasing {{in the end}} of life care field. Several <b>declarations</b> have been issued on ‘assisted dying/euthanasia’ but have not yet been analysed systematically. Aim: To map the emergence of assisted dying/euthanasia <b>declarations</b> in the international context and to establish the representation of palliative care in these <b>declarations.</b> Methods: A two stage search strategy was used: 1) Systematic searches using the Google search engine to identify assisted dying/euthanasia <b>declarations</b> 2) Websites of key organisations were searched. Content analysis was employed to explore the characteristics of the identified <b>declarations</b> and to examine references to ‘palliative care’. Results: 61 assisted dying/euthanasia <b>declarations</b> (1974 to 2016), 22 since 2011, were identified. Their geographic scope was global (18), international (2), national (38), regional (2). Two thirds of the <b>declarations</b> were against assisted dying/euthanasia. The issuing organisations were: healthcare related (28), religious (16), lobbyist (12), political (3). Twelve <b>declarations</b> were issued by 14 palliative care organisations and 41 <b>declarations</b> made reference to palliative care. Palliative care references included: describing palliative care, clarifying it excludes assisted dying/euthanasia, demonstrating it can eliminate suffering, expressing concerns about the implications for palliative care of legalising assisted dying/euthanasia, and demanding access to and resources for palliative care. Conclusions: <b>Declarations</b> relating to assisted dying/euthanasia represent the views and demands of diverse communities. The value of palliative care in eliminating suffering {{at the end of life}} is recognised in the <b>declarations,</b> whether or not they support assisted dying/euthanasia. Despite divided opinions, ‘palliative care’ forms a significant part of the discussion on legalising assisted dying/euthanasia...|$|R
50|$|Anyone who has {{attempted}} to maintain coherence amongst the <b>declarations</b> and usages of procedures in a large program and its usage of libraries of routines, especially one undergoing changes, will have struggled over the usage of forward or similar added <b>declarations</b> for procedures invoked but not defined in the current compilation. Maintaining synchrony between widely-separated locations especially across different source files requires diligence. Those <b>declarations</b> using the reserved word are easy to find, but if the helpful <b>declarations</b> are not distinguished from ordinary <b>declarations,</b> the task becomes troublesome. The gain of supposedly swifter compilation may seem insufficient when simply abandoning the goal of one-pass compilation would remove this imposition.|$|R

Function definitions, in turn, contain <b>declarations</b> and statements. <b>Declarations</b> either define new types using keywords such as , , and , or assign types to and perhaps reserve storage for new variables, usually by writing the type {{followed by the}} variable name. Keywords such as [...] and [...] specify built-in types. Sections of code are enclosed in braces ( [...] and , sometimes called [...] "curly brackets") to limit the scope of <b>declarations</b> and {{to act as a}} single statement for control structures.|$|R
40|$|The essay {{concerns}} the reservations {{attached to the}} <b>declarations</b> accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the two International Courts. As early as during the 1920 s when States consented to the compulsory jurisdicition of the first World Court they attached limitations on, conditions or reservations to their <b>declarations</b> of acceptance. For these <b>declarations,</b> there were no rules whatever prescribing any sort of uniformity or similarity of content in any aspects, and States formulated more and more complicated restrictions to their <b>declarations</b> of acceptance. After the International Court of Justice had been established, States continued the practice of attaching reservations to <b>declarations</b> of acceptance and, moreover, increased the number thereof, “inventing” more and more complicated reservations. Quite a few of such reservations placed much more limitations on the Court's compulsory jurisdiction than the interwar <b>declarations</b> of acceptance had done and a no small part of them left loopholes of escape from the jurisdiction recognized. In analysing the problems of permissible reservations, the author refers to the rules and criterias developed in international treaty law on the reservations to multilateral treaties and to the jurisprudence of the two Word Courts. She concludes that the <b>declarations</b> of acceptance are unilateral acts and the States are free to attach any reservation to their <b>declarations</b> of acceptance. ...|$|R
