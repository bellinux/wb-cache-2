In contrast to what occurred when considering any other fixed scales, little penguin's highly variable laying date always occurred within the annual peak of ocean productivity that emerged from our newly defined dynamic scale. Additionally, local sea surface temperature seems to have triggered the onset of reproduction, acting as an environmental cue informing on marine productivity patterns at our dynamic scale. Chlorophyll-a patterns extracted from this scale revealed that environment factors in marine ecosystems affecting breeding decisions are related to a much wider region than foraging areas that are commonly used in current studies investigating the link between animals' life history and their environment. We suggest that marine productivity patterns may be more predictable than previously thought when environmental and biological data are examined at appropriate scales. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The authors studied the seasonality of influenza throughout Brazil, a geographically diverse country, by modeling influenza-related mortality and laboratory surveillance data. Monthly time series of pneumonia and influenza mortality were obtained from 1979 to 2001 {{for each of the}} 27 Brazilian states. Detrended time series were analyzed by Fourier decompo-sition to describe the amplitude and timing of annual and semiannual epidemic cycles, and the resulting seasonal parameters were compared across latitudes, ranging from the equator (þ 5 N) to the subtropics (35 S). Season-ality in mortality was most pronounced in southern states (winter epidemics, June–July), gradually attenuated toward central states (15 S) (p< 0. 001), and remained low near the equator. A seasonal southward traveling wave of influenza was identified across Brazil, originating from equatorial and low-population regions in March–April and moving toward temperate and highly populous regions over a 3 -month period. Laboratory surveillance data from recent years provided independent confirmation that mortality peaks coincided with influenza virus activity.

This paper investigates potential strategies used by cooperatively breeding Noisy Miners Manorina melanocephala at a site in south-east Queensland {{to reduce the risk}} to their nests. First, nearly twice as many nests were built from June to September as from October to January. Conversely, the availability of insects needed to feed chicks was known to be higher in the warmer months. Predation risk was probably <b>driving</b> the <b>timing</b> of breeding, because early broods were significantly less likely to be preyed upon than were those built later in the year. Second, low nests (less than 2. 5 m high) {{were more likely to be}} successful than nests built at heights of over 4 m. Low nests are less visible and accessible to raptors. No other measures of nest concealment or accessibility were linked with nest success. However, early nests were significantly better concealed than late nests. Noisy Miner nests are probably fairly obvious to diurnal predators because of the activity of many visitors around them, and the loud begging calls of nestlings. Finally, the number of visitors to a nest was not correlated with the fate of that nest. In conclusion, there was no single strategy for reducing the risk to noisy miner nests of predation. This was probably due to the diverse taxonomic range of potential nest predators at the study site...|$|R

In addition, studying phenology is the simplest procedure to track current {{global warming and}} its effects on the success and survival of different populations of the same species. Little is known about the effect of water temperature and its corresponding accumulated heat on charophytes’ phenology. We compared differences in water temperature and sexual reproductive phenology of Chara hispida in two ponds of two countries located at different latitudes (Spain and Switzerland) over the same year. We estimated the accumulated heat required to develop from one phenophase to another (unripe/ripe gametangia and oospores). Curve fitting techniques on water temperature showed an advance of 26 days in the Spanish spring 2 onset. All phenological events happened for the first time around 40 days earlier in the Spanish pond, agreeing with the Hopkins’ Bioclimatic Law prediction. C. hispida sexually reproduced in a daily mean temperature (DMT) range of 10 - 25 °C and needed 600 growing degree-days (GDD) to ripen gametangia in the Spanish pond. The Swiss population required a higher DMT (15 °C) to begin to reproduce, and ~ 700 GDD to initiate gametangia ripening. Temperature (as well as radiation) {{is one of the most}} important drivers of reproductive phenology, and accumulated heat is a better predictor than DMT for charophyte phenology.

40|$|Present-day {{clusters}} are massive halos containing mostly quiescent galaxies, while distant protoclusters are extended structures containing numerous star-forming galaxies. We {{investigate the}} implications of this fundamental change in a cosmological context using a set of N-body simulations and semi-analytic models. We find that the fraction of the cosmic volume occupied by all (proto) clusters increases by nearly three orders of magnitude from z= 0 to z= 7. We show that (proto) cluster galaxies are an important, and even dominant population at high redshift, as their expected contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density rises (from 1 % at z= 0) to 20 % at z= 2 and 50 % at z= 10. Protoclusters thus provide a significant fraction of the cosmic ionizing photons, and may have been crucial in <b>driving</b> the <b>timing</b> and topology of cosmic reionization. Internally, the average history of cluster formation can be described by three distinct phases: at z~ 10 - 5, galaxy growth in protoclusters proceeded in an inside-out manner, with centrally dominant halos that are among the most active regions in the Universe; at z~ 5 - 1. 5, rapid star formation occurred within the entire 10 - 20 Mpc structures, forming most of their present-day stellar mass; at z<~ 1. 5, violent gravitational collapse drove these stellar contents into single cluster halos, largely erasing the details of cluster galaxy formation due to relaxation and virialization.

30|$|Plate {{tectonics}} {{is central}} to {{many aspects of the}} geology and evolution of terrestrial planets. While Earth is the only planet where plate tectonics is observed, its <b>driving</b> mechanism and <b>timing</b> of initiation are still poorly understood. Subduction is thought to be the fundamental process for plate tectonics initiation because the slab pull of subducting slab contributes most to the forces that drive plate movements. On the Earth, initiation of subduction is greatly facilitated by tectonic forces associated with plate motions already occurring elsewhere (Mueller and Phillips 1991; Hall et al. 2003). Various models for subduction initiation has been proposed (e.g., McKenzie 1977; Turcotte 1977; Ogawa 1990; Mueller and Phillips 1991; Kemp and Stevenson 1996; Toth and Gurnis 1998; Stern 2004; Solomatov 2004 a; Ueda et al. 2008; Nikolaeva et al. 2010), many of which involve existing plate boundaries or weak zones. Incipient subduction zones are often found near transform faults or fracture zones because of their physical weakness (e.g., Mueller and Phillips 1991; Gurnis et al. 2004).|$|R
40|$|The {{nutritional}} quality of forage plants varies {{in space and}} time. This variation is presumed to drive the annual migration of herbivore species which follow peaks in the availability of high quality forage between sites. The green-wave hypothesis predicts that during spring migration to northern breeding sites, geese and other herbivorous waterfowl travel along a climatic gradient, {{taking advantage of the}} flush of spring growth of forage plants at each stopover site along the gradient. Here, we explore a basic assumption of the green wave hypothesis which states that there are successive waves of forage availability along the East-Atlantic Flyway from temperate to arctic sites, as spring advances. We use one of the migration routes of the Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis as a model to compare data on food quality and quantity of forage plants with the timing of migration along its migratory corridor. We collected data on forage biomass and quality at three saltmarsh sites along the traditional migration route of the Barnacle Goose: a temperate staging site in the Wadden Sea, a Baltic stopover site and a Russian sub-arctic breeding site. In all areas forage biomass increased in spring, while the {{nutritional quality}} peaked early in the season and declined with increasing biomass. We combined data on forage biomass and nutritional quality in one measure, the nutrient biomass. For all sites, nutrient biomass showed a peak in early spring. We used observations on goose migration to examine whether the geese utilise these peaks in nutrient biomass, as is predicted by the green wave hypothesis. Our data show that the geese utilise the Wadden Sea staging site and the Baltic stopover site at the moments of peak nutrient biomass. At the Russian breeding site, geese arrive prior to the flush of spring growth of forage plants and profit from the peak in nutrient biomass when the goslings hatch and adult birds start moulting. We conclude that spring nutrient biomass is a key factor <b>driving</b> the <b>timing</b> of the annual northern migration of avian herbivore...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the factors determining different growth rates and convergence across geographical areas {{has been a major}} theme in recent years in the regional {{analysis of}} economic research. Generally, the debate has been focused on factual predictions, of different specification, of regional growth models, based on yearly data, using a cross-section approach and per capita output (regional GDP) (Barro and Sala-i-Martin, 1992). However, the attention paid by economists to analysing growth and convergence across areas does not represent the only useful analysis that may be worth pursuing on the dynamic properties of different areas. National and aggregated economic analysis does not contribute to shaping comovements in different regions and interest in local dynamics can be motivated in several ways. It is well-known that permanent change in output and employment results from unexpected shocks to the economy, and that any economic change over time can be a result of the trend-cycle and seasonal components, neither of which may be assumed as being constant. Moreover, local or regional shocks can have redistribution consequences and, as a result, regional reallocations may lead to aggregate fluctuations. We can imagine that while regional economic series may share a common <b>driving</b> factor, the <b>timing</b> of the response to shocks to the factor may differ across areas fo...|$|R
40|$|Inhibitory interneurons are the “shush”-ers of the brain—their output {{causes a}} {{reduction}} in the output of other neurons. Inhibitory interactions {{play a critical role in}} the olfactory bulb, where they shape olfactory representations that guide behavior. However, the mechanisms by which interneuron activation improves olfactory function remain debated. In particular, the relative importance neural activity over short periods of time (tens of milliseconds) versus long periods of time (hundreds to thousands of milliseconds) has provoked significant debate. Granule cells are inhibitory interneurons in the olfactory bulb that can respond and influence olfactory bulb activity across a wide range of timescales. The first part of this dissertation investigates the physiological mechanisms <b>driving</b> the <b>timing</b> of granule cell recruitment. We found that the specific timing of recruitment depends on the timing of synaptic excitation delivered from tufted cells. Tufted cells (unlike the more commonly studied mitral cells) are able to fire at long latencies due to intrinsic membrane properties that allow them to integrate weak inputs slowly while responding rapidly to strong inputs. Computational modeling revealed that the long-latency inhibition generated by this mechanism can improve performance on stimulus discrimination tasks. The second portion of this dissertation focuses on the downstream effects of granule cell recruitment. Highly correlated spiking can be advantageous for propagating information. However, these same correlations limit encoding by introducing redundancy. We investigated how granule cell recruitment altered correlations between mitral cell pairs across timescales. We found that granule cell recruitment increased fast timescale correlations (i. e. synchronous spiking) while simultaneously decreasing slow timescale correlations (i. e. firing rate similarity). Using computational modeling, we show that timescale-dependent correlation changes are functionally advantageous because they can circumvent the tradeoff between propagation and encoding. Taken together, these studies extend our understanding of olfactory bulb physiology by providing a mechanistic description of how inhibitory circuits shape activity across timescales. Our results indicate that granule cell recruitment requires dynamic and stimulus-dependent interactions between mitral, tufted, and granule cells, and that the inhibition recruited by this mechanism works at multiple timescales to effectively encode and propagate stimulus information. ...|$|R

Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) multilocus genotypes for 31 sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations from the Kvichak River, Alaska, we assessed the relative roles of geography (discrete boundaries or continuous distance) and ecology (spawning habitat and <b>timing)</b> <b>driving</b> genetic divergence in this species at varying spatial scales within the drainage. We also evaluated two outlier detection methods to characterize candidate SNPs responding to environmental selection, emphasizing which mechanism(s) may maintain the genetic variation of outlier loci. Results For the entire drainage, Mantel tests suggested a greater role of geographic distance on population divergence than differences in spawn timing when each variable was correlated with pairwise genetic distances. Clustering and hierarchical analyses of molecular variance indicated that the largest genetic differentiation occurred between populations from distinct lakes or subdrainages. Within one population-rich lake, however, Mantel tests suggested a greater role of spawn timing than geographic distance on population divergence when each variable was correlated with pairwise genetic distances. Variable spawn timing among populations was linked to specific spawning habitats as revealed by principal coordinate analyses. We additionally identified two outlier SNPs located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II that appeared robust to violations of demographic assumptions from an initial pool of eight candidates for selection. Conclusions First, our results suggest that geography and ecology have influenced genetic divergence between Alaskan sockeye salmon populations in a hierarchical manner depending on the spatial scale. Second, we found consistent evidence for diversifying selection in two loci located in the MHC class II by means of outlier detection methods; yet, alternative scenarios for the evolution of these loci were also evaluated. Both conclusions argue that historical contingency and contemporary adaptation have likely driven differentiation between Kvichak River sockeye salmon populations, as revealed by a suite of SNPs. Our findings highlight the need for conservation of complex population structure, because it provides resilience in the face of environmental change, both natural and anthropogenic. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background] Understanding {{wildlife}} disease ecology {{is becoming}} an urgent need due to the continuous emergence and spread of several wildlife zoonotic diseases. West Nile Virus (WNV) is the most widespread arthropod-borne virus in the world, and in recent decades {{there has been an}} increase both in geographic range, and in the frequency of symptomatic infections in humans and wildlife. The principal vector for WNV in Europe is the common house Culex pipiens mosquito, which feeds {{on a wide variety of}} vertebrate host species. Variation in mosquito feeding preference has been described as one of the most influential parameters <b>driving</b> intensity and <b>timing</b> of WNV infection in the United States, but feeding preferences for this species have been little studied in Europe. [Methods] Here, we estimated feeding preference for wild Cx. pipiens in northern Italy, using molecular analysis to identify the origin of blood meals, and avian census to control host abundance variations. Additionally, we used host bird odour extracts to test experimentally mosquito preferences in the absence of environmental variations. [Results] For the first time, we demonstrate a clear feeding preference for the common blackbird (Turdus merula), both for wild collected specimens and in the lab, suggesting a potential important role for this species in the WNV epidemiology in Europe. A seasonal decrease in abundance of blackbirds is associated with increased feeding on Eurasian magpies (Pica pica), and this may be linked to seasonal emergence of WNV in humans. Feeding preferences on blackbirds are more marked in rural areas, while preference for magpies is higher in peridomestic areas. Other species, such as the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) appear to be selected by mosquitoes opportunistically in relation to its abundance. [Conclusions] Our findings provide new insights into the ecology of Cx. pipiens in Europe and may give useful indications in terms of implementing targeted WNV surveillance plans. However, a clearer understanding of spatio-temporal variations of Cx. pipiens feeding preferences, and targeted studies on reservoir competence for WNV for these species are therefore now urgently needed as this is essential to describe disease dynamics and quantify virus transmission risk.
