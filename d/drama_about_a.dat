5|$|In June 1935 Calleia was {{announced}} to star as Joaquin Murrieta in I Am Joaquin (later titled Robin Hood of El Dorado), a film {{for which he}} had written the screenplay. MGM replaced him with Warner Baxter, ostensibly because Calleia was too old, although Baxter was six years older. Calleia did receive a notable starring role in Man of the People (1937), a political <b>drama</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> young lawyer fighting corporate racketeers.|$|E

5|$|Farrell was {{inspired}} to try acting when Henry Thomas' performance in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial moved him to tears. With his brother's encouragement, he attended the Gaiety School of Acting, dropping out when he was cast as Danny Byrne on Ballykissangel, a BBC <b>drama</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> young English priest who becomes part of an Irish rural community. As an 18-year-old travelling in Sydney, he was at one time suspected for attempted murder. The police sketch looked remarkably like him and he had even described blacking out during the night in question. His only alibi was apparently a journal kept by his friend that explained the two had been across town that night, taking MDMA.|$|E

His performance was described as characteristically powerful in The Independent. He also played tabloid journalist Dave Dewston in the four-part BBC serial Murder, and prison officer Mike in the part-improvised single drama Out of Control.

Morrissey researched premature births by speaking to paediatricians at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{moved into}} writing adult {{television}} dramas in 1994. His early scripts generally explored concepts {{of religion and}} sexuality among various backdrops: Revelations was a soap opera about organised religion and featured a lesbian vicar; Springhill was a soap <b>drama</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> Catholic family in contemporary Liverpool; The Grand explored society's opinion of subjects such as prostitution, abortion and homosexuality during the interwar period; and Queer as Folk, his first prolific series, recreated his experiences in the Manchester gay scene.

5|$|Despite risking his own money, Kurosawa chose a {{story that}} was more {{directly}} critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any previous work. The Bad Sleep Well, based on a script by Kurosawa's nephew Mike Inoue, is a revenge <b>drama</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> young man {{who is able to}} infiltrate the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his father's death. Its theme proved topical: while the film was in production, mass demonstrations were held against the new U.S.-Japan Security treaty, which was seen by many Japanese, particularly the young, as threatening the country's democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians. The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success. The 25-minute opening sequence depicting a corporate wedding reception is widely regarded as one of Kurosawa's most skillfully executed set pieces, but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison. The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals, however courageous or cunning.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, he starred {{alongside}} Melissa Leo in Why Stop Now, a <b>drama</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> {{drug addict}} mother (Leo) and her piano prodigy son (Eisenberg), {{and in the}} magical realist romantic comedy To Rome with Love, directed by Woody Allen. That same year, he filed a $3million lawsuit against the producers of the 2010 direct-to-DVD film Camp Hell, claiming exploitation. According to the lawsuit, Eisenberg agreed {{to appear in the}} film as a favor to his friends. He was on set for one day of filming in 2007, earned about $3,000, and logged only a few minutes of total screentime. Because of his minimal involvement in the production, he was surprised to see that his face was prominently featured {{on the cover of the}} DVD, implying that he starred in the film. His lawsuit asserts various California law causes of action, including claims for unfair business practices and publicity rights.|$|E
