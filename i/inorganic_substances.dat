The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>substances.</b> The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do not because they are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.|$|E

Since Aristotle these had been considered essentially biological (vital) processes. However, Friedrich Wöhler, Justus Liebig and other pioneers of the rising field of organic chemistry—building on the work of Lavoisier—showed that the organic world could often be analyzed by physical and chemical methods. In 1828 Wöhler showed that the organic substance urea could be created by chemical means that do not involve life, providing a powerful challenge to vitalism. Cell extracts ("ferments") that could effect chemical transformations were discovered, beginning with diastase in 1833. By the end of the 19th century the concept of enzymes was well established, though equations of chemical kinetics would not be applied to enzymatic reactions until the early 20th century.|$|E

In 1827 the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius held that an indispensable force of nature for the synthesis of organic compounds, called vital force or life force, was needed. This philosophical idea, vitalism, well into the 19th century had many supporters, even after the introduction of the atomic theory. The idea of vitalism especially fitted in with beliefs in medicine; the most traditional healing practices believed that disease was the result of some imbalance in the vital energies that distinguishes life from nonlife.

2500|$|A {{food web}} (or food cycle) {{is a natural}} {{interconnection}} [...] of food chains and a graphical representation (usually an image) of what-eats-what in an ecological community. [...] Another name for food web is consumer-resource system. Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels: 1) the autotrophs, and 2) the heterotrophs. To maintain their bodies, grow, develop, and to reproduce, autotrophs produce organic matter from <b>inorganic</b> <b>substances,</b> including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide. These chemical reactions require energy, which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis, although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs. [...] A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere, to mixotrophs (such as carnivorous plants) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere, and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter. The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs. The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory, carnivory, scavenging and parasitism. Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs, such as sugars, provides energy. Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes, from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods, and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Demarco invited Beuys to Scotland in May 1970 {{and again}} in August to show and perform in the Edinburgh International Festival with Gunther Uecker, Blinky Palermo and other Duesseldorf artists plus Robert Filliou where they took over the main spaces of Edinburgh College of Art. The {{exhibition}} {{was one of the}} defining moment for British and European Art as powerful as When Attitudes Become Form and directly influencing several generations of artists and curators, not least Nicholas Serota. This was titled [...] "Strategy Get Arts-Contemporary Art from Dusseldorf." [...] In Edinburgh 1970 Beuys created ARENA for Demarco as a retrospective of his art up to that time, and he showed The Pack and performed Celtic Kinloch Rannoch with Henning Christiansen and Johannes Stuttgen in support, seen by several thousands. This was Beuys's first use of blackboards and the beginning of nine trips to Scotland to work with Richard Demarco, and six to Ireland and five to England working mainly with art critic Caroline Tisdall and Troubled Image Group artist Robert McDowell and others in the detailed formulation of the Free International University for Creativity and Interdisciplinary Research that was presented iat Dokumenta 6 in 1977, in London in 1978 and Edinburgh in 1980 as well as many other iterations. In Edinburgh, {{at the end of the}} 1970s the FIU became one of four organisations that together founded the German Green Party. Beuys became entranced by the periphery of Europe as a dynamic counter in culture and economy terms to Europe's centralisation and this included linking Europe's energies North-South to Italy and East West in the Eurasia concept, with special emphasis on Celtic traditions in landscape, poetry, myths that also define Eurasia. In his view anything that survives as art and ideas and beliefs including the great religions for centuries or millennia contain eternal truths and beauty. The truth of ideas and of 'thinking as form', the sculpture of energies across a wide and variegated spectrum from mythos and spirituality to materialism, Socialism and Capitalism, and of 'creativity = capital' encompassed for him the study of geology, botany, and animal life and finding meanings and precepts in all of these as much as in the study of society. philosophy and he human condition and in his art practice as 'Social Sculpture'. He adopted and developed a gestalt way of examining and working with both organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>substances</b> and human social elements, following Leonardo, Loyola, Goethe, Steiner, Joyce, and many other artists and, scientists and thinkers, working with all visible and invisible aspects comprising a totality of cultural, moral and ethical significance as much as practical or scientific value. These trips inspired many works and performances. Beuys considered Edinburgh with its Enlightenment history as a laboratory of inspirational ideas. It was when visiting Loch Awe and Rannoch Moor on his May 1970 visit to Demarco he first conceived the necessity of the 7,000 Oaks work. After making the Loch Awe sculpture, at Rannoch Moor he began what became the Celtic (Kinlock Rannoch) Scottish Symphony performance, developed further in Basel the next year as Celtic+. The performance in Edinburgh includes his first blackboard that later appears in many performances when in discussions with the public. With it and his Eurasian staff he is a transmitter and despite long periods of imperturbable stillness interspersed by Christiansen's 'sound sculptures' he also creates dialogue evoking artists thoughts and in discussion with spectators. He collected gelatin representing crystalline stored energy of ideas that had been spread over the wall. In Basel the action including washing the feet of seven spectators. He immersed himself in water with reference to Christian traditions and baptism and symbolized revolutionary freedom from false preconceptions. He then as in Edinburgh pushed a blackboard across the floor alternately writing or drawing on it for his audience. [...] He put each piece in a tray and as the tray became full he held it above his head and convulsed causing the gelatin to fall on him and the floor. He followed this with a quiet pause. He stared into emptiness for over half an hour, fairly still in both performances. During this time he had a lance in his hand and was standing by the blackboard where he had drawn a grail. His stance was a protective one. After this he repeated each action in the opposite order ending with the washing with water as a final cleansing. The performances were filled with Celtic symbolism with various interpretation or historical influences. This extended in 1972 with the performance Vitex Agnus Castus in Naples of combining female and male elements and evoking much else and that extended further with I Like America and America Likes Me to have a performance dialogue with the original energy of America represented by the endangered yet highly intelligent coyote. In 1973, in Edinburgh, Beuys worked with Buckminster Fuller in Demarco's 'Black & White Oil Conference, where Beuys talked of 'The Energy Plan of the Western Man' using blackboards in open discussion with audiences at Demarco's Forrest Hill Schoolhouse. In the 1974 Edinburgh Festival, Beuys performed Three Pots for the Poorhouse again using gelatin in Edinburgh's ancient poorhouse, continuing the development begun with Celtic Kinloch Rannoch. He met there Tadeusz Kantor directing Lovelies and Dowdies and was at Marina Abramovitz's first ever performance. In 1976, Beuys performed In Defence of the Innocent at the Demarco Gallery where he stood for the imprisoned gangster and sculptor Jimmy Boyle in a manner associating Boyle with The Coyote. In 1980 Edinburgh Festival Beuys was at the FIU exhibition and performed Jimmy Boyle Days (the name of the blackboards he used in public discussions), and where he went on temporary hunger strike as a public protest and led with others in a legal action against the Scottish Justice system. This was the first case under the mew European Human Rights Act. These eight performances should be understood as one continuum ...|$|E
