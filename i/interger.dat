In this paper, {{we propose}} a low {{complexity}} integer frequency offset estimation {{scheme based on}} coherence phase bandwidth for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The proposed scheme overcomes {{the effect of the}} timing offset via correlating the local and received OFDM training symbols in a coherence phase bandwidth block unit. Moreover, by utilizing a threshold to determine an <b>interger</b> frequency offset etimate, the proposed scheme need not calculate correlation values for all possible <b>interger</b> frequency offset candidates. From numerical results, it is demonstrated that the proposed scheme can estimate the integer freqeuncy offset with a reduced complexity while minataining the same level of the estimation performance...|$|E

This {{is one of the}} classic problems in algorithmic graph theory. In this paper we present an determinstic linear time and linear space algorithm for undirected SSSP. We assume that the weights are <b>intergers</b> each stored in one word. Since 1959, all developments in SSSP have been based in Dijkstra's algorithm [Dij 59]. For each vertex we have a super distance D(v) d(v). Moreover, we have a set S ` V such that 8 v 2 S : D(v) = d(v). Initially, S = fsg and D(s) = d(s) = 0.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown by F. E. Diederichsen that for {{integral}} representations of a finite group, the irreducible constituents in any complete reduction are note necessarily unique up to order and unimodular equivalence. In this same article, it is shown that for certain finite groups, such as the cyclic group of order 4, there are infinitely many classes of indecomposable representations under unimodular equivalence. A natural method for studying these problems of arithmetical representation theory would be the P-adic approach. As {{a first step in}} this direction, using the methods of Hensel and R. Brauer, we will show that the theory of representations of a finite group, over a ring of P-adic integers can always be brought back to the modular case, insofar as it is concerned with questions of unimodular equivalence, reduction and deomposition.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{analysis of}} Perdew and Levy, and Sham and Schluter {{shows that the}} functional derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation density functional plays {{a critical role in}} the correct prediction of band gaps, or the chemical hardness. In a recent work by the present authors, explicit expressions for band gap prediction with all common types of exchange-correlation functionals have been derived without invoking the concept of exchange-correlation energy functional derivative discontinuity at all. We here analyze the two approaches and establish their connection and difference. The present analysis further leads to several important results: (1) The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) in DFT has as much meaning in describing electron addition as the highest occupied molecular orbital in describing electron removal. (2) Every term in the total energy functional contribute to the energy gap because of the discontinuity of the derivative of density/density matrix with respect to the number of electron, at <b>intergers.</b> (3) Consistent with the Perdew-Levy-Sham-Schluter conclusion that the exact Kohn- Sham energy gap differ from fundamental band gap by a finite correction due to the functional derivative discontinuity of the exchange-correlation energy, we show that the exchange-correlation functional cannot be a continuous explicit functional of the electron density, either local or nonloal. The last result is further strengthened, when we consider Mott insulator. There, the exact exchange-correlation functional needs to have an explicitly discontinuous dependence on the density or the density matrix.

40|$|The {{study of}} q-analogues of the Cartan domains (irreducible bounded {{symmetric}} domains) was initiated by S. Sinel’shchikov and L. Vaksman in [SV]. In particular, for any Cartan domain they defined the ∗-algebra Pol(G− 1) q, a q-analogue of the polynomial algebra on the prehomogenous vector space G− 1, {{and set a}} problem on investigation of their representations. The theory of representations of the ∗-algebras corresponding to domains of rank 1 is well-understood. In this paper our purpose is to study such representations {{for one of the}} popular Cartan domains of rank 2, the matrix ball in the space Mat 2, 2 of complex 2 × 2 matrices. Following [SSV] we will denote this ∗-algebra by Pol(Mat 2, 2) q. A description of Pol(Matm,n) q, m, n ∈ N in terms of generators and relations is given in [SSV]. In the paper we classify all irreducible representations of Pol(Mat 2, 2) q by bounded operators on a Hilbert space. The method which we use here is based on the study of some dynamical system arising on a spectrum of a commutative ∗-sublgebra of Pol(Mat 2, 2) q or a set which contains the spectrum (see [OS]). Note that the ∗-algebra has also unbounded ∗-representation. One can easily define a well-behaved class of such unbounded representations and classify them up to unitary equivalence using the same technique. In the paper we use the following standard notations: R is the set of real numbers, R + is the set of nonegative real numbers, Z denotes the set of <b>intergers,</b> Z + = { 0, 1, 2, [...] . }. Let q ∈ (0, 1).

It has frequently been assumed that the activation of aconitase with Fe 2 + produces an active site containing a single ferrous ion. The data reported here suggest that a ferrous ion is used to rebuild a [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster...|$|E

In applications where {{the components of the}} data are necessarily nonnegative such as chemical concentrations in experimental results or pixels in digital images, the NMF provides a more relevant interpretation of the results since it gives non-subtractive combinations of non-negative basis vectors. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for the NMF based on alternating non-negativity constrained least squares (NMF/ANLS) and the active set based fast algorithm for non-negativity constrained least squares with multiple right hand side vectors, and discuss its convergence properties and a rigorous convergence criterion based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In addition, we also describe algorithms for sparse NMFs and regularized NMF. We show how we impose a sparsity constraint on one of the factors by �� �-norm minimization and discuss its convergence properties. Our algorithms are compared to other commonly used NMF algorithms in the literature on several test data sets in terms of their convergence behavior. £�¥�§�©� � and � £�¥���©� �.

Foreman is whether A can be non-stationary in some ℵω and ℵω+ 1 preserving extension of V. It is shown here that if W is such an outer model, then { k < ω: cf W (ℵ V k) = ℵW n} is infinite, for each positive <b>interger</b> n. Let λ be a infinite cardinal and assume that 2 λ = λ +. Let 〈 aδ: δ < λ + 〉 list all of the bounded subsets of λ +. An ordinal α < λ + is approachable if there exists an unbounded x ⊆ α of order type cf(α) such that every proper initial segment of x {{is included in the}} list 〈 aδ: δ < α 〉. Modulo the non-stationary ideal on λ +, the definition of “approachable ” is independent of the enumeration 〈 aδ: δ < λ + 〉 of bounded subsets of λ +. The set of approachable ordinals cannot be very small. An easy observation is that, modulo the non-stationary ideal, every cofinality-ω ordinal below λ + is approachable. A result of Shelah [S 1] is that if λ is singular, then for each regular κ < λ, below λ + there exists a stationary set of cofinality-κ approachable ordinals...|$|E
