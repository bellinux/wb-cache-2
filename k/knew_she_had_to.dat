5|$|Burnham {{was born}} on May 11, 1861 on a Dakota Sioux Indian {{reservation}} in Minnesota, to a missionary family living near the small pioneer town of Tivoli (now gone), about 20 miles (32km) from Mankato. His father, the Reverend Edwin Otway Burnham, was a Presbyterian minister educated and ordained in New York; {{he was born in}} Ghent, Kentucky. His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in Iowa, having emigrated with her family from Westminster, England at the age of three. In the Dakota War of 1862, Chief Little Crow and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town New Ulm, Minnesota; Burnham's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time, so when Burnham's mother saw Sioux approaching her cabin dressed in war paint, she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave and could never escape carrying her baby. She hid Frederick in a basket of green corn husks in a corn field and fled for her life. Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed, she returned to find their house burned down, but the baby Frederick was safe, fast asleep in the basket with the corn husks.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were only}} 4 {{routines}} left for each gymnast to compete. With 2 down and 2 {{to go the}} places were now: Gnauck 1st, Davydova 2nd, Shaposhnikova and Comaneci joint 3rd. Nadia Comăneci then scored a 10 on bars, the only gymnast to receive a perfect score that night. (It was her first perfect score on bars in a major competition since the 1976 Olympics). Neil Admur, New York Times, 25 July 1980, A17, [...] "The drama on the final rotation added to the suspense. Miss Gnauck was second among the 9 gymnasts on the vault, Miss Davydova seventh on the bars and Miss Comaneci eight on the beam". Maxi Gnauck held the lead until her last routine when she vaulted insecurely. She scored 9.7, on a vault with a start value of 9.9, the same as she had scored for this vault at 1979 European Championships in Denmark and 79 World Championships in United States. Barry Lorge, Washington Post, 25 July 1980, p.9, [...] "Gnauck, first of the contenders up in the fourth and final rotation. Her first vault looked good but was too safe : 9.7. She <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do better but she buckled on the landing of her second vault". Peter Aykroyd, International Gymnastics : Sport, Art or Science ?, 1987, p.68, [...] "She went into the all-round finals with a slight lead, but weak vaulting lost her this advantage".|$|E

25|$|But Hester {{had been}} {{alienated from the}} Puritan society, both in her {{physical}} life and spiritual life. When Dimmesdale dies, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> move on because she can no longer conform to the Puritans' strictness. Her thinking is free from religious bounds and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> established her own different moral standards and beliefs.|$|R
60|$|Everyone looked rather {{blank and}} amazed, except the Story Girl. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, and <b>she</b> did it.|$|R
60|$|His {{mother did}} the same. She {{thought of the}} pain, of the morphia, of the next day; hardly ever of the death. That was coming, she <b>knew.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> submit to it. But she would never entreat it or make friends with it. Blind, with her face shut hard and blind, she was pushed towards the door. The days passed, the weeks, the months.|$|E
6000|$|The preacher smiled. It {{was a very}} {{engaging}} smile, Cissy thought, that lightened {{his hard}} mouth. It enabled her to take heart of grace, and presently to chatter like the very birds she had disparaged. Oh yes; she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{learn a great deal}} more. She had studied [...] "some" [...] already. She was taking lessons over at Point Concepcion, where her aunt had friends, and she went three times a week. The gentleman who taught her was not a Catholic, and, of course, he knew she was a Protestant. She would have preferred to live there, but her mother and father were both dead, and had left her with her aunt. She liked it better because it was sunnier and brighter there. She loved the sun and warmth. She had listened to what he had said about the dampness and gloom of the chapel. It was true. The dampness was that dreadful sometimes it just ruined her clothes, and even made her hoarse. Did he think they would really take his advice and clear out the woods round the chapel? ...|$|E
60|$|Now as Lady Harman {{listened to}} all this {{confused}} effective picturing of the great catering business which was {{the other side of}} her husband and which she had taken on trust so long, she had in her heart a quite unreasonable feeling of shame that she should listen at all, a shyness, as though she was prying, as though this really did not concern her. She <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> listen and still she felt beyond her proper jurisdiction. It is against instinct, it is with an enormous reluctance that women are bringing their quick emotions, their flashing unstable intelligences, their essential romanticism, their inevitable profound generosity into the world of politics and business. If only they could continue believing that all that side of life is grave and wise and admirably managed for them they would. It is not in a day or a generation that we shall un-specialize women. It is a wrench nearly as violent as birth for them to face out into the bleak realization that the man who goes out for them into business, into affairs, and returns so comfortably loaded with housings and wrappings and trappings and toys, isn't, as a matter of fact, engaged in benign creativeness while he is getting these desirable things.|$|E
60|$|She locked {{her door}} and opened her writing-desk. <b>Knowing</b> what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>she</b> tried to collect herself and do it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tricks? I don't understand!" [...] {{she said}} quietly, {{for she was}} not afraid. The {{passport}} was en regle: <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> nothing <b>to</b> fear.|$|R
50|$|Gabry and Catcher {{run away}} and climb a wall to get away. On the other side {{there is a big}} bridge covered with crashed cars and Mudo that goes over a valley filled with a horde of Mudo. Gabry <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> cross to escape, so she walks {{sideways}} along the tiny ledge {{on the outside of the}} bridge, holding onto the gate. There is a section that is almost all the way broken, and when the Recruiters follow, Catcher rolls cars to shift the weight of the bridge and eventually it crumbles so that the Recruiters can’t follow. Gabry and Catcher continue on, hoping to get to the Dark City.|$|R

5|$|There was {{a simpler}} {{performance}} on tape {{and a more}} difficult one, with Mariah singing out more, with more licks. But we chose a happy medium. The song really calls for not anything really fancy. But she's always fighting the forces inside of her because she's her own devil's advocate. She {{wants to do something}} that's so over the top and use her talents and the voice <b>she</b> <b>has.</b> But <b>she</b> also <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> restrain herself and do what the music really calls for.|$|R
5000|$|McGrady {{became a}} fan of Holby City {{while she was in}} a {{relationship}} with fellow actor Jalaal Hartley, who played Tom O'Dowd in the show from 2008 to 2009. She thought that it would [...] "a brilliant gig" [...] if she was cast in a role. When the character of Mary-Claire came up, McGrady <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> have the part.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a part of}} a {{study abroad}} program, she went to Trinidad to do an {{internship}} at a diplomat's office and at a record label. While she was there, she sang backup for a friend's band in front of over 80,000 people at the International Soca Monarch finals in 2002. According to Platten, from that moment on she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pursue music full-time.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking to The Daily Mail in November 2013, Elizabeth Banks stated: [...] "I play Brian’s second wife, Melinda, who he {{is still}} married to, and who {{essentially}} saved his life. … Brian suffers from a sort of paranoid schizophrenia, [...] and always has, but for years no one knew quite {{what to do to}} help him. … Melinda met Brian, {{fell in love with him}} and <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> save him from this doctor." [...] When finally free of Landy's grasp, Brian was rediagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.|$|E

50|$|Over at Comeback Canyon, it's {{time for}} Emmy and Chandra to face {{off on the}} scale. Emmy is up first and loses four pounds, or 1.65% weight loss. Chandra is still {{stinging}} from her meager one-pound weight loss last week, and <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> step it up {{to stay in the}} game. She needs to post at least six pounds to stay... and is shocked to see she's dropped seven! With her 2.16% weight loss, Chandra is safe for another week with Bob at Comeback Canyon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it?" [...] said Cornelia, not so {{much with}} preoccupation, perhaps, as with indifference. She thought it rather a nice name, but <b>she</b> did not <b>know</b> what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do with it.|$|R
5000|$|Pizzi {{says that}} as soon as she heard about the World Marathon Challenge, she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> run it.

Pizzi had never been to any continent besides North America. She first consulted her daughter, receiving criticism from her daughter's friends. Her daughter approved, saying: [...] "Mom, finish strong." ...|$|E

To prepare for the role, Akudolu went to a hospital and met with a heart consultant, who showed her {{how to use the}} instruments. She was also shown how to stitch by a woman in the show's prosthetics department. Mo's first episode was broadcast on 22 May 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Pinkie Pie—or [...] "Pinkamena Diane Pie"—grew up {{on a rock}} {{farm where}} she and her family enjoyed few pleasures. As she tended to the rocks one day, a rainbow-colored blast tore through the sky and briefly cleared away the clouds and curling up her once {{straight}} hair. At the sight of the rainbow that followed, Pinkie became elated and <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> share that feeling with others. Overnight, she set up a party in the farm's silo. When her family discovered this, Pinkie first thought she had disappointed them, but they all soon broke out into smiles and joined in the fun, causing Pinkie to earn her balloon cutie mark.|$|E

5000|$|Zavala {{had planned}} to wed Gustavo Arreola (marriage was a strong desire for her) but she broke off their {{engagement}} in 1901 because she felt {{a call to the}} religious life and believed that she was called to give assistance to the poor and the sick. Zavala and her spiritual director (and future Servant of God) Cipriano Iñiguez Martín del Campo both co-founded a new religious order on 13 October 1901 titled as the Handmaids of Santa Margherita Maria and the Poor. Zavala described her call to the religious life as a [...] "sudden change of heart" [...] that she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> follow. Zavala worked as a nurse and regardless of the poorness and the lack of material goods of the patients she was compassionate and caring towards the needs of the ill. Zavala was named as the Superior General for the new order.|$|E
50|$|When Matthew returned, Anna <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> confess before Donald told Matthew. Angry, Matthew {{initially}} {{dumped her}} but listened when she insisted she would turn {{her back on}} Donald, {{and asked him to}} marry her. He happily accepted, and the news was broken to Donald, Carl and Jimmy King (Nick Miles). The next day, Matthew proposed to Anna with an antique engagement ring as she moved her belongings to Home Farm. A party was planned, to celebrate both the engagement, and the successful deal with Polek Haulage. Donald crashed the party, announcing to everyone that Anna was only marrying Matthew to ruin the Kings from the inside. Matthew angrily retorted that Donald had tried to buy him off, and convinced his brothers that Donald was lying. Donald threatened Anna that he would disinherit her if she didn't break off the engagement, and she furiously insisted that she choose Matthew, and ordered him to leave. Hating to see his fiancee so upset, Matthew told Anna that the only thing that mattered was them, and planned to confront Donald alone.|$|E

Of course <b>she</b> <b>knows.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a new dress for it, and, we couldn't both have that. George couldn't afford it these hard times. And, as Bella said, it would be very foolish of me to get an {{expensive}} dress that would be no use to me afterward. But it doesn't matter. And, of course, somebody <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stay with the children." ...|$|R
