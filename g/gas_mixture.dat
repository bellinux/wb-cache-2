The spatial and temporal development of discharges in He/F 2 and Ne/F 2 <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> is monitored via its fluorescence using an intensified CCD camera with a gating time of 300 ps. The formation and development of discharge filaments in He/F 2 <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> is completely different from that in Ne/F 2. Under the same start up conditions, discharges in Ne/F 2 are dominated by cathode hotspots where as no hot spots are visible in discharges in He/F 2 <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures.</b> However, the discharges in Ne/F 2 <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{appear to be more}} uniform even though the discharge width decreases in time and hotspots are persistent on the cathode surface...|$|R

But experimental work relating to N 2 - SF 6 <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> is limited. In view of increasing application of <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures,</b> {{it is essential to}} understand the nature of by-products formed in <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Many recent studies have highlighted the advantages of using N 2 -SF 6 <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> as a replacement to SF 6 gas for High Voltage application, with a view to reduce emission of SF 6 gas into the atmosphere.

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), or {{tungsten inert gas}} (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode, an inert or semi-inert <b>gas</b> <b>mixture,</b> and a separate filler material.

For {{the first time the}} effects of hydrogen dilution of SiH 4 + NH 3 <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> on the a-Si 1 -xNx: H network is reported. We have observed that hydrogen dilution decreases hydrogen incorporation and increases nitrogen incorporation, promoting a higher connectivity of the a-Si 1 -xNx :H network.

5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers may {{be supplied}} with a <b>gas</b> <b>mixture</b> suitable for accelerated decompression by connecting a {{supply to the}} surface gas panel and connecting it through the valve system to the divers.

Surface supplied heliox bounce divers will be provided with mixtures suitable for their current depth, and the mixture may be changed several times during descent and ascent from great depths.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of Ar addition to SF 6 /O 2 <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{has been investigated}} for inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching of SiC {{with a view to}} improve both etch rate and etched surface microstructure. SiC etch rates have been studied as a function of Ar concentration, gas flow rates, applied ICP power, chuck power and chamber pressure. SiC etch rate, surface morphology, surface chemistry and etch profiles obtained in SF 6 /O 2 /Ar <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> have been compared with those of SiC-etched in SF 6 /O 2 <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> under similar conditions. It was found that, compared with SF 6 /O 2 (4 : 1) ICP-etched SiC in our studies, smoother surfaces and significant reduction of fluorine-related etch residues can be obtained by optimum Ar addition. SiC etch rate in SF 6 /O 2 <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures</b> can be increased by over 5 % with optimum Ar%. The highest SiC etch rate achieved here is approximately 500 nm/min in SF 6 /O 2 /Ar <b>gas</b> <b>mixtures.</b> The {{influence of}} Ar addition on the SiC etch profile has also been studied...|$|R

5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding <b>gas</b> <b>mixture,</b> argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
5|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} is {{a method}} by which diamond can be grown from a hydrocarbon <b>gas</b> <b>mixture.</b> Since the early 1980s, this method {{has been the subject}} of intensive worldwide research. Whereas the mass-production of high-quality diamond crystals make the HPHT process the more suitable choice for industrial applications, the flexibility and simplicity of CVD setups explain the popularity of CVD growth in laboratory research. The advantages of CVD diamond growth include the ability to grow diamond over large areas and on various substrates, and the fine control over the chemical impurities and thus properties of the diamond produced. Unlike HPHT, CVD process does not require high pressures, as the growth typically occurs at pressures under 27 kPa.|$|E
5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any <b>gas</b> <b>mixture</b> with them {{that is to be}} used on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders used for this purpose are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with the regulator pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E
