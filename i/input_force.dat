The friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment which presses the shoe even stronger {{on the rim}} thus leading to an amplified brake force.

25|$|A lever is a beam {{connected}} to ground by a hinge, or pivot, called a fulcrum. The ideal lever does not dissipate or store energy, which {{means there is}} no friction in the hinge or bending in the beam. In this case, the power into the lever equals the power out, and the ratio of output to <b>input</b> <b>force</b> is given by {{the ratio of the}} distances from the fulcrum to the points of application of these forces. This is known as the law of the lever.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{calculating the}} FRF for a massndash&springndash&damper {{system with a}} mass of 1nbsp&kg, spring {{stiffness}} of 1.93nbsp&N/mm and a damping ratio of 0.1. The values of the spring and mass give a natural frequency of 7nbsp&Hz for this specific system. Applying the 1nbsp&Hz square wave from earlier allows the calculation of the predicted vibration of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting vibration. It happens in this example that the fourth harmonic of the square wave falls at 7nbsp&Hz. The frequency response of the massndash&springndash&damper therefore outputs a high 7nbsp&Hz vibration even though the <b>input</b> <b>force</b> had a relatively low 7nbsp&Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting vibration is dependent on both the forcing function and the system that the force is applied to.|$|E

In clinical practice, observations of intraventricular blood pressures are too sparse and noisy. In spite of many efforts which are aimed to recover intracardiac electrical excitations from body surface potentials [39], the coupling of electrical excitations and active forces remain unknown in clinical practice because of difficulties. So {{it is a good}} strategy to assume the whole <b>input</b> <b>forces</b> to the cardiac system are a Gaussian random variable, which represents the unobservable nature. The uncertainties of <b>input</b> <b>forces</b> could be removed or reduced if new observations of <b>input</b> <b>forces</b> can be reliably collected in clinical practice in the future.

30|$|Inspired by {{the work}} [33] of input {{estimation}} in the inverse heating problem without the time history of external input, we proposed a biomechanical constrained sequential filtering framework which performs multiframe estimation of the nonrigid myocardial kinematic function and external loads of system simultaneously from medical image sequence. Our work is also developed from earlier works like the state-space-based motion recovery algorithms with the external loads constructed from boundaries [21, 24] and model-based filtering framework with external loads simulated from an electromechanical coupling model [30]. Contrary to previous approaches using deterministic approximation of external loads, our proposed framework treats external loads as a stochastic input after the biomechanical model is converted into a stochastic state-space representation, which is more rational because of largely unknown knowledge of external loads of each patient's heart. Since the external loads in our approach are treated as a stochastic variable, we start to call external loads as <b>input</b> <b>forces</b> from here, which is a proper description in the stochastic control theory [22]. Therefore, the main difference of our work to previous multiframe estimation efforts is that rather than making ad hoc mathematical assumptions {{on the behavior of}} <b>input</b> <b>forces,</b> we allow uncertainties inside <b>input</b> <b>forces</b> because of unobservable loading condition of the heart, which is a better description of clinical situation from the stochastic control theory point of view. To achieve optimal estimation, we cyclically feed the updated estimation of <b>input</b> <b>forces</b> and imaging-derived data into the filtering framework until reaching largely data-driven convergence: a Kalman filter is first used to generate the residual innovation sequences without <b>input</b> <b>forces,</b> followed by a recursive least-square filter which is derived to use the sequences of residual innovation to compute values of <b>input</b> <b>forces</b> to the myocardium. Finally, myocardial kinematic function can be recovered by using the estimated <b>input</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|R

In this paper, we present a multiframe estimation framework which simultaneously recovers the cardiac motion parameters and the <b>input</b> <b>forces</b> from periodic medical image sequences. It is realized through a Kalman filter which generates the residual innovation sequences, followed by an on-line recursive least-squares filter that uses the residual innovation sequences to compute the values of <b>input</b> <b>forces</b> and to correct the estimations of cardiac kinematic functions.

30|$|The {{conventional}} Kalman filtering strategy {{consists of}} two steps: prediction and correction. The successful place of the conventional Kalman filtering strategy is computing the estimated state variables between predictions and measurements in minimum mean square sense. However, the predictions generated by the model could be faulty if the input term of the model is wrongly added, and then the error of estimations could be dominated by the imperfect predictions. In the case of myocardial dynamics, it will demand arduous work, including tremendous experiments, to determine patient's loading condition, which is not feasible in daily clinical practice. So {{it is reasonable to}} treat the loading, that is, <b>input</b> <b>forces,</b> of the heart as stochastic sources. In our particular application, it can be easily seen that the response of the cardiac system will vary largely with different loading conditions from (4). The forces constructed from boundaries or image features are obviously different from the real situation in the myocardium and a minor error from these image-derived forces could be amplified by (4) easily. Since the patient-specific observations of <b>input</b> <b>forces</b> in the cardiac system are still unavailable, it is meaningful to handle the uncertainties in <b>input</b> <b>forces</b> and measurements simultaneously, which can increase the accuracies of estimated state variables if estimated <b>input</b> <b>forces</b> are closed to ground truth.|$|R
