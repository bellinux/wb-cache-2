"The Bishop Revival" [...] {{revealed}} that the seahorse shown in promotions since the series began {{was in fact a}} genetically encoded [...] "signature" [...] created by Walter's father Dr. Robert Bishop. In an interview after the episode's broadcast, consulting producer Akiva Goldsman cited [...] "The Bishop Revival" [...] when discussing the use of flashbacks in Fringe; he stated his disinclination to use too many flashbacks in the series, explaining [...] "I think flashbacks are really useful and {{there are a couple of}} places where it will be useful. But fundamentally, no, I don't think we're a show that will be doing a lot of jumping back in time despite the single horde of calls for the 'Walter's Grandfather Nazi Hunting' series. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>not,</b> but it was fun to do [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Derrickson chose Nepal as a {{location}} to feature an [...] "Eastern city" [...] {{that would not}} be familiar to most audiences. After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event [...] "was {{all the more reason to}} shoot there". Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was [...] "absolutely vital to this film, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>not</b> least because it’s so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It’s important to a film like this—which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension—that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous." [...] The eventual filming locations around the Kathmandu Valley included the Pashupatinath and Swayambhunath Temples; Thamel and New Road in Kathmandu; and the Patan Durbar Square in Patan.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Fuller's death, her {{importance}} faded. Her obituary in {{the newspaper}} she had once edited, the Daily Tribune, said that her works had a few great sentiments, [...] "but as a whole they must commend themselves mainly by their vigor of thought and habitual fearlessness rather than freedom of utterance". As biographer Abby Slater wrote, [...] "Margaret had been demoted {{from a position of}} importance in her own right to one in which her only importance was in the company she kept". Years later, Hawthorne's son Julian wrote, [...] "The majority of readers will, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>not</b> be inconsolable that poor Margaret Fuller has at last taken her place with the numberless other dismal frauds who fill the limbo of human pretension and failure." [...] In the 20th century, American writer Elizabeth Hardwick, former wife of Robert Lowell, wrote an essay called [...] "The Genius of Margaret Fuller" [...] (1986). She compared her own move from Boston to New York to Fuller's, saying that Boston was not a good place for intellectuals, despite the assumption that it was the best place for intellectuals.|$|E

2500|$|On August 17, 2005, {{he became}} the first senator to call for the {{withdrawal}} of troops from Iraq and urge that a timetable for that withdrawal be set. He called other Democrats [...] "timid" [...] for refusing to take action sooner, and suggested December 31, 2006, as the date for total withdrawal of troops. On the subject of Bush's assertion that a deadline would be helpful to Iraqi insurgents, Feingold said, [...] "I think he's wrong. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>not</b> talking about endgames is playing into our enemies' hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Barack Obama {{stated in}} June 2012: [...] "What I've said is, let's make {{long-term}} spending cuts; let's initiate long-term reforms; let's reduce {{our health care}} spending; let's make sure that we've got a pathway, a glide-path to fiscal responsibility, {{but at the same}} time, let's not under-invest in the things {{that we need to do}} right now to grow.

2500|$|When Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal {{suggested}} that the attacks were {{an indication that the}} United States [...] "should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the Palestinian cause", Giuliani asserted, [...] "There is no moral equivalent for this act. There is no justification for it... And one of the reasons I think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the United States, like Israel, and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>not</b> only are those statements wrong, they're part of the problem." [...] Giuliani subsequently rejected the prince's $10 million donation to disaster relief {{in the aftermath of the}} attack.|$|E
2500|$|Elbegdorj {{has long}} been an {{advocate}} for women's rights and more proportional representation of women in decision making level of governments. He stressed the importance of women in leadership, highlighting the three-fold increase of women representatives elected in the 2012 Mongolian parliamentary elections in his speech at the UN General Assembly in September 2012. [...] "We need more women leaders. Women tend to see the whole picture. For society to advance, we need more women in public service at all levels – local to global. They bring an unique perspective often missing in global challenges," [...] Elbegdorj said [...] "Have you ever heard of a woman bloody dictator or tyrant? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>not.</b> If there were more women in power, I think we would have more harmony, more engagement and less suffering and less conflict." ...|$|E
2500|$|Years later, Ripken {{admitted}} to having written the expletive on the bat; however, he claimed he did it to distinguish it as a batting practice bat, and {{did not intend to}} use it for the card. He went on to say, [...] "I can't believe the people at Fleer couldn't catch that. I mean, they certainly have to have enough proofreaders to see it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>not</b> only did they see it, they enhanced it. That writing on that bat is way too clear. I don't write that neat. I think they knew that once they saw it, they could use the card to create an awful lot of stir." [...] Some collectors list the card as the [...] "Rick Face" [...] card, as they claim that the proximity between the letters appears to make the word [...] "FUCK" [...] look similar to [...] "RICK".|$|E

2500|$|For Justice Stevens, {{speech that}} {{embodied}} a religious purpose fell into three categories. [...] One category included speech that approached a particular topic from a religious perspective. [...] Another category included speech that [...] "amounts to worship, or its equivalent." [...] Between these two categories, Stevens posited a third category—religious proselytizing. [...] This case, then, involved a government entity attempting {{to open its}} facilities to allow the first category of religious speech on its property but not the other two categories. [...] Distinguishing speech from a religious viewpoint, on the one hand, from religious proselytizing, on the other, is comparable to distinguishing meetings to discuss political issues from meetings whose principal purpose is to recruit new members to join a political organization. [...] If a school decides to authorize afterschool discussions of current events in its classrooms, it may not exclude people from expressing their views simply because it dislikes their particular political opinions. [...] But must it therefore allow organized political groups—for example, the Democratic Party, the Libertarian Party, or the Ku Klux Klan—to hold meetings, the principal purpose of {{which is not to}} discuss the current-events topic from their own unique point of view but rather to recruit others to join their respective groups? [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>not.</b> [...] Such recruiting meetings may introduce divisiveness and tend to separate young children into cliques that undermine the school's educational mission. [...] School officials may reasonably believe that evangelical meetings designed to convert children to a particular religious faith may pose the same risk. [...] Even if the Club's speech was not properly classified as religious worship, it certainly was religious proselytism, and the school was within its rights to exclude the Club from campus.|$|E

Well, prithee be plain with me, and tell me the reason and ground of thy discouragement. Why, says the sinner, though God forbids me not, and though I am willing to come faster, yet there naturally ariseth this, and that, and the other thought in my heart, that hinders my speed to Jesus Christ. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am <b>not</b> chosen; sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am <b>not</b> called; sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am come too late; and sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>not</b> {{what it is to}} come.
