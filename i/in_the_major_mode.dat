5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace con delicatezza – Trio. The {{first part}} of the scherzo proper cadences not in the tonic or dominant, but in the subdominant. The second, B part, {{continues}} to modulate by ascending fourths, until it reaches the key of D-flat major. In this key, a new theme is presented, emphasizing the local subdominant (G-flat major, a further fourth upward) – first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>mode,</b> then in the minor, with an enharmonic shift to F-sharp minor. This harmonic excursion eventually leads, through A major and a B diminished triad, back to the tonic and the opening section. The trio is in binary form and in B-flat minor, the first presentation of the tonic minor in the sonata.|$|E
5|$|II. Andantino in F-sharp minor, A–B–A form. The A section {{presents}} a sparse, lamenting, poignant melody, full of sighing gestures (portrayed by descending seconds). This theme, despite its vastly different character, references the opening {{bars of the}} Allegro, an aforementioned source {{of much of the}} sonata's material – the Andantino's first measure shares with the fanfare a second-beat bass note 'echo' after the downbeat on A, creating an audible rhythmic affinity; additionally, the quiet close of the A theme features the fanfare's characteristic pattern of stepwise thirds in the middle voices enclosed between tonic octaves. The middle section is of an improvisatory, fantasia-like character, with extremely harsh modulations and sonorities, culminating in C-sharp minor with fortissimo chords. The chromaticism, triplet emphasis, and modulatory patterns of this section are all reminiscent of the developments nested within the Allegro's exposition. After the C-sharp minor climax (according to Fisk, a key of great importance in the cycle due to its relation to Der Wanderer), a recitative section with startling sforzando outbursts emphasizing an ascending minor second leads to a serene phrase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>mode</b> (C-sharp major), which in turn leads (as the dominant of F-sharp minor) back to the A section, here somewhat transformed, with new accompanimental figuration. The final bars of the movement feature rolled chords that prefigure the opening of the following Scherzo.|$|E

It matches the Sunday's {{prescribed}} reading, the Parable of the Great Banquet from the Gospel of Matthew. The first and last stanza are used unchanged in both text and tune: the former is treated as a chorale fantasia, the latter as a four-part closing chorale. An unknown librettist paraphrased the inner stanzas as recitatives and arias, quoting one stanza of the hymn within a recitative. Bach scored the cantata for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of different flutes and oboes, strings and continuo.

40|$|Abstract Pacific low-frequency {{variability}} (timescale> 8 years) {{exhibits a}} well-known El Niño-like pattern of basin-scale sea surface temperature, which is found <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>modes</b> of Pacific decadal climate. Using {{a set of}} climate model experiments and observations, we decompose the mechanisms contributing to the growth, peak, and decay of the Pacific low-frequency spatial variance. We find that the El Niño-like interdecadal pattern is established through the combined actions of Pacific meridional modes (MM) and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Specifically, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growth phase of the pattern, subtropical stochastic excitation of the MM energizes the tropical low-frequency variance acting as a red noise process. Once <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropics, this low-frequency variance is amplified by ocean-atmospheric feedbacks as the pattern reaches its peak phase. At the same time, atmospheric teleconnections distribute the variance from the tropics to the extratropics, where the pattern ultimately decays. In this stochastic red noise model of Pacific climate, the timescale of the extra-tropical/tropical interactions (1 – 2 years) permits the stochastic excitation of the ENSO-like pattern of decadal and interdecadal variance. 1...|$|R

With standard voice leading, the chord is followed directly or indirectly by some form of the dominant chord, in which both 6 and 4 have resolved to the fifth scale degree (henceforth 5). This tendency to resolve outwards to 5 is why the interval is spelled as an augmented sixth, rather than enharmonically as a minor seventh (6 and 5).

40|$|Public events differ {{mainly in}} size and nature {{including}} duration and location. The transport issues arising during public events are provision of traveller information, parking and public transport, management of traffic and reduction of community impact. The stakeholders concerned with public events {{have an important role}} to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> transport planning process. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a framework for planning public events for organisers and local councils <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> transport issues. The output will be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of checklists for promoters, local councils, transport operators, traffic managers and the Police Department. This study involved a review of available literature on transport aspects of public events and examined events at both ends of the spectrum of event sizes, namely small scale and large scale events. Small scale events are dependent on the existing supply of transport services <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>mode</b> of transport is private transport. On the other hand, large scale events are greatly dependent on the existing and additional supply of transport <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>mode</b> of transport is still private transport, but public transport plays an important role. Administrative procedures for public events vary from local council to local council. Implementation of uniform local law pertaining to public events is currently under preparation in some local councils. However, it does not adequately address <b>the</b> transport issues. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of small scale events, organisers must submit their application to the relevant local council, prior to the event, preferably four weeks before the event. The local council consults with the Police, local residents and local businesses and approves the public event. On the other hand, the administrative procedures for large scale public events are similar to small scale events except planning span, appointment of event co-ordinator and the need to organise additional supply of public transport services. A municipal survey of the administrative procedures used to manage small scale public events, a vehicle occupancy survey during a cricket match and travel survey during a cricket and a football match were conducted and the results were analysed. The municipal survey has highlighted the extent to which municipalities follow a regulated procedure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of approving small scale public events. Within the time scale of this project, it has not been possible to explore <b>in</b> depth, <b>the</b> effectiveness of the various procedures.

5000|$|For example, pieces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>mode</b> {{commonly}} modulate up a fifth to the dominant; for a key with sharps in {{the signature}} {{this leads to}} a key whose key signature has an additional sharp.

To write that passage with a new key signature would require recasting the new section using the enharmonically equivalent key signature of A major. An example of such recasting is Claude Debussy's Suite bergamasque: in the third movement [...] "Clair de lune" [...] the key shifts for a few measures from D major to D minor (eight flats), but the passage is notated in C minor (four sharps) for ease of reading; the same happens in the final movement [...] "Passepied", which reaches theoretical G major written as A major.|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} held that {{happiness}} and sadness in music {{are associated with}} two struc-tural properties: tempo (i. e., the number of beats per minute) and mode (i. e., the spe-cific arrangement of intervals among the subset of pitches used to write a given musical excerpt). More specifically, fast tempi tend to evoke a happy tone, whereas slow tempi tend to evoke a sad tone. 1 – 3 Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>mode</b> is associated with happiness, and the minor mode is associated with sadness. 4 There is compelling evidence that the manipulation of tempo and mode affect happy–sad judgments in adults. 5 Yet, it is less clear at what stage of development lis-teners become sensitive to these manipulations. The capacity to detect changes in tempo seems to be present very early in life, before one year of age; 6, 7 nevertheless, sensitivity to tempo has never been considered separately from mode in developmen-tal studies of emotions. By contrast, the ability to emotionally respond to mode has been studied independently from tempo and {{has been found to}} emerge later, around the age of seven to eight years. 8, 9 However, there are theoretical and empirical grounds for thinking that mode, as well as tempo, may be present very early <b>in</b> de-velopment. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>mode</b> is viewed as more consonant than the minor mode. 10 Since sensitivity to consonance emerges within the first year of life, 11 {{it is likely that the}} capacity to analyze mode will appear earlier than seven years of age.

To supplement {{our knowledge}} about the binding mode of the different DNA-bending proteins observed across the three domains of life, we present here the first model of a complex <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> monomeric Methanogen Chromosomal protein 1 (MC 1) from Euryarchaea binds to the concave side of a strongly bent DNA. In laboratory growth conditions MC 1 is the most abundant architectural protein present in Methanosarcina thermophila CHTI 55. Like most proteins that strongly bend DNA, MC 1 is known to bind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minor groove. Interaction areas for MC 1 and DNA were mapped by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data. The polarity of protein binding was determined using paramagnetic probes attached to the DNA. The first structural model of the DNA-MC 1 complex we propose here was obtained by two complementary docking approaches and is in good agreement with the experimental data previously provided by electron microscopy and biochemistry. Residues essential to DNA-binding and -bending were highlighted and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. It {{was found that the}} Arg 25 side-chain was essential to neutralize the negative charge of two phosphates that come very close in response to a dramatic curvature of the DNA...|$|R
