5|$|Although (reportedly) {{molybdenum}} {{was deliberately}} alloyed with steel in one 14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ca. 1330), that art was never employed widely {{and was later}} lost. In the West in 1754, Bengt Andersson Qvist <b>examined</b> <b>a</b> sample of molybdenite and determined {{that it did not}} contain lead and thus was not galena.|$|E
5|$|Combined Operations <b>examined</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} options while {{planning}} {{the destruction of}} the dock. At this stage of the war the British government still tried to avoid civilian casualties. This ruled out a bombing attack by the RAF, which at the time did not possess the accuracy needed to destroy the dock without serious loss of civilian life.|$|E

5|$|Scientist Bill Austin of Khoyatan Marine Lab in the Northeast Pacific <b>examined</b> <b>a</b> video {{made during}} the National Geographic dives to {{identify}} the benthic flora and fauna of Bowie Seamount.

5|$|Birt, Hogg, and Dubé <b>examined</b> <b>a</b> {{family with}} a {{hereditary}} thyroid cancer and discovered {{that many of the}} members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. The first case of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; the first case of renal cancer followed in 1993 and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999. It was formerly thought that people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome were at higher risk for colorectal polyps and neoplasms, but this has been disproven. The BHD Foundation supports research into the syndrome and holds regular symposia in BHD and related disorders for researchers, clinicians, and family members.|$|E

5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally <b>examined</b> <b>a</b> cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{most cases}} of {{fluoride}} poisoning {{have been caused}} by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste. One regional study <b>examined</b> <b>a</b> year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.|$|E
5|$|In January 1917, Crawford {{successfully}} {{applied to}} join the RFC as an observer with the 23rd Squadron, which flew over enemy lines to make observations and draw maps. On his maiden flight, the German Army opened fire on his aircraft, and his right foot was pierced by bullets and badly injured. To recuperate, he spent time at various hospitals in France and England before {{being sent to the}} RFC Auxiliary Hospital at the Heligan estate in Cornwall. During this time in England he spent a weekend at Wells's home in Dunmow, Essex, embracing the latter's desire for a united world government and the idea that writing about global history was a contribution to that cause. While at Heligan, Crawford began work on a book, Man and his Past, in which he <b>examined</b> <b>a</b> broad sweep of human history from an archaeological and geographical perspective.|$|E

5|$|The RAWCF first <b>examined</b> <b>a</b> {{design by}} Captain Adrian Jones, who had {{produced}} the Boer War Cavalry Memorial {{a few years}} before, but his design was rejected. Next, the committee contacted the artists Sir Edwin Lutyens, Herbert Baker and Sir Aston Webb. Lutyens sent in three designs, each costed at less than £15,000 (less than £607,000 in 2009 terms), but they were felt to be too similar to the Cenotaph and to give insufficient prominence to the artillery. After the RAWCF insisted that a howitzer be prominently incorporated into the designs, Lutyens withdrew. Baker disagreed {{with the concept of}} single service monuments, but submitted a proposal costed at over £25,000 (over £1,010,000 in 2009 terms), which was declined; Baker subsequently withdrew from the project. Webb declined to submit a proposal and also withdrew.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} offered Jovanović {{the opportunity}} {{to make a name for}} himself as a serious history painter, given that the subject of the work was an event of international significance and the painting was to be displayed in a foreign capital. To ensure Migration of the Serbs was historically accurate, Jovanović studied authentic medieval weapons, costumes and other objects, later incorporating them into the composition. He also studied medieval histories, collected ethnographical evidence and consulted historians. Notably, the Church asked the historian and Orthodox priest Ilarion Ruvarac to consult Jovanović on the historical details of the migration and accompany him on a visit to the monasteries of Fruška Gora, where the young artist <b>examined</b> <b>a</b> number of contemporary sources and objects from the time.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{tenure at}} the aerodrome began ominously. The same day he was granted a request to travel as an {{observer}} in a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2, disaster struck which could conceivably have ended his career. Instructed to familiarise himself with the aircraft around the airfield he <b>examined</b> <b>a</b> Caudron Type A, and proceeded {{to turn over the}} engine. The aircraft was listed as unserviceable and McCudden saw no danger in leaving the throttle fully open. Suddenly the engine started and it accelerated out of the hangar and into a Farman MF.11. McCudden watched as the propeller chewed the wing to pieces and damaged his Commanding Officer's car which had been parked nearby. He was able to reach the cockpit and switch off the ignition but not before extensive damage had been done. For this misdemeanor he was brought before Colonel Frederick Sykes, commanding the RFC Military Wing. Sykes was pleased with his overall progress, which likely saved him, but sentenced McCudden to seven days detention and a forfeiture of 14 days pay for the incident. Five years later Sykes again met McCudden—then {{at the height of his}} fame—and chaffed him on the episode, even jokingly threatening to send him a bill for the car.|$|E
