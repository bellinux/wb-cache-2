40|$|In general, Scots {{have not}} shown {{an excess of}} {{confidence}} in their potential to learn languages. A school system which did not previously encourage the majority to study languages, but reserved them for a certain academic elite, has undoubtedly played its part in this. A study {{of a group of}} Open University language learners supports the view that it is mainly those with considerable school experience of language learning, and strong present links with the language who have the confidence and motivation to enter and remain in the adult language learning arena. Yet, Scotland has a rich historic and current multilingual profile which largely goes untapped and which could be of great benefit in raising language awareness and confidence about language learning. In a devolved Scotland, it now seems appropriate to widen participation, to make language learning a more inclusive domain, and to rekindle a previously discouraged polyglot mentality. An ideal opportunity presents itself to introduce new policies which would reverse negative cultural and <b>educational</b> <b>legacies</b> and enhance confidence in language identity and language learning potential. This would provide the means to a healthier and more open cultural and social dialogue, ensuring the democratic future of Scotland in the world at large...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{perennial}} {{challenge for}} {{universities and colleges}} is {{to keep pace with}} knowledge change by reconsidering their structural and resource commitments to various knowledge areas. Reflecting upon changes in the academic landscape of public higher education in the United States over the past quarter of a century, the author diagnoses a macro-trend whereby the dominant legitimating idea of public higher education has changed from higher education as a social institution to higher education as an industry. Three interrelated mechanisms are identified as having advanced this process: academic management, academic consumerism, and academic stratification. This pattern of academic restructuring reflects multiple institutional pressures. While public universities and colleges have increasingly come to rely on market discourse and managerial approaches in order to demonstrate responsiveness to economic exigencies, they may end up losing legitimacy as they move away from their historical character, functions, and accumulated heritage as educational institutions. Thus, responsiveness to compelling economic pressures that dominate contemporary organizational imperatives in an attempt to gain legitimacy in one dimension may result in loss for another. Wholesale adaptation to market pressures and managerial rationales could thereby subsume the discourse about the future of colleges and universities within a logic of economic rationality at a detriment to the longer-term <b>educational</b> <b>legacies</b> and democratic interests that have long characterized American public education...|$|R

Both processes push policy makers toward market-led policies on higher education, which causes problems, whether of higher education sustainability, or quality and competitiveness, or accessibility and equity.

Considering the importance of both current changing social conditions and past <b>educational</b> <b>legacies,</b> this research considers distributed models of leadership in open and distance higher education related to broader societal changes. Open and distance higher education may be an appropriate educational response to societal changes – are leadership models at work in this type of education as current and innovative as the model of education itself?

The state of developments in ODE across the globe was thoroughly explored. Interview transcripts were evaluated regarding positioning of institutions and programs in relation to other societal factors. In particular, the notion of distributed leadership was explored. In support of both the work of Bennett, et. al (2003) and the complexities of distance and distributed learning, the following concepts support the notion of leadership in distance and distributed organizations: leadership should be seen as a network of interacting individuals and partnerships; the organization and relations require flexibility and boundary openness; projects and activities will be characterized by dispersed complexity, variability and collaborative action through relationships; central support acts as a hub of distribution...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of three teacher-researcher {{studies carried out with}} the intention of showing teachers how to move beyond the monolingual paradigm to build upon linguistic and cultural diversity in their everyday practice. The monolingual paradigm is linked to ideologies regarding proficiency in English as the principle means of academic success and citizenship. These studies challenge this traditional way of viewing education by treating learning "as an emerging property of whole persons' legitimate peripheral participation in communities of practice" (Lave, 1991, p. 63), whether these are interest-based communities of practice beyond the classroom or bilingual communities of practice within the classroom. In order to recognize and explain this learning and inform teaching practices, I adopt a social semiotic approach in order to explore how meaning is constructed through language, and also through social interactions with all modern aspects of society, including gesture, image, performance, and music (Kress, 2012; van Leeuwen, 2005). I explore how these interactions allow youth to create diverse identities, beyond immigrant, refugee, limited English proficient, learner, and "other", in three educational arenas: 1) Outside of the classroom in interest-based communities of practice at school, 2) in a secondary dual-language content classroom, and 3) online in an educational transnational telecollaboration project. In all three studies I triangulate quantitative data of student participation and academic achievement with qualitative participant narratives and teacher-researcher observations. What results is insight into the impact of creating multimodal trajectories for youth to perform identities and knowledge as language users in schools, where historically messages of youth's social identities are ascribed in much more constricting ways (Harklau, 2003). Viewing these youth as language users, rather than learners, sends a message to both educators and youth that in education, identity formation trumps skills development, and this can lead to higher expectations, more engaging learning, and opportunities for youth to question race-language <b>educational</b> <b>legacies</b> (Malsbary, 2014; Wenger, 1998) ...|$|R

40|$|Education in {{contemporary}} Cameroon {{consists of two}} distinct unreformed systems inherited from colonial regimes which are unsuitable for modern Cameroon. Western Education was introduced in 1844 by the British Baptist Missionary Society and encouraged by colonial regimes (Germans 1884 - 1916, British and French 1916 - 1961). Since independence (1961), the failure to restructure education to reflect common national values has been identified by analysts with its colonial origins. Yet the different systems (Missions and colonial) had varying impacts and the inter-relationships between each system and Cameroonians differed. This study therefore examines whether {{the impact of the}} respective colonial and Missionary education systems alone can explain the present stalemate in Cameroon education or other factors are accountable. It assesses the role and motives of colonial regimes, Missions and Cameroonians in education and examines the impact of the different motives and inter-relationships on post-colonial attitudes to education. The central argument is that the current reform impasse cannot be explained by a single factor. The respective colonial and Mission education systems and the reactions of Cameroonians were examined chronologically, using mostly primary sources. It was found that the Germans and the British were liberal to Missions as against a stronger French control. The Germans' desire for a protestant Mission together with the British tolerance to foreign Missionary societies, sustained the Basel Mission. Cameroonian interests and attitudes also influenced the pattern of education. Finally, the constraints of global economic and political forces have reinforced the deadlock on institutional reforms. Thus the impact of the respective <b>educational</b> <b>legacies</b> and the perceptions and reactions of Cameroonians at different stages of educational growth are found to have combined with the socio-economic and political developments since independence to explain the stalemate. To attain educational change, this study recommends the importance of creating awareness among teachers and parents and the wider public on the need for reform. It also suggests that further research be conducted on pre-colonial attitudes to education and on Cameroon cultures to identify indigenous educational ideas with relevance to modem education as well as those traditional values that can enrich the educational system, and eventually generate common national and international interests. ...|$|R

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Luton, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyTeachers undergo changes in their beliefs, knowledge and practices on an individual level as {{they learn how to}} teach. If society undergoes significant change, as Hong Kong did during the transition from British to Chinese rule in 1997, then social groups within society such as teachers are likely to react to change in different and complex ways. The purpose of this investigation is to exam. ine the changes experienced by teachers of English in Hong Kong, with a focus on teachers who received their teacher preparation at one Hong Kong institution during the final years leading up to the transition. The educational, linguistic, social and political context of Hong Kong is first described through a study of the research literature and a number of theories and models of change are presented through which the findings of the investigation are analysed. The main sources of data for the investigation consist of questionnaire responses, interview transcriptions and lesson observation reports of trainee English teachers during and after graduation from a BA course in TESL at a Hong Kong university. The main conclusions of the investigation are: (i) Educational issues and particularly those affecting ELT became more high-profile and politicised in the lead up to and after the changeover. (ii) English teachers in Hong Kong experience conflict between their desired approaches and the realities and constraints of the Hong Kong teaching context. These constraints provide a common justification for lack of innovative behaviour and make it possible for teachers to put off being innovative in the classroom indefinitely. (iii) At the same time, English teachers in Hong Kong are becoming more empowered within the educational system in reaction to challenges to their competency and as they have realised that they can affect educational policy through individual and collective action. The findings suggest that colonial discourses as documented by Pennycook (1998) of English language teaching still persist in Hong Kong, as they have been shown to do in other post-colonial societies, and Hong Kong is undergoing a post-handover period of change as it struggles to synthesise the <b>educational</b> <b>legacies</b> of the colonial period with new initiatives adopted to address Hong Kong's changing educational and social needs.
