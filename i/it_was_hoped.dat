5|$|Digidesign {{was working}} on {{expanding}} ProTools from a single track to multitracking and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> {{that as many as}} 48 digital tracks could be synced and used to record. The computers used were mostly Apple Quadra 400/500 models and with a great effort by all, it was soon evident that magnetic tape would have to be used.|$|E
5|$|It was {{intended}} to penalize, by means of reduced Congressional representation, states that withheld the franchise from adult male citizens for any reason other than participation in crime. This, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped,</b> would induce the former slave states to recognize the political rights of the former slaves, without directly forcing them to do so—something that it was thought the states would not accept.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} {{of such an}} economic zone serves a larger part within the China Western Development policy. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> that the consolidation of three major cities into one zone would accelerate the development of other areas in Western China.|$|E
50|$|Kettle and {{his team}} created a {{building}} and masterplan that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> will revitalise an area of former industrial land 12 km from the city centre {{on the coast of}} the Gulf of Finland. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> that the complex will provide a blueprint for future sustainable design across Russia.|$|R

5|$|The {{secondary}} battery served several other roles. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> that a medium-calibre shell {{might be able}} to score a hit on an enemy dreadnought's sensitive fire control systems. It was also felt that the secondary armament could {{play an important role in}} driving off enemy cruisers from attacking a crippled battleship.|$|E
5|$|Another {{arm of the}} {{conspiracy}} was directed at the Indian troops who were serving in Middle East, while efforts were directed at drawing Afghanistan into the war {{on the side of}} the Central Powers, which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> would incite a nationalist or pan-Islamic uprising in India and destabilise the British recruiting grounds in Punjab and across India. After Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, her influence had declined, and it was Afghanistan that was at the time seen by Britain as the only power in the sub-continent capable of directly threatening India.|$|E
5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective Britain’s situation was likened to that which the Austrian Empire found itself in after it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866. As Austria was thereafter formally excluded from German affairs, so too would Britain be excluded from continental affairs {{in the event of}} a German victory. Yet afterwards, Austria-Hungary became a loyal ally of the German Empire in the pre-World War I power alignments in Europe, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> that Britain would come to fulfill this same role.|$|E

5|$|Hines {{thought it}} would be easier to enter the North from Canada and {{traveled}} there during the winter. Hines led the Northwest Conspiracy from Canada in the fall of 1864. Colonel Benjamin Anderson was involved in the plot, along with other Confederate soldiers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> that Hines and his men would be able to free the Confederate prisoners held at Camp Douglas in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Armour Research Foundation (ARF), {{based at}} the Illinois Institute of Technology, began {{studying}} the effects of nuclear explosions on the environment. These studies continued until 1962. In May 1958, ARF began covertly researching the potential consequences of an atomic explosion on the Moon. The main objective of the program, which ran {{under the auspices of}} the United States Air Force, which had initially proposed it, was to cause a nuclear explosion that would be visible from Earth. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> that such a display would boost the morale of the American people.|$|E
5|$|In August 1866 Morris {{joined the}} Burne-Jones family on their holiday in Lymington, while in August 1867 both {{families}} holidayed together in Oxford. In August 1867 the Morrises holidayed in Southwold, Suffolk, {{while in the}} summer of 1869 Morris took his wife to Bad Ems in Rhineland-Palatinate, central Germany, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> that the local health waters would aid her ailments. While there, he enjoyed walks in the countryside and focused on writing poetry.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> {{that the}} Air Force would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, {{it was left}} {{outdoors}} on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts. Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. Paul E. Garber of the Smithsonian Institution, became concerned about the Enola Gays condition, and on 10 August 1960, Smithsonian staff began dismantling the aircraft. The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, on 21 July 1961.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the final}} {{decision}} on {{the location of the}} new capital territory, the local landowners and residents of Queanbeyan looked favourably on the possibility of having the territory located nearby. Such a result, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped,</b> would bring improvements to local infrastructure, increase the demand for local goods and services, and raise land values. It was assumed that the existing freehold arrangements would remain, and that those whose land was not required for the city itself would {{be in a position to}} capitalise on the new circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Authority announced, in October 2009, that Cycle England {{would be}} {{investing}} £1.25million, {{to be spent}} by 2011, to build and improve cycle routes within the National Park for use by leisure and commuting cyclists. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> that this investment would help reduce traffic congestion and environmental pollution, as well as giving commuters and visitors {{a viable alternative to}} travelling around the National Park by car.|$|E

5|$|The South Circular Road {{was planned}} by the Ministry of Transport {{in the early}} 20th century {{as part of a}} general {{programme}} of traffic improvements across London. In 1903, a proposal for new approach roads was submitted to the Royal Commission on London Traffic, but was rejected. The Road Board was formed in 1910 to address traffic issues, which led to the London Arterial Road Conferences in 1913–14 that revived the earlier plans. Progress was halted because of the war, but resumed in 1920, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> it would find work for demobilised soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} architects Allward and Gouinlock and by the engineering firm Stone and Webster Canada, Ltd. in 1965. Colonel McLaughlin unveiled {{a model of the}} building at his 94th birthday celebration, which was held in his honour at the museum in September of that year. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> that the building would be open by Canada's centennial in 1967, but construction delays forced the opening to October 26, 1968.|$|E
5|$|The {{paradigm}} gave researchers {{license to}} study isolated problems and find solutions that were both verifiable and useful. It provided {{a common language}} to describe problems and share their solutions with each other, and with other fields that also used concepts of abstract agents, like economics and control theory. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> that a complete agent architecture (like Newell's SOAR) would one day allow researchers to build more versatile and intelligent systems out of interacting intelligent agents.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Conviction, {{the game}} {{would have no}} {{interactive}} torture sequences. Instead, players could choose whether to kill or incapacitate a target after interrogation. The system was not complex, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> that players would choose based on instinct. According to Béland, every player choice is gray {{and there are no}} right or wrong choices. However, the game demo has an interactive torture scene in which players can decide how deeply a knife penetrates a person's shoulder. After a mixed-to-negative response, Ubisoft removed the scene from its final product.|$|E
5|$|Allied naval commanders {{decided to}} use battleships to conduct a series of attacks against Japanese coastal cities in mid-1945. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> that the Japanese {{military}} would respond to these bombardments by attacking the Allied forces with the aircraft that were being held in reserve {{to respond to the}} planned invasion of Japan, thereby exposing these aircraft to destruction by Allied fighter aircraft. However, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal, and decided to not attack naval forces operating off Japan. Instead, the aircraft would remain in reserve until Allied landing operations in the home islands began.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was used for reference, and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoped</b> that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E
