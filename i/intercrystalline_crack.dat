40|$|High cycle {{fatigue crack}} {{propagation}} in grain boundaries was studied in precipitation hardened Al-Zn-Mg specimens containing a single grain boundary (gb) {{perpendicular to the}} load axis. In peak-aged bicrystals tested in wet nitrogen atmospheres, cracks propagated in an intercrystalline manner. Under cyclic loading conditions two different mechanisms contribute to crack propagation which are termed stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and intergranular corrosion fatigue (CF). In both cases, it is well established that <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>crack</b> propagation is influenced by hydrogen penetrating into the gb during each load cycle. For SCC it is the hydrogen dissolved into the gb, resp. areas close to the boundary whereas for CF it is the trapped hydrogen which initiates the intergranular cracking. Both terms will be discussed under microstructural aspects...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of ageing on fatigue fracture of the alloy Cu- 35 %Ni- 3. 5 %Cr has been investigated. Fatigue cracks propagate in all conditions investigated at first in an intercrystalline {{and later in}} a transcrystalline manner. The intercrystalline fraction of the fracture surface increases with increasing cycle number. This {{is the reason why}} the improvement of fatigue strength through ageing will be smaller with increasing cycle number, because precipitation hardening can be not fully utilized in the case of pronounced <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>crack</b> propagation. The transition from intercrystalline to transcrystalline crack propagation is determined by a certain stress intensity factor which increases with increasing alternating stress. Because of precipitation hardening, this transition is more difficult in decomposed conditions than in the solution-treated condition. This behaviour is discussed together with the density of microcracks at grain boundaries. (orig.) Reprinted from Int. J.

40|$|Experimental {{results on}} the fatigue damage of quasi defect-free {{materials}} in the VHCF range are presented. For nickel-based superalloys and pure nickel the likelihood of crack initiation at favorable grain morphologies is studied. Slip band and microcrack formation at the surface was observed even in run-out samples. Hence, microcracks were evaluated regarding their propagation capabilities according to grain orientation and barrier function of grain boundaries. In the VHCF regime crack initiation can shift from surface to subsurface, consequently early crack growth has to be studied by means of optical methods and indirect detection techniques or tomographic methods. In the study presented crack initiation and crack growth was monitored through optical observation and quasi 3 -D observation by means of synchrotron radiation. For an as-received and a coarsegrained condition of pure nickel Ni 201 fatigue crack growth in the VHCF regime occurs at deltaK as low as 3. 54 MPam 1 / 2 for a crack growth rate da/dN = 10 E- 12 m/cycle. The grain size {{had no effect on}} the threshold limit but crack growth retardation at grain boundaries and crack path deflection lead to lower crack growth rates for the coarse-grained condition In the nickel-based alloy Nimonic 80 A the influence of microstructure on the <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>crack</b> initiation and propagation was confirmed. Here, the combination of the misorientation angle between two adjacent grains and the orientation of their boundary with respect to the external load defines the magnitude of stress concentration at grain boundaries...|$|E

The results indicate that hydrogen does not alter the yield stress of samples significantly although it reduces both the ultimate tensile strength and the ductility considerably.

40|$|Developing the {{techniques}} of welding materials with higher dynamic strength onto the rolling surfaces of rails {{is one of the}} options for increasing their operational endurance. The subject of this paper is an analyses of heterogeneous weld interfaces experimentally manufactured by welding medium-carbon austenitic steels onto high-carbon unalloyed pearlitic steels. The analyses focus on examinations of the marginal mixing of the materials at the weld interface and the circumstances under which <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>cracks</b> form in the weld deposit layers. Structural analyses, chemical microanalyses and a hardness assessment were performed in order to identify the corresponding structural changes. The proportion of zonal vs. interdendritic segregation of the alloying elements in the degradation of the welded joint was distinguished. We described the nature of the structural heterogeneities produced, locally connected with the martensitic transformation. The chemical heterogeneity leading to the formation of martensite at grain boundaries was identified as the limiting effect. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{microcrack}} model yields {{an increase}} JR in crack-resistance. Considering {{the value of}} the observed increase of the crack resistance, it appears that JR is too small to explain the whole R-curve. Therefore, also other effects must play a role suchas the contribution to the energy dissipation by the friction of the rough <b>intercrystalline</b> broken <b>crack</b> walls. In our opinion both models describe parts of the reality. In this paper we have concentrated our discussion only on one aspect of increasing crack resistance.

40|$|The {{deformation}} {{and damage}} mechanisms arising during thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) of the polycrystallinesuperalloy IN 792 have been investigated. The TMF cycles {{used in this}} study are in-phase(IP) and out-of-phase (OP). The minimum temperature used in all TMF-tests is 100 ◦C while the maximumtemperature is 500 or 750 ◦C in the IP TMF-tests and 750, 850 or 950 ◦C in the OP TMF-tests. Themajority of the cracks are transcrystalline, except for the IP TMF-test at 750 ◦C, where some tendencyto <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>crack</b> growth can be seen. In all tests, the cracks were initiated and propagated inlocations where deformation structures such as deformation bands have formed in the material. In thetemperature interval 750 – 850 ◦C, twins were formed in both IP and OP TMF-tests and this behaviouris observed to be further enhanced close to a crack. Twins are to a significantly lesser extent observedfor tests with a lower (500 ◦C) and a higher (950 ◦C) maximum temperature. Recrystallization at grainboundaries, around particles and within the deformation structures have occurred in the OP TMF-testswith a maximum temperature of 850 and 950 ◦C and this is more apparent for the higher temperature. Void formation is frequently observed in the recrystallized areas even for the case of compressive stressesat high temperature.

40|$|AbstractIN 718 is a {{commonly}} used nickel-base alloy for high temperature applications, e. g., in gas and steam turbines. At elevated temperatures, {{this and other}} superalloys are prone to the failure mechanism "dynamic embrittlement". Dynamic embrittlement {{can be considered as}} a kind of stress corrosion cracking, driven by tensile-stress-controlled oxygen grain boundary diffusion. Oxygen embrittles the grain boundaries by weakening the grain boundary cohesion resulting in fast and brittle <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>crack</b> propagation. In order to reveal the mechanism of dynamic embrittlement, high-temperature fatigue crack propagation tests were carried out at 650 °C applying various dwell times and testing frequencies. Most of the tests were performed in laboratory air, but some experiments were run in vacuum as well, in order to eliminate environmental effects and, hence, to define the reference fatigue crack propagation behaviour. The observations show that at low stress intensity factor ranges ΔKI, continuous crack growth occurs. At intermediate values of ΔKI, no crack propagation takes place during the dwell part of the cycle. Rather, the crack extends during unloading and reloading between subsequent hold times. The time necessary to grow the crack under sustained load during the dwell time was found to decrease with increasing stress intensity factor. Therefore, at high values of ΔKI, there is a contribution of the crack propagation at constant stress, since the incubation time is shorter than the dwell time. A mechanism-based model was developed for the range of test parameters, where intergranular and transgranular areas exist {{side by side in the}} fracture surface. The total crack growth per cycle is calculated by a linear combination of the intergranular and the transgranular contribution using the corresponding area fractions as weighting factors. It is shown that simulation calculations based on this model approach correspond very reasonably to the experimental observations. Hence, the model provides a quantitative mechanismen-related description of the effect of dynamic embrittlement on fatigue crack propagation rate...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} in the inter-face {{between the}} heavy Al wire and the Al metallization {{of the power}} semiconductor {{is one of the}} major failure causes of power modules and discrete devices. These fatigue cracks are primarily caused by mismatch of the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the Al of the bonding wire and the Si of the chip. During thermal cycling periodic plastic and elastic strains occur in the interface region weakening the wire material with every cycle. Typically this leads to the initiation and growth of cracks in the interface between the wire and the metallization. The final result is a bond lift off and a failure of the device. The main influencing factors for this degradation are the temperature swing and the maximum temperature of the cycle, the wire material and diameter and the initial wire bond quality. In the past, many publications in this field were concentrated on the reliability of complete power modules with many wire bonds. In these works the degradation process of a single wire was not monitored. Only the final result of the degradation - the bond wire lift off - was considered. To gain more insight into the degradation process in the interface between the wire bond and the chip metallization, crack initiation and growth has to be monitored on a single wire basis. Since electrical measurements of cracks lengths in the micrometer range are not feasible and common inspection methods such as X-Ray and Acoustic Microscopes do not deliver high enough spatial resolution only metallographic cross sectioning followed by SEM or light microscope inspection can reveal the correct crack length and possibly the grain structure around the crack tip. Metallographic cross sectioning is a manual step and thus very time consuming. It is feasible only for a small number of samples but on a power semiconductor many wires (up to 20) are bonded in parallel to increase current capability and reliability of the module. In this case, cross sectioning of every wire is not possible. Typically the interface quality of heavy wire bonds right after the bonding process is evaluated by the shear test. During the shear test, a shear tool is shearing through the wire material at a defined height above the pad metallization. The measured shear force and the coverage of the sheared bond site with wire material give a clue about the bonding quality. If during thermal cycling a crack is initiated and growing this must be detectable by decreasing shear forces and coverage of the shear site. For this reason the shear test is used for detecting the crack growth. In this poster shear results after power cycling with different temperature swings and maximum temperatures are presented. In addition, cross sections and microstructure analyses reveal that the exact path of the crack is not directly in the interface between wire and metallization but in a layer above the interface. This layer is characterized by fine grains below and coarse grains above. Also, the analysis of the crack tip area shows mainly <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>crack</b> growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{hot-working}} {{characteristics of}} IN- 718 are {{studied in the}} temperature range 900 °C to 1200 °C and strain rate range 0. 001 to 100 s− 1 using hot compression tests. Processing maps for hot working are developed {{on the basis of}} the strain-rate sensitivity variations with temperature and strain rate and interpreted using a dynamic materials model. The map exhibits two domains of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) : one occurring at 950 °C and 0. 001 s− 1 with an efficiency of power dissipation of 37 pct and the other at 1200 °C and 0. 1 s− 1 with an efficiency of 40 pct. Dynamic recrystallization in the former domain is nucleated by the δ(Ni 3 Nb) precipitates and results in fine-grained microstructure. In the high-temperature DRX domain, carbides dissolve in the matrix and make interstitial carbon atoms available for increasing the rate of dislocation generation for DRX nucleation. It is recommended that IN- 718 may be hot-forged initially at 1200 °C and 0. 1 s− 1 and finish-forged at 950 °C and 0. 001 s− 1 so that fine-grained structure may be achieved. The available forging practice validates these results from processing maps. At temperatures lower than 1000 °C and strain rates higher than 1 s− 1 the material exhibits adiabatic shear bands. Also, at temperatures higher than 1150 °C and strain rates more than 1 s− 1, IN- 718 exhibits <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>cracking.</b> Both these regimes may be avoided in hotworking IN- 718...|$|R

Basquin’s characteristics of fatigue have been determined in mechanical test on smooth specimens at a simple state of loading in conditions of alternating bending. The tests were carried out on a fatigue test stand constructed by the authors – MZGS 100. The development of fatigue cracking has been described based on metallographic and fractographic investigations of the fractured samples making use of a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

40|$|High {{temperature}} deformation {{behavior of}} Al- 5. 9, Cu- 0. 5 %, Mg alloy and Al- 5. 9, Cu- 0. 5 %, Mg alloy containing 0. 06 wt. % Sn was studied by hot compression tests conducted at different temperatures and strain rates. Trace content of Sn {{resulted in a}} significant increase of flow stress for various processing conditions. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modeling was applied providing excellent prediction of flow stress at different combinations of strain, strain rate and deformation temperature. While validation, {{it was possible to}} predict 100 and 89 % of the flow stress values of the respective alloys within an error less than± 10 %. The flow stress data thus generated using the ANN architectures was used to develop power dissipation efficiency maps, instability maps and subsequently the processing maps which would delineate the process domains for safe metal working. Optimum hot processing window was suggested for the investigated alloys, providing intelligent processing and manufacturing system of these wrought microalloyed Al alloys, extensively used in aircraft and space applications. The power dissipation efficiency maps revealed a maximum efficiency of 60 % for the alloy without Sn content, while a comparatively lower value of 40 % for the microalloyed material. The instability maps generated for the alloy containing Sn, revealed only one instability regime. The safe regimes for hot working of the base alloy without Sn content were observed at (i) very low strain rate (- 1) with temperature 400 °C) with strain rate > 0. 02 sec - 1. The safe processing zone of the alloy with trace content of Sn, is at low strain rate (- 1) for the entire range of temperatures studied. Microstructural analysis confirmed that dynamic recovery (DRV) and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) characterized the safe processing regimes of both the alloys. Instability during hot deformation was observed to be driven mainly by shear band formation and/or <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>cracking</b> for the investigated Al alloys...|$|R
40|$|Forming and forging {{processes}} {{are among the}} oldest and most important materials related technologies. New materials technologies centre on the development and widespread use of thermomechanical processing, particularly for aerospace alloys and concepts of metal workability and formability. Workability refers to the relative ease with which a metal can be shaped through plastic deformation. The term workability is often used interchangeably with the term formability, which is preferred for the shaping of sheet metal parts. However, workability is usually used to refer to the shaping of materials by such bulk deformation processes as forging, extrusion, and rolling. The characterisation of mechanical behaviour of a material by tension testing measures two different types of mechanical property: strength properties (such as yield strength and ultimate tensile strength) and ductility properties (such as percentage elongation and reduction in area). Similarly, the evaluation of workability involves both the measurement of the resistance to deformation (strength) and determination of the extent of possible plastic deformation before fracture (ductility). Therefore, a complete description of the workability of a material is specified by its flow stress dependence on processing variables (for example strain, strain rate, preheat temperature, and die temperature), its failure behaviour, and the metallurgical transformations that characterise the alloy system to which it belongs. However, the major emphasis in workability is on measurement and prediction of limit of deformation before fracture. Therefore, the emphasis in the present review article is on methods for determining the extent of deformation a metal can withstand before cracking or fracture occurs. Flow stress data are essential in the development of constitutive equations and processing maps. One of the requirements for process modelling is a knowledge of the material flow behaviour for defining the deformation maps that delineate 'safe' and 'non-safe' hot working conditions. These maps show in the processing space (that is on axes of temperature T and strain rate (epsilon) over dot) the processing conditions for stable and unstable deformation. The range of T and (epsilon) over dot for stable material flow useful in the development of process control algorithms should be obtained from physical quantities, which can be evaluated from the test data. As such there is no unique instability theory existing to delineate the regions of unstable flow during hot deformation which is applicable for all the materials. The designer has to establish a suitable theory on the basis of microstructural observations of the flow localisation in the intended materials. Various existing theories are reviewed for identification of flow instabilities (such as adiabatic shear banding, <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>cracking,</b> prior particle boundary cracking in powder compacts, wedge cracking) during hot deformation of materials, and these theories are verified by considering the flow stress data of IN 718 and the reported microstructural observations from different sources...|$|R

40|$|An {{inspiration}} {{to the research}} work has arisen from the problems related to cracking of massive castings made of ferritic-austenitic cast steel. The shape and the character of crack trajectories indicate that they are hot cracks. Investigations have included two cast steel grades, namely GX 2 CrNiMoN 25 - 6 - 3 and GX 2 CrNiMoCuN 25 - 6 - 3 - 3, because some customers had demanded for copper addition which makes possible the ageing treatment; also the alloys with increased carbon content have been investigated and this resulted from difficulties in obtaining sufficiently low carbon content (Cmax 0, 03 %) in many Polish foundries which are not equipped with argon-oxygen devices for cast steel decarburizing. The method of critical size of a specimen similar in shape to the Hall test specimen {{has been applied to}} examine the cast steel susceptibility to hot cracking. The examination results undoubtedly indicate the negative influence of the increased carbon content, especially in the presence of copper. The <b>intercrystalline</b> character of <b>cracks</b> which propagate along the dendritic austenite precipitates suggests that the peritectic reaction occurs in the final stage of solidification, being induced by segregation of the strong austenite-forming alloying elements. The increased hot cracking susceptibility of the ferrite-austenite cast steel containing copper, particularly with simultaneously increased carbon content, indicates that the implementation of production technologies concerning this material should be started with production of castings made of alloy grades without copper addition...|$|R
40|$|Vibratory {{cavitation}} erosion tests on AISI-SAE 1018 carbon steel in tap water and in mild (0. 1 M) aqueous solutions of CaCO 3, CaO, NaHCO 3 and NaOH were conducted at {{a temperature of}} 80 [deg]F (27 [deg]C), a double amplitude of 1. 38 x 10 - 3 in (35. 1 [mu]m) and a pressure of 1 atm. For the maximum (150 min) test duration the weight loss in tap water (no additive) is the smallest. However, {{this is not the}} case for shorter test times. The biggest difference between weight losses among the various solutions is about 10 % - 30 %, which is somewhat beyond natural data scatter for such vibratory tests. Released gases and also particles may play an important role in the results. There are three easily distinguishable damage regions for all cavitated surfaces, i. e. generally undamaged rim, central heavily damaged region and transition region, as for most vibratory tests. The relative areas of the three regions are about 53. 5 %, 0. 13 % and 46. 4 % respectively for the present tests. The erosion rate and extent of the damaged regions do not depend substantially on the solute tested. The very small area of the heavily damaged central region is presumably due to the relatively low horn amplitude used in these tests. The increase in damage rate with respect to tap water is about 50 % for the maximum test duration. Surface photographs and scanning electron microscopy photomicrographs (for a test duration of 150 min) are presented. <b>Cracks,</b> <b>intercrystalline</b> fractures and single-blow craters are most concentrated in the central region, as would be expected...|$|R
40|$|The {{advanced}} use of inorganic membranes, such as zeolites, in large-scale {{industrial processes}} is hindered by {{the inability to}} manufacture continuous and defect-free membranes. We therefore aimed to construct such a defect-free membrane. Various zeolites were synthesised on the inner surface of ?-alumina support tubes by a hydrothermal process. Gas permeation properties were investigated at 298 K for single component systems of N 2, CF 4 and C 3 F 6. Ideal selectivities lower than Knudsen selectivities were obtained {{as a result of}} defects from <b>intercrystalline</b> slits and <b>crack</b> formation during synthesis and template removal. A composite ceramic membrane consisting of a ceramic support structure, a mordenite framework inverted intermediate zeolite layer and a Teflon AF 2400 top layer was developed to improve separation. The Teflon layer sealed possible defects present in the separation layer forcing the gas molecules to follow the path through the zeolite pores. Ideal selectivities of 88 and 71 were obtained for N 2 /CF 4 and N 2 /C 3 F 6 respectively. Adsorption experiments performed on materials present in the membrane structure suggested that although adsorption of C 3 F 6 onto Teflon AF 2400 compared to CF 4 results in a considerable contribution to permeation for the composite ceramic membrane, the sealing effect of the zeolite layer by the Teflon layer is the reason for the large N 2 /CF 4 and N 2 /C 3 F 6 selectivities obtained. The Teflon layer effectively sealed intercrystalline areas in-between zeolite crystals, which resulted in high ideal selectivies for N 2 /CF 4 and N 2 /C 3 F 6...|$|R
