40|$|As {{the demand}} for high speed and {{reliable}} wireless communication increases, {{the importance of having}} a linear transmitter has enhanced. Distortions created by the transmitter, such as power amplifier nonlinearity and I/Q imbalance, diminish the fidelity and limit the performance of wireless systems, if left undealt with. Among the techniques commonly used to mitigate these distortions, digital predistortion has established itself as a suitable candidate that minimizes the hardware overhead and only requires modest additional power in the transmitter architecture. An important pre-requisite for utilizing <b>digital</b> <b>predistorters</b> is developing accurate and low complex behavioral models, which is the main focus of this thesis. After analyzing the importance of modeling and compensating for the distortion created by modulators and power amplifiers in the transmitter architecture, an overview of some commonly used models in the literature is presented. A novel behavioral modeling approach is proposed which is capable of modeling long term memory effects in power amplifiers, and a new dual–input modeling approach for I/Q imbalance compensation is presented that successfully compensates for distortion created by the modulator. Compared with conventional and recently proposed techniques, the approaches presented in this thesis show promising results in modeling transmitters accurately. The important issue of computational complexity in behavioral models is also discussed, and the accuracy/compexity tradeoff of some common behavioral models is analyzed. Once behavioral modeling techniques are established, they are used for digital predistortion of wireless transmitters. Issues such as identification of <b>digital</b> <b>predistorters</b> and adaptation of parameters due to changes in power amplifier behavior are discussed and a new measurement testbed to evaluate the performance in parameter adaptation algorithms is proposed.

30|$|As {{the signal}} {{bandwidth}} gets wider, {{such as in}} WCDMA, mobile WiMAX and 3 GPP LTE and LTE-advanced (up to 100 MHz bandwidth, five component carriers of carrier aggregation), PAs begin to exhibit memory effects. This {{is especially true for}} those high PAs used in wireless base stations. The causes of the memory effects can be attributed to thermal constants of the active devices or components in the biasing network that have frequency-dependent behaviors. As a result, the current output of the PA depends not only on the current input, but also on past input values. In other words, the PA becomes a nonlinear system with memory. For such a PA, memoryless predistortion can achieve only very limited linearization performance. Therefore, <b>digital</b> <b>predistorters</b> must need to have memory structures [7].|$|R
30|$|LUT-based digital predistorters {{have low}} {{computational}} complexity, but they require significantly more memory space {{to store the}} model parameters than polynomial-based digital predistorters. Thus, LUT-based digital predistorters have slow convergence speed as compared to polynomial-based digital predistorters. Comparatively, evaluation of a polynomial function is more computationally complex than a simple memory LUT entry and compensation of higher orders of nonlinearity and memory effects requires a high order polynomial. For newer spectral efficiency transmission formats, a predistorter bandwidth of several tens of MHz might be required for implementation of these high order polynomials.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The {{importance}} of spectral efficiency in mobile communications often requires {{the use of}} non-constant-envelop linear digital modulation schemes. These modulation techniques carry signal information in both magnitude and phase, thus they must be linearly amplified to avoid nonlinear signal distortion which is not correctable in a typical receiver. A second difficulty in utilizing these modulation formats is that nonlinear amplification generates out-of-band power (spectral regrowth). Therefore, to achieve both high energy efficiency and spectral efficiency, some forms of linearization must be used to compensate for the nonlinearity of power amplifiers. One powerful technique that is amenable to monolithic integration is digital signal predistortion. Most predistorters try to achieve the inverse nonlinear characteristic of High Power Amplifier(HPA). In this thesis a new multi-stage <b>digital</b> adaptive signal <b>predistorter</b> is presented.

40|$|Power {{amplifiers}} (PAs) {{are vital}} components in radio transmitters {{because they are}} responsible to amplify the low power communication signals to power levels suitable for transmission. Important requirements of PAs are high efficiency and linearity. Unfortunately, there is a tradeoff between efficiency and linearity. In order to satisfy both requirements, designers prefer to prioritize the efficiency in the design process while the linearity is taken care of later using external linearization techniques. Among the linearization techniques proposed in the literature, digital predistortion (DPD) has drawn a large attention of the industrial and academic sectors because it can provide a good compromise between linearity, implementation complexity and efficiency. This thesis treats different aspects related to the compensation of PA nonlinear distortion through DPD. One issue in the synthesis of DPD is that the optimal output from a predistorter is unknown. To overcome this problem, the concept of iterative learning control (ILC) for the linearization of PAs is introduced.   An ILC scheme is derived that is {{able to identify the}} optimal predistorted signal that linearizes a PA.   Based on the ILC framework, a novel approach to derive model structures for <b>digital</b> <b>predistorters</b> is proposed. Techniques to identify the parameters of <b>digital</b> <b>predistorters</b> have been developed.

The issue of gain normalization in ILA has been investigated. A variant to ILA that eliminates the need for a normalization gain and simplifies the DPD synthesis is proposed. Performance limits on PA linearization has also been investigated and an expression for the lower bound for the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance has been derived. The improved linearity performance achieved through the techniques developed in this thesis can enable a better utilization of the potential performance of existing and emerging highly efficiency PAs, and are therefore expected to have an impact in future wireless communication systems...|$|R

Experimental results show that the selection of the normalization gain affects the average output power and consequently the linearity performance of the linearized PA.
