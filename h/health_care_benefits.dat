50|$|Changes in the {{perception}} of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> after World War II and an assessment of medical services provided to dependents caused Congress to re-evaluate the dependent <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>benefit</b> in the late 1950s. Changes in tax law had induced business and industry to begin offering a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>benefit</b> as an employment incentive. A 1956 Department of Defense estimate was that 40 percent of active duty dependents did not have access to federal facilities due to distance, incomplete medical coverage at the federal facility, or due to the saturation of services at military treatment facilities. Congress responded by passing the Dependents Medical Care Act of 1956 and the Military Medical Benefits Amendments of 1966. These acts created the program known as the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS).|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines {{the evolution of}} the Military <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Benefit</b> (MHCB) and the principal factors that influenced its change. The Military <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Benefit</b> is a critical part of the compensation package received by the military member. A detailed examination of United States Code, Title 10, along with congressional hearings, committee reports, legislative bills and external organizational literature was conducted. The congressional process for modifying the MHCB is explained, followed by identification and description of the major legislative changes to the MHCB between 1956 and 1996. Research revealed that the scope of the MHCB has dramatically increased since 1956. Three distinct periods of congressional action were identified. The first, 1956 to 1966, was characterized by establishment of the benefit structure and its initial expansion. The second, 1967 to 1982, was a status quo era in which Congress focused its attention on controlling the rising costs of CHAMPUS. The final period, 1983 to 1996, was dominated by congressional oversight, leading to further expansion of the MHCB and the development of Managed Care programs. Equity with private sector or other government sponsored <b>health</b> <b>care</b> programs was the primary factor in the growth of the MHCB. Understanding the process used to change the Military <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Benefit</b> and the principal factors that influence this change allows planners an insight into possible future changes in military medical benefits and their associated costs[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

The Allende Government encouraged more doctors to begin their practices in rural and low-income urban areas, and built additional hospitals, maternity clinics, and especially neighborhood health centers that remained open longer hours to serve the poor. Improved sanitation and housing facilities for low-income neighborhoods also equalized <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>benefits,</b> while hospital councils and local health councils were established in neighborhood health centers {{as a means of}} democratizing the administration of health policies.

25|$|In {{the article}} Why Tie Health Insurance to a Job?, Emanuel said that {{employer}} based health insurance {{should be replaced}} by state or regional insurance exchanges that pool individuals and small groups to pay the same lower prices charged to larger employers. Emanuel said that this would allow portable health insurance even to people that lose their jobs or change jobs, {{while at the same}} time preserving the security of employer based health benefits by giving consumers the bargaining power of a large group of patients. According to Emanuel, this would end discrimination by health insurance companies in the form of denial of health insurance based on age or preexisting conditions.
