5000|$|Twardzik {{grew up in}} Middletown, Pennsylvania, {{and played}} collegiately at Old Dominion University, {{where he was a}} two-time All-American and led the Monarchs to the 1971 NCAA Division II title game. He was drafted by the Trail Blazers in 1972, but elected to play for the Virginia Squires of the ABA. Twardzik played for the Squires for four seasons until the team (and the ABA) came to an <b>end,</b> <b>folding</b> just prior to the ABA-NBA merger in June 1976. After the ABA-NBA merger Twardzik signed with the Blazers (who held his NBA rights). [...] He would be the {{starting}} point guard of the Blazers team which won the NBA title in 1977. He played for four seasons total in Portland, and retired {{at the end of the}} 1979-80 season because of injury. His jersey number (13) was retired by the team.|$|E
50|$|The {{total body}} {{length of the}} fossil is around 10.5 mm, with the {{preserved}} part of the carapace of the cephalothorax about 5 mm long and the opisthosoma (abdomen) about 6 mm long. The eight walking legs are more-or-less uniform in appearance, with the fourth leg longest at about 8.5 mm and the first shortest at about 6.5 mm. The legs terminate {{in at least two}} claws. The two pedipalps are slightly shorter than the legs, at just under 4 mm long. The chelicerae are shaped like a clasp-knife, i.e. with the fang at the <b>end</b> <b>folding</b> back into the part to which it is attached. The opisthosoma shows at least seven sections on the upper surface (tergites), each with a flattened W-shaped profile composed of a wider upwardly curved central plate and two side plates. The lower surface of the opisthosoma bears eight visible plates. No spinnerets, telson or terminal spike (flagellum) are present.|$|E
40|$|A {{fluorescent}} sensor for Hg 2 + {{was obtained}} by incorporation of two methionine units into a cholate hexamer and by attaching a Dansyl group at the chain <b>end.</b> <b>Folding</b> could be made highly favorable or unfavorable in different solvents. Because folding was required to bring the sulfur groups together to chelate the mercury ion, binding affinity of the foldamer and, thus, its sensitivity as a sensor, could be tuned over broad ranges (at least 5 orders of magnitude) by solvent changes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Robotic {{manipulation}} of deformable objects re-mains a challenging task. One such task is folding a garment autonomously. Given start and <b>end</b> <b>folding</b> positions, {{what is an}} optimal trajectory to move the robotic arm to fold a garment? Certain trajectories will cause the garment to move, creating wrinkles, and gaps, other trajectories will fail altogether. We present a novel solution to find an optimal trajectory that avoids such problematic scenarios. The trajectory is optimized by minimizing a quadratic objective function in an off-line simulator, which includes material properties of the garment and frictional force on the table. The function measures the dis-similarity between a user folded shape and the folded garment in simulation, which is then used as an error measurement to create an optimal trajectory. We demonstrate that our two-arm robot can follow the optimized trajectories, achieving accurate and efficient manipulations of deformable objects. I...|$|E

50|$|This new {{single strand}} {{that has been}} {{released}} will act {{as the starting point}} for the LAMP cycling amplification. The DNA has a dumbbell-like structure as the <b>ends</b> <b>fold</b> in and self anneal. This structure becomes a stem-loop when the FIP or BIP primer once again initiates DNA synthesis at one of the target sequence locations. This cycle can be started from either the forward or backward side of the strand using the appropriate primer. Once this cycle has begun, the strand undergoes self-primed DNA synthesis during the elongation stage of the amplification process. This amplification takes place in only an hour, under isothermal conditions between 60-65 °C.|$|R

40|$|The {{function}} of a protein generally is determined by its three-dimensional (3 D) structure. Thus, {{it would be useful}} to know the 3 D structure of the thousands of protein sequences that are emerging from the many genome projects. To this <b>end,</b> <b>fold</b> assignment, comparative protein structure modeling, and model evaluation were automated completely. As an illustration, the method was applied to the proteins in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast) genome. It resulted in all-atom 3 D models for substantial segments of 1, 071 (17 %) of the yeast proteins, only 40 of which have had their 3 D structure determined experimentally. Of the 1, 071 modeled yeast proteins, 236 were related clearly to a protein of known structure for the first time; 41 of these previously have not been characterized at all...|$|R

2500|$|HK {{included}} several design {{features that are}} essential in modern military firearms. For example, the bolt locks back after the last round is spent (this can be deactivated), and at {{the front end of}} the trigger guard there is a bolt catch button. The cocking handle can be switched from either <b>end,</b> <b>folds</b> in, and unfolds from a spring so the shooter need not unfold it by hand [...] before firing. Another feature of it is that it doubles as the forward assist, which is used in the instance that the spent cartridge ejected but the next one did not properly extract and go into battery. In addition, the ejection port has a brass deflector to mitigate the amount of casings that may strike the face of left-handed operators. Instead of a dust cover which has the need to be flipped back up when the gun isn't in use, the bolt acts as the seal from dirt.|$|R
