5|$|Because Kazakhstan {{was once}} {{a member of the}} USSR, its rail system connects with and carries the same rail gauge as the Russian rail system, {{as well as the other}} Central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> and Tajikistan.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, {{and later}} acceding states <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> and Tajikistan signed the first {{agreements}} on {{the establishment of}} a Customs Union. Its purpose was to gradually lead the way toward the creation of open borders without passport controls between member states.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia and <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> {{signed the}} Treaty on Increased Integration in the Economic and Humanitarian Fields to begin {{economic}} integration between countries {{to allow for}} the creation of common markets for goods, services, capital, labour, and developing single transport, energy and information systems.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> and Tajikistan {{signed the}} Treaty on the Customs Union and the Single Economic Space by {{clarifying}} {{the goals and}} policies the states would undertake in order to form the Eurasian Customs Union and the Single Economic Space.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, China {{was the top}} {{producer}} of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by <b>Kyrgyzstan.</b> Several other countries {{are believed to have}} unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{minority}} {{languages are}} spoken widely across the Union. However, official languages spoken are Armenian, Belarusian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz and Russian. Russian is widely spoken {{not only in}} Russia but also in Belarus, Kazakhstan and <b>Kyrgyzstan.</b> In these countries Russian has status of official language and is taught in most public schools.|$|E

5|$|In July 2010, <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> saw an {{outbreak}} of ethnic violence in which as many as 2,000 people, primarily Uzbeks, were killed, {{and hundreds of thousands}} displaced. Following the violence, dozens of Uzbek community and religious leaders were arrested by the Kyrgyzstani government and accused of inciting ethnic violence, among them Azimzhan Askarov, who had been filming killings and arson attacks during the riots. Askarov then distributed the video to international media and accused the Kyrgyz military of complicity in the killings.|$|E
5|$|In force since 2012, the {{multilateral}} CIS Free Trade Zone Agreement established {{a free trade}} area between Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, <b>Kyrgyzstan,</b> Russia (now all EAEU member states), as well as Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Moldova. Russia has suspended the Agreement with respect to Ukraine from 1 January 2016, following the provisional application of the DCFTA between the European Union and Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|Previously, Tajikistan was {{on track}} to become a {{potential}} member of the union, having signed the treaty on the Eurasian Customs Union and the Single Economic Space. However, due to border disputes between <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> and Tajikistan, the integration process in Tajikistan has stalled. Both countries exchanged fire in December 2013 and August 2014, which resulted in casualties. Both countries have since announced they would resolve conflicts and improve border cooperation. Officials hope to make significant progress {{by the end of}} 2015.|$|E
5|$|For {{his travels}} from 1253 to 1255, the Franciscan monk William of Rubruck {{reported}} numerous Europeans in Central Asia. He described German prisoners {{who had been}} enslaved and forced to mine gold and manufacture iron weapons in the Mongol town of Bolat, near Talas, <b>Kyrgyzstan.</b> In Karakorum, the Mongol capital, he met a Parisian named Guillaume de Buchier, and Pâquette, a woman from the French city of Metz, who had both been captured in Hungary during the Mongol invasions of Europe. He also mentions Hungarians and Russians, {{and it is also}} known that 30,000 Alans, a group of Sarmatian tribes, formed the Asud guard of the Mongol court in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty on Increased Integration in the Economic and Humanitarian Fields {{signed in}} 1996 laid the first {{foundation}} for economic convergence. The treaty ensured {{the creation of}} a permanent executive organ to oversee integration of states that later would be part of the EEU. It served as the blueprint for the future common market for goods, services, capital and labour. The Single Economic Space established a single market across the territory of Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan. In 2015 with the entry into force of the EEU Agreement, the single market was expanded to include Armenia and <b>Kyrgyzstan.</b> The countries represent a market of some 183 million people and a combined GDP of around $4 trillion.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} wild {{ancestor of}} Malus pumila was Malus sieversii, found growing wild {{in the mountains}} of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, <b>Kyrgyzstan,</b> Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China. Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed {{over a long period of}} time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.|$|E
5|$|The tiger was {{historically}} widespread throughout eastern Eurasia, {{with the}} Pontic Caspian steppe, Eastern Turkey and Mesopotamia {{serving as the}} westernmost fringe of their range, and the coasts between eastern Siberia and the Indonesian islands of Java, Bali and Sumatra acting as the frontier to the Pacific Ocean. In between, tigers roamed what is today Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Georgia, southern Russia, Syria, Turkey and eastern Ukraine (as part of the Black Sea region), Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Nepal (comprising South Asia), Kazakhstan, <b>Kyrgyzstan,</b> Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan (composing Central Asia) China, Mongolia, North Korea, Siberia and South Korea (constituting East Asia) and South East Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam).|$|E
5|$|Uzbekistan remains {{hesitant}} {{to join the}} Economic Union, with Uzbek officials making opposing claims on the prospect of integration. The country prefers not to pursue economic and political integration as of now. Russian officials have stated that integration with {{the country would be}} slow and analysts state that as Russian influence and trade increases in <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> and Tajikistan it may persuade Uzbekistan to join in the future. Uzbekistan began its integration process when Russia announced it would write off USD$865 million off debt owed by the country. Uzbekistan joined the CIS Free Trade Area in 2014, meaning it has free trade with EEU member states.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye 007 closely {{follows the}} plot of the movie, though with some minor alterations. The game starts in Arkhangelsk in the Soviet Union in 1986, where MI6 has {{uncovered}} a secret chemical weapons facility at the Byelomorye Dam. James Bond and fellow 00-agent Alec Trevelyan are sent to infiltrate the facility and plant explosive charges. During the mission, Trevelyan is apparently killed by Colonel Arkady Ourumov, but Bond escapes by commandeering an aeroplane. Five years later in 1991, Bond is sent to investigate a satellite control station in Severnaya, Russia, where programmers Natalya Simonova and Boris Grishenko work. Two years after the Severnaya mission, in 1993, Bond investigates an unscheduled test firing of a missile in <b>Kyrgyzstan,</b> believed to be a cover for the launch of a satellite known as GoldenEye. This space-based weapon works by firing a concentrated electromagnetic pulse at any Earth target to disable any electrical circuit within range. As Bond leaves the silo, he is ambushed by Ourumov and a squad of Russian troops. Ourumov manages to escape during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|In 1124, {{just before}} the final conquest of the Liao dynasty, a group of Khitans led by Yelü Dashi fled {{northwest}} to the border area and military garrison of Kedun (Zhenzhou), in modern-day northern Mongolia. Yelü Dashi convinced the people there, around 20,000 Liao cavalry and their families, to follow him and attempt to restore the Liao dynasty. Yelü Dashi proclaimed himself emperor in 1131, after which he moved further west into modern Kazakhstan and then occupied the Karakhanid city of Balasaghun (in modern <b>Kyrgyzstan).</b> After a failed attempt in 1134 to reclaim the territory formerly held by the Liao, Dashi decided instead to stay where he was and establish a permanent Khitan state in Central Asia. The state, known as the Qara Khitai or the Western Liao dynasty, controlled several key trading cities, was multicultural, and showed evidence of religious tolerance. The state survived {{for nearly a century}} before being conquered by the Mongol Empire in 1218.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, Meredith {{expressed}} {{his desire to}} play for the Australia national team. Australia coach Ange Postecoglou said {{at the time that he}} was open to selecting a number of new players to the national team, including Meredith. Meredith was first called up by Australia for a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Jordan on 8 October 2015, for which he was an unused substitute as Australia lost 2–0. Meredith debuted for Australia on 12 November 2015, after being selected in the starting line-up for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against <b>Kyrgyzstan,</b> which the team won 3–0 at home. He only learned he would be starting on the morning of the match, and his family flew to Canberra from Melbourne to watch him. He made a second start in a win over Bangladesh four days later.|$|E
5|$|While {{mercury and}} zinc {{minerals}} {{are found in}} large enough quantities to be mined, cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in zinc ores from where it is recovered. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes. Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran. At {{the current rate of}} consumption, these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055. About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use. In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by <b>Kyrgyzstan.</b> Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents. Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Islamist {{inspired}} {{terrorist attacks in}} New York and Washington on 11 September 2001, Australian forces were committed to the American-led international coalition against terrorism. The ADF's most visible contribution—codenamed Operation Slipper—has been a special forces task group operating in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2002 and again from mid-2005 {{to fight against the}} Taliban. Over time the Australian commitment has grown, with the addition of further ground forces {{in the form of a}} Reconstruction Task Force from 2006 to provide security, reconstruction and to mentor and train the Afghan National Army. Australia has also contributed a frigate and two AP-3C Orion surveillance aircraft and three C-130 Hercules transport aircraft to international operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean since 2001, supporting both the operations in Afghanistan and those in Iraq under Operation Catalyst. A detachment of four F/A-18 Hornet fighter-bombers was based at Diego Garcia from late-2001 to mid-2002, while two Boeing 707 air-to-air refuelling aircraft were also based in Manas Air Base in <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in Afghan airspace but were later withdrawn. A Special Operations Task Group was deployed to support the Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007. In addition to radar crews, logistics and intelligence officers, and security personnel, this brought the number of Australian personnel in Afghanistan to 950 by mid-2007, with further small increases to 1,000 in mid-2008, 1,100 in early 2009 and 1,550 in mid-2009.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan urged <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> to {{stop the}} {{violence}} and rebuild the stability of the nation. Turkey, which is a main ally of <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> due to Turkic blood, fully supported <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> provisional Government.|$|E

25|$|Visitors to <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> must {{obtain a}} visa {{from one of}} the <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> {{diplomatic}} missions unless they come {{from one of the}} visa-exempt countries or countries whose citizens are eligible for a visa on arrival. Despite proposals to abolish the visa-free regime, the Prime Minister of <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> vowed to retain the current policy in December 2015.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> has {{abundant}} {{water running}} through it, its water supply {{is determined by}} a post-Soviet sharing agreement among the five Central Asian republics. As in the Soviet era, <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> {{has the right to}} 25% of the water that originates in its territory, but the new agreement allows Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan unlimited use of the water that flows into them from <b>Kyrgyzstan,</b> with no compensation for the nation at the source. <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> uses the entire amount to which the agreement entitles it, but utilization is skewed heavily in favor of agricultural irrigation. During the Soviet era, <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> and Tajikistan shared their abundant water resources with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan during summer, and these three nations shared oil and gas with <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> and Tajikistan in winter. According to the International Crisis Group, the skewed system that is currently in place could cause irreversible regional destabilization, and needs to be dealt with by international actors to avoid a crisis in Central Asia. In 1994 agriculture accounted for about 88% of total water consumption, compared with 8% by industry and 4% by municipal water distribution systems. According to World Bank experts, <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> has an adequate supply of high-quality water for future use, provided the resource is prudently managed.|$|E

25|$|The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, {{composed}} of Russia, China, Kazakhstan, <b>Kyrgyzstan,</b> Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, characterized the Andijan massacre {{as a terrorist}} plot. The SCO passed resolutions in July 2005 calling for nations to deny asylum to Uzbek refugees from Andijan in <b>Kyrgyzstan.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{killing of}} {{hundreds}} of ethnic Uzbeks in <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> during the 2010 South <b>Kyrgyzstan</b> riots resulting in the flight of thousands of Uzbek refugees to Uzbekistan have been called ethnic cleansing by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and international media.|$|E
