5|$|Concentrated {{hydrochloric}} acid (fuming {{hydrochloric acid}}) forms acidic mists. Both the mist and the solution have a corrosive effect on human tissue, {{with the potential}} to damage respiratory organs, eyes, skin, and intestines irreversibly. Upon mixing hydrochloric acid with common oxidizing chemicals, such as sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> (bleach, NaClO) or potassium permanganate (KMnO4), the toxic gas chlorine is produced.|$|E
5|$|In {{the form}} of {{chloride}} ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert to toxic. In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to <b>hypochlorite</b> in neutrophils {{as part of the}} immune response against bacteria.|$|E
5|$|The lichen's cortex and medulla react {{positively}} with potassium hydroxide (K), turning yellow. Cortex and medulla react {{positively with}} para-phenylenediamene (Pd) as well, also turning yellow. They produce no reaction with calcium or sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> (bleach – C), nor with KC (potassium hydroxide quickly followed by bleach). Among the substances {{produced by the}} lichen are atranorin and zeorin.|$|E

25|$|Chloramine {{is used as}} a {{disinfectant}} {{for water}} because it is less aggressive than chlorine and more stable against light than <b>hypochlorites.</b>|$|R
5|$|Because it {{was used}} in glassmaking, {{manganese}} dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. Ignatius Gottfried Kaim (1770) and Johann Glauber (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to permanganate, a useful laboratory reagent. By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. First, hydrochloric acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process. The production of chlorine and <b>hypochlorite</b> bleaching agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium <b>hypochlorite)</b> is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine {{is usually}} used (in {{the form of}} hypochlorous acid) to kill {{bacteria}} and other microbes in drinking water supplies and public swimming pools. In most private swimming pools, chlorine itself is not used, but rather sodium <b>hypochlorite,</b> formed from chlorine and sodium hydroxide, or solid tablets of chlorinated isocyanurates. The drawback of using chlorine in swimming pools is that the chlorine reacts with the proteins in human hair and skin (see Hypochlorous acid), and becomes chemically bonded. Even small water supplies are now routinely chlorinated.|$|E
50|$|This {{reaction}} is exothermic {{and in the}} case of concentrated <b>hypochlorites,</b> such as LiOCl and Ca(OCl)2, can lead to a dangerous thermal runaway and potentially explosions.|$|R
50|$|Like many <b>hypochlorites,</b> {{anhydrous}} NaClO {{obtained by}} desiccation of the pentahydrate will decompose violently on heating or friction. However, {{it is more}} stable in cold dilute solutions.|$|R
50|$|Phase-transfer {{catalysis}} of nucleophilic epoxidation is {{also possible}} using cinchona-based alkaloid catalysts. Phase-transfer methods allow some variability in the oxidant used: hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxide, and <b>hypochlorites</b> have all been used with some success.|$|R
5|$|Much later, during World War I in 1916, a {{standardized}} and diluted modification of Labarraque's solution containing <b>hypochlorite</b> (0.5%) and boric acid as an acidic stabilizer, {{was developed by}} Henry Drysdale Dakin (who gave full credit to Labarraque's prior work in this area). Called Dakin's solution, the method of wound irrigation with chlorinated solutions allowed antiseptic treatment {{of a wide variety}} of open wounds, long before the modern antibiotic era. A modified version of this solution continues to be employed in wound irrigation in modern times, where it remains effective against bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics (see Century Pharmaceuticals).|$|E
5|$|Welded {{titanium}} {{pipe and}} process equipment (heat exchangers, tanks, process vessels, valves) {{are used in}} the chemical and petrochemical industries primarily for corrosion resistance. Specific alloys are used in Oil & Gas downhole applications and nickel hydrometallurgy for their high strength (e. g.: titanium Beta C alloy), corrosion resistance, or both. The pulp and paper industry uses titanium in process equipment exposed to corrosive media, such as sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> or wet chlorine gas (in the bleachery). Other applications include ultrasonic welding, wave soldering, and sputtering targets.|$|E
5|$|Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not giving off a smell like <b>hypochlorite</b> treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
5000|$|... 1997: Weld-On 724 was {{introduced}} {{as the first}} high-strength solvent cement for chemical resistant CPVC plastic joints {{in the market and}} formulated for use in a variety of harsh chemical applications such as <b>hypochlorites,</b> acids and caustics.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the above routes, many other ways exist to dissolve gold, differing {{in the choice of}} the oxidant (hydrogen peroxide, <b>hypochlorites)</b> or variations of conditions. It is possible also to convert the trichloride (Au2Cl6) or the oxide (Au2O3·H2O).|$|R
50|$|<b>Hypochlorites</b> are {{frequently}} quite unstable in their pure forms {{and for this}} reason are normally handled as aqueous solutions. Their primary applications are as bleaching, disinfection and water treatment agents but they are also used in chemistry for chlorination and oxidation reactions.|$|R
5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium <b>hypochlorite,</b> sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{haloform}} reaction {{can also}} occur inadvertently in domestic settings. Bleaching with <b>hypochlorite</b> generates halogenated compounds in side reactions; chloroform {{is the main}} byproduct. Sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> solution (chlorine bleach) mixed with common household liquids such as acetone, butanone, methyl ethyl ketone, ethanol, or isopropyl alcohol can produce some chloroform, {{in addition to other}} compounds such as chloroacetone or dichloroacetone.|$|E
25|$|Deuterated {{chloroform}} is an isotopologue of chloroform with {{a single}} deuterium atom. CDCl3 is a common solvent used in NMR spectroscopy. Deuterochloroform is produced by the haloform reaction, the reaction of acetone (or ethanol) with sodium <b>hypochlorite</b> or calcium <b>hypochlorite.</b> The haloform process is now obsolete {{for the production of}} ordinary chloroform. Deuterochloroform can be prepared by the reaction of sodium deuteroxide with chloral hydrate.|$|E

25|$|These {{reactions}} are usually {{carried out at}} room temperature or below. Methylene chloride is commonly employed, although in catalytic systems employing highly polar chlorites or <b>hypochlorites,</b> a two-phase aqueous-organic system must be used. The pH of the reaction medium should be carefully controlled; for nitroxide-catalyzed reactions the pH is usually maintained between 8 and 11.|$|R
5|$|Dichlorine {{monoxide}} (Cl2O) is a brownish-yellow gas (red-brown when solid or liquid) {{which may}} be obtained by reacting chlorine gas with yellow mercury(II) oxide. It is very soluble in water, {{in which it is}} in equilibrium with hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which it is the anhydride of. It is thus an effective bleach and is mostly used to make <b>hypochlorites.</b> It explodes on heating or sparking or in the presence of ammonia gas.|$|R
