40|$|HgI 2 is an {{excellent}} semiconductor material for a low energy, room temperature x-ray spectrometer. The high values of the atomic numbers for its constituent elements gives high x-ray and gamma ray stopping power. The band gap of HgI 2 is significantly higher than other commonly used semiconductors. Owing to the large value band gap, the leakage current for HgI 2 devices is smaller, thus allowing low noise performance. Devices fabricated from HgI 2 crystals have demonstrated energy resolution sufficient to distinguish the x-ray emission from the neighboring elements on the periodic table. Also the power requirements of HgI 2 are very low. These characteristics make a HgI 2 spectrometer an ideal component in a satellite based detection system. Unfortunately, HgI 2 crystals tend to deteriorate with time, even if protected by standard semiconductor encapsulants. This degradation ruins {{the performance of the}} device in terms of its energy resolution and pulse amplitude. The degrading mechanism is believed to be material loss occurring from below the electrodes, due to high vapor pressure of HgI 2 at room temperature. To address this major obstacle to rapid expansion of HgI 2 technology, a research program aimed at improving device stability by encapsulation with <b>inert</b> <b>polymeric</b> <b>materials</b> was carried out. The program focused specifically on optimizing the encapsulant materials and their deposition techniques. The principal objectives for this program were device encapsulation, device testing, and accelerated testing to ensure very long term stability of these high resolution sensors. A variety of encapsulants were investigated with the selection criteria based on their chemical diffusion barrier properties, mechanical stability, reactivity, and morphology of encapsulant films. The investigation covered different classes of encapsulants including solvent based encapsulants, vapor deposited encapsulants, and plasma polymerized encapsulants. A variety of characterization techniques were employed to examine their effectiveness in stabilizing HgI 2 devices; these included permeability evaluation, vacuum and heat testing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well as studying the detector performance of coated detectors. The plasma polymerized films appear to have entirely solved the HgI 2 degradation problem. Another achievement of this program was the development of an accelerated testing technique which correlates extremely well with long term tesing...|$|E

40|$|The type of <b>polymeric</b> <b>material</b> {{used in the}} {{manufacturing}} of tubing determines its strength, elasticity, and durability. Tubing made of <b>polymeric</b> <b>material</b> is commonly used for analytical work because it is readily available, inexpensive and can be relatively <b>inert.</b> <b>Polymeric</b> tubing is used in many sampling applications for explosive compounds. A major concern is the uptake of the explosive compounds into or onto the tubing during sampling. Because of the reactive nature of explosives, {{it is important that}} as little of the detectable explosive as possible is lost by tubing uptake. It is also important that nothing leaches out of the tubing to interfere with the detection of explosives. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is commonly used for the analysis of trace levels of explosive compounds in the range of parts per billion (ppb) to parts per million (ppm). This study attempts to determine which types of polymers are most conducive to sampling applications where large volumes of dilute explosive solutions are collected through a length of tubing for analysis. This was determined by analyzing the amount of explosive lost from solution per cm{sup 2 } of tubing in solution. It was determined that tubing made of polyethylene, teflon, polypropylene, or KYNAR{reg_sign} is recommended for dilute trinitrotoluene (TNT) solution analyses. Tubing made of polypropylene, PHARMED{reg_sign}, KYNAR{reg_sign}, or polyethylene is recommended for analyses involving dilute explosive solutions of RDX.
