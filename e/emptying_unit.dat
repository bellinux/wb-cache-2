50|$|The third Branchage {{box office}} {{came back to}} the harbour front in St Helier, taking over an <b>empty</b> <b>unit</b> in the newly {{refurbished}} abattoir, Liberty Wharf.|$|R
50|$|Medway Council granted {{permission}} {{for a further}} extension in 2011. This extension has converted the <b>empty</b> <b>units</b> outside the main centre into a new food court with more outdoor seating, with the old food court converted into more retail units within the centre.|$|R
50|$|In 2016 it was {{reported}} that the centre had a total of fifteen <b>empty</b> <b>units</b> and had lost most of its stores including: H&M, MAC, Jaeger, Austin Reed and Soho Coffee Co. and it's few remaining stores including: Tesco Metro, EasyGym, Cafe Nero, Pret A Manger.|$|R
50|$|Platform 1 (the {{outer face}} of the up island) sees only {{occasional}} use as it has no direct access for northbound (down) terminating trains or <b>empty</b> <b>units</b> coming into service from the carriage sidings. The latter must cross over the flyover into the up reversing siding and then shunt back into the platform via the reversing line.|$|R
5000|$|However, since 2009 the Bentley Bridge Retail Park has thrived with <b>empty</b> <b>units</b> {{being filled}} by {{national}} retailers. In September 2011 retailer TK Maxx {{announced plans to}} close its city centre store in Wolverhampton and relocate to Bentley Bridge. Whilst the retail park thrives, local independent traders on the high street continue to suffer due to economic circumstances.|$|R
2500|$|It {{has also}} been criticised for alienating local {{businesses}} (such as Lewis's Department Store, [...] and the stores on Bold Street), and for shifting Liverpool's Shopping District (noting <b>empty</b> <b>units</b> around Lime Street and Ranelagh Street). Despite this, Central Village is a new shopping development that {{was scheduled to be}} constructed between 2010 and 2013 at the eastern end of the city centre.|$|R

5000|$|East Boston's {{population}} is ethnically diverse, reflecting the immigrants {{from around the}} world who moved there. Since the early 1900s, immigrants {{have been a part of}} the East Boston community. First Irish and Canadians, then Russian Jews and Italians, Southeast Asians, and finally Latinos. In 2011, East Boston was estimated to have 41,128 residents living in 14,832 housing units. [...] There are 1,258 <b>empty</b> <b>units</b> in the community.|$|R
5000|$|Pinstone Street {{connects the}} two {{shopping}} areas of Fargate and The Moor in {{the centre of}} the city. Originally called Pinstone Lane, its eastern side contains Sheffield Town Hall and the Peace Gardens. The western side of the street was to be redeveloped as part of the Sevenstone project which was postponed indefinitely {{as a result of the}} Late-2000s recession [...] - [...] the street's <b>empty</b> <b>units</b> were then occupied by a number of independent businesses and food outlets.|$|R
50|$|Healthy Spaces utilises retail or {{warehouse}} space {{which are}} empty and provides new and grassroot causes {{with the space}} {{they need to get}} started. The charity creates a link between commercial landlords and the charity sector by developing partnerships with commercial landlords that have <b>empty</b> <b>units,</b> such as retail units, banks, warehouses and restaurants. It then invites Third sector like-minded organisations to collaborate by occupying one of the spaces, rent free giving them a physical presence in the community to make an environmental difference.|$|R
5000|$|The area is zoned for manufacturing, which precludes {{permanent}} residences {{from being}} built there. The condo-hotel design was approved after negotiations with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. As a hotel condominium, 391 dwelling units within the building will be privately owned, but no unit may [...] "be {{occupied by the}} same person for more than 29 days in any 36-day period, or for more than 120 days a year." [...] When not occupied by the owner, an <b>empty</b> <b>unit</b> may be rented out as a hotel suite.|$|R
50|$|In the 2010s {{several large}} {{national}} stores left Commercial Street, amongst them Marks and Spencer, Burton and Monsoon leaving <b>empty</b> shop <b>units,</b> charity shops or bargain stores in their place.|$|R

50|$|In {{the opening}} months of 2016, a {{restricted}} top speed limit of 25mph, down from 40mph, was established over {{the entirety of}} the Dothan subdivision and an infrastructure rehabilitation project set to start on the line was cancelled. Through freight trains were either relocated to other routes or cancelled. However, numerous unit trains originating or terminating on the Dothan Subdivision continued to operate, including loaded and <b>empty</b> <b>unit</b> grain to and from the feed mills located in Troy, Banks, Pinckard, and Enterprise (via Waterford). Lengthy local road freight trains operate the Dothan-Montgomery portion, and occasional unit train shipments of rock and pipe continue to originate in Dothan.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010 it held {{a fashion}} shoot using only clothes from local shops and markets, models scouted {{on the street}} in Preston, and an <b>empty</b> <b>unit</b> in a {{run-down}} shopping centre for an ad-hoc photography studio and gallery. They used fashion imagery [...] "because it's so widely accessible" [...] and [...] "also wanted to address the way the North is presented in fashion photography." [...] Murray said [...] "Fashion is about so much more than a few fashionable people in London, ... It's peoples' identity and self-expression." [...] The resulting zine, Denim, was considered by the British Journal of Photography to be [...] "an arresting 14-page story".|$|R
50|$|Recent {{placement}} of powerful security cameras {{at the outside}} of the village and installation of a gunshot locating systems in Richmond's high-crime areas has increased policing effectiveness and lowered crime. Prospects are good for continued low crime, since the current wave of home desertions is not affecting Atchison Village, which promptly repairs and auctions <b>empty</b> <b>units.</b> Vacancy rates now are almost always at zero. It should be pointed out, also, that due to the recent gentrification to a largely middle-aged to elderly white population, the prices of homes have increased sharply over the past decade reaching upwards of $200K+ whereas many members as recently as 10 years ago were buying in at under $100K.|$|R
50|$|Several {{years after}} its closure, Our Price still had a {{presence}} in the Mander Centre, Wolverhampton, West Midlands as the <b>empty</b> retail <b>unit</b> had yet to be occupied by a new tenant and still bore the branding. In January 2013, however, the signs were removed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} Epigram {{language}} to define the universe of regular tree types—closed under <b>empty,</b> <b>unit,</b> sum, product and least fixpoint. We then present a generic decision procedure for Epigram’s in-built equality at each type, taking a complementary approach to that of Benke, Dybjer and Jansson [7]. We also give a generic definition of map, taking our inspiration from Jansson and Jeuring [21]. Finally, we equip the regular universe with the partial derivative which can be interpreted functionally as Huet’s notion of ‘zipper’, as suggested by McBride in [26] and implemented (without the fixpoint case) in Generic Haskell by Hinze, Jeuring and Löh [18]. We aim to show through these examples that generic programming can be ordinary programming in a dependently typed language. ...|$|R
50|$|The area {{is largely}} Victorian with grey granite {{tenement}} blocks {{representative of the}} period. At {{the west end of}} Rosemount larger houses exist on streets such as Belvidere Crescent. Victoria Park {{can be found in the}} north of the area. Rosemount Place itself is a very busy street for both cars and pedestrian and has small shops lining almost the entire street. It maintains a lot of traditional premises such as butchers, fishmongers, cheese shops and bakers. It has a number of smaller boutique shops. This area is one of the few still in existence in Aberdeen where a large number of independent stores can be found. Due to this fact, it remains popular and many businesses are prosperous, with <b>empty</b> <b>units</b> rare.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2013, {{work began}} on redeveloping the {{exterior}} of the station with £1 million of funding from Suffolk County Council. One aim of the redevelopment was to create a more efficient transport interchange with bus routes within the town. The works include the resurfacing of the car park and adjoining land to create 70 additional car parking spaces, as well as redesigning the taxi rank and installing modern bus shelters with electronic information boards. Initial discussions took place in mid 2013 to renovate <b>empty</b> <b>units</b> within the station, in particular the former café which was housed in the large structure facing Station Square, with the help of local groups. On 18 February 2014, Peter Aldous MP officially opened a [...] "Bike & Go" [...] outlet at the station.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{architecture of}} the building is the 1960s brutalist style. It was originally an outdoor shopping centre but it was converted to an indoor shopping centre in 1992. It was built and owned by Hartlepool Borough Council until it was privatised in the 1990s. In 2011 {{it was announced that}} the bosses at Middleton Grange are planning a rebrand, a facelift and a major push to bring in more business with a £2 million investment which see the 1960s mosaic tile effect outside the shopping centre replaced and modernised, the sea blue colour scheme inside will be replaced with a battleship grey colour scheme, the signs will be replaced with new signs and BHS announced they will be opening a new two floor 35,000 sq ft department store with a cafe in the old Woolworths store in September 2011. There are a lot of <b>empty</b> <b>units</b> due to stores closing down in the 2007 recession as there is only an 80% occupancy rate of Middleton Grange, with the new BHS store opening this will increase the occupancy rate to 86%. The majority of the <b>empty</b> <b>units</b> are located in the East Mall, Upper West Mall and Market Walk areas. The longest serving retail outlet since the opening is Boots, following the closure of Woolworths in 2009 and the pending closure of Marks & Spencer in 2015. The four anchor tenants are Marks & Spencer (until 2015), BHS, Wilko and Primark, There was fifth anchor tenant, The Co-operative Home Store and it closed in October 2011 leaving the large <b>unit</b> <b>empty,</b> the Eugene's Cafe {{at the bottom of the}} unit stayed open but closed in September 2012. That particular unit and the Primark unit were previously a supermarket housing Fine Fare, then Gateway and finally Asda until they closed and moved to new premises on Hartlepool Marina in 1995. In 2012 Brighthouse, Home Bargains, JD Sports and Sports Direct moved to larger units and Carphone Warehouse and Gamestation closed. In 2014 Marks & Spencer announced they will be closing their store in Middleton Grange to open a Simply Food store in Anchor Retail Park at Hartlepool Marina.|$|R
5|$|On 4 March 1976, a bomb {{exploded}} on an <b>empty</b> electric multiple <b>unit</b> at the station. Eight {{people in an}} adjacent train were injured.|$|R
500|$|In the 1980s, as {{the economy}} declined, {{existing}} tenants left, resulting in significant drop in occupancy rates in the apartment complexes and forcing many complexes into bankruptcy and foreclosure. Owners marketed the <b>empty</b> <b>units</b> to newly arrived immigrants and Gulfton became a predominantly immigrant community. Beginning in the 1980s Gulfton's crime rate increased and schools were increasingly overwhelmed with excess students. [...] "Houstonians" [...] (Houston citizens) nicknamed the community the [...] "Gulfton Ghetto." [...] The city of Houston responded to the sudden demographic shifts by increasing police presence, and the school district responded by opening more schools to handle the influx of students. After the 1980s demographic and socioeconomic transitions, Gulfton gained a community college campus, two additional elementary schools, added public bus routes, a park, a community center, a public library, and a juvenile detention facility.|$|R
5000|$|A {{prefilled}} pen {{is entirely}} disposable. The pen comes pre-filled with insulin, {{and when the}} insulin cartridge or reservoir is <b>empty,</b> the entire <b>unit</b> is discarded.|$|R
2500|$|Matalan {{moved to}} Strood Retail Park, {{extending}} the retail offer toward Jane's Creek. In 2009 {{the site was}} fully redeveloped with another two retail units on either side. KFC and Paul Simon moved in next to Matalan- extending the retail and leisure offer, and Subway moved into Strood High Street in 2011 giving the centre a more modern focus. Thompson Travel closed, and the <b>empty</b> <b>unit</b> sat there for around 8 months until Greggs took it over. Thus {{we see that the}} economics and demographics of the area were right for expansion. Tesco planned for a brand new store to be built on its acquired land in February 2013, But after a national policy change in March 2013 it announced that it would focus on smaller Express stores. [...] The Tesco Store [...] was to include a community hub and library which would be on the behalf of Medway Council and would have replaced the annex at the previous Civic Centre site in Strood.|$|R
50|$|Hailsham Forward's key {{actions for}} the next five years include a pedestrian-friendly High Street, parking time restrictions, the {{creation}} of loading bays in the town centre, traffic wardens, a review of business rates and shop rents, improvements to shop frontages and signage, and the attraction and retention of a broader diversity of retail outlets (independent national/chain) to fill <b>empty</b> retail <b>units</b> in the town centre.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, {{property}} consultants Colliers CRE {{conducted a}} survey of 15 towns and cities across the UK, which revealed that in October 2008 High Wycombe had the highest proportion of <b>empty</b> retail <b>units,</b> at 23.6 per cent. This was attributed to the joint impact of the recession {{and the opening of}} Eden, which had drawn many major retailers and shoppers out of other areas of the town.|$|R
50|$|Clongriffin has an off-license, a chipper, Italian restaurant, {{a barber}} and a Chinese restaurant, most at the {{beginning}} of the main street. There are several <b>empty</b> retail <b>units</b> to let, some reserved for a bigger Centra shop, a betting shop, hair salon, and for other uses. An anchor store at the empty Shopping Centre at Clongriffin Square was promised from Superquinn but this will not proceed. The Shopping Centre stands empty.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} band-structure calculations {{governed by the}} Helmholtz or Maxwell equations in piecewise homogeneous periodic materials. Methods based on boundary integral equations are natural in this context, since they discretize the interface alone and can achieve high order accuracy in complicated geometries. In order to handle the quasi-periodic conditions which are imposed on the unit cell, the free-space Green's function is typically replaced by its quasi-periodic cousin. Unfortunately, the quasi-periodic Green's function diverges for families of parameter values that correspond to resonances of the <b>empty</b> <b>unit</b> cell. Here, we bypass this problem {{by means of a}} new integral representation that relies on the free-space Green's function alone, adding auxiliary layer potentials on the boundary of the unit cell itself. An important aspect of our method is that by carefully including a few neighboring images, the densities may be kept smooth and convergence rapid. This framework results in an integral equation of the second kind, avoids spurious resonances, and achieves spectral accuracy. Because of our image structure, inclusions which intersect the unit cell walls may be handled easily and automatically. Our approach is compatible with fast-multipole acceleration, generalizes easily to three dimensions, and avoids the complication of divergent lattice sums.
