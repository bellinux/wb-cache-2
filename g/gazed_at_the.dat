25|$|The {{theme of}} stars re-emerged when Jason and Sam went star gazing after their wedding {{reception}} on September 28, 2011. Later, after Franco's {{attack on the}} couple during their honeymoon, Jason held Sam as they <b>gazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars because they made her feel safe. Jason and Sam star-gazed several times throughout the year. Stars emerged again on February 8, 2012, after Sam and Jason learned {{that they were going}} to be parents. Jason took Sam back to the honeymoon cabin he had built for them and they stargazed. They also promised each other that they would teach their child all about the constellations.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{never said}} how he {{produced}} the Book of Mormon, saying {{only that he}} translated {{by the power of}} God and implying that he had transcribed the words. The Book of Mormon itself states only that its text will [...] "come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof". As such, considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists. For {{at least some of the}} earliest dictation, Smith is said to have used the [...] "Urim and Thummim", a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates. Later, however, he is said to have used a chocolate-colored stone he had found in 1822 that he had used previously for treasure hunting. Joseph Knight said that Smith saw the words of the translation while he <b>gazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stone or stones in the bottom of his hat, excluding all light, a process similar to divining the location of treasure. Sometimes, Smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room, while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table. [...] After completing the translation, Smith gave the brown stone to Cowdery, but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about 1833 when he said he no longer needed it.|$|E

500|$|By now, Rogers {{has learned}} Astaire's true {{identity}} although {{neither of them}} yet know that her impulsive marriage to Rhodes is null and void. Dining together during carnival night in Venice, and to help assuage her guilt, Astaire declares: [...] "Let's eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow {{we have to face}} him," [...] which serves as the cue for the music of [...] "The Piccolino", the film's big production number. A gondola parade is followed by the entry of a dancing chorus who perform a series of ballroom poses and rippling-pattern routines choroeographed by Hermes Pan. Berlin, who lavished a great deal of effort on the song designed it as a pastiche of [...] "The Carioca" [...] from Flying Down to Rio (1933) and [...] "The Continental" [...] from The Gay Divorcee (1934), and the lyric communicates its fake origin: [...] "It was written by a Latin/A gondolier who sat in/his home out in Brooklyn/and <b>gazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars." [...] It is a song about a song and Rogers sings it to Astaire after which an off-camera chorus repeats it while the dance ensemble is photographed, Busby Berkeley-style, from above. The camera then switches to Rogers and Astaire who bound down to the stage to perform a two-minute dance, all shot in one take, with the Astaire-Pan choreography separately referencing the basic melody and the Latin vamp in the accompaniment. They dance to the accompaniment as they descend the steps and glide along the dance floor, then, when the melody enters, they halt and perform the Piccolino step, which involves the feet darting out {{to the side of the}} body. The rest of the dance involves repetitions and variations of the Piccolino step and the hopping steps associated with the vamp, leading to some complex amalgamations of the two. On the vamp melody's final appearance, the dancers perform a highly embellished form of the Piccolino step as they travel sideways back to their table, sinking back into their chairs and lifting their glasses in a toast.|$|E

In 1698, van Leeuwenhoek was invited to visit the Tsar Peter the Great on his boat. On this occasion van Leeuwenhoek presented the Tsar an [...] "eel-viewer", so Peter could study blood circulation whenever he wanted.|$|E
2500|$|The {{historical}} {{background of the}} Galician clergy contributed to a strong hostility and rivalry towards Poles, {{as well as a}} fierce sense of loyalty to Austria and the Habsburg dynasty by most Galician clerics. These attitudes were transmitted to their parishioners and thus reflected in Ukrainian society as a whole, earning western Ukrainians the nickname [...] "Tyroleans of the East" [...] for their loyalty to Austria. In the words of Ukrainian Catholic pilgrims visiting the tombs of the first two Austrian rulers to rule Ukraine, [...] "lost deep in thought, we <b>gazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coffins of Maria Theresa and her son Joseph, whose names are written in golden letters in our people's history." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Chan {{tradition}} ascribes {{the origins}} of Chan in India to the Flower Sermon, the earliest source for which comes from the 14th century. It is said that Gautama Buddha gathered his disciples one day for a Dharma talk. When they gathered together, the Buddha was completely silent and some speculated that perhaps the Buddha was tired or ill. The Buddha silently held up and twirled a flower and his eyes twinkled; several of his disciples tried to interpret what this meant, though {{none of them were}} correct. One of the Buddha's disciples, Mahākāśyapa, silently <b>gazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> flower and broke into a broad smile. The Buddha then acknowledged Mahākāśyapa's insight by saying the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{apparition}} {{is said to}} {{have occurred}} {{at the height of the}} Franco-Prussian War. Pontmain, a hamlet of about 500 inhabitants, lay between the oncoming Prussian army and the city of Laval. [...] The Barbedette family consisted of father César, his wife, Victoire, with their two sons Joseph and Eugène, aged ten and twelve, and another older boy who was away in the army. On the evening of 17 January 1871, the two boys were helping their father in the barn when the elder, Eugène, walked over towards the door to look out. As he <b>gazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> star studded sky he suddenly he saw an apparition of a beautiful woman smiling at him; she was wearing a blue gown covered with golden stars, and a black veil under a golden crown.|$|E
2500|$|According to legend {{it was so}} {{magnificent}} and impressive, Napoleon {{who stood}} {{on the threshold of}} this synagogue in 1812 and <b>gazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> interior was speechless with admiration. The synagogue had a number of entrances. One, at street level, consisted of a pair of iron gates that had been donated by a tailors' society in 1640. The other entrance on the western side, added in 1800, was a bit more imposing: it had an elevated two-tiered wooden gable with a portal and wrought iron posts. There was a heavy iron door with an original Hebrew inscription indicating it was a gift of a [...] "society of Psalm reciters" [...] in 1642. At the time of its building, ecclesiastical regulations all through Europe specified that a synagogue could not be built higher than a church. To obey the law, and yet create the necessary interior height, it was customary to dig a foundation deep enough for the synagogue’s floor level to be well below that of the street. Outside, the synagogue looked to be about three stories tall, but inside it soared to over five stories. Another entrance with a vestibule and the [...] "pillory" [...] was located on the northern side of the building.|$|E
