40|$|Dutch <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> are {{important}} {{actors in the}} field of urban planning. They are independent social enterprises, which take their own decisions on this stock. Many <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> work with asset management plans to secure that their portfolio meets company goals and market demand. However, in practice decisions of <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> are often not a direct result of these plans, but of incidents at the neighbourhood level, or of emerged opportunities. Next to that, <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> nowadays do not only focus on the quality of their own housing stock, but also on the physical, economical and social quality of the whole neighbourhood, which implies cooperation {{with a wide variety of}} local actors. As a result <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> in the Netherlands are increasingly employing an area-based approach towards asset management. In order to analyse the different ways <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> implement this area-based approach, the concept of planning is used. Five planning types are identified (rational, incremental, collaborative, political and advocacy planning) and transformed into propositions that are tested in a survey among housing managers. From this survey a diffuse picture arises. <b>Housing</b> <b>associations</b> use different elements from different planning types.

40|$|The {{research}} {{explores the}} regional {{responses to a}} changing context in <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> and market renting in the North East and North West of England. <b>Housing</b> <b>associations</b> are operating within a radically altered and rapidly changing policy context — something which was heightened {{during the course of}} this research. This research originated in the convergence of a number of factors shaping an agenda for <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> to engage with market renting: ◾The growth of private renting within a changing housing system. ◾Government policy encouraging institutional investment in the private rented sector. ◾The impact of funding and welfare reform on the operating environment of <b>housing</b> <b>associations,</b> including a trend towards commercialisation and diversification. Within this context, the research aimed to examine the extent and nature of market renting provision amongst <b>housing</b> <b>associations,</b> but also – crucially - to explore the strategic decision making processes shaping such activity.

40|$|Since the Dutch {{government}} strongly {{reduced its}} control of <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> in the 1990 s, the <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> have been developing different organisational strategies. In this paper I present a theoretical classification of organisational archetypes for <b>housing</b> <b>associations,</b> {{based on a}} distinction between prospectors and defenders, and between <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> with a relatively strong social orientation and those with a more business-like, commercial, orientation. The four resulting organisational archetypes are worked out {{on the basis of}} their range of activities, innovations, organisational structure, available expertise (human resources), strategic management systems, and their approach towards local accountability. Furthermore, the archetypes are illustrated and tested by case studies. It is concluded that the distinction between prospectors and defenders is applicable to the <b>housing</b> <b>associations,</b> but that the distinction between social and commercial orientation is harder to apply to practice. ...|$|R
40|$|Object {{of study}} is the {{organization}} of Real Estate Development by Dutch <b>Housing</b> <b>Associations.</b> Real estate development and <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> seem like a logical combination. Real estate development {{has been one of}} the main activities <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> have always been undertaking: developing dwellings for specific target groups, renovating dwellings and, since the 90 ’s of last century, investing and other real estate as well. The context of real estate development by <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> is highly dynamic, the institutional context and real estate market has been changing thoroughly throughout the last decades. <b>Housing</b> <b>associations</b> reacted and are reacting differently to cope with these changes. Little is known about their way of working and organizing themselves, but big differences between <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> are visible. The dissertation describes the results of an explorative research on (the problems in) the organization of real estate development by <b>housing</b> <b>associations,</b> with special attention on the division of responsibilities between employees from <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> involved in the process of real estate development. It shows that the problems in real estate development are complex and an univocal on how housing organizations organize real estate development cannot be given. However, it is clear that a large part of the problems can be related to an unclear division of responsibilities. Looking at the division of responsibilities, it can be seen that most problems arise in the first part of the real estate development process and around the way the conceptual roles of the 'Investor' and the 'Decision Maker' are fulfilled. The method of analysis used in this research had proven to be useful to identify the problems in the division of responsibilities by <b>housing</b> <b>associations.</b> Real Estate & HousingArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R

40|$|The main {{target of}} this {{research}} is to make an inventory of the financial methods that can be used by <b>housing</b> <b>associations.</b> Then these methods are tested in a financial model to see the consequences of these methods over time. The third insight gained is what the consequences of these methods are related to the legally defined tasks of the <b>housing</b> <b>associations.</b> Next to making a consequence analysis of the applicable financing methods the model is constructed {{in such a way that}} it is adaptable and suited for <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> to gain insight in their specific financial possibilities and facilitate the ongoing research to a mixed funding. The main research question answered in this graduation research is the following: What are the returns, influences and consequences for future investments of alternative ways of financing the Dutch <b>housing</b> <b>associations?</b> The research adds to the current research about the balance sheet of <b>housing</b> <b>associations.</b> The existing research is mainly focused on the assets of the <b>housing</b> <b>associations.</b> This research looks beyond the existing financial paradigm and explores the alternatives that can be used by <b>housing</b> <b>associations.</b> Due to the size of the social rent sector in the Netherlands and the growing doubt about the long term sustainability of the current financial system, research to enlarge the funding opportunities for <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> fulfils both a scientific and social need to expand the applicable knowledge. The expected research outcome and conclusions from the financial model is that several alternatives can be cheaper than the WSW secured financing. The main reason for this expectation is the number of financiers in the market; the WSW secured loans depends on the two Dutch sector-banks, their oligopoly has an upward effect on the interest yield. In other financial markets there is a decreasing interest yield due to interventions and quantitative enlargements of governments and central banks. <b>Housing</b> <b>associations</b> can benefit from this trend by exploring the other financial possibilities. For many of these methods a sound reporting standard is required and the internal organisation of the <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> must adapt to these standards.

40|$|<b>Housing</b> <b>associations</b> have an {{important}} role to play in supporting vulnerable neighbourhoods. This is one of the findings from Gerard van Bortel’s research entitled Networks and Fault Lines, which examines the role of <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> in the decision-making processes of neighbourhood strategy. Van Bortel studied decision-making processes and policy networks in the neighbourhood strategy for almost 10 years, analysing developments in two vulnerable neighbourhoods: Lozells in Birmingham and De Hoogte in Groningen. His research shows that <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> can play a stabilising, connecting role in the neighbourhood regeneration in times of crisis and government cutbacks. Improving a deprived neighbourhood needs a long-term approach. Their property ownership in the neighbourhoods gives <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> a lasting commitment to these areas. Their position as third sector organisations—between market, state and community—allows them to continue focusing on the neighbourhoods, even when politicians and media stop paying attention and the market parties see no point in investments. The importance of strong networks in neighbourhoods is becoming increasingly important. The thesis makes recommendations about how <b>housing</b> <b>associations</b> can support vulnerable neighbourhoods: not as the dominant party that will ‘sort things out’, but as a party that shows patience and perseverance by helping to forge strong ties between residents, local organisations, <b>housing</b> <b>associations,</b> municipal authorities and other relevant parties.
