40|$|The {{increase}} {{in demand for}} channel capacity and the limitations in satellite power and frequency spectrum is leading to requirements for advanced multiple beam antenna systems with frequency reuse. The concept of the Olympus satellite evolved {{from the fact that}} new technologies and methods are to be explored for future satellites. The role of Olympus can be seen in both the development of earth station networks {{and at the same time}} the satellite requirements for the future satellites. It is a step between advanced transparent repeaters and the future intelligent satellite with on-board processing. A review of commercial and experimental satellites employed in the European region is given in the thesis. The services offered by these satellites and the access methods used are discussed with particular emphasis on business services. The new research work reported was done on the experiments related to the Olympus SS-TDMA payload. First a survey of commercial TDMA systems was performed and their capabilities discussed in detail for the SS-TDMA experimental application. The Olympus payload description and link budget analysis was performed in order to identify the size of the earth station required for these networks. The performance of the satellite link was simulated using BOSS software package together with some earlier simulation using the TOPSIM software package. The methods of BER estimation used are investigated and various results compared. These simulations covered most aspects of the RF (degradation due to TWTA non-linearity, fading, carrier spacing, co-channel interference) and some aspects of the baseband circuits. These simulation results have been compared with the experimental results and were found to be in close agreement. Thus giving confidence in the simulation methods used. In SS-TDMA the problem of acquisition and synchronisation is very important. In this respect the design of the acquisition and synchronisation unit (ASU) is discussed in detail. The resulting ASU was interfaced with the reference station of the commercial TDMA system for the first phase of the SS-TDMA experiments. Finally we present results of various network control methods for the SS-TDMA network, including the buffer requirement for the on-board clock control with the sidereal day clock correction. The ASU design, its interface to the reference TDMA terminal and successful operation with the reference station in acquiring and synchronising with the satellite switch provided the real time operation of the SS-TDMA scheme. The operation was conducted experimentally using the BTRL (British Telecom Research Labs) <b>experimental</b> <b>earth</b> <b>station</b> at Martlesham both in the "reference station loopback" and "reference station and traffic station" configuration via the the SS-TDMA switch. Full details of the experiments and comparison with systems simulations are presented in the thesis...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe {{capability}} of modern satellite earth terminals has increased, expanded, and {{benefited from the}} development and application of both microprocessor and minicomputer components. Microprocessors with intrinsic low cost and capability limited only by the imagination of engineers are now key components in the fundamental communications performance of <b>earth</b> <b>stations.</b> These components are now {{an integral part of}} antenna, modem, multiplexers, status and control, and communications control hardware.

The system includes a 6. 1 meter Ku-band satellite <b>earth</b> <b>station,</b> two transportable <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> each with a 1. 8 meter dish, and commercial modems designed for two-way timing. Elements of the facilities are described in this paper. High-accuracy timing with this equipment using the two-way time transfer technique via a geostationary satellite is d'iscussed. Phase stability measurements of ground facilities in various loop-around schemes using a satellite simulator have been performed in order to determine ultimate stability limits. Allan-variance stability plots are generated for sample times of 1 s to several days at various carrier-to-noise density (C/No) ratios. These plots are compared to theoretical limits obtained from the model of phase jitter given for the spread spectrum modem. The use of small transportable <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> with full duplex capability provides for signal turn-around at a remote location with stationary satel-lites in common view with the NBS <b>earth</b> <b>station.</b> It is shown that the portability of the small <b>earth</b> <b>stations</b> readily allows a measurement of signal delays through the ground equipment including the orthomode transducer, feed, and other antenna-related items.
