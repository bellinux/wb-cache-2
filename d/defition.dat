40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to obtain similar {{solutions}} for gas-particle nonequillibrium nozzle flows. Modified <b>defitions</b> for speed for sound and Mach number are proposed for this study. The governing equations are transformed into a similar form and a single correlating parameter is obtained. The limiting (equillibrium and frozen) speeds of sound are shown to be derivable from the modified definition. The numerical results transpire several interesting phenomena occurring in the nozzle. For example, the approach to isothermal condition of the flow at very large loading ratio is proved with no assumption regarding the lag of the particles. By varying the numerical values of the general correlating parameter, the complete nonequillibrium regime of the flow can be scanned. With the present similar solutions, the flow quantities in a nozzle can be readily determined for different particle sizes, loading ratios, reservoir conditions, and {{for a family of}} nozzle shapes without resorting to complex computer programs...|$|R

40|$|The limite concept, a {{basic concept}} for {{calculus}} courses {{has been reported}} as a difficult concept for the students around the world. As a teacher at a secondary school and as a lecturer at the Eduardo Mondlane University I perceived the students'difficulties when encountering this concept. The present study scrutinizes the students'understanding {{of the concept of}} limit of a function. I borrowed the concepts "concept image and concept definitions"from Tall and Vinner (1981) to establish the students'mental images and definitions of the limit concept. Since mental images can only come into being within a representation, I concerned myself with how the students worked the numerical, algebraic and graphical representations and how they switched from one representation to another, drawing on Douady's (1986) work. Two classes of two schools, one in Maputo and other in Quelimane were chosen for the present study. A task was administerd and nine students, four from Maputo and five from Quelimane, were interviewed with the goal deeping the students'thinking when tackling the limit concept. The results of the research showed tha students'concept definitions of a limit of a funtion might be split into two broad categories. The first category encompassed the <b>defitions</b> that suggested a dynamic nature which were classified as approach and continuity. Alternatively, the students'definitions indicated a staatic concept definition, using the words interval, neighborhood or the formal definition with the simbols and were included in the categories notations/algebraic calculation, boundary and formal definition. Similarly, the students'images included the asymptotic and the motion picture. Adding to these two categories three static concept images were classified: the barrier, the value correspondence and the procedural. moreover, i established the relationship between the different representation systems and students'concept images used in the solution process. in addition, I ascentained students'connections between images associated to the context and those generated from the mathematics in a daily life proble...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a better {{understanding}} of how virtual relationships can be described in a business-to-business setting. This purpose is achieved by exploring, describing and somewhat explaining how the virtual relationship process can be described, how the benefits and risks with virtual relationships can be described, and how the people involved in a virtual relationship can be described. Case studies are performed on Frontec AB, Effnet AB and MoDo Paper AB. The process was concluded to involve mostly information search and exploration of the relationship. The main benefits was found to be lower marketing costs and increased customer retention, while the main risk was found to be unreliable soft- and hardware. The people involved matched the proposed roles in the Buying Team very well, while some deviations existed in the Buying Center. Finally, a <b>defition</b> of virtual relationships is given, as well as implications for managers, theory, and future research. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|Precis The Thesis {{comprehensively}} describes {{and explains}} basic concepts of Steiner-Vallentyne Left-Libertarianism. The introductory part compares this school of Left-Libertarianism with other approaches and advocates {{the method of}} critical theory of society being used, which was formulated by Marek Hrubec, successing classical authors of critical theory. This method divides the analyzed phenomena into three phases - critique, explanation and normativity. The critical phase describes relation between the analyzed and reality, while defining the analyzed against it. Explanation clarifies positive elements, which are consequent from the critique of reality and ultimately, the normative phase formulates a specific conception of the elements' realization. In this Diploma Thesis the critical phase is represented by <b>defition</b> of Left-Libertarianism against dominant streams in contemporary political philosophy, with the accent on its differentiation from related approaches, constituting their conception on one's freedom - especially rawlsian liberalism and classical libertarianism. Explanatory phase is dedicated to basic concepts of Left-Libertarianism, their historical roots and theoretical principles on which they are constituted. Finally, the normative phase presents the concept of universal basic income, which [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{assessment of the}} interaction between the land-use transporttion system and travel behavior. A methodology is developed to identify a range of land-use transportation systems using a clustering technique with network and land use inputs. Twenty neighborhoods from Orange County, California, were considered in this process. Three groups, or themes, were found to best represent the neighborhoods in the sample area, one each associated with the conventional <b>defition</b> of neotraditional (TND) and planned unit development (PUD) neighborhoods, and one representing neighborhoods that blend characteristics of TND and PUD. Conventional and more complex measures of individual travel behavior were compared via an analysis of variance between the themes to identify significant differences, controlling for socio-economic differences. Research results included the development of a systematic methodology to identify a more explicit land use and transportation dimension, an estimate of the potential effectiveness of design-oriented solutions to reduce automobile congestion using the developed themes, and a preliminary assessment {{of the extent to which}} development themes can be utilized to improve the current modeling framework...|$|E
40|$|The test cost of RF {{systems is}} an {{increasing}} percentage of the overall system cost. This trend is mainly {{due to the traditional}} RF testing schemes based on the full measurement of specifications over a wide range of input conditions. In this paper, we present a test development methodology for RF circuits based on a novel parametric fault <b>defition.</b> We target deviations in physical circuit parameters, such as a resistance or the width of a transistor. However, we consider a circuit faulty only if it violates a specification. Our test development method aims at reducing not only the number of measurements, but also the overall test hardware cost by incorporating the relative set-up cost of each measurement into our selection criteria. Experimental results on a low-noise amplifier (LNA) circuit show that our test development technique reduces the overall test time (49 %- 67 %) as well as the number of required measurement set-ups (17 %- 33 %) considerably. By defining the target faults based on specification violations, our technique also provides high confidence in the test quality. 1...|$|E

It therefore analyzes a portion of land of special cultural value in its geographic connotations in order to represent it in its entirety. We make use of cross-disciplinary approach {{that makes it possible}} to develop a complete inventory of Geosites nationally and internationally thanks to the determination of a standardized methodology for computerization of all the features about the good itself. It builds a Geographic Information System, which combines in a single project all the Geosyte geographical, scientific and cultural informations identifying it uniquely through polygons with standard size of 1 km² (Areas Minimum Sample) or multiples of them, connected to a relational database wich contains all the information about the Geosyte provided by the ISPRA format. The georeferencing system used is WGS 84, the only one available on a global scale, integrated to a UTM projection system, to avoid deformations {{and to be able to}} perform areal processing. A series of thematic maps allow detailed analysis of the territory, taking as a basis the land use map defined by a methodology standardized at European level, the Biohab, which allows a very high level of detail, perfect for an area of dimensions considered.

After that, judge will determine that pawning execution could implemented through private sale, with condition and definition determined by judge fairly. In this research {{the main problem}} which will studied was about, whether share security could implemented through private sale and if share securityy execution definition implemented by private sale must based on justice definition. This research could give contribution of knowledge, and give description clearly and detailed about share security execution by private sale. Research method used was judicial-normative. Normative method was literature study, it was research concerning secondary data. Research spesification used was such descriptive-analytical study. In this research, writer used judicial normative method, therefore data used was secondary data. Data analysis technique in this research was using qualitative analysis type. It's meant valued prevailed law and relatively have normative characteristic and to create the purpose of law. Pawning execution implementation through private sale could carried out, but must with judge mediator. This case as intended by Article 1156 KUHP. Judge will determined that pawning execution was implemented through private sale, with condition and definition determined by judge fairly. Therefore, creditor couldn't determined price arbitrarily. Share security execution definition implemented by private sale must based on justice <b>defition</b> and justice verdict. Therefore, private sale share security execution process will in line with Article 1156 KUHP. Parties that have other agreement was that share security without auction in general, must kept asked justice definition, therefore that private sale was legal. Private sale share security implementation decided by asked judge mediator, therefore wasn't deviate from essence of Article 1156 KU&HP. Besides that government must be made regulation specifically {{as soon as possible}} about share security execution implementation in order to ease and more assured legal certainty about share security execution implementation.

There is a lack of studies that would show the demand and the nature of help required by women who go through crisis pregnancy. Crisis {{pregnancy is}} a prennancy which is neither planned nor desired by woman, and which means a personai crisis for her. This <b>defition</b> can include a woman for whom a planned or desired pregnancy turns into a crisis over time due to a change in circumstances. Support of close friends or family members {{is one of the most}} important factors for woman in crisis pregnancy that could help to overcome it. Qualitative research shows the demand for help that women experiencing crisis pregnancy need. The research method is semi-structured personal interview. Women who had an abortion and received pastoral help through Rachelle program participated in this research. During the time of deliberation the emotional state of women could be described as discomfort (fear), feeling of being lost (having no one to share with or having a strong inner resistance) and being forced to choose an abortion instead of being ofered help. The reaction to a crisis pregnancy from medical doctors was pressure, indifference or lack of information. The reaction of husbands/partners to a crisis pregnancy was incomprehension of the situation, hostility towards an unborn child, psychological pressure and even abuse. The reaction from relatives and those close to a pregnant woman was a lack of dialogue, showing no interest towards an unborn child, encouraging an abortion or dissuading it. In a case of encouraging an abortion or dissuading it woman's decision to give birth depended on the strength of the emotional bond with and trust in the person giving the advice. According to this research women would have needed psychological help, a chance to discuss their choice with medical doctors, objective information about abortion and the beginning of human life, to be discour-aged to choose an abortion and motivated for the motherhood. The search for solution, as well as positive news of child birth, an authoritative advice and the truth about abortion told by a medical doctor could have changed their decision. Trust in the authority of person who helps women to make the best decision during crisis pregnancy and gives her advice is very important for changing the decision.

Making accessible, it is important to review nowadays of internet 2 applications. •	Under present trends: o	Present experience and age limit to be called heritage: this is completely ambiguous to the different realities, heritage is not only an experience, it is a necessity. o	Concept of precaution, preventive actions in the field of conservation: this is extensively research and relevant experiences are out there and being applied around the globe, this is not a new concept or deviation of the traditional practice of the Venice charter, it is a reality; •	Under new tools: o	This is an understatement, the use of databases, internet, photogrammetry, etc is not new, nowadays, evry single country in Europe makes use of this, the problem those not lay of the technology but on the good use of it. However the gap between information providers and users is getting even bigger now with the collection of data being more automatic, extensive. o	Also the exploitation of google maps, earth, etc where people identified heritage sites is increasing a lot, the discussion should focus on how to adapt our selves to this new trend in the internet and built environment design technology, and to professionazed heritage actors in this. •	Production o	Please do not mention a global methodology, this is not possible, the nature of heritage is diverse and one should respect this fact, it is important to prepare guidelines and conventions, also competences in heritage information, especially in ventories, please look at guidelines prepared by the Getty Conservation Insitute’s ourput on the RecorDIM initiative: ([URL] and the English Heritage guidelines at : [URL] o	Knowledge, it will be preferably to talk about level of detail that leads to decisions; o	Validation: who validates? o	Perhaps it is better to assess heritage from the the potential threats to their significance and integrity, this provides the type of information required; •	Processing and communications: o	The matter is not choosing a simple, is making a good feasibility study and chose the best fitted information strategy; o	Level of information needs to be define; o	Use of digital tools is a requirement, but the issue of provenance and longetivity of information is an issue; •	Users and uses: o	Identification of competences is a requirement for definition of uses o	Practices also need to be defined o	Decision making process; [...] - - National priorities identified in the field of Cultural Heritage: -	The priority target should be defined by a group of information usres and providers, as well as, the government and the academics, this should be done by the <b>defition</b> of comptences and the current legal status; -	Background research and feasibility studies should set an example; -	Use of instruments, such as the World Heritage Convention should be put in place, this is perhaps the most effective instrument nowadays at the international level; -	major economic and social issues in the management of the Heritage: this is always an issue, but rather than a challenge it is a reality, cost-effective inventories will help people manage their heritage better - Actors involved in the Conservation policy - Government services and agencies, universities, what about NGO’s 	- partnership conditions - Short history of the inventories in the country, experimentations and regular services - Organisation and financing of the inventories according to the different services (museums, monuments, archaeology, ethnography, natural sites…) - Users of the inventoriesstatus: accepte...|$|E
