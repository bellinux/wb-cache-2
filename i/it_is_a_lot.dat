500|$|Chamber pop {{was part}} of a larger trend which {{involved}} musicians who rejected traditional rock conventions, such as Tortoise and Stereolab, although those specific bands are not considered ork-pop. [...] The genre's orchestration is typically more complex than rock music, making extensive use of brass and strings. It drew from the 1990s lounge music revival but avoided any influence from other contemporary styles like grunge, electronica, or alternative music, particularly the lo-fi hiss and distortion of the last. Although modern rock groups like Smashing Pumpkins, Oasis, and R.E.M. occasionally used strings, their approach was considerably less intricate. The High Llamas were one of the first to anticipate the easy-listening fad with their 1993 debut album Gideon Gaye. O'Hagan felt that [...] "There is this whole misconception that American college rock with twisted baseball hats and checked shirts is adventurous, but it's the most conformist, corporate thing out there.... All these bands sound like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. It's a shame that it couldn't be discovered from the get-go for what <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> of it is just very simple dumb-guy rock." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times said, [...] "By {{trying so}} hard for authenticity, this Doctor Zhivago drains the story of much of its lyricism.... Mr. Lean's grander, glossier version was a closer match to the romantic spirit of the novel's hero.... The Davies version is engrossing but more for the {{harrowing}} scenes set {{in the civil war}} after the revolution than for the novel's legendary love triangle. Black-and-white archival photographs - Moscow slums, newspaper shots of soldiers marching off to World War I - are interspersed throughout the film and slowly bleed into a scene of the television show. The visual trick gives the series a quasi-documentary feel and is quite effective. Yet Mr. Davies takes the same liberties with Pasternak's text as the original film did, focusing on the love story and discarding a lot of the politics, secondary plots and literary sidetracks.... This Doctor Zhivago can be watched as a useful history lesson and as a cautionary show business tale: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> easier to adapt a Jane Austen novel than it is to remake a film by David Lean." ...|$|E

Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly rates the film as [...] "A" [...] grade, positing that examination of the students' different motives for survival or subversion of the Program is a [...] "sick blast". A.O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, stating [...] " [...] expertly choreographed scenes of mayhem are at once comical and appalling, and [...] young cast embraces the melodramatic extremity of the story with impressive conviction", adding that Battle Royale [...] "is {{in many ways a}} better movie [...] and in any case a fascinating companion, drawn from a parallel cultural universe. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> uglier and also, perversely, a lot more fun."

[...] Alexandra Cavallo of the Boston Phoenix writes, [...] "Battle Royale is The Hunger Games not diluted for young audiences" [...] while giving the film three stars out of four. Jeffrey M. Anderson of Combustible Celluloid gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, calling it a [...] "gloriously sick and twisted story" [...] and claiming that it is [...] "endlessly entertaining, by turns gory and hilarious, disturbing and exciting." [...] In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert's Australia correspondent Michael Mirasol praised Battle Royale for its [...] "thoughtful characterisation" [...] that is [...] "lavished upon all the students" [...] and concluded that it is an [...] "intensely violent fable aimed at a young audience, but with true feeling, intelligence, and respect." [...] Jake Mulligan of The Suffolk Voice gave it five out of five stars, stating that [...] "the influence of [...] "Royale" [...] on works as disparate as [...] "Kill Bill" [...] and [...] "The Hunger Games" [...] cannot be measured" [...] and describing Battle Royale as [...] "Provocative, funny, violent, and aided by a script that somehow gives equal attention to most of the students while also displaying the well-thought out minutia behind the narrative." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hassan {{explained}} that Lynsey does not {{cope with the}} challenge very well as she has already been pushed to breaking point over recent months and now she is trapped having to play Silas' psychotic game.

Lynsey tries {{to stand up to}} Silas, but he outwits her at every turn". At her [...] "lowest ebb", Lynsey confides in Doug Carter (PJ Brennan) whose girlfriend, Jenny (Daisy Turner), was killed by Silas. Hassan {{explained that}} Lynsey takes a big risk in confiding in Doug but Lynsey trusts him to keep it a secret. Lynsey feels like she should not be bringing Doug in to the dangerous situation but she realises that she needs someone to help her. Her portrayer went on to add that Doug believes Lynsey and shows her a lot of kindness and friendship. Lynsey is given clues by Silas to help her identify his next victim, although they leave Lynsey feeling like she has no way of figuring the potential victim's identity out as the clues seem to fit everyone. Hassan said that by the time Halloween arrives Lynsey feels [...] "totally tired and exhausted". Silas reveals that Lynsey is the woman he intended to kill but she escapes. Silas kills a woman dressed as Catwoman, initially believing it to be Lynsey until he realises it is his daughter, Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy). Lynsey soon after exposes Silas who is arrested. Hassan said that she had enjoyed seeing Lynsey show gumption during the storyline and hoped to see more of this side of her character. Reflecting on the storyline, Hassan said the storyline was amazing and added that she was enthusiastic to play the storyline. She said that previous to the storyline she had known she could show a feistier side and more depth to Lynsey which she was always aware existed.|$|E
