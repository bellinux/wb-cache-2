25|$|Jandamarra The Play (2008) {{was sold}} out before its opening season premiere at the Perth International Arts Festival. As the {{director}} of Bunuba Films since 2000, Oscar {{was one of the}} driving forces in the company's marathon journey to bring Jandamarra's story to the stage. Jandamarra, a Bunuba warrior born in 1873, was famous for leading his people in an armed uprising against the British colonisation of their lands. He outsmarted the police and settlers in the Kimberley for years, before being killed in 1897 at the age of 24. Geoffrey Bolton, a distinguished Australian historian, compared Jandamarra to guerilla leaders like the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata and Sicilian rebel Salvatore Giuliano. Oscar said Jandamarra was fighting for his people’s freedom. “He was not an outlaw, he was fighting for his land, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> freedom fighter”.|$|E
500|$|Valery Krylov, {{advisor to}} Anatoly Karpov and a {{specialist}} in the [...] "psycho-physiological rehabilitation of sportsmen", believed Fischer suffered from schizophrenia. Psychologist Joseph G Ponterotto, from second-hand sources, concludes that [...] "Bobby did not meet all the necessary criteria to reach diagnoses of schizophrenia or Asperger syndrome. The evidence is stronger for paranoid personality disorder." [...] Magnús Skúlason, a chess player and a psychiatrist and head doctor of Sogn Mental Asylum for the Criminally Insane, befriended Fischer {{toward the end of}} Fischer's life. From Endgame, Fischer's 2011 biography by Frank Brady: Skulason was not [...] "Bobby's psychiatrist", as has been implied in the general press, nor did he offer Bobby any analysis or psychotherapy. He was at Bobby's bedside as a friend, to try to do anything he could for him. Because of his training, however, he couldn't fail to take note of Bobby's mental condition. [...] "He definitely was not schizophrenic", Skulason said. [...] "He had problems, possibly certain childhood traumas that had affected him. He was misunderstood. Underneath <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> caring sensitive person." ...|$|E

60|$|Fassifern, {{who had no}} hand in the murder, 'let it go,' and {{probably}} handed the blackmailer's letter over to the Campbells. Later, ----, ---- of ----, the blackest villain in the country, offered to the Government to accuse Fassifern of the murder. The writer of the anonymous letter to Fassifern is styled 'Blarmachfildich,' or 'Blarmackfildoch,' in the correspondence. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Mr. Millar, employed by Fassifern to agitate against Glenure.|$|E

He was a thin, youngish kind of man, I should say past fifty, sort of French-Irish in his affections, and puffed up with disconsolation. Yes, he was a {{flattened}} kind of a man, in whom drink lay stagnant, inclined to corpulence and misery. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kind of Dutchman, being very sad and genial in his ways.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, indeed! At {{first it}} was rather terrible, and yet so true I wouldn't change a word of it. But I don't wonder he is misunderstood, belied, and abused. He tells the truth so plainly, and lets in the light so clearly, that hypocrites and sinners must fear and hate him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little hard and unsparing, sometimes, though I don't know enough to judge the men and {{measures}} he condemned.

6000|$|... "The cat is a sweet animal. I {{love them}} very much. They are clean and pretty, and catch rats and mice, {{and let you}} pet them, and are fond of you if you are kind. They are very wise, and can find their way anywhere. Little cats are called kittens, and are dear things. I have two, named Huz and Buz, and their mother is Topaz, because she has yellow eyes. Uncle told me a pretty story about a man named Ma-ho-met. He had a nice cat, {{and when she was}} asleep on his sleeve, and he wanted to go away, he cut off the sleeve so as not to wake her up. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kind man.

60|$|He {{stopped at}} the door of his office while I traversed the {{littered}} anteroom. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> somewhat taken aback.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little {{surprised}} to hear himself saying this; but, {{as soon as it}} was said, he liked it. He was Captain Stroke playing in the Den again, after all, and playing as well as ever. Nothing being so real to Tommy as pretence, I daresay he even began to feel his ankle hurting him. [...] "Gently," [...] he begged of Corp, with a gallant smile, and clenching his teeth so that the pain should not make him cry out before the ladies. Thus, with his lieutenant's help, did Stroke manage to reach Aaron's house, making light of his mishap, assuring them cheerily that he should be all right to-morrow, and carefully avoiding Grizel's eye, though he wanted very much to know what she thought of him (and of herself) now.|$|E
6000|$|I {{regret to}} say that James was lying. His mashie was in {{excellent}} repair, and {{he still had a}} dozen balls in his bag, it being his prudent practice always to start out with eighteen. No! What he had said was mere subterfuge. He wanted to go to his locker and snatch a few minutes with Sandy MacBean's [...] "How to Become a Scratch Man". He felt sure that one more glance at the photograph of Mr. MacBean driving would give him the mastery of the stroke and so enable him to win the match. In this <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little sanguine. The difficulty about Sandy MacBean's method of tuition was that he laid great stress {{on the fact that the}} ball should be directly in a line with a point exactly in the centre of the back of the player's neck; and so far James's efforts to keep his eye on the ball and on the back of his neck simultaneously had produced no satisfactory results.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] {{replied the}} girl. [...] "I was between {{thirteen}} and fourteen, and wore short dresses, {{and my hair}} was plaited. My father was on duty at the Philadelphia Navy-Yard, and we lived in that city. There {{was a young man}} who used to come to bring messages to father; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> clerk or a draftsman. I do not remember his name, except that his first name was Rupert, and father always called him by that. He was a beautiful man-boy or boy-man, however you choose to put it. His eyes were heavenly blue, his skin was smooth and white, his cheeks were red, and he had the most charming mouth I ever saw. He was just the right height, well shaped, and wore the most becoming clothes. I fell madly in love with him the second time I saw him, and continued so for a long time. I used to think about him and dream about him, and write little poems about him which nobody ever saw. I tried to make a sketch of his face once, but I failed and tore it up." ...|$|E
60|$|Then he bustled away {{to speak}} {{to some of his}} {{important}} guests, from whom <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> seeking political information.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not a beggar, for {{he wanted}} to pay Monna Lisa, only {{she asked him to}} do work for her instead. And he gets himself shaved, and his clothes are tidy: Monna Lisa says <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a decent man. But {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not in his right mind: Lupo, at Peretola, was not in his right mind, and he looks a little like Lupo sometimes, as if he didn't know where he was." ...|$|R
60|$|The long-drawn voyage {{came to an}} end at last. On the {{afternoon}} of October 30 we sighted land, and looking westward I perceived what looked like a dark wave of water breaking the smooth rim of the horizon. A short time developed the wave into the rocks and slopes of Robben Island--a barren spot inhabited by lepers, poisonous serpents, and dogs undergoing quarantine. Then with the darkness we entered Table Bay, and, steaming slowly, reached the anchorage at ten o'clock. Another hour of waiting followed until the tugboat obeyed the signal; but at last she ran alongside, and there stepped on board a Man Who Knew. Others with despatches pushed roughly through the crowd of soldiers, officers, passengers, and war correspondents to the General's cabin. We caught the Man Who Knew, however, and, setting him half way up the ladder to the hurricane deck, required him forthwith to tell us of the war. Doubtless you have been well informed of all, or at any rate of much, that has passed. The man told his story quickly, with an odd quiver of excitement in his voice, and the audience--perhaps we were 300--listened breathless. Then {{for the first time we}} heard of Elandslaagte, of Glencoe, of Rietfontein, a tale of stubborn, well-fought fights with honour for both sides, triumph for neither. 'Tell us about the losses--who are killed and wounded?' we asked this wonderful man. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> passage agent or something like that.|$|E
60|$|I had at {{that period}} {{a small room}} {{at the top of}} a house owned by a distant relation--a second or third cousin, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> man of {{independent}} and original character, had a Ulyssean experience of men and cities, and an old English name of which he was proud. While in London he had procured from the Heralds' College his family arms, whose crest was stamped upon a quantity of plate he had brought with him to California. The plate, together with an exceptionally good cook, which he had also brought, and his own epicurean tastes, he utilized in the usual practical Californian fashion by starting a rather expensive half-club, half-restaurant in the lower part of the building--which he ruled somewhat autocratically, as became his crest. The restaurant was too expensive for me to patronize, but I saw many of its frequenters as well as those who had rooms at the club. They were men of very distinct personality; a few celebrated, and nearly all notorious. They represented a Bohemianism--if such it could be called--less innocent than my later experiences. I remember, however, one handsome young fellow whom I used to meet occasionally on the staircase, who captured my youthful fancy. I met him only at midday, as he did not rise till late, and this fact, with a certain scrupulous elegance and neatness in his dress, ought to have made me suspect that he was a gambler. In my inexperience it only invested him with a certain romantic mystery.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seems that}} the boy, who gave his name as Ralph Kenzie, though I believe that really it was Ralph Mackenzie, was {{travelling}} {{with his father and}} mother and many others from a country called India, which is one of those places that the English have stolen {{in different parts of the}} world, as they stole the Cape and Natal and all the rest. They travelled for a long while in a big ship, for India is a long way off, till, when they were near this coast, a storm sprang up, and after the wind had blown for two days they were driven on rocks a hundred miles or more away from our stead. So fierce was the sea and so quickly did the ship break to pieces that only one boat was got out, which, except for a crew of six men, was filled with women and children. In this boat the boy Ralph and his mother were given a place, but his father did not come, although the captain begged him, for he was a man of some importance, whose life was of more value than those of common people. But he refused, for he said that he would stop and share the fate of the other men, which shows that this English lord, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lord, had a high spirit. So he kissed his wife and child and blessed them, and the boat was lowered to the sea, but before another could be got ready the great ship slipped back from the rock upon which she hung and sank (for this we heard afterwards from some Kaffirs who saw it), and all aboard of her were drowned. May God have mercy upon them! ...|$|E
40|$|Professor Robert Sedler is {{a leading}} {{constitutional}} law professor and a well-known civil liberties lawyer. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> right about many things.

60|$|Poor Mrs. Micawber! She {{said she}} had tried to exert herself, and so, I have no doubt, she had. The centre of the street door was {{perfectly}} covered with a great brass-plate, on which was engraved 'Mrs. Micawber's Boarding Establishment for Young Ladies': but I never found that any young lady had ever been to school there; or that any young lady ever came, or proposed to come; or that the least preparation was ever made to receive any young lady. The only visitors I ever saw, or heard of, were creditors. THEY used to come at all hours, and some of them were quite ferocious. One dirty-faced man, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> boot-maker, used to edge himself into the passage as early as seven o'clock in the morning, and call up the stairs to Mr. Micawber--'Come! You ain't out yet, you know. Pay us, will you? Don't hide, you know; that's mean. I wouldn't be mean if I was you. Pay us, will you? You just pay us, d'ye hear? Come!' Receiving no answer to these taunts, he would mount in his wrath to the words 'swindlers' and 'robbers'; and these being ineffectual too, would sometimes go to the extremity of crossing the street, and roaring up at the windows of the second floor, where he knew Mr. Micawber was. At these times, Mr. Micawber would be transported with grief and mortification, even to the length (as I was once made aware by a scream from his wife) of making motions at himself with a razor; but within half-an-hour afterwards, he would polish up his shoes with extraordinary pains, and go out, humming a tune with a greater air of gentility than ever. Mrs. Micawber was quite as elastic. I have known her to be thrown into fainting fits by the king's taxes at three o'clock, and to eat lamb chops, breaded, and drink warm ale (paid for with two tea-spoons that had gone to the pawnbroker's) at four. On one occasion, when an execution had just been put in, coming home through some chance as early as six o'clock, I saw her lying (of course with a twin) under the grate in a swoon, with her hair all torn about her face; but I never knew her more cheerful than she was, that very same night, over a veal cutlet before the kitchen fire, telling me stories about her papa and mama, and the company they used to keep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Amyas Belamour! Sir Jovian's brother! Ah! {{that is a}} sad story," [...] replied Betty, [...] "though I am {{not certain}} that I have it correctly, having only heard it {{discussed}} between {{my father and mother}} when I was a growing girl, sitting at my sampler. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> barrister; I know he was a very fine gentleman and a man of parts, who had made the Grand Tour; for when he was staying at the Great House, he said my mother was the only person he met who could converse with him on the Old Masters, or any other subject of virtu, and that, being reported to my Lady, increased her bitterness all the more because Mr. Belamour was a friend of Mr. Addison and Sir Richard Steele, and had contributed some papers to the Spectator. He was making a good fortune in his profession, and had formed an engagement with a young lady in Hertfordshire, of a good old family, but one which had always been disliked by Lady Belamour. It is said, too, that Miss Sedhurst had been thought to have attracted one of my Lady's many admirers, and that the latter was determined not to see her rival become her sister-in-law, and probably with the same title, since Mr. Belamour {{was on the verge of}} obtaining knighthood. So, if she be not greatly belied, Lady Belamour plied all parties with her confidences, till she contrived to breed suspicion and jealousy on all sides, until finally Miss Sedhurst's brother, a crack-brained youth, offered such an insult to Mr. Belamour, that honour required a challenge. It was thought that as Mr. Belamour was the superior in age and position, the matter might have been composed, but the young man was fiery and hot tempered, and would neither retract nor apologise; and Mr. Belamour had been stung in his tenderest feeling. They fought with pistols, an innovation that, as you know, my father hates, as far more deadly and unskilful than the noble practice of fencing; and the result was that Mr. Sedhurst was shot dead, and Mr. Belamour received a severe wound in the head. The poor young lady, being always of a delicate constitution, fell into fits on hearing the news, an died in a few weeks. The unfortunate Mr. Belamour survives, but whether from injury to the brain, or from grief and remorse, he has never been able to endure either light or company, but has remained ever since in utter darkness and seclusion." ...|$|E
6000|$|And now, I see a {{wonderful}} row of little lights rise smoothly {{out of the}} ground, before a vast green curtain. Now, a bell rings--a magic bell, which still sounds in my ears unlike all other bells--and music plays, amidst a buzz of voices, and a fragrant smell of orange-peel and oil. Anon, the magic bell commands the music to cease, and the great green curtain rolls itself up majestically, and The Play begins! The devoted dog of Montargis avenges {{the death of his}} master, foully murdered in the Forest of Bondy; and a humorous Peasant with a red nose and a very little hat, whom I take from this hour forth to my bosom as a friend (<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Waiter or an Hostler at a village Inn, but many years have passed since he and I have met), remarks that the sassigassity of that dog is indeed surprising; and evermore this jocular conceit will live in my remembrance fresh and unfading, overtopping all possible jokes, unto the end of time. Or now, I learn with bitter tears how poor Jane Shore, dressed all in white, and with her brown hair hanging down, went starving through the streets; or how George Barnwell killed the worthiest uncle that ever man had, and was afterwards so sorry for it that he ought to have been let off. Comes swift to comfort me, the Pantomime--stupendous Phenomenon!--when clowns are shot from loaded mortars into the great chandelier, bright constellation that it is; when Harlequins, covered all over with scales of pure gold, twist and sparkle, like amazing fish; when Pantaloon (whom I deem it no irreverence to compare in my own mind to my grandfather) puts red-hot pokers in his pocket, and cries [...] "Here's somebody coming!" [...] or taxes the Clown with petty larceny, by saying, [...] "Now, I sawed you do it!" [...] when Everything is capable, with the greatest ease, of being changed into Anything; and [...] "Nothing is, but thinking makes it so." [...] Now, too, I perceive my first experience of the dreary sensation-- often to return in after-life--of being unable, next day, {{to get back to the}} dull, settled world; of wanting to live for ever in the bright atmosphere I have quitted; of doting on the little Fairy, with the wand like a celestial Barber's Pole, and pining for a Fairy immortality along with her. Ah, she comes back, in many shapes, as my eye wanders down the branches of my Christmas Tree, and goes as often, and has never yet stayed by me! ...|$|E
