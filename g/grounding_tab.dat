5000|$|... #Caption: A cheater plug, {{with metal}} <b>grounding</b> <b>tab</b> (lower right). The ground tab is {{designed}} to be attached to the outlet faceplate screw, which is supposed to be connected to the building electrical ground.|$|E
5000|$|A cheater plug, AC ground lifter or three-prong/two-prong adapter is an adapter {{that allows}} a NEMA 5-15P grounding-type plug (three prongs) to connect to a NEMA 1-15R non-grounding {{receptacle}} (two slots). [...] They are needed to allow appliances with 3-wire power cords to plug into legacy ungrounded (two slot) receptacles found in older buildings. The use of such an adapter avoids the need to replace receptacles, but is potentially hazardous if the <b>grounding</b> <b>tab</b> is not connected to electrical ground. A safer and more reliable alternative identified in the US and Canadian electrical codes is to replace the outlet with a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) breaker outlet. These adapters are illegal in some jurisdictions, in particular throughout Canada.|$|E
40|$|Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) is {{performed}} during the diagnostic workup for giant cell arteritis (GCA), a vasculitis {{with the potential}} to cause irreversible blindness or stroke. However, treatment is often started on clinical <b>grounds,</b> and <b>TAB</b> result frequently does not influence patient management. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the need for TAB in cases of suspected GCA...|$|R
50|$|The Swift {{is mostly}} built from {{composite}} materials; flying surfaces and the fuselage are formed from composite sandwiches and the wing and tailplane have carbon fibre spars. It {{has a low}} wing of trapezoidal plan with slightly upturned tips, fitted with Frise ailerons and slotted flaps. The rear surfaces are also trapezoidal. There is a trim tab in the elevator and a <b>ground</b> adjustable <b>tab</b> on the rudder.|$|R
2500|$|The A1 is a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane. The wing has straight edges, with sweep only on {{the leading}} edge, and squared tips. [...] It is a single piece structure of light alloy construction, with Frise type mass balanced ailerons which are fabric covered aft of the spar; a <b>ground</b> adjustable trim <b>tab</b> is fitted on the port side. [...] There are no flaps. [...] The empennage is also straight tapered and of similar construction to the wing, though the rudder is fabric covered. There is a small dorsal fin. [...] All rear control surfaces are horn balanced; the tailplane's incidence can be adjusted {{on the ground and}} the starboard elevator has a <b>ground</b> adjustable trim <b>tab.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other Digital DATCOM inputs include power effects (propeller and jet), <b>ground</b> effects, trim <b>tabs,</b> and {{experimental}} data. The EXPRXX Namelist allows a user to use experimental data (such as coefficient of lift, coefficient of drag, etc.) {{in lieu of}} the data Digital DATCOM produces in the intermediate steps of its component build-up.|$|R
5000|$|The Akro was {{designed}} as a homebuilt aircraft for pilots who competed in aerobatic competitions. It was the first U.S. aircraft design to be guided by the Aresti Catalog of manoeuvres for such events. The structure absorbs high stresses, +12/-11g. The Akro is a cantilever mid wing monoplane with a wooden, two spar mahogany skinned wing built in one piece, its forward spar passing unbroken through the fuselage and the rear spar in two parts. The plain, statically balanced ailerons have steel spars with spruce ribs and trailing edges they are fabric covered and carry <b>ground</b> adjustable trim <b>tabs.</b> The tail unit is a fabric covered steel tube structure, wire braced and with swept, straight tapered surfaces. Like the ailerons, all the rear control surfaces are statically balanced. The rudder has a <b>ground</b> adjustable trim <b>tab.</b> The tailplane is mounted {{at the top of the}} fuselage, with variable incidence and a flight controllable trim tab in the elevator.|$|R
2500|$|The Kityonok is a parasol winged, {{conventionally}} {{laid out}} ultralight which seats two side-by-side. The parasol configuration {{was used to}} increase wing lifting area to improve STOL performance. Though the prototype had a partly fabric covered fuselage, later Kityonoks have glass fibre skins everywhere except for control surfaces. [...] The fuselage has an aluminium frame and the wings have aluminium alloy ribs. The constant chord wings are swept forward at about 4°, with 3° of dihedral and mount electrically operated flaps. [...] The wings are braced with a V-form pair of lift struts on each side, fixed to the lower fuselage close to the engine mounting and assisted by jury struts. [...] The centre section loads are carried by a centre-line pair of faired cabane struts. [...] The wings can be folded for storage. [...] The tailplane is trapezoidal and set {{at the top of}} the fuselage; there is an electrically operated trim tab on the port elevator. [...] The rudder has a <b>ground</b> adjustable <b>tab.</b>|$|R

50|$|Two of the 101's three , seven-cylinder Pobjoy R radial engines, {{enclosed}} in NACA cowlings, were mounted {{ahead of the}} leading edges on steel frames isolated on rubber blocks and toed outwards. The third was in the fuselage nose. All had their own oil tanks and fire extinguishers; fuel was stored in the wings. The fuselage was a wooden semi-monocoque formed with frames and stringers. The enclosed cabin seated three in tandem, with the pilot {{at the leading edge}} between the engines and the two passengers behind. Each occupant had both roof and side windows. Behind the cabin the fuselage curved upwards in Couzinet's distinctive way, the upper side narrowing to form a very broad-chord fin; its one-piece, almost triangular tailplane was built into the fuselage, carrying very narrow elevators. Like the ailerons, these had <b>ground</b> adjustable <b>tabs.</b> The rudder had a rather pointed tip but was curved and full; extending down to the keel, it operated in a slight elevator cut-out.|$|R
50|$|The Meteor has a pod-and-boom style {{fuselage}}, with a long, single-piece canopy {{above the}} upper fuselage line, {{forward of the}} wing, under which the pilot sits in a reclined position. The under-wing, retractable monowheel undercarriage is assisted by a short, retractable, forward skid. Retraction is manual; there is a wheel brake. Behind the wing the fuselage has a circular cross-section. There is a long, shallow fillet or sub fin between fuselage and fin, both straight edged, and both rudder and fin extend well below the lower fuselage line to form a tail bumper. The rudder is horn balanced. Later revisions slightly increased rudder area. The high aspect ratio, straight tapered tailplane is mounted above the fuselage on the fillet forward of the fin's leading edge. The elevators are also aerodynamically balanced and originally carried a <b>ground</b> adjustable trim <b>tab,</b> later removed.|$|R

25|$|Fuselage {{structure}} was typical for the period, being welded chrome-moly tubing with light wood strips to fair the shape in {{and covered with}} fabric. Wings were built around two solid spruce spars with the airfoil formed from trussed ribs made from plywood and spruce. The leading edge was covered in aluminum sheeting and the whole assembly covered in fabric. Ailerons were interconnected with a strut mounted to the trailing edge and on some versions were sheeted with ribbed aluminum. Most models were not fitted with flaps – the VKS-7F, built for the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) being the exception. It was fitted with split flaps only on the undersides of the upper wings and at mid chord, inboard and {{just ahead of the}} ailerons. Wing bracing was with a canted N strut joining upper and lower wings, assisted by a single strut bracing the lower wing to the upper fuselage longeron, there being no bracing wires. Elevators and rudder were built up from welded steel tubing braced with wire cables, and both could be trimmed, the elevators in flight and the rudder with a <b>ground</b> adjustable <b>tab.</b> Normally the main undercarriage was made up of a pair of vees, sprung with oleo/spring struts and provided with brakes as standard equipment, and a free-castoring tailwheel sprung with triangulated shock cords. was fitted to most aircraft, although a small number for Brazil were fitted with a tail skid. Floats were also offered as an option, starting with the UIC which had Edo P-3300 floats. Later types (including the UKC, YKC and CJC) were offered with Edo 38-3430 floats.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{prototype}} flew for {{the first}} time on 15 May 1959 but was lost in a fatal crash during single engine tests on 2 August 1959. [...] Development work continued on a second aircraft which first flew in 1960 and a third followed in 1962. The fourth aircraft, now renamed the Simmering-Graz-Pauker SGP.222 was intended as a production prototype and demonstrator and appeared at the 1964 Hamburg show, though it turned out to be the last of the line. [...] It incorporated several changes in response to the lengthy development trials. The wing leading edges had breaker strips added and there were new fillets in this edge at the root and on the outboard side of the engine cowlings. [...] The ailerons were mass balanced and fitted with <b>ground</b> adjustable trim <b>tabs,</b> and the upper hinge gaps sealed with fabric. The most obvious external changes were to the empennage where the horizontal tail now had positive dihedral and the previously rounded vertical tail had been enlarged and given severe straight taper, assisted by a ventral fin to improve low speed handling. Both elevators and the rudder had trim tabs.|$|R
