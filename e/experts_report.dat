25|$|Although many {{companies}} offer courses in stock picking, and numerous <b>experts</b> <b>report</b> success through technical analysis and fundamental analysis, many economists and academics state {{that because of}} the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) it is unlikely that any amount of analysis can help an investor make any gains above the stock market itself.

Many investors try not only to make a profitable return, but also to outperform, or beat, the market.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Social-medical <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> {{from the}} German {{statutory}} pension insurance {{are essential for}} the German statutory pension regulatory authority {{to decide whether to}} grant services regarding participation as well as retirement pensions due to incapacity to work. The objective of this investigation is to determine whether the ICF Core Sets and other international approaches, such as the EUMASS Core Sets or ICF Core Set for vocational rehabilitation cover the content of the social-medical <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> as well as to propose an approach how the ICF can be economically used by the social medicine practitioner when writing a social-medical <b>expert</b> <b>report.</b> METHOD: A retrospective quantitative study design was used to translate a total of 294 social-medical <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> from patients with low back pain (LBP) or chronic widespread pain (CWP) into the language of the ICF (linking) by 2 independent health professionals and compare the results with the ICF Core Sets for specific health conditions and other international approaches. RESULTS: The content of social-medical <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> was largely reflected by the condition specific brief ICF Core Sets, brief ICF Core Sets for vocational rehabilitation and EUMASS Core Sets. The weighted Kappa statistic for the agreement between the 2 health professionals who translated the <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> were in CWP 0. 69 with a bootstrapped confidence interval of 0. 67 - 0. 71 and in LBP 0. 73 (0. 71 - 0. 74). DISCUSSION: The analyses show that the content of social-medical <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> varies enormously. A combination of a condition specific brief ICF Core Set as well as vocational rehabilitation and EUMASS ICF Core Sets as well as all ICF-categories from the <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> that were named at least in 50 % of it can largely provide a basis for preparing <b>expert</b> <b>reports.</b> Within the scope of implementation the need for a specific ICF Core Set for <b>expert</b> <b>reports</b> of the German statutory pension insurance should be further analyzed and discussed. <br/...|$|R

50|$|Chiari-like {{malformation}} (CM) is {{the most}} common cause of foramen magnum obstruction and syringomyelia in dogs. Syringomyelia (SM) is a disease of the spinal cord typified by fluid filled cavities, or syrinxes, within the spinal cord substance. The disease is caused by the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the nervous system. A situation of high pressure in the spinal cord compared to low pressure outside, leads to fluid accumulation, which eventually forms cavities. CM is a condition characterized by the mismatch of size between the brain and the skull. The skull is too small causing part of the brain to descend out of the skull through the opening at its base, crowding the spinal cord. The cause of CM is not yet fully understood. CM is rare in most breeds but reportedly has become very widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon). Some researchers estimate that as many as 95% of CKCSs may have CM. It is worldwide in scope and not limited to any country, breeding line, or kennel, and <b>experts</b> <b>report</b> that it is believed to be inherited in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. CM is so widespread in the Cavalier that it may be an inherent part of the CKCS's breed standard. This disease not only affects thousands of dogs, but a similar condition affects over three hundred thousand children yearly. Therefore, canines are an appropriate model for the treatment of the human condition.|$|E
