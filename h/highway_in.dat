5|$|By 1942, the Maryland State Roads Commission {{proposed}} relocating Queens Chapel Road near Northwest Branch {{to eliminate}} the highway's circuitous course and extend Ager Road to the new highway. MD 500 was relocated from Northwest Branch to Hamilton Street as the first carriageway of an ultimate divided <b>highway</b> <b>in</b> 1949. The second carriageway of the new highway was added in 1951 and 1952. The portion of the state highway from the District of Columbia to Northwest Branch was expanded to a divided <b>highway</b> <b>in</b> 1951 and 1952; this work included rebuilding the highway's bridge across Northwest Branch to carry the expanded <b>highway.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the remainder of MD 500 from Hamilton Street to US 1 was widened and resurfaced in 1951. The divided highway was extended northeast from Hamilton Street to MD 410 in 1973. MD 500 was reduced from six lanes to four lanes when the highway was re-striped in 2005.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the road was {{designated}} as a provincial <b>highway</b> <b>in</b> the 1960s, it was a paved two lane route.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, {{the state}} highway system was {{adjusted}} again, and several new roads {{were added to}} the system, including parts of what would become US410. The Olympic Highway traveled around the Olympic Peninsula and a section from Aberdeen to Olympia was later used as part of US410. The Pacific Highway would later have a brief concurrency with US410 from Olympia to Tacoma, and US410 would later connect to the National Park <b>Highway</b> <b>in</b> Tacoma and follow it to Buckley, where State Road5, now a secondary highway maintained by the counties, began. From the end of State Road5 in Naches, the Inland Empire Highway is concurrent with the future US410 to Dayton, where a branch of the highway travels to Clarkston. State Road5 became the McClellan Pass <b>Highway</b> <b>in</b> 1919 and was aligned further south to Chinook Pass. The McClellan Pass Highway was renamed the Naches Pass <b>Highway</b> <b>in</b> 1921 to reflect the realignment in 1919. Despite the name, the road did not cross Naches Pass, as no highway ever has.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, MD71 was {{involved}} in a three-route number change involving highways in three different areas of the state. MD71 was reassigned to the Blue Star Memorial Highway then under construction from Queenstown to the Delaware state line; this designation lasted only three years before U.S.Route301 was rerouted onto the <b>highway</b> <b>in</b> 1959. MD71 was designated MD194 to match the adjacent numbered <b>highway</b> <b>in</b> Pennsylvania. MD194 had previously been assigned to Flower Avenue in Takoma Park; Flower Avenue was then designated MD787.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the DelDOT {{conducted}} a feasibility study {{for a future}} north–south limited access <b>highway</b> <b>in</b> Sussex County. The Sussex County North–South Transportation Study explored routes along and between the US13, US113, and DE1 corridors. The study took into account local, long distance, and seasonal traffic patterns; environmental, agricultural, and developmental impacts; connections with arterial highways; {{and the ability to}} build the limited-access <b>highway</b> <b>in</b> usable sections. The study recommended routing the limited-access highway along the US113 corridor, using as much of the current US113 route as possible. For its standing US113 North/South Study, DelDOT has split the corridor into four areas: Millsboro–South, Georgetown, Ellendale, and Milford.|$|E

5|$|King's Highway 35, {{also known}} as Highway 35, is a provincial <b>highway</b> <b>in</b> the Canadian {{province}} of Ontario, linking Highway 401 with Peterborough, Kawartha Lakes, and Algonquin Park.

The winding course of the highway, combined with the picturesque views offered along its length, have led some to declare it the most scenic <b>highway</b> <b>in</b> Ontario.|$|E

M-123 also has a rare signed concurrency with a County-Designated <b>Highway</b> <b>in</b> Michigan; in Trout Lake, there is a concurrency with H-40. All of M-123 north of M-28 is a Scenic Heritage Route within the Michigan Heritage Route system.|$|E
5|$|M-45 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} <b>highway</b> <b>in</b> the US {{state of}} Michigan that is also called Lake Michigan Drive.

Lake Michigan Drive continues in each direction from M-45's termini, extending west of US Highway 31 (US31) and east of Interstate 196 (I-196). In between, the road runs through rural and suburban areas of Ottawa and Kent counties, including the main campus of Grand Valley State University in Allendale. Lake Michigan Drive was originally part of M-50 until the mid-1960s. Previously in the 1920s and 1930s, the M-45 number was designated along a <b>highway</b> <b>in</b> the Upper Peninsula (UP).|$|E
