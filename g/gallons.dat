5|$|A {{total of}} 4.03 million <b>gallons</b> {{of water per}} day are {{withdrawn}} from Toby Creek and its tributaries. 3.38 million <b>gallons</b> per day (84 percent) are removed by registered water suppliers and 0.51 million <b>gallons</b> per day (13 percent) are removed for commercial and industrial purposes. 0.10 million <b>gallons</b> per day (2 percent) are removed for mineral purposes and 0.04 million <b>gallons</b> per day (1 percent) are removed for residential purposes. A reservoir known as the Huntsville Reservoir {{is located in the}} watershed of Toby Creek. It has a capacity of approximately 1.915 billion <b>gallons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Above {{the swamp}} on Twomile Run, the {{discharge}} of the stream is 511 <b>gallons</b> per minute. Upstream of Middle Branch Twomile Run, the discharge is 618 <b>gallons</b> per minute and downstream of Robbins Hollow, the discharge is 1402 <b>gallons</b> per minute. Downstream of the sampling site KC121, the discharge is 1893 <b>gallons</b> per minute and upstream of Huling Branch, the discharge is 2258 <b>gallons</b> per minute. The discharge {{at the mouth of}} Twomile Run ranges from 200 to 10,000 <b>gallons</b> per minute, which is between 0.6 and 2 percent of {{the discharge of}} Kettle Creek.|$|E
5|$|A mid-20th-century report {{estimated}} {{the volume of}} surface seepage into mine workings at Hull Creek was 9.53 <b>gallons</b> per minute per inch of rainfall.

50|$|Many {{measures}} of capacity were understood as fractions or multiples of a <b>gallon.</b> For example, a quart is {{a quarter of}} a <b>gallon,</b> and a pint is half of a quart, or an eighth of a <b>gallon.</b> These ratios applied regardless of the specific size of the <b>gallon.</b> Not only did the definition of the <b>gallon</b> change over time, but there were several different kinds of <b>gallon,</b> which existed at the same time. For example, a wine <b>gallon</b> with a volume of 231 cubic inches (the basis of the U.S. <b>gallon),</b> and an ale <b>gallon</b> of 282 cubic inches, were commonly used for many decades prior to the establishment of the imperial <b>gallon.</b> In other words, a pint of ale and a pint of wine were not the same size. On the other hand, some measures such as the fluid ounce were not defined as a fraction of a <b>gallon.</b> For that reason, it is not always possible to give accurate definitions of units such as pints or quarts, in terms of ounces, prior to the establishment of the imperial <b>gallon.</b>|$|R
5|$|By 1911, two dams {{had been}} {{constructed}} on Glen Brook (a subtributary of Briar Creek) in Briar Creek Township two {{miles north of}} Berwick. In 1911, the first dam, known as Number One, had a capacity of 15 million <b>gallons.</b> The second dam, known as Number Two, had a capacity of 7.5 million <b>gallons.</b> In 1911, a third dam was under construction several hundred feet downstream of the two aforementioned dams. It was intended to have a capacity of 23.8 million <b>gallons.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{higher the}} sugar {{content of the}} sap, the fewer the <b>gallons</b> of sap are needed to obtain one gallon of syrup. 57 <b>gallons</b> of sap with 1.5% sugar content will yield 1 gallon of syrup, but only 25 <b>gallons</b> of sap with a 3.5% sugar content are needed to obtain one gallon of syrup. The sap's sugar content is highly {{variable}} and will fluctuate even within the same tree.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{sales of}} spirits {{increased}} 9% {{over the previous}} year. Whiskey and vodka were the top sellers, while tequila had the largest percentage increase. Oregonian's top buy was Jack Daniel's, with 412,000 bottles sold. This was during a national spirits trend where manufacturers introduced new products and advertising aimed at young drinkers. Again in 2007, Oregon's 2.6 million adults on average drank 32 <b>gallons</b> of beer each, versus 4 <b>gallons</b> of wine and 2 <b>gallons</b> of spirits, but sales of beer hadn't increased like sales of spirits. The Oregon Department of Human Services reported that while drinking among 8th11th graders has fallen nationally, it has increased in Oregon. The number of DUI offenses dropped between 2002 and 2005, from 25,342 to 23,455.|$|E

5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 <b>gallons</b> (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 <b>gallons</b> (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 <b>gallons</b> (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 <b>gallons</b> (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E
5|$|Anheuser-Busch still {{operate a}} large-production brewery in Newark, {{originally}} opened in 1951, {{which is used}} for brewing Budweiser and Rolling Rock. New Jersey offers a limited brewery license for microbreweries and a restricted brewery license for brewpubs. In 1995, the Ship Inn Restaurant and Brewery in Milford became the first brewpub in New Jersey. Within ten years, the industry expanded to 28 breweries, most of them microbreweries or brewpubs. In 2010, New Jersey craft brewers produced 32,000 barrels (992,000 <b>gallons)</b> of craft brew. In 2012, New Jersey liberalized its licensing laws to allow microbreweries to sell beer by the glass {{as part of a}} tour, and sell up to 15.5 <b>gallons</b> (i.e. a keg) for off-premises consumption. The same legislation permits brewpubs to brew up to 10,000 barrels of beer per year, and sell to wholesalers and at festivals.|$|E
5|$|During {{the storm}} of 10 July 1968, the lake gained an extra 471millionimperial <b>gallons</b> (2,140,000m³) and rose 19inches (480mm) in under 12hours. At one point worried Bristol police issued a warning that the dam might not hold, {{prompting}} localised evacuation of populated valley areas downstream including Pensford and Keynsham.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperial}} and US systems {{differ in}} the size of the basic unit (the <b>gallon</b> or the pint, one <b>gallon</b> being equal to eight pints), and in the number of fluid ounces per pint. Apothecaries' systems for volumes were internationally much less common than those for weights. Before introduction of the imperial units in the UK, all apothecaries' measures were based on the wine <b>gallon,</b> which survived in the US under the name liquid <b>gallon</b> or wet <b>gallon.</b>|$|R
50|$|Capacities of wine casks were {{formerly}} {{measured and}} standardised {{according to a}} specific system of English units. The various units were historically {{defined in terms of}} the wine <b>gallon</b> so varied according to the definition of the <b>gallon</b> until the adoption of the Queen Anne wine <b>gallon</b> in 1707. In the United Kingdom and its colonies the units were redefined with the introduction of the imperial system whilst the Queen Anne wine <b>gallon</b> was adopted as the standard US liquid <b>gallon.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term derives most {{immediately}} from galun, galon in Old Northern French, but {{the usage}} was common in several languages, for example jale in Old French and gęllet (bowl) in Old English. This suggests a common origin in Romance Latin, but the ultimate {{source of the}} word is unknown. The <b>gallon</b> originated as the base of systems for measuring wine, and beer in England. The sizes of <b>gallon</b> used in these two systems were different from each other: the first {{was based on the}} wine <b>gallon</b> (equal in size to the US <b>gallon),</b> and the second on either the ale <b>gallon</b> or the larger imperial <b>gallon.</b>|$|R
5|$|However, {{the primary}} {{agricultural}} product from Rancho Camulos was wine. Ninety acres (360,000 m²) of vineyards were planted in the 1860s and Camulos wines and brandies were known throughout Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. In 1870, records indicate Camulos was largest of the four vintners in the San Buenaventura Township of Santa Barbara County, with 45 tons (40,900kg) of grapes grown, making 6,000 US <b>gallons</b> (23,000 L) of wine and 800 US <b>gallons</b> (3,000 L) of brandy. In addition to oranges and grapes, the ranch produced almonds, walnuts, apricots, wheat, corn and barley. Flower petals from roses grown at Camulos were shipped to Europe to make perfume.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of <b>gallons</b> of water on the fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million <b>gallons</b> of diammonium phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E
5|$|Locomotive tenders {{were also}} changed as new, {{improved}} designs became available. Some {{examples of the}} second batch (70025–70029) were equipped with the BR1A tender, which had a higher water capacity of 5,000 <b>gallons.</b> Members of the third batch (70045–70054) were equipped with another tender design, the BR1D, which had 9 tons of coal and 4,750 <b>gallons</b> of water, {{due to the fact}} that they were intended for use on longer runs in the north of the railway network. This tender design also featured a steam-powered coal pusher, which eliminated the need for crew members to mount the tender to pull forward coal when the locomotive was at a stop.|$|E

5|$|Wilsonville also {{provides}} its own {{water supply and}} wastewater treatment. The wastewater system was built in 1972, while the water system was upgraded with a new treatment plant in 2002. Water is drawn from the Willamette River from the Wilsonville Water Treatment Plant built {{at a cost of}} $46 million in conjunction with the Tualatin Valley Water District. The city used to use wells to provide drinking water, but those began to run dry in the late 1990s. The plant’s initial capacity was 15 million <b>gallons</b> per day, but can be expanded to 120 million <b>gallons</b> per day. Neighboring Sherwood will begin receiving water from the plant in 2012.|$|E
50|$|A wine <b>gallon</b> is {{a unit of}} {{capacity}} that was used routinely in England {{as far back as}} the 14th century, and by statute under Queen Anne since 1707.

5|$|A microbrewery, or craft brewery, {{produces}} {{a limited amount}} of beer. The maximum amount of beer a brewery can produce and still be classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial <b>gallons</b> or 475 thousand US <b>gallons)</b> a year. A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a pub or other eating establishment. The highest density of breweries in the world, most of them microbreweries, exists in the German Region of Franconia, especially in the district of Upper Franconia, which has about 200 breweries. The Benedictine Weihenstephan Brewery in Bavaria, Germany, can trace its roots to the year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. The brewery was licensed by the City of Freising in 1040, and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution in 1789, most countries and even some cities had their own system of measurement. Although different countries might have used units of measure with the same name, such as the foot, or local language equivalents such as pied, Fuß, and voet, there was no consistency in the magnitude of those units, nor in the relationships with their multiples and submultiples, much like the modern-day differences between the US and the UK pints and <b>gallons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bird, {{the eldest}} son of Premier Vere Bird, first entered {{politics}} in 1981 when he served as an unelected security official during the general election. In the following election in 1984, Bird and his brother Lester were both elected to the House of Representatives after the Antigua Labour Party, led by their father, took 16 of the 17 House seats. Bird himself was victorious over George Walter, leader of the Progressive Labour Movement and former Premier of Antigua and Barbuda, gaining 912 votes to Walter's 358. Upon election, with his father as Prime Minister, {{he was given the}} Ministry of Aviation, Public Information and Public Utilities.
