5000|$|Volcanic {{activity}} in the South Pacific near Tonga on August 12, 2006 caused {{the emergence of a}} new island. The crew of the Maiken, a yacht that had left the northern Tongan islands group of Vava'u in August, reported that they had seen streaks of light, porous pumice stone floating in the water—and then had [...] "sailed into a vast, many-miles-wide belt of densely packed pumice". They went on to witness the <b>ephemeral</b> <b>island</b> known as Home Reef breaching the surface.|$|E
2500|$|Historical eruptions at Raoul {{during the}} 19th and 20th centuries have {{sometimes}} occurred simultaneously from both calderas, and have consisted of small-to-moderate phreatic eruptions, {{some of which}} formed <b>ephemeral</b> <b>islands</b> in Denham caldera.

50|$|Banua Wuhu {{submarine}} volcano rises {{more than}} 400 m {{from the sea}} floor in the Sangihe Islands of Indonesia. Historical records show that several <b>ephemeral</b> <b>islands</b> were formed and disappeared. A 90 m high island was formed in 1835, but then dwindled to only a few rocks in 1848. A new island was reportedly formed in 1889 and it was 50 m high in 1894. Another new island was formed in 1919 but then disappeared by 1935.|$|R
50|$|The term {{floating}} {{island is}} sometimes used for accumulations of vegetation free-floating within {{a body of}} water. Due {{to the lack of}} currents and tides, these are more frequently found in lakes than in rivers or the open sea. Peaty masses of vegetable matter from shallow lake floors may rise due to the accumulation of gases during decomposition, and will often float for a considerable time, becoming <b>ephemeral</b> <b>islands</b> until the gas has dissipated enough for the vegetation to return to the lake floor.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{northeast}} {{rim of the}} same caldera 12.8 km {{to the east of}} the Bayonnaise Rocks is a submerged reef named Myōjin-shō (...) , which is a post-caldera cone with a depth of approximately 50 m. During a submarine volcanic eruption of 17 September 1952, an <b>ephemeral</b> <b>island</b> was formed, with a height of 10 m, which was created and destroyed several times by volcanic activity until completely disappearing on 23 September 1953. The following day, an eruption killed 31 researchers and crewmen abroad the Maritime Safety Agency survey ship No.5 Kaiyo-Maru. The island reappeared on 11 October, sinking again on 11 March 1954 and reappeared one more time between 5 April and 3 September 1954.|$|E
40|$|An {{associated}} partial postcranial skeleton {{is described}} as the third definitive ornithopod dinosaur record from the Upper Cretaceous Bajo Barreal Formation of central Patagonia, Argentina. Specifically, the specimen was recovered from the uppermost Cretaceous (Campanian-?Maastrichtian) Upper Member of the Bajo Barreal exposed on an <b>ephemeral</b> <b>island</b> in the southeastern portion of Lago Colhu Huapi in southern Chubut Province. Identifiable elements of the skeleton include four incomplete dorsal vertebrae, three partial anterior caudal vertebrae, a middle caudal neural arch, an incomplete posterior caudal vertebra, a dorsal rib fragment, the right calcaneum, and portions of the left metatarsal III and right metatarsal IV. Comparisons with corresponding elements in other ornithischians indicate that the material pertains to a medium-sized, non-hadrosaurid ornithopod. In particular, the morphology of the calcaneum is characteristic of ornithopods of this "grade". The new discovery augments {{our understanding of the}} latest Cretaceous terrestrial vertebrate assemblage of central Patagonia and adds to the generally meager record of ornithischians in the Late Cretaceous of the Southern Hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|Kolumbo {{submarine}} volcano, located 7 km {{northeast of}} Santorini in the Aegean Sea, last erupted in 1650 AD resulting in significant coastal destruction from tsunamis and about 70 fatalities on nearby Thera from gas discharge. Pyroclastic materials {{were reported as}} far south as Crete and as far northeast as Turkey. Tephra from the 1650 AD submarine eruption has been correlated in sediment box cores using a combination of mineralogy and major element composition of glass shards. The biotite-bearing rhyolite of Kolumbo can be readily discriminated from other silicic pyroclastics derived from the main Santorini complex. In general, the tephra deposits are very fine-grained (silt to fine sand), medium gray in color, and covered by ~ 10 cm of brown hemipelagic sediment. This corresponds to an average background sedimentation rate of 29 cm/kyr in the area. The distribution of the 1650 AD Kolumbo tephra covers at least 446 km 2 around the crater, nearly 5 times the approximated 97 km 2 previously inferred from seismic profiles on the volcano’s slopes and in adjacent basins. Despite the expansion of the inferred deposition area, the estimated eruption volume is not enlarged significantly, and therefore remains a minimum estimate, because the box cores did not penetrate the bases of the tephra units. SEM images reveal particle morphologies attributed to multiple fragmentation mechanisms, including primary volatile degassing and phreatomagmatic activity. It is likely that phreatomagmatic activity became more important in the latter stages of the eruptive sequence when eruptions column broke the surface and a small <b>ephemeral</b> <b>island</b> was formed. We suggest that after the generation of a significant fine ash fraction during submarine and subaerial stages of explosive volcanism, the fines are efficiently removed from the vent area and transported by several mechanisms: (1) dominant local winds; (2) surges over the sea surface from subaerial eruption column collapse; (3) vertical gravity currents driven by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities; and, (4) sediment gravity flows driven by submarine eruption column collapse. The fine-grained marine tephra deposits surrounding Kolumbo represent the complement to the very fines-poor proximal pumice sequence exposed in the crater walls...|$|E

50|$|Ile des Cendres is a {{group of}} {{submarine}} volcanoes located off the southeast coast of Vietnam. It consists of two submarine cinder cones that formed <b>ephemeral</b> <b>islands</b> during an eruption in 1923 and two submarine lava cones of uncertain age. The 1923 eruption produced two small islands, one about 30 m high and about 450 m long, and the other only 30 m wide and 30 cm high. A third submarine cone reached to within 20 m of the surface. Additional submarine cones occur between Ile des Cendres and the Vietnam mainland (Bondarenko and Nadezhnyi, 1989).|$|R
40|$|Taxa {{have been}} dated using three methods: equating their age with {{the age of}} the oldest known fossil, with the age of strata the taxa are endemic to, and with the age of {{paleogeographic}} events. All three methods have been adopted as methods of dating nodes in molecular phylogenies. The first method has been the most popular, but both this and the second method involve serious difficulties. Studies often, correctly, introduce oldest known fossils as providing minimum ages for divergences. However, in the actual analyses these ages, and ages derived from them, are often treated as absolute ages and earlier geological events are deemed irrelevant to the phylogeny. In fact, only younger geological events can be irrelevant. Studies correlating the age of nodes with age of volcanic islands often overlook the fact that these islands have been produced at subduction zones or hot spots where small, individually <b>ephemeral</b> <b>islands</b> are constantly being produced and disappearing, and a metapopulation can survive indefinitely. Correlating the age of taxa with that of associated paleogeographic events is probably the most promising method but has often been used in a simplistic way, for example in assuming that all divergence across the Isthmus of Panama dates to its final rise. Most workers now agree that a global molecular clock does not exist, and that rates can change between lineages and within a lineage over time. New methods of estimating branch lengths do not assume a strict clock, but the number of models for molecular evolution is then effectively infinite. Problems with calibrating the nodes, as well as with substitution models, mean that phylogeography’s claim to be able to test between vicariance and dispersal is not justified...|$|R
40|$|The uplifted {{and deeply}} eroded {{volcanic}} succession of Porto Santo (central East-Atlantic) {{is the product}} of a wide spectrum of dynamic processes that are active in shoaling to emergent seamounts. Two superimposed lapilli cones marking the base of the exposed section are interpreted as having formed from numerous submarine to subaerial phreatomagmatic explosions, pyroclastic fragmentation being subordinate. The lower basaltic and the upper mugearitic to trachytic sections are dominated by redeposited tephra and are called 'lapilli cone aprons'. Vertical growth due to accumulation of tephra, voluminous intrusions, and minor pillowed lava flows produced <b>ephemeral</b> <b>islands</b> which were subsequently leveled by wave erosion, as shown by conglomerate beds. Periods of volcanic quiescence are represented by abundant biocalcarenite lenses at several stratigraphic levels. The loose tephra piles became stabilized by widespread syn-volcanic intrusions such as dikes and trachytic to rhyolitic domes welding the volcanic and volcaniclastic ensemble into a solid edifice. Shattering of a submarine extrusive trachytic dome by pyroclastic and phreatomagmatic explosions, accentuated by quench fragmentation, resulted in pumice- and crystal-rich deposits emplaced in a prominent submarine erosional channel. The dome must have produced an island as indicated by a collapse breccia comprising surf-rounded boulders of dome material. Subaerial explosive activity is represented by scoria cones and tuff cones. Basaltic lava flows built a resistant cap that protected the island from wave erosion. Some lava flows entered the sea and formed two distinct types of lava delta: 1. closely-packed pillow lava and massive tabular lava flows along the southwestern coast of Porto Santo, and 2. a steeply inclined pillow-hyaloclastite breccia prism composed of foreset-bedded hydroclastic breccia, variably-shaped pillows, and thin sheet flows capped by subhorizontal submarine to subaerial lava flows along the eastern coast of Porto Santo. The facies architectures indicate emplacement: 1. on a gently sloping platform in southwestern Porto Santo, and 2. on steep offshore slopes along high energy shorelines in eastern Porto Santo. Growth of the pillow-hyaloclastite breccia prism is dominated by the formation of foreset beds but various types of syn-volcanic intrusions contributed significantly. Submarine flank eruptions occurred in very shallow water on the flanks of the hyaloclastite prism in eastern Porto Santo. The island became consolidated by intrusion of numerous dikes and by emplacement of prominent intrusions that penetrate the entire volcanic succession. Volcanic sedimentation ended with the emplacement of a debris avalanche that postdates the last subaerial volcanic activity...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} {{areas of}} endemism in New Caledonia {{and their relationship}} with tectonic history. Location New Caledonia, south-west Pacific. Methods Panbiogeographical analysis. Results Biogeographical patterns within New Caledonia are described and illustrated with reference to eight terranes and ten centres of endemism. The basement terranes make up a centre of endemism for taxa including Amborella, the basal angiosperm. Three of the terranes that accreted to the basement in the Eocene (high-pressure metamorphic terrane, ultramafic nappe and Loyalty Ridge) have their own endemics. Main conclusions New Caledonia {{is not simply a}} fragment of Gondwana but, like New Zealand and New Guinea, is a complex mosaic of allochthonous terranes. The four New Caledonian basement terranes were all formed from island arc-derived and arc-associated material (including ophiolites) which accumulated in the pre-Pacific Ocean, not in Gondwana. They amalgamated and were accreted to Gondwana (eastern Australia) in the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous, but in the Late Cretaceous they separated from Australia {{with the opening of the}} Tasman Sea and break-up of Gondwana. An Eocene collision of the basement terranes with an island arc to the north-east - possibly the Loyalty Ridge - is of special biogeographical interest in connection with New Caledonia-central Pacific affinities. The Loyalty-Three Kings Ridge has had a separate history from that of the Norfolk Ridge/New Caledonia, although both now run in parallel between Vanuatu and New Zealand. The South Loyalty Basin opened between Grande Terre and the Loyalty Ridge in the Cretaceous and attained a width of 750 km. However, it was almost completely destroyed by subduction in the Eocene which brought the Loyalty Ridge and Grande Terre together again, after 30 Myr of separation. The tectonic history is reflected in the strong biogeographical differences between Grande Terre and the Loyalty Islands. Many Loyalty Islands taxa are widespread in the Pacific but do not occur on Grande Terre, and many Grande Terre/Australian groups are not on the Loyalty Islands. The Loyalty Islands are young (2 Myr old) but they are merely the currently emergent parts of the Loyalty Ridge whose ancestor arcs have a history of volcanism dating back to the Cretaceous. Old taxa endemic to the young Loyalty Ridge islands persist over geological time as a dynamic metapopulation surviving in situ on the individually <b>ephemeral</b> <b>islands</b> and atolls found around subduction zones. The current Loyalty Islands, like the Grande Terre terranes, have inherited their biota from previous islands. On Grande Terre, the ultramafic terrane was emplaced on Grande Terre in the Eocene (about the same time as the collision with the island arc). The very diverse endemic flora on the ultramafics may have been inherited by the obducting nappe from prior base-rich habitat in the region, including the mafic Poya terrane and the limestones typical of arc and intraplate volcanic islands...|$|R
40|$|Whale falls provide {{abundant}} {{but relatively}} <b>ephemeral,</b> sulphide-rich habitat <b>islands</b> on the deep-sea floor. To explore life-history adaptations to whale-fall habitats, {{we examined the}} reproductive biology of Idas washingtonia, a bathymodiolin mussel occurring in abundance on sunken whale skeletons in the deep northeast Pacific Ocean. Analysis of the reproductive biology of I. washingtonia demonstrates strong evidence of protandric hermaphroditism. Developing males were recognised in individuals as small as 1. 7 mm shell length and spermatogenesis continued until ∼ 7 mm length. At > 6. 5 mm, males were generally spent and the first previtellogenic oocytes were observed. Although developing females were found as small as 4. 5 mm shell length, most well-developed females were > 6 mm shell length. Overall, females only formed ∼ 12 % of the population. As with other modiolid bivalves, fecundity was high and the egg size < 50 μm, indicative of planktotrophic development. The occurrence of protandric hermaphroditism, high fecundity and planktotrophic dispersal may be an adaptation to the ephemeral nature of their habitat. The success of this adaptation is shown by the rapid colonisation of whale falls even though these may have been severely reduced in abundance since the peak of commercial whaling activity in the 20 th century...|$|R
40|$|An {{annotated}} list {{of indigenous}} Fijian seed plant genera is presented and comprises 484 genera and 1315 species in 137 families. The relative {{diversity of the}} largest families and genera in Fiji is indicated and compared with floras in New Caledonia and the Upper Watut Valley, Papua New Guinea. Differences and similarities appear {{to be due to}} biogeographical/phylogenetic factors rather than ecological differences or means of dispersal. Generic diversity for the seed plants as a whole is greatest between 0 – 100 m and decreases monotonically with altitude. However, in the largest family, Orchidaceae, maximum diversity occurs between 200 – 400 m. Fifty percent of the families are recorded from shore habitat. Twenty-seven percent of the families and 80 species occur in or around mangrove, where the most diverse families are Orchidaceae, Rubiaceae, and the legumes. Some of the mangrove-associate species are pantropical or Indo-Pacific but most are locally or regionally endemic. Fifty-six percent of the Fijian families are recorded on limestone. Twenty-nine species are restricted to limestone and 12 species usually occur on limestone. The importance of calcium in reducing the effects of salinity is emphasized and 39 species are recorded from both mangrove and limestone. A plagiotropic habit occurs in 38 species which occur on limestone or around beaches, and 20 of these are Pacific endemics. Genera restricted to higher altitudes include many present elsewhere in Melanesia but absent from Australia despite suitable habitat there, again indicating the importance of biogeographical and historical factors. Altitudinal anomalies in Fiji taxa are cited and include 7 anomalously high records from northern Viti Levu, a site of major uplift, and 22 anomalously low altitudinal records in the Lau Group, a site of subsidence. It is suggested that the Fijian flora has not been derived from immigrants from Asia, but has evolved more or less in situ. Taxa would have survived as metapopulations on the individually <b>ephemeral</b> volcanic <b>islands</b> always found at oceanic subduction zones and hot spots, and the atolls which characterize areas of subsidence. The complex geology of Fiji is determined by its position between two subduction zones of opposite polarity, the Vanuatu and Tonga Trenches, in what is currently a region of transform faulting. The large islands comprise fragments of island arcs that have amalgamated and welded together. There has been considerable uplift as well as subsidence in the islands and it is suggested that both these processes have had drastic effects on the altitudinal range of the taxa. Limestone and mangrove floras could have provided a widespread, diverse ancestral species pool from which freshwater swamp forest, lowland rainforest, dry forest, secondary forest, thickets, and montane forest have been derived during phases of uplift...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adaptive {{plasticity}} {{is essential}} for many species to cope with environmental heterogeneity. In particular, developmental plasticity allows organisms with complex life cycles to adaptively adjust the timing of ontogenetic switch points. Size at and time to metamorphosis are reliable fitness indicators in organisms with complex cycles. The physiological machinery of developmental plasticity commonly involves the activation of alternative neuroendocrine pathways, causing metabolic alterations. Nevertheless, we have still incomplete knowledge about how these mechanisms evolve under environments that select for differences in adaptive plasticity. In this study, we investigate the physiological mechanisms underlying divergent degrees of developmental plasticity across Rana temporaria island populations inhabiting different types of pools in northern Sweden. Methods: In a laboratory experiment we estimated developmental plasticity of amphibian larvae from six populations coming from three different island habitats: islands with only permanent pools, <b>islands</b> with only <b>ephemeral</b> pools, and <b>islands</b> {{with a mixture of}} both types of pools. We exposed larvae of each population to either constant water level or simulated pool drying, and estimated their physiological responses in terms of corticosterone levels, oxidative stress, and telomere length. Results: We found that populations from islands with only temporary pools had a higher degree of developmental plasticity than those from the other two types of habitats. All populations increased their corticosterone levels to a similar extent when subjected to simulated pool drying, and therefore variation in secretion of this hormone does not explain the observed differences among populations. However, tadpoles from islands with temporary pools showed lower constitutive activities of catalase and glutathione reductase, and also showed overall shorter telomeres. Conclusions: The observed differences are indicative of physiological costs of increased developmental plasticity, suggesting that the potential for plasticity is constrained by its costs. Thus, high levels of responsiveness in the developmental rate of tadpoles have evolved in islands with pools at high but variable risk of desiccation. Moreover, the physiological alterations observed may have important consequences for both short-term odds of survival and long term effects on lifespan...|$|R
