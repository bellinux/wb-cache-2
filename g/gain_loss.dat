40|$|The {{purpose or}} {{objective}} of this dissertation was to analyse the current income tax treatment of derivative financial instruments in South Africa. In the context of financial markets, derivative financial instruments are mainly used for hedging and speculation. The dissertation considers whether the current South African Income Tax Act deals with the income taxation of derivatives with respect to <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> and the timing of those <b>gains</b> and <b>losses.</b> With regards {{to the nature of}} <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> arising from derivative transactions, the aspect which was considered is whether <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> were of a capital or revenue nature in the context of speculation or hedging. With regards to the timing of <b>gains</b> or <b>losses,</b> the dissertation considers when <b>gains</b> and <b>losses</b> should be brought into taxable income of a taxpayer. The following examples of derivative financial instruments were analysed: cross currency swaps, index options, credit default swaps and contracts for differences (CFDs). These derivatives were analysed with respect to the nature and timing of the <b>gains</b> or <b>losses</b> when hedging or speculating. The impact of the provisions of the Eighth Schedule is also considered with respect to the derivatives mentioned above. CopyrightDissertation (MCom) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009.

50|$|Beyond {{its use in}} the {{physical}} and social sciences, Kuhn's paradigm concept has been analysed in relation to its applicability in identifying 'paradigms' with respect to worldviews at specific points in history. One example is Matthew Edward Harris' book The Notion of Papal Monarchy in the Thirteenth Century: The Idea of Paradigm in Church History. Harris stresses the primarily sociological importance of paradigms, pointing towards Kuhn's second edition of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Although obedience to popes such as Innocent III and Boniface VIII was widespread, even written testimony from the time showing loyalty to the pope does not demonstrate that the writer had the same worldview as the Church, and therefore pope, at the centre. The difference between paradigms in {{the physical}} sciences and in historical organisations such as the Church is that the former, unlike the latter, requires technical expertise rather than repeating statements. In other words, after scientific training through what Kuhn calls 'exemplars', one could not genuinely believe that, to take a trivial example, the earth is flat, whereas thinkers such as Giles of Rome {{in the thirteenth century}} wrote in favour of the pope, then could easily write similarly glowing things about the king. A writer such as Giles would have wanted a good job from the pope; he was a papal publicist. However, Harris writes that 'scientific group membership is not concerned with desire, emotions, <b>gain,</b> <b>loss</b> and any idealistic notions concerning the nature and destiny of humankind...but simply to do with aptitude, explanation, and cold description of the facts {{of the world and the}} universe from within a paradigm'.|$|E
