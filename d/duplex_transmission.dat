Optical chaotic light {{can be obtained}} by injecting a sinusoidal electronic signal into a self-pulsating laser diode. To synchronize between two identical chaotic systems with different initial conditions, a drive and response system model is constructed according to Pecora and Carroll’s theory. Synchronization can be achieved for optical simplex and <b>duplex</b> <b>transmissions</b> provided that the conditional Lyapunov exponents for the drive and response systems are all negative. This approach offers a key step toward realizing optical chaotic modulation and demodulation.

40|$|Joint {{optimization}} of nonlinear precoders {{and receive}} filters is studied {{for both the}} uplink and downlink in a cellular system. For the uplink, the base transceiver station (BTS) receiver implements successive interference cancellation, and for the downlink, the BTS station pre-compensates for the interference with Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP). Convergence of alternating optimization of receivers and transmitters in a single cell is established when filters are updated according to a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion, subject to appropriate power constraints. Adaptive algorithms are then introduced for updating the precoders and receivers {{in the absence of}} channel state information, assuming time-division <b>duplex</b> <b>transmissions</b> with channel reciprocity. Instead of estimating the channels, the filters are directly estimated according to a least squares criterion via bi-directional training: Uplink pilots are used to update the feedforward and feedback filters, which are then used as interference pre-compensation filters for downlink training of the mobile receivers. Numerical results show that nonlinear filters can provide substantial gains relative to linear filters with limited forward-backward iterations. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures, submitted to IEEE Trans.

In the proposed solution the opportunistic user designs its beamformer in order to span the noise subspace at the primary receiver, thus intertwining its signal with the primary’s so that its signal lies within the spatial whitespace of the primary system, causing no interference to the latter. This is spatial interweave. To solve this beamforming design problem the knowledge of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is crucial.
