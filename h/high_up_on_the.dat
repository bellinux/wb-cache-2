The blood was smeared <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> armpits and the shirt smelled unused, suggesting to the police that it was a plant. The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed that Frank had arranged the plant.|$|E
25|$|The alpine {{tree line}} {{boundary}} is seldom abrupt: it usually forms a transition zone between closed forest below and treeless alpine tundra above. This {{zone of transition}} occurs “near {{the top of the}} tallest peaks in the northeastern United States, <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> giant volcanoes in central Mexico, and on mountains in each of the 11 western states and throughout much of Canada and Alaska”. Environmentally dwarfed shrubs (krummholz) commonly forms the upper limit.|$|E
25|$|On 11 May 1996 eight climbers {{died after}} several expeditions {{were caught in}} a {{blizzard}} <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mountain. During the 1996 season, 15 people died while climbing on Mount Everest. These were the highest death tolls for a single event, and for a single season, until the sixteen deaths in the 2014 Mount Everest avalanche. The disaster gained wide publicity and {{raised questions about the}} commercialisation of climbing Mount Everest.|$|E

50|$|Allobates chalcopis was {{originally}} described from forested ravines of Mount Pelée at {{an elevation of}} about 500 m asl. Extensive search in 2011 failed to spot the species in this habitat, but it was discovered <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mountain, at about 800 - 1400 m asl, that is, to {{the summit of the}} mountain. The current range starts from the transition zone between forest and savanna, the latter being the vegetation type found <b>higher</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mountain.|$|R

25|$|In 1826, {{a severe}} drought forced farmers to collect {{water from the}} Monk's Well in Kilmaurs, a spring never known to be dry. They drove their carts along the dry bed of the Carmel to catch the water, which poured from an exit <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall. One of these farmers horses bolted, {{bringing}} {{the head of a}} female rider into violent contact with the arch of the 'Auld Brig', killing the unfortunate woman outright.|$|E
25|$|Unsurprisingly, {{security}} and fire protection were major concerns. Horrea were frequently built with very thick walls (as much as 1 m / 3ft thick) {{to reduce the}} danger of fire, and the windows were always narrow and placed <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall to deter theft. Doors were protected with elaborate systems of locks and bolts. Even the largest horrea usually only had two or three external doors, which were often quite narrow {{and would not have}} permitted the entrance of carts. The arduous task of moving goods into, out of and around horrea was most probably carried out by manual labour alone; the biggest horrea would thus have had an enormous staff of labourers.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, Whymper, {{weary of}} the defeats he had {{sustained}} on the south-west ridge, tried a new way. The stratification of the rocks on the east face seemed to him favourable, and the slope not excessive. His plan of attack was complicated: a huge rock couloir, the base of which lies on the Italian side below the Breuiljoch, on the little Matterhorn glacier, would be ascended to a point <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Furggen ridge; from there, traversing the east face of the mountain, he meant to reach the Hörnli (north-east) ridge and follow it to the summit. However, when this route was attempted, the mountain discharged an avalanche of stone upon the climbers, and the ascent failed. His guides refused to make any further attempts by this route.|$|E

25|$|In early 1944, a Dornier Do 217 crashed <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Vehner moor in Lower Saxony, between Osnabrück and Oldenburg, and it {{was decided}} to send the V11 to recover the wreckage. Unfortunately the V11 ended up {{crashing}} nearby before it could attempt to lift the Do 217's remains. It was then decided to attempt to recover both using the V14. Flown by Karl Bode and Luftwaffe helicopter pilot Helmut Gerstenhauer, the operation was begun on 11 May 1944. A small team of Focke-Achgelis men and a Luftwaffe recovery company had already dismantled the V11, and the V14 made 10 flights carrying loads beneath it in a cargo net and setting them down where they could be loaded onto road vehicles. All the major parts of the V11 and the Do 217 were retrieved, and much useful experience was gained.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} car, SP 618000 {{was turned}} out in December, 1968 and tested through 1969. Chevrolet conducted vibration and low-speed crash tests to make sure nose-down Vegas wouldn't shift or be damaged in railcar collisions. Chevrolet's goal was to deliver Vegas topped with fluids and ready {{to drive to the}} dealership. To do this Vega engineers had to design a special engine oil baffle to prevent oil from entering the No. 1 cylinder, batteries had filler caps located <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear edge of the case to prevent acid spilling, the carburetor float bowl had a special tube that drained gasoline into the vapor canister during shipment, and the windshield washer bottle stood at a 45 degree angle. Plastic spacers were wedged in beside the powertrain to prevent damage to engine and transmission mounts. The wedges were removed when cars were unloaded. The rail car doors were opened and closed by means of a forklift truck.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} {{different}} outcomes has been proposed, and new theories {{continue to be}} put forward. Most views have the two carrying two cylinders of oxygen each, reaching and climbing either the First or Second Step, where they are seen by Odell. At this point {{there are two main}} alternatives: either Mallory takes Irvine's oxygen and goes on alone (and may or may not reach the summit); or both go on together until they turn back (having used up their oxygen, or realising that they will do so before the summit). In either case Mallory slips and falls to his death while descending, perhaps caught in the fierce snow squall that sent Odell to take shelter in their tent. Irvine either falls with him or, in the first scenario, dies alone of exhaustion and hypothermia <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ridge. The theory advanced by Tom Holzel in February 2008 is that Odell sighted Mallory and Irvine climbing the First Step for a final look around while they were descending from a failed summit bid.|$|E

25|$|The Hatsuharu-class destroyers were {{designed}} to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night torpedo attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japan's naval strategic projections. They were to be armed much as the Fubuki class despite displacing only 1400 tons compared to the 1700 tons of the earlier destroyers. Furthermore, their fire control systems were to be more modern than the older systems and suitable for anti-aircraft use. This required the gun turrets to be modified for high-angle fire, which also meant more powerful motors to traverse and elevate the guns more quickly to engage high-speed aircraft. The torpedo launchers were {{to be given a}} protective shield to allow for use in heavy weather and to protect against splinter damage. And the Hatsuharu vessels were to be fitted with modern, enclosed command spaces protected against strafing aircraft. These requirements could only be met by adding weight <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship and increased the ship's center of gravity. The only way to adhere to the allotted displacement was to try to reduce the weight of the hull and other equipment below the waterline as much as possible. But this put the ship's designers in a no-win situation as any reduction of weight below the waterline further raised the ship's center of gravity and reduced her stability.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 February 1875, the ship was still heading south in almost {{cyclonic}} conditions with fore, top and mainsails set and the steam engines running at full speed. Flooding rains lashed the entire Queensland coast and Captain Pearce reportedly could not see land or sun. At approximately 7:00pm, and for reasons undetermined, he altered course and shortly afterwards, at full speed (11 to 12 knots), hit {{a section of the}} Great Barrier Reef at low tide [...] north west of Holbourne Island. Gothenburg struck with such force that she was left <b>high</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reef. Immediately, an order came out to lower the sails.

500|$|Critics {{have also}} derided that the film's [...] "bad" [...] {{characters}} {{appear to be}} exaggerated in appearance, overweight, drawn with dark skin, large noses and damaged teeth, while Jasmine's skin tone remains lighter in comparison. Slim in stature, Jasmine also lacks obvious character flaws in both her personality and speech Jasmine. Uprooting Racism: How White People Can Work for Racial Justice Ð 3rd Edition author Paul Kivel dubbed this [...] "racial coding", a practice also {{believed to have been}} used to differentiate the good from bad characters in Disney's The Lion King (1994).

Brode accused Jasmine of [...] "perpetuat damaging stereotypes." [...] Observing that [...] "underneath their multicultural skin [...] all conform to the white, middle-class, thin, feminine ideal of beauty", Gary Burns, author of A Companion to Popular Culture, accused Jasmine of being [...] "an American-accented girl... who battles the traditions of older, heavily accented, traditional Arabs." [...] Despite Disney's attempt to accurately portray the culture of the time period during which the film is set such as a lack of women in powerful positions, Isabel Santaolalla, author of [...] "New" [...] Exoticisms: Changing Patterns in the Construction of Otherness, agreed that Jasmine remains [...] "a vehicle for contemporary gender politics in America" [...] despite her Middle Eastern appearance, explaining, [...] "the film's PC credibility is reserved for Jasmine, but this feistiness probably reflects developments in America more than the realities of 1990s Basrah or Baghdad." [...] Critics also did not appreciate the scene in which Jasmine nearly gets her hand cut off by a merchant as punishment for unintentionally stealing an apple.|$|E
