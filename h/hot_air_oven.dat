5000|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>ovens</b> are {{electrical}} devices which use dry heat to sterilize. They were originally developed by Pasteur. [...] Generally, {{they can be}} operated from 50 to 300 °C, using a thermostat to control the temperature. Their double walled insulation keeps the heat in and conserves energy, the inner layer being a poor conductor and outer layer being metallic. There is also an air filled space in between to aid insulation. An air circulating fan helps in uniform distribution of the heat. These are fitted with the adjustable wire mesh plated trays or aluminium trays and may have an on/off rocker switch, as well as indicators and controls for temperature and holding time. The capacities of these ovens vary. Power supply needs vary from country to country, depending on the voltage and frequency (hertz) used.

The conventional cure processes involve thermal curing in <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> <b>ovens</b> and autoclaves where the cure process is time and energy intensive.

In the present work, 2 mm thick glass-epoxy composite laminates have been cured using a conveyorised microwave system. The epoxy matrix is LY 5052 / HY 5052 resin system. Since the use of metal moulds inside a microwave system could lead to arcing, hot spots and damage to microwave sources, two different, ceramic moulds based on fused silica were fabricated in-house and employed for microwave curing. One was a microwave transparent fused silica mould and the other a microwave absorbing dielectric mould. The temperature uniformity of the moulds was assessed using an IR pyrometer and IR camera. Cure completion of microwave cured laminates was ascertained by Tg measurement and mechanical property determination, which were compared with thermally cured counterparts in order to evaluate the efficacy of the moulds for rapid, uniform and energy-efficient microwave processing...|$|R

50|$|Dry {{heat was}} the first method of {{sterilization}} and is a longer process than moist heat sterilization. The destruction of microorganisms {{through the use of}} dry heat is a gradual phenomenon. With longer exposure to lethal temperatures, the number of killed microorganisms increases. Forced ventilation of hot air can be used to increase the rate at which heat is transferred to an organism and reduce the temperature and amount of time needed to achieve sterility. At higher temperatures, shorter exposure times are required to kill organisms. This can reduce heat-induced damage to food products.

Both the autoclave and the dry heat oven were the method of choice in 13 of the 16 schools. The sterilization routine was routinely monitored by 11 of the institutions. Chemical control through the tape test in the autoclave was used by 13 of the schools, three institutions reported preventive maintenance, and biological indicators were used by seven of the 16 schools.

40|$|Testing of radon {{concentration}} in soil gas that {{is drawn from}} two to four feet below grade, prior to construction, is becoming increasingly important {{in order to identify}} construction sites with potential for elevated indoor radon concentrations. In addition, such testing is increasingly evolving as a practice within other soil testing performed during the design and construction phases of a project. Theoretical considerations suggest that soil water content may significantly affect measurements of radon concentrations in soil gas prior to construction, during soil preparation, and after foundationlslab construction. An experimental assembly has been designed and constructed to investigate soil water content effects on soil gas radon concentration measurements. Soil samples were first weighted and dried using a <b>hot</b> <b>air</b> conventional <b>oven,</b> and then placed inside the assembly's testing chamber. Temperature and relative humidity inside the chamber, pressure differentials between the chamber and the ambient, and radon concentration emanated from the soil samples are simultaneously monitored during the experiments.

In most samples, analysis of results show no dependence of average radon concentration collected from soil samples on sample water content ranging from dryness to saturation. Less than 10 % change in in-situ samples radon levels were observed in most soil samples. Dryness conditions may slightly contribute to produced testing results in the lower range of statistical uncertainty of average radon concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Clay brick {{is one of}} the {{essential}} materials in building construction. The demand for clay brick has been increased over the years as it goes along with the rise of world population and industrial building constructions. The current state of brick manufacturing process is still very traditional where drying of clay brick takes very long time and labour intensive. Adding to this problem, uneven heating during drying and firing affect a lot to bricks quality which often cause cracks. This research aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} microwave energy source against the conventional methods for drying four different types of clay bricks. Green clay samples were pressed into a slab specimen at different compositions (%clay, %water, %lime, %fly ash). Later, the green samples were dried under four different mediums (natural, <b>hot</b> <b>air,</b> electric <b>oven</b> and microwave). The quality of dried bricks was compared in terms of water absorption, density, and porosity. It is found that microwave heating outperforms the three conventional heating methods by drying all types of brick samples without crack. Design of experiment (DOE) was utilized to evaluate significant factors (temperature (60 - 70 - 80 oC), time (6 - 8 - 10 min) and percentage of charcoal (0 - 3 - 6 %)) to dry red brick samples. Responses were crack density, brick density, water absorption and moisture contents. Analysis of variance indicates that all three factors are significant. Temperature is the most influential factors among the three affecting all responses. It is found that drying bricks at 70 oC succeeding without any crack generation on the samples. It is also noted that a significant faster drying rate is seen when adding various percentages of charcoal contents in brick samples. From the results obtained, it is concluded that microwave technology has a great potential to be applied as a heating source in the production of bricks.
