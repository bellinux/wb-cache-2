Cyc01 mutants showed a disproportionately large sleep rebound and died after 10 hours of sleep deprivation, although they were more resistant than other clock mutants to various stressors.

50|$|The {{study of}} teleological {{mechanisms}} (from the Greek τέλος or telos for end, goal, or purpose) in machines with corrective feedback dates {{from as far}} back as the late 18th century when James Watt's steam engine was equipped with a governor (1775-1800), a centrifugal feedback valve for controlling the speed of the engine. Alfred Russel Wallace identified this as the principle of evolution in his famous 1858 paper. In 1868 James Clerk Maxwell published a theoretical article on governors, one of the first to discuss and refine the principles of self-regulating devices. Jakob von Uexküll applied the feedback mechanism via his model of <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> (Funktionskreis) in order to explain animal behaviour and the origins of meaning in general.|$|E
40|$|Summary Macromolecular machines, {{such as the}} ribosome, undergo {{large-scale}} conformational {{changes during}} their <b>functional</b> <b>cycles.</b> Although their mode of action is often {{compared to that of}} mechanical machines, a crucial difference is that, at the molecular dimension, thermodynamic effects dominate <b>functional</b> <b>cycles,</b> with proteins fluctuating stochastically between functional states defined by energetic minima on an energy landscape. Here, we have used cryo-electron microscopy to image ex-vivo-derived human polysomes as a source of actively translating ribosomes. Multiparticle refinement and 3 D variability analysis allowed us to visualize a variety of native translation intermediates. Significantly populated states include not only elongation cycle intermediates in pre- and post-translocational states, but also eEF 1 A-containing decoding and termination/recycling complexes. Focusing on the post-translocational state, we extended this assessment to the single-residue level, uncovering striking details of ribosome-ligand interactions and identifying both static and functionally important dynamic elements...|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{we focus}} on the {{development}} of an algorithm that is used to generate a minimal number of patterns for path delay test of integrated circuits using the multi-cycle at-speed test. We test the circuits in functional mode, where multiple <b>functional</b> <b>cycles</b> follow after the test pattern scan-in operation. This approach increases the delay correlation between the scan and functional test, due to more functionally realistic power supply noise. We use multiple at-speed cycles to compact K-longest paths per gate tests, which reduces the number of scan patterns. After a path is generated, we try to place each path in the first pattern in the pattern pool. If the path does not fit due to conflicts, we attempt to place it in later <b>functional</b> <b>cycles.</b> This compaction approach retains the greedy nature of the original dynamic compaction algorithm where it will stop if the path fits into a pattern. If the path is not able to compact in any of the <b>functional</b> <b>cycles</b> of patterns in the pool, we generate a new pattern. In this method, each path delay test is compared to at-speed patterns in the pool. The challenge is that the at-speed delay test in a given at-speed cycle must have its necessary value assignments set up in previous (preamble) cycles, and have the captured results propagated to a scan cell in the later (coda) cycles. For instance, if we consider three at-speed (capture) cycles after the scan-in operation, and if we need to place a fault in the first capture cycle, then we must generate it with two propagation cycles. In this case, we consider these propagation cycles as coda cycles, so the algorithm attempts to select the most observable path through them. Likewise, if we are placing the path test in the second capture cycle, then we need one preamble cycle and one coda cycle, and if we are placing the path test in the third capture cycle, we require two preamble cycles with no coda cycles...|$|R

40|$|To {{elucidate}} the exact {{role of the}} C-terminal region of GroEL in its <b>functional</b> <b>cycle,</b> the C-terminal 20 -amino acid truncated mutant of GroEL was constructed. The steady-state ATPase rate and duration of GroES binding showed that the <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> of the truncated GroEL is extended by ∼ 2 s in comparison {{with that of the}} wild type, without interfering with the basic functions of GroEL. We have proposed a model for the <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> of GroEL, which consists of two rate-limiting steps of ∼ 3 - and ∼ 5 -s duration (Ueno, T., Taguchi, H., Tadakuma, H., Yoshida, M., and Funatsu, T.

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{explore the}} domain-scale {{flexibility}} of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) throughout its <b>functional</b> <b>cycle,</b> block normal-mode analyses (BNM) {{were performed on}} several important functional states, including the holoenzyme, the core complex, a model of RNAP bound to primarily duplex DNA, and {{a model of the}} ternary elongation complex. The calculations utilized a molecular mechanics (MM) force field with physical interactions; this is made possible by the use of BNM and the implementation of a sparse-matrix diagonalization routine. The use of homology models necessitated the MM force field rather than the simpler elastic network model (ENM). From the MM/BNM, we have systematically and semiquantitatively calculated the atomic fluctuations in the four functional states without bias due to crystal packing or other artifactual forces. We have observed that both R subunits and the ö subunit are rigid, in line with their roles as structural motifs that are not mechanistically involved in RNAP’s <b>functional</b> <b>cycle.</b> It has been observed that the â subunit has two highly mobile domains; these are commonly known as the â 1 and â 2 domains. Our calculations suggest that the flexibility of these domains is modulated throughout the <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> and that they move entirely independently of each other unless DNA is bound.

The 26 S holocomplex comprises the core particle (CP), where proteolysis takes place, and one or two regulatory particles (RPs). The base of the RP is formed by a heterohexameric AAA(+) ATPase module, which unfolds and translocates substrates into the CP. Applying single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and image classification to samples in the presence of different nucleotides and nucleotide analogs, we were able to observe four distinct conformational states (s 1 to s 4).

40|$|Some sea slugs {{are capable}} of {{retaining}} functional sequestered chloroplasts (kleptoplasts) for variable periods of time. The mechanisms supporting the maintenance of these organelles in animal hosts are still largely unknown. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and the occurrence of a xanthophyll cycle were investigated in the sea slugs Elysia viridis and E. chlorotica using chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and pigment analysis. The photoprotective capacity of kleptoplasts was compared to that observed in their respective algal source, Codium tomentosum and Vaucheria litorea. A <b>functional</b> xanthophyll <b>cycle</b> and a rapidly reversible NPQ component were found in V. litorea and E. chlorotica but not in C. tomentosum and E. viridis.

30|$|Directional {{movement}} of cellular components {{is essential to}} all eukaryotic cells, and is driven by a mechanoenzymatic system consisting largely of the actin–myosin cytoskeletal protein complex. Structural and functional analysis of this complex has provided critical insights into the mechanisms that enforce and regulate the {{movement of}} intracellular components such as muscle fibers, vesicles, as well as organelles. However, the structural bases of energy coupling between ATP hydrolysis and force generation common for all myosins remain elusive. Here we briefly review the widely accepted concept of how the actin–myosin cycle functions. We then propose a model {{based on the assumption}} that most of the chemical energy stored in ATP is released in the step of ATP binding, not during the hydrolysis step per se. Importantly, we propose that this energy is used to dissociate myosin from the actin filament, the most energy-intensive step in the reaction of the actin–myosin <b>functional</b> <b>cycle.</b> This suggests that the dissociation step serves as the major energy storage, thus driving the remaining <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> of the actin–myosin complex.|$|E

This research paper is {{made on the basis of}} the information, received from textbooks and scientific literature of domestic and foreign authors, as well as from other sources. The main methods, used in this work are as follows: method of system analysis, method of the theory of operations’ research, prognostics. Application of these methods allows forecasting material flows, creating the integrated management systems and controlling their movements, developing systems of logistic service, to optimize supply stock and solve a number of other tasks. A logistic approach to form a modern system of logistics will save time, reduce costs for the purchase of material resources, their delivery and storage. In modern conditions of the market economy, the considered time parameters of the logistic chain are essential for manufacturing enterprises because their records significantly increase the efficiency of the logistical system. Logistics is equipped with a special complex of economic and mathematical models, the main feature of which is the adaptability, i. e. ability to solve complex optimization problems in the operational mode and in the process of the management of material flows. The primary role of these models in a market economy is to identify quickly points of compromise. Dynamics to functional cycles gives the necessity to align resource needs «input» and «output». «Input» <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> is an order that specifies requirements for a product or service. Logistical system, which is able to complete fully the order of any size, as a rule, needs in the «combined» functional cycles, including different transactions and operations at different stages. The «output» of the system – expected results to perform the logistics operations. We can talk about the effectiveness of the <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> structure due to the operational needs. The effectiveness of the <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> is directly related to the resource cost. The efficiency and productivity of the functional cycles are the key indicators in logistical management. Functional cycles are forming a single supply chain and link its participants. Thus, the <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> is the main object of the design and operational management in logistical systems, its structure is the basis for making the integrated logistics. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe chaperonins are {{a family}} of {{molecular}} chaperones present in all three kingdoms of life. They are classified into Group I and Group II. Group I consists of the bacterial variants (GroEL) and the eukaryotic ones from mitochondria and chloroplasts (Hsp 60), while Group II consists of the archaeal (thermosomes) and eukaryotic cytosolic variants (CCT or TRiC). Both groups assemble into a dual ring structure, with each ring providing a protective folding chamber for nascent and denatured proteins. Their <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> is powered by ATP binding and hydrolysis, which drives a series of structural rearrangements that enable encapsulation and subsequent release of the substrate protein. Chaperonins have elaborate allosteric mechanisms to regulate their <b>functional</b> <b>cycle.</b> Long-range negative cooperativity between the two rings ensures alternation of the folding chambers. Positive intra-ring cooperativity, which facilitates concerted conformational transitions within the protein subunits of one ring, has only been demonstrated for Group I chaperonins.

30|$|Recently, we {{proposed}} an electrostatic membrane potential (ΔΨ)-driving hypothesis {{in an attempt}} to unify energy-coupling mechanisms of a variety of transmembrane proteins into a common theoretical framework. The central idea of this hypothesis is that the interaction of charged groups in a membrane protein with ΔΨ can provide a major driving force for the <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> of the corresponding membrane protein. This hypothesis has been used to explain the energy coupling mechanisms of PMF-driven major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters (Zhang et al., 2015 a), of proton transfer-mediated GPCR activation (Zhang et al., 2014), and of the ABC transporters (Zhang et al., 2015 b). For example, in the MFS case, protonation of the transporter applies an extra electrostatic force, which together with the hydrophobic mismatch forces generates a torque to induce conformational changes for substrate transport. In this article, we propose the application of the same ΔΨ-driving hypothesis for identifying the mechanism of the <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> of the Fo motor. We will summarize the current knowledge on structures of ATP synthases and briefly discuss the current models of the mechanism of the Fo motor. One of the models, referred to here as the rigid-rotor model, will be further refined in light of newly available structural information and in the framework of our ΔΨ-driving hypothesis.|$|E
40|$|The 'small' mechanosensitive channel, MscS, {{resides in}} cytoplasmic {{membranes}} of most free-living bacteria. MscS is gated directly by membrane tension and functions as an osmolyte release valve in bacterial turgor regulation. In contrast to previously studied MscL, {{which is a}} strictly prokaryotic molecule, MscS homologs are found in eukaryotes increasing {{the value of this}} channel as a general model for gating by membrane stretch. Presented here are the results of three studies aimed at characterizing the structural basis for function of Escherichia coli MscS. In study one, we provide the first electrophysiological characterization of the wild-type channel in its native membrane free of other mechanosensitive channels. It is, to date, the most complete description the gating cycle specifying the kinetic scheme and dependencies of major rates on tension and voltage. Study two represents a collaborative effort to probe the strength of intersubunit contacts in the homo-heptameric MscS channel. In patch-clamp experiments we show that the dissociating effects of TFE alter MscS gating in a manner that provides significant insight into the mechanics of channel inactivation. In the final study our research group utilized a novel extrapolated motion technique to explore the conformational pathways of the MscS <b>functional</b> <b>cycle.</b> Guided by these new models, channel mutants were generated to alter helical propensity along the pore lining TM 3 helix. Patch-clamp analysis revealed a vivid picture of the functioning MscS in which these TM 3 domains provide a structural frame for the open channel. Dynamic collapse of these 'struts' at flexible points along TM 3 modulates transitions from the open state to the inactivated and closed states. My contributions to these studies have allowed for (1) refinement of the MscS <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> including identification of a new desensitized state; (2) determination of the physical parameters and spatial scales of channel opening, closing and inactivation; and (3) identification of key hinge elements, residing in TM 3, that along with membrane tension serve to modulate the <b>functional</b> <b>cycle</b> of MscS.

Key features are: isolation valve between growth and pulling chamber, and recharging mechanism. <b>Functional</b> changes reduce <b>cycle</b> time and prolong crucible life...|$|R
