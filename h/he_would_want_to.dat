5|$|In {{addition}} to taking the written exam, {{all of the}} applicants {{had to take a}} horse-riding test as well. Having grown up riding horses on his family's plantation, Middleton scored very well on this exam, and the officer in charge thought that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go into the cavalry. Middleton, however, wanted to go into the infantry, leaving the officer stunned that anyone with such horsemanship skills would even consider spending his time walking instead of riding a fine horse.|$|E
5|$|Nima Nourizadeh had {{previously}} only worked directing music videos and commercials, {{but he came}} to the producers' attention for his directing work on a series of party-themed Adidas commercials. Nourizadeh explained to the producers how <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> develop the script and how he would want the film to look and feel, and he was eventually brought from London to Los Angeles, for what he believed would be two weeks, but stretched to two years. Phillips believed that Nourizadeh's interpretation of the film was compatible with his vision, influencing the decision to hire Nourizadeh in his feature film debut.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{factor contributing to}} the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to add new elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> include portions of it in Duke Nukem Forever. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to {{a new version of}} the Unreal engine that was designed for multiplayer matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not have a plan for what the finished game would look like. At the same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired Bear Stearns to look into selling the company or merging it. Later that year, Infogrames Entertainment announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive. The publishing rights for Duke Nukem Forever passed to Gathering of Developers in early December 2000.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} Justin Spitzer, his 10th writing credit for the series. It was directed by series editor David Rogers, his 4th directing credit for the series. Beginning with this episode, Mindy Kaling was promoted to executive producer. Before this, it was speculated that she might {{not return to the}} series as a writer. The episode features guest appearance from Stephen Collins, Dee Wallace and Josh Groban as Andy's father, mother and brother, respectively. Collins and Wallace were reported to appear on the series by Joyce Eng of TV Guide. Josh Groban was later reported to appear on the series the next day. Writer Mindy Kaling had sent Groban a message through Twitter asking if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> appear on the series. He responded yes with the filming week of the episode lining up with his Los Angeles concert for his Straight to You Tour.|$|E

Often, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have sex in a public area or in the woods. Ridgway himself admitted to having a fixation with sex workers, {{with whom he had}} a love-hate relationship. He frequently complained about their presence in his neighborhood, but he also took advantage of their services regularly. It has been speculated that Ridgway was torn between his uncontrollable lusts and his staunch religious beliefs.|$|E

As the book draws to a close, Arthur {{is on his way to}} check out a possible university for Random, when, during a hyperspace jump, he is flung across alternate universes, has a brief encounter with Fenchurch, and ends up exactly where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be. And then the Vogons turn up again.|$|E
25|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Takeshi Abo. His process for composing the music consisted of him reading the game's story, {{to get an}} as full as possible understanding of the setting and the character personalities. He considered his first impressions of the game's emotional flow and events to be very important: he would write them down together {{with the kind of}} music <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use for each scene, and keep them in mind when composing the music. He said that this approach, while taking longer than if he had just designated songs to various places in the game, made for higher quality music with a better relation to the game's worldview.|$|E

Gaston leaves angered, where he later runs into Honoré, who declares the family has always been a bit odd.

500|$|Dedicated {{to music}} education, Edwards enjoys {{conducting}} Beethoven for youth orchestras. He has {{admitted that he}} did not envision a career conducting youth orchestras but also that he [...] "did not rule them out". His favourite composition is Parsifal by Richard Wagner; other favourites include unaccompanied choral music, cello suites by Bach, quartets by Beethoven and jazz, including Nat King Cole. Apart from music, Edwards likes the Chicago Bears, CrossFit, golf, kayaking, Masterpiece Theater, poetry, and Rhône wine along with the winemaking process. Edwards is an avid sports fan and fitness advocate; he is a former rugby player, enjoys running and playing squash, and believes there are similarities between how music and sports affect the community. He was sometimes referred to as [...] "coach" [...] by musicians of the Portland Youth Philharmonic. Edwards has shared that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work at a vineyard or winery, or be a sports radio host or travel correspondent for a publication if he were not a conductor.|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 1922, {{nearly all}} of Hemingway's early writing– his juvenilia and {{apprentice}} fiction, including the duplicates– was lost. He had been sent on assignment to cover the Conference of Lausanne, leaving Hadley, who was sick with a cold, behind in Paris. In Lausanne he spent days covering the conference, and the evenings drinking with Lincoln Steffens. Before setting off to meet him in Switzerland, thinking <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> show his work to Steffens, Hadley packed all his manuscripts into a valise which was subsequently stolen at Gare de Lyon train station. Although angry and upset, Hemingway went with Hadley to Chamby (Montreux) to ski, and apparently did not post a reward for {{the recovery of the}} valise. An early story, [...] "Up in Michigan", survived the loss because Gertrude Stein had told him it was unprintable (in part because of a seduction scene), and he had stuffed it in a drawer.|$|E

500|$|During his childhood, MacFarlane {{developed}} {{an interest in}} illustration and began drawing cartoon characters Fred Flintstone and Woody Woodpecker, as early as two years old. By the age of five, MacFarlane knew that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> pursue a career in animation, and began by creating flip books, after his parents found {{a book on the}} subject for him. Four years later, aged nine, MacFarlane began publishing a weekly comic strip titled [...] "Walter Crouton" [...] for The Kent Good Times Dispatch, the local newspaper in Kent, Connecticut, which paid him five dollars per week. In one anecdote from the time, MacFarlane said in an October 2011 interview that as a child he was always [...] "weirdly fascinated by the Communion ceremony". He created a strip with a character kneeling at the altar taking Communion and asking [...] "Can I have fries with that?" [...] The paper printed it and he got an [...] "angry letter" [...] from the local priest; it led to [...] "sort of a little mini-controversy" [...] in the town.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the first}} Test match, it was noticed that despite British and Irish Lions fans being filmed singing The Power of Four, {{none of the}} players did sing it when it was played as the Lions anthem before God Defend New Zealand. It was also noted that Lions fans felt that The Power of Four was not {{catching}} on and some even suggested that Axel F {{would be better than}} The Power of Four. It was also suggested that due to a perceived selection bias towards English members of the Lions, that Land of Hope and Glory should be used instead of The Power of Four. The acting British and Irish Lions captain Martin Corry said that he did not attempt to sing The Power of Four because he felt {{that he would not be}} able to reach the correct notes. In 2009, British and Irish Lions player Alun Wyn Jones said that [...] "I'd rather sing The Power of Love" [...] when asked if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sing The Power of Four.|$|E
500|$|However, Milk's {{assassination}} {{has become}} entwined with his political efficacy, {{partly because he}} was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, [...] "No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death." [...] His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was [...] "a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America". According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend {{has been unable to}} be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: [...] "The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him {{a great deal of the}} Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one." [...] On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian John D'Emilio said, [...] "The legacy that I think <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be remembered for is the imperative to live one's life at all times with integrity." [...] For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: [...] "His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} cultural {{references to}} many American and British films. Woods becoming {{a convenience store}} clerk {{to prepare for a}} film is similar to Nick Lang (Michael J. Fox) becoming a police officer in the 1991 film The Hard Way, which Woods also starred in (interestingly, this is a reversal of roles: Woods played the cop that Lang was saddled with in the film). When Kent asks Homer if he is willing to go undercover to [...] "nail" [...] Apu, Homer replies: [...] "No way, man, get yourself another patsy!" [...] This is a reference to a line in the 1991 film JFK. The scene of Homer and Apu riding on mules to the Springfield Airport, with their luggage strapped to the mules' backs, is similar to a scene from the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia. In his Kwik-E-Mart job interview, the interviewer asks Woods why <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work at the Kwik-E-Mart, to which he replies: [...] "To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, I kind of like to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, in True Believer I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then, the film Chaplin I had a little cameo in that. I actually traveled back in time, back to the twenties, where... Well, I've said too much," [...] referencing the 1989 film True Believer and the 1992 film Chaplin.|$|E
