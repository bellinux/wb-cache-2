Boakes has said he prefers working on the Dark Fall games without a development team as [...] "the worlds of Dowerton and Fetch Rock are created from an informed imagination, using textures and sounds from the world around me. I think {{a little of that}} personality would be lost if tackled by a small team." [...] Of Lost Souls, he felt working alone helped him establish the game's atmosphere of isolation; [...] "working alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> of the Darkling Room {{is the best way to}} approach this game [...] It's an eerie, isolating experience." ...|$|E

40|$|To make {{a smooth}} {{touchdown}} when landing, an insect {{must be able}} to reliably control its approach speed as well as its body and leg position – behaviors that are thought to be regulated primarily by visual information. Bumblebees forage and land under a broad range of light intensities and while their behavior during the final moments of landing has been described in detail in bright light, little is known about how this is affected by decreasing light intensity. Here, we investigate this by characterizing the performance of bumblebees, B. terrestris, landing on a flat platform at two different orientations (horizontal and vertical) and at four different light intensities (ranging from 600 lx down to 19 lx). As light intensity decreased, the bees modified their body position and the distance at which they extended their legs, suggesting that the control of landing in these insects is visually mediated. Nevertheless, the effect of light intensity was small and the landings were still well controlled, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dimmest</b> <b>light.</b> We suggest that <b>the</b> changes <b>in</b> landing behavior that occurred in <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> might represent adaptations that allow the bees to perform smooth landings across the broad range of light intensities at which they are active...|$|R

30|$|Mr. T from {{community}} G of city C suffered from neural muscular atrophy. He {{and his wife}} were small-business owners and did not participate in any medical insurance plan.

40|$|Two Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mutants {{defective}} in CHLM encoding Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase (MgPMT) were identified. The mutants, {{one with}} a missense mutation (chlM- 1) and a second mutant with a splicing defect (chlM- 2), do not accumulate chlorophyll, are yellow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark and <b>dim</b> <b>light,</b> and their growth is inhibited at higher light intensities.

40|$|Ants {{are thought}} to be special among Hymenopterans in having only dichromatic colour vision based on two spectrally {{distinct}} photoreceptors. Many ants are highly visual animals, however, and use vision extensively for navigation. We show here that two congeneric day- and night-active Australian ants have three spectrally distinct photoreceptor types, potentially supporting trichromatic colour vision. Electroretinogram recordings show the presence of three spectral sensitivities with peaks (λmax) at 370, 450 and 550 nm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night-active Myrmecia vindex and peaks at 370, 470 and 510 nm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day-active Myrmecia croslandi. Intracellular electrophysiology on individual photoreceptors confirmed that the night-active M. vindex has three spectral sensitivities with peaks (λmax) at 370, 430 and 550 nm. A large number of <b>the</b> intracellular recordings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night-active M. vindex show unusually broad-band spectral sensitivities, suggesting that photoreceptors may be coupled.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} rod and cone photoreceptor degeneration in organotypic cultures of adult porcine retina. Our hypothesis was that the photoreceptors accumulate opsins, which, together with exposure to cyclic <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> illumination, induce autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER-stress) to overcome damaging protein overload. For this purpose, retinas were cultured for 48 h and 72 h during which they were illuminated with <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> for 8 h/day; specimens were analyzed by means of immunohistochemistry, Western blot, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and transmission electron microscopy. ER-stress and photoreceptor degeneration was observed in conventionally cultured retinas. <b>The</b> additional stress <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> illumination for 8 h/day resulted in increased levels of the ER-stress markers GRP 78 /BiP and CHOP, as well as increased level of active caspase- 12. Increased autophagic processes in cone and rod photoreceptors were detected by LC 3 B-II increases and occurrence of autophagosomes at the ultrastructural level. Illumination also resulted in altered protein expression for autophagy inducers such as p 62 and Beclin- 1. Moreover, there was a decrease in phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which further indicate an increase of autophagy. Rod and cone photoreceptors in retinas from a diurnal animal that were exposed to <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> illumination in vitro displayed autophagy and ER-stress processes. As no alteration of rhodopsin mRNA was observed, autophagy and ER-stress are suggested to decrease rhodopsin protein at the posttranscriptional level...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} termination of short term melatonin treatment on sleep, health, behavior, and parenting stress in children with delayed <b>Dim</b> <b>Light</b> Melatonin Onset. Forty-one children (24 boys, 17 girls; mean age= 9. 43 years) entered melatonin treatment for 3 weeks and then discontinued treatment by first taking a half dose for 1 week and then stopping completely for another week. Sleep was measured with sleep diaries filled in by parents and with actometers worn by children. Analyses were conducted with linear mixed models. Sleep latency was longer during the stop week compared to the treatment weeks. Sleep start was later and actual sleep time was shorter during the half dose and stop weeks compared to the treatment weeks. Sleep efficiency deteriorated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stop week. <b>Dim</b> <b>Light</b> Melatonin Onset was earlier after treatment, but this effect disappeared after <b>the</b> stop week. <b>In</b> addition to <b>the</b> effects on sleep, results from questionnaires completed by parents showed that melatonin treatment also had positive effects on children's health and behavior problems and parenting stress. While health deteriorated after treatment discontinuation, the effects on behavior problems and parenting stress remained. Behavior problems at baseline did not influence the effect of melatonin treatment. This study showed that complete termination of treatment after 4 weeks of melatonin use was too early. However, clinicians may advise a lower dose after a successful treatment trial of several week...|$|R
40|$|Monotremes are {{the most}} basal {{egg-laying}} mammals comprised of two extant genera, which are largely nocturnal. Visual pigments, <b>the</b> first step <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sensory transduction cascade <b>in</b> photoreceptors of <b>the</b> eye, have been examined {{in a variety of}} vertebrates, but little work has been done to study the rhodopsin of monotremes. We isolated the rhodopsin gene of the nocturnal short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and expressed and functionally characterized <b>the</b> protein <b>in</b> vitro. Three mutants were also expressed and characterized: N 83 D, an important site for spectral tuning and metarhodopsin kinetics, and two sites with amino acids unique to the echidna (T 158 A and F 169 A). The λ max of echidna rhodopsin (497. 9 ± 1. 1 nm) did not vary significantly in either T 158 A (498. 0 ± 1. 3 nm) or F 169 A (499. 4 ± 0. 1 nm) but was redshifted in N 83 D (503. 8 ± 1. 5 nm). Unlike other mammalian rhodopsins, echidna rhodopsin did react when exposed to hydroxylamine, although not as fast as cone opsins. The retinal release rate of light-activated echidna rhodopsin, as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy, had a half-life of 9. 5 ± 2. 6 min− 1, which is significantly shorter than that of bovine rhodopsin. The half-life of the N 83 D mutant was 5. 1 ± 0. 1 min− 1, even shorter than wild type. Our results show that with respect to hydroxylamine sensitivity and retinal release, the wild-type echidna rhodopsin displays major differences to all previously characterized mammalian rhodopsins and appears more similar to other nonmammalian vertebrate rhodopsins such as chicken and anole. However, our N 83 D mutagenesis results suggest that this site may mediate adaptation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> echidna to <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> environments, possibly via increased stability of light-activated intermediates. This study is the first characterization of a rhodopsin from a most basal mammal and indicates that there might be more functional variation in mammalian rhodopsins than previously assume...|$|R
