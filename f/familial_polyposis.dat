40|$|PURPOSE: <b>Familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominantly inherited syndrome {{characterized by}} {{hundreds or thousands}} of colorectal polyps and a high risk of colorectal cancer at a young age. Truncating germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene are detected in approximately 80 percent of patients with classical <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> and in approximately 10 percent of the attenuated <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> patients. METHODS: We investigated the adenomatous polyposis coli and MUTYH genes mutations in a well-characterized series of 25 unrelated Italian patients with <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis.</b> RESULTS: We characterized the specific adenomatous polyposis coli gene mutation in 10 probands, and identified eight truncating mutations (4 novel and 4 known mutations) and two splicing mutations. One of these, a novel missense mutation in exon 15, activates an exonic splicing enhancer control sequence. Moreover, 11 MUTYH gene mutations have been identified in 7 patients without a dominant family history of polyposis. CONCLUSIONS: This study enlarges the genotype-phenotype correlations of <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> and suggests that messenger alterations could be responsible for a subset of <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> cases without germ-line adenomatous polyposis coli or MUTYH gene mutations.

Occult radio-opaque jaw lesions and pigmented ocular fundus lesions (formerly called congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium) are extraintestinal phenotypic markers for this disorder. We evaluated the usefulness of the combination of these markers for identifying patients who have inherited <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis.</b> Forty three affected patients and 12 unaffected first degree relatives from 24 families with <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis,</b> including four families without extraintestinal manifestations, were examined for both phenotypic markers. Thirty three of the 43 patients (77 %) with <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> were positive for both markers, including patients from two families without extraintestinal manifestations. By contrast, only one of 12 (8 %) unaffected first degree relatives over 35 years of age had both markers. The sensitivity of the combination of these markers in identifying patients who inherited <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> was 77 %, the specificity 92 %, the predictive value of a positive test 97 %, the predictive value of a negative test 52 %, and the efficacy 80 %.

5000|$|An adenoma (from Greek αδένας, , [...] "gland" [...] + -ώμα, , [...] "tumor") ( [...] ; plural adenomas or adenomata [...] ) is {{a benign}} tumor of {{epithelial}} tissue with glandular origin, glandular characteristics, or both. Adenomas can grow from many glandular organs, including the adrenal glands, pituitary gland, thyroid, prostate, and others. Some adenomas grow from epithelial tissue in nonglandular areas but express glandular tissue structure (as {{can happen in}} <b>familial</b> <b>polyposis</b> coli). Although adenomas are benign, over time they may transform to become malignant, at which point they are called adenocarcinomas. Most adenomas do not transform.

40|$|A {{biomarker}} {{of increased}} risk for colon cancer is abnormally high proliferation of colonic epithelial cells. The authors developed an in vitro assay that measures the ability of human colonic epithelial cells that are in progressive stages of abnormal development to respond to direct application of calcium as the chloride in tissue culture medium. Incorporation of 3 H‐thymidine and autoradiography in situ was employed to measure the number of proliferating cells cultured at 0. 1 mM CaCl 2, the optimum level for growth, and 2. 2 to 5 mM, both levels achievable in the colonic lumen. Abnormal cell proliferation was reduced in biopsies from 13 of 14 patients without <b>familial</b> <b>polyposis</b> but at {{increased risk for}} colon cancer because of previous colonic neoplasms or familial association; in cells from three of four asymptomatic individuals in <b>familial</b> <b>polyposis</b> families at risk for that disease; and in cells of three of ten patients symptomatic with <b>familial</b> <b>polyposis.</b> Growth of tubular adenoma cells from two of seven <b>familial</b> <b>polyposis</b> patients was also inhibited by calcium.

These findings indicate heterogeneity within the <b>familial</b> <b>polyposis</b> phenotype for the normal cellular response to growth inhibition by calcium, and a further loss of response to calcium as these cells progress toward malignancy.

Among <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis,</b> 61 % were diagnosed with colorectal cancer.

40|$|In 1984 a {{national}} registry {{of families with}} <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> {{was set up in}} The Netherlands to promote screening in those families. Eight-two families had been registered by the end of 1988. Analysis of the pedigrees showed that 204 family members at risk had not yet been screened. The diagnosis of <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> was histologically confirmed in 230 patients. These patients were subdivided into two groups. Group A comprised patients with <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> referred because they were symptomatic, and Group B relatives of these patients who were found by screening to have <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis.</b> The authors compared these groups with respect to the occurrence of colorectal carcinoma. Fifty-four patients were found to have a colorectal carcinoma at the time of diagnosis of <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis,</b> i. e., 49 of the 104 patients in Group A (47 percent) and five of the 126 patients in Group B (4 percent). The average age at diagnosis of the 104 patients in Group A was 35 years (range, 13 to 66 years) and that of the 126 patients in Group B was 24 years (range, 8 to 59 years). By the age of 40 years, 90 percent of the patients in group B had been diagnosed. Late onset of <b>familial</b> adenomatous <b>polyposis</b> was found in four families.
