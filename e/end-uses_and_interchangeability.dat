50|$|The {{greenhouse}} {{effect is a}} natural process, but it is hypothesized that additional human contributions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, halocarbons, etc. are magnifying the {{greenhouse effect}} and causing global warming. While industry is commonly cited {{as the source of}} these emissions, emissions are ultimately a matter of <b>end-use</b> <b>and</b> therefore lifestyle. That is, when a product is chosen, so is a production process. Therefore, V GAS focuses on the <b>end-use</b> <b>and</b> lifestyle decisions of the individual as a way of exploring global warming.|$|R

40|$|Substitutability <b>and</b> <b>interchangeability</b> in {{constraint}} satisfac- tion problems (CSPs) {{have been}} used as a basis for search heuristics, so- lution adaptation and abstraction techniques. In this paper, we consider how the same concepts can be extended to soft constraint satisfaction problems (SCSPs). We introduce two notions: threshold alpha and degradation delta for substi- tutability <b>and</b> <b>interchangeability,</b> (alpha-substitutability/interchangeability <b>and</b> delta-substitutability/interchangeability respectively). We show that they satisfy analogous theorems to the ones already known for hard constraints. In alpha-interchangeability, values are interchangeable in any solution that is better than a threshold alpha, thus allowing to disregard differences among solutions that are not sufficiently good anyway. In delta-interchangeability, values are interchangeable if their exchange could not degrade the solution by more than a factor of delta. We give efficient algorithms to compute (delta/alpha) interchangeable sets of values for a large class of SCSPs...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>interchangeability</b> <b>and</b> the <b>interchangeability</b> {{algorithm}} in constraint satisfaction problems {{was first introduced}} by Eugene Freuder in 1991. The interchangeability algorithm reduces the search space of backtracking search algorithms, thereby improving the efficiency of NP-Complete CSP problems.|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been various {{attempts}} {{to set up a}} test suite covering the syntactic phenomena of a natural language (cp. [Flickinger et al. 1989], [Nerbonne et al. 1993]).

[Balkan et al. 1994]). These test suites are meant for the testing of NLP software regarding their coverage of syntactic phenomena. [Volk 1995] showed that a well-organised test suite {{can also be used to}} support incremental grammar development and grammar documentation. The key issues in the organisation of a test suite are the ease of extensibility <b>and</b> <b>interchangeability</b> as well as the avoidance of redundancy.
