5|$|For {{the next}} fifteen years, Michael (Tyler Mane) {{continues}} making masks and not speaking to anyone. Loomis, having continued to treat Michael over the years, attempts {{to move on}} with his life and closes Michael's case. Later, Michael kills the sanitarium employees and escapes from Smith's Grove. He kills a truck driver for his clothes, and makes his way back to Haddonfield. On Halloween, Michael arrives at his now-abandoned childhood home, where he recovers the kitchen knife and Halloween mask he stored under the <b>floorboards</b> the night he killed his sister.|$|E
5|$|Hindley hired {{a vehicle}} {{a week after}} Kilbride went missing, and again on 21 December 1963, {{apparently}} {{to make sure the}} burial sites had not been disturbed. In February 1964 she bought a second-hand Austin Traveller, but soon after traded it for a Mini van. Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett disappeared on 16 June 1964. His stepfather, Jimmy Johnson, became a suspect; in the two years following Bennett's disappearance, Johnson was taken for questioning on four occasions. Detectives searched under the <b>floorboards</b> of the Johnsons' house, and on discovering that the houses in the row were connected, extended the search to the entire street.|$|E
5|$|Passenger service {{along the}} Wallkill Valley line ceased in 1937, {{due to the}} {{increased}} usage of automobiles. By December 1958 the building (then owned by the New York Central Railroad) was no longer used as a railroad station. It was sold off in 1959, and hosted a number of local endeavors, serving as a chapter house for the Knights of Columbus and as an office for a public-access television station. Under the ownership of the television station, the roof and <b>floorboards</b> were repaired.|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{methods for}} {{mitigating}} the blast {{effects on the}} <b>floorboard</b> of passenger vehicles due to the detonation of explosives buried in water saturated sand underneath vehicles. The effects on <b>floorboard</b> acceleration of adding a vehicle hull, several types of <b>floorboard</b> bracing, the use of foam {{to fill the gap}} between the <b>floorboard</b> and hull, and the use of foam to isolate the <b>floorboard</b> from the hull. In addition, several tests have been conducted to examine how the distance of the <b>floorboard</b> from the ground affects the acceleration of the <b>floorboard</b> after the detonation. Testing showed that the addition of a hull to a vehicle, the hulls geometry, bracing of the <b>floorboard,</b> and increasing ground clearance all are able to help reduce <b>floorboard</b> accelerations. However, <b>floorboard</b> bracing had the potential to make accelerations much higher it is hit by the hull during testing. Foam filling between the hull and <b>floorboard</b> as well as a foam frame to isolate the <b>floorboard</b> from the hull did not have positive results. The primary method of investigation is differentiating a velocity profile found with the use of bar magnet velocity gages on the small scale model <b>floorboard.</b> Several other possible methods of investigation are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The {{intersection}} of 7th Street NW and H Street NW {{is the heart}} of D.C.'s Chinatown neighborhood today, but prior to the 1930s it was populated primarily by German immigrants. Before the American Civil War, 7th Street NW was the city's primary commercial district, the street lined with three-story Federal-style townhouses with shops on the ground floor and residences above. Lincoln conspirator Mary Surratt's boarding house (604 H Street NW) has been substantially renovated through the years (and currently houses a Chinese restaurant), but it may also house Mary Surratt's ghost. From the 1870s onward, occupants of the building have claimed that Surratt's spirit is responsible for the incomprehensible mumbling and whispers, footsteps, muffled sobs, and creaking <b>floorboards</b> which have unnerved them.|$|E
5|$|The use of Malmö Stadion for concerts has {{increased}} since {{the construction of}} Swedbank Stadion and Malmö FF's departure. Since 2007, several known artists such as Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John, Dolly Parton, The Eagles, Kiss, and Rod Stewart have performed at the stadium. Due to the climate in Sweden {{and the lack of}} a retractable roof at the ground, all of these concerts have been held during the European summer, between June–August. The main stage has been placed either facing the Southern Stand, or along one of the short sides of the stadium. The pitch has been covered up with wooden <b>floorboards</b> during the performances to minimize the damage done to the grass. Many spectators complained about the less than impressive sound quality at both the Elton John and Dolly Parton concerts, citing the stadiums layout as unsuitable for this kind of concert.|$|E
5|$|As Boyd took off, another C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel John Delmore {{closed in}} on Khâm Đức. At an {{altitude}} of about 300 to 400 feet, Delmore's aircraft began to receive North Vietnamese fire, and {{both sides of the}} cockpit were opened up by bullets that had ripped through the <b>floorboards.</b> Subsequently, just before touch down, Delmore and his co-pilot shut down the engine and forced the aircraft to remain upright. With no brakes and little directional control, the aircraft crashed into the CH-47 that had been destroyed early in the morning, but Delmore managed to turn his aircraft off the runway to avoid blocking it. When the aircraft had stopped completely, the five-man crew got out as quickly as they could. About 20 minutes later, U.S. soldiers on the ground guided them to safety, and they were rescued by a U.S. Marine CH-46. After witnessing the destruction of two C-130 Hercules, Lieutenant Colonel Franklin Montgomery landed his C-130 and extracted more than 150 Vietnamese civilians, and some CIDG and U.S. soldiers. Montgomery's aircraft suffered no hits, but the loadmaster was knocked down and trampled by panic-stricken Vietnamese civilians whilst trying to maintain order.|$|E

5|$|Sophia Dorothea had {{a second}} child, a {{daughter}} named after her, in 1687, {{but there were no}} other pregnancies. The couple became estranged—George preferred the company of his mistress, Melusine von der Schulenburg, and Sophia Dorothea, meanwhile, had her own romance with the Swedish Count Philip Christoph von Königsmarck. Threatened with the scandal of an elopement, the Hanoverian court, including George's brothers and mother, urged the lovers to desist, but to no avail. According to diplomatic sources from Hanover's enemies, in July 1694 the Swedish count was killed, possibly with the connivance of George, and his body thrown into the river Leine weighted with stones. The murder was claimed to have been committed by four of Ernest Augustus's courtiers, one of whom (Don Nicolò Montalbano) was paid the enormous sum of 150,000 thalers, which was about one hundred times the annual salary of the highest paid minister. Later rumours supposed that Königsmarck was hacked to pieces and buried beneath the Hanover palace <b>floorboards.</b> However, sources in Hanover itself, including Sophia, denied any knowledge of Königsmarck's whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1941 and the {{beginning}} of 1942, approximately 7,000 Jewish women, children and old men were brought to the camp, along with a further 500 Jewish men and 292 Romani women and children. Most of these people were from the outlying Serbian towns, primarily Niš, Smederevo and Šabac. Women and children were placed in makeshift barracks that were barely heated, and whose windows were shattered due to German bombing raids carried out during the invasion of Yugoslavia. Originally constructed as fair pavilions, the largest of these barracks held up to 5,000 prisoners. Inmates suffered during numerous influenza epidemics, slept on wet straw or bare <b>floorboards,</b> and were provided with inadequate amounts of food. Starvation was widespread, and Jewish inmates appealed unsuccessfully to Serbian authorities for more food to be provided to the camp. Consequently, a high number of detainees, especially children, died in late 1941 and early 1942, with many inmates freezing to death in one of the coldest winters on record. The Romani inmates were kept in far more miserable conditions than their Jewish counterparts. They also slept on straw in an unheated hall, but were kept separate from non-Romani prisoners. The majority of Romani inmates were released after six weeks of detention. Most Jewish inmates remained detained, with the exception of ten Jewish women who were married to Christian men.|$|E
5|$|The 1828 {{construction}} {{features a}} central hall with three {{rooms on the}} east and west sides of roughly symmetrical construction with chimneys at the intersection of the front and middle rooms. The first floor chimneys were flanked by doors allowing access to the other rooms and storage on the other side. The layout and usage of the jail is not known for certain, but it is believed that the rooms to the west were used by the jailer and his family. The first room as a parlor, the middle as the dining room and the rear room as the kitchen. As part of the renovations in 1959, the Society changed the parlor to a research room, the dining room into a library and added a door to the stairway from the kitchen. The front research room and library retain the original fireplaces, pine <b>floorboards</b> and closets, but the connecting passage between the two rooms were changed to a bathroom. The east side of the jail {{is believed to have been}} used by the jailer for his occupational duties, with the front room as a public reception room and the middle room as his office. The rear room in the back may have been used for record or other storage. After leasing the property, the Society removed the partitions in the rooms that separated the rooms from each other.|$|E

This is where the food cellar is located and Kent’s head is making the <b>floorboard</b> protrude outward. George stomps on the <b>floorboard</b> and corrects the problem. As Nathalie’s panic grows more desperate, George finds flowers and chocolate that Kent gave to Nathalie that night. Questioning her, Nathalie admits to Kent being present in the house the night of his fishing trip. When she reveals his location, George, believing him to be still alive, taunts him. When Nathalie reveals that he is dead, George comes to understand the true desperation of the situation. Taking his body to the nearby tool shed they debate over what course of action to take. The situation is further complicated because Kent’s clothes are missing and his neck was broken by George stomping on the cellar door. George's being a prominent judge and Nathalie's history (as it is now revealed) of early legal trouble for a pill addiction leave them little legal option but {{to dispose of the}} body themselves. Although Nathalie still insists that the authorities should be notified and the situation explained, George insists that it is not possible.|$|R
