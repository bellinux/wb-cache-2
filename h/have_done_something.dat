500|$|The tale's {{composition}} {{in the early}} period of the Viking Age in Ireland [...] "may <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> to substitute laconic humour and a spirit of ripe burlesque for the dignity and poetical beauty" [...] of other treasures of the Irish sagas. To call the tale a parody would not be entirely accurate; instead, it seems [...] "that a literary genius has presented us with a well-preserved heroic tradition, seen through the prismatic lens of a later age. [...] He brings to his theme a ripe sophistication, a concentrated irony, and a gay and lighthearted hyperbole." ...|$|E
500|$|Alaphilippe's second-place finish was {{the best}} for any French rider since Laurent Jalabert in 1998. He had entered the race in support of Kwiatkowski. When Kwiatkowski was {{struggling}} on the Côte de Saint-Nicolas, the Etixx-Quick Step directeur sportif sent a radio message to Alaphilippe to ride for himself; this {{was similar to the}} events in La Flèche Wallonne, where Alaphilippe also finished second to Valverde. He was frustrated on the finish line and waved his arm in the air; he said after the race [...] "today I really felt I could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> more".

500|$|Warren denies {{claims of}} an imitation, noting the {{discrepancies}} between the production schedules: when Inseminoid entered the shooting stage, Alien, {{which had been}} filmed in closed studios, had been released months before. While the director accepts the often [...] "uncanny" [...] similarities between the two films, he states that Alien distributors 20th Century Fox discounted the possibility of derivation after watching the final cut of Inseminoid: [...] "... in fact, the head of Fox sent us a very nice letter saying how much he enjoyed the film and wished us luck with the release ... I find it flattering that anyone can compare Alien, which cost {{in the region of}} $30million, with Inseminoid which cost less than £1million.

500|$|On 23 December 2005, Alex Gilady, an Israeli IOC {{member and}} a member of the IOC's London 2012 Co-ordination Commission, {{suggested}} that Madrid should have tied for second spot with Paris in the third round of voting, but did not do so because Greek member Lambis Nikolaou pressed the wrong button. He further postulated that if this had happened, Madrid would have beaten Paris in the resulting runoff ballot for second place, and gone on to beat London in the final round. However, Craig Reedie, a British IOC member, dismissed these words, commenting that a claim [...] "that an unnamed member 'might' <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> which 'might' have brought about something else which 'might' have brought about a different result is 'the kind of tittle-tattle that happens after many an IOC vote'." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{pre-season}} play in September 2000, Kariya {{received a}} one-game suspension after slashing Minnesota Wild player Aaron Gavey, {{though he was}} able to serve the suspension during exhibition play. Several months into the 2000–01 season, Kariya suffered a broken right foot after blocking a shot from Tampa Bay Lightning defenceman Pavel Kubina during a game in December 2000. Missing 15 games, he returned to the lineup in late-January 2001. The Ducks struggled as a team while both Kariya and Selänne's paled in comparison to previous years. In March 2001, Selänne was traded to the San Jose Sharks, marking the end of his duo with Kariya. Despite he and Kariya's success playing with each other, the Ducks had advanced to {{the second round of the}} playoffs just once in their tenure together. While disappointed with the trade, Kariya later commented that with the tandem constituting nearly half of the Ducks' $39 million payroll, [...] "If [...] were running the business, [...] would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> too." [...] Kariya finished the season with 67 points (33 goals and 34 assists) over 66 games. In addition to losing Selänne via trade, Kariya played the majority of the season without centre Steve Rucchin, who was suffering from post-concussion syndrome.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "major consequence" [...] of the typewriter's {{development}} was {{the entrance of}} women into the clerical work force. Although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in the 1880s, the typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings. Before the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) established the first typing school in 1881, women were trained by the manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with the machine. The expansion of correspondence and paper work that demanded the efficiency of typewriters, however, also created demand for additional clerical workers. The low wages accepted by women—often 50% (or less) of those paid to a man—made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling the new positions. As typing and stenography positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories, women were attracted in large numbers to office work. In 1874, less than 4% of clerical workers in the United States were women; by 1900, the number had increased to approximately 75%. Before his death, Sholes remarked of the typewriter, [...] "I do feel that I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> for {{the women who have}} always had to work so hard. This will enable them more easily to earn a living." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{pressure}} evidently worked, as Rinder {{wrote an}} [...] "Apology and Announcement" [...] on June 4, 2005 {{in which he}} told Miscavige, [...] "I recognise very clearly how Treasonous I have been towards you and Scientology." [...] He subsequently commented that such written confessions [...] "read like North Korean POW writeups," [...] alluding to the way that Korean War POWs detained in North Korea were forced to go through brainwashing to renounce their [...] "reactionary imperialist" [...] mindset. He explained to the Tampa Bay Times why people did not simply {{walk out of the}} Hole: [...] "If you leave you are going to lose contact with your family and any friends who are Scientologists. You have it pounded into you the whole time that the only reason someone leaves a group like that is because they are bad, that you <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> that force you to have to leave." [...] He noted people had invested a great deal of themselves in Scientology, that Sea Org members have [...] "made a commitment beyond even a single lifetime" [...] and that the prevailing attitude was that [...] "'I've lived through many lifetimes {{and there are lots of}} experiences that I've had that are far worse than this, so I can put up with this and I can stand it'." ...|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt {{had been}} {{approached}} at a British Academy Television Awards ceremony by director Paul Greengrass, who {{wanted him to}} star in a television drama he was making about the 1972 [...] "Bloody Sunday" [...] shootings in Derry. Nesbitt was only seven years old when the shootings happened and was ignorant of its cause; he believed that there was [...] "no smoke without fire" [...] and that the Catholic marchers must <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> to provoke the British Army. He was filming Cold Feet in Manchester when he received the script. He read it and found that had [...] "an extraordinary effect" [...] on him. Nesbitt played Ivan Cooper in Bloody Sunday, the man who pressed for the march to go ahead. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Cooper and spent many hours talking to him about his motives on that day. He met with relatives of the victims and watched the televised Bloody Sunday Inquiry with them, and also read Don Mullan's Eyewitness Bloody Sunday and Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson's Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They?. Greengrass compared Nesbitt's preparation to an athlete preparing for a race, and told The Observer, [...] "For an Irish actor, doing the Troubles is like doing Lear." [...] Nesbitt had questioned whether {{he was a good}} enough actor to effectively portray Cooper and was worried what Derry Catholics would think of a Protestant playing the lead, although Ivan Cooper himself is a Protestant.|$|E
500|$|Marvel Studios {{developed}} specific {{business practices}} to create its shared universe, including choosing filmmakers that were considered [...] "out-of-left-field", given their previous work. Feige remarked, [...] "You don't {{have to have}} directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us. You just have to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> singularly sort of awesome," [...] adding [...] "It's worked out well for us when we've taken people [...] that have done very, very good things. Very rarely are one of those good things a big giant blockbuster superhero movie." [...] When hiring directors, the studio usually has [...] "a kernel of {{an idea of what}} we want", which is presented to potential directors {{over the course of several}} meetings to discuss and further expand. [...] "And if over the course of three or four or five meetings they make it way better than what we initially were spewing to them, they usually get the job", according to Feige. Later expanding on this process, Feige explained that before talking to any directors on a film, Marvel Studios often puts together a [...] "lookbook" [...] of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for the film. These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds every [...] "18 months or so" [...] to plan out and develop the phases of the MCU. These lookbooks are not always shown to directors, though, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first.|$|E

500|$|Writer Kinberg {{would later}} state that [...] "there {{are a lot}} of things about 'X3' that I love and there {{are a lot of}} things that I regret", {{detailing}} that he would have preferred the Dark Phoenix as the main plotline and [...] "I would have fought harder" [...] for that, considering that at the period [...] "the darkness of her story was a little bit daunting on a huge $200 million studio movie" [...] leading Fox to ask for rewrites. Previous X-Men director Bryan Singer declared that The Last Stand [...] "isn't what I would have done" [...] and he was dissatisfied with the busy plot and excessive character deaths, but Singer still liked some parts of the movie, such as Ellen Page's casting – leading Singer to bring her back as Kitty Pryde in [...] – and the scenes with Leech, which he described as [...] "really sweet moments". Matthew Vaughn, who was attached as director before dropping out, criticized Ratner's direction: [...] "I could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> with far more emotion and heart. I'm probably going to be told off for saying that, but I genuinely believe it." [...] While promoting his own installment of the franchise, 2011's , Vaughn would say regarding The Last Stand that [...] "I storyboarded the whole bloody film, did the script. My X3 would have been 40 minutes longer. They didn't let the emotions and the drama play in that film. It became wall-to-wall noise and drama. I would have let it breathe and given far more dramatic elements to it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Father's Day" [...] was {{met with}} a {{generally}} positive reception. Piper stated that this was her favourite episode of the first series, and the most emotionally taxing for her to perform. SFX praised the way the concept of time was explored {{as well as the}} accurate representation of the '80s, and stated that Dingwall gave [...] "one of the series' best performances" [...] as Pete Tyler. However, the reviewer thought that the Reapers were the let-down of the episode, finding that [...] "the episode doesn't feel as much like horror as it should". Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave the episode an A for the emotional impact and the acting. Blumburg did note, however, that there were [...] "enormous logical gaps" [...] involving [...] "glowing TARDIS keys and under-explained paradoxes". In 2013, Radio Times reviewer Mark Braxton described it as [...] "a time-travel tale with immense heart" [...] and highlighted the shift of identification from the Doctor to Rose and the acting of Piper and Dingwall. Braxton, on the other hand, felt that the Reapers were redundant and the episode would have done [...] "equally well if you scythed the Reapers from the script". Reviewing [...] "Father's Day" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins gave it a grade of [...] "A", finding the story powerful. In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Robert Smith praised the emotion and the dilemma, which he felt was not heavy-handed. He was also positive about the direction and Dingwall's performance, though he felt that removing the Doctor from the plot suggested that he would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> else to resolve it, and he was not a fan of the scene where the Doctor tells two ordinary people how important their lives are, because it was [...] "cheesy" [...] and [...] "disconnected" [...] {{from the rest of the}} story. Coauthor Graeme Burk was also positive, writing that it may be [...] "the best story this season". He called the direction [...] "wonderful" [...] and the script [...] "sublime", and noted how the story was more about family than time travel.|$|E
500|$|A proclamation: In {{the markets}} {{of the city}} the profits from {{commerce}} are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while the little people from the rural villages {{are not allowed to}} sell their wares. There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this [...] "the boxing of the community family." [...] They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two {{at the end of the}} year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He must <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>something</b> to provoke this dispute. Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows, to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations.|$|E
