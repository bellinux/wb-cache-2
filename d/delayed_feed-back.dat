In partic-ular, the study of the catalytic CO oxidation leads to the Krischer-Eiswirth-Ertl model, a nonlinear parabolic system of three equations, which can be controlled by a <b>delayed</b> <b>feed-back</b> term. For the control of the uniform oscillations of the process we had already studied the correspondig delayed CGLE, developing first a pseudolinearization principle, of a very broad applicability, which led us to a range of parameters in which the stability of these uniform oscillations takes place. In this work we first present some numerical simulations which corfirm the mentioned range of parameters, and gives us also ranges of parameters for some other different behavior. Out of the setting of the CGLE, the dynamics of the process is much richer, so we also present another method {{for the study of the}} existence, uniqueness (based on monotony methods) stability (again with the pseudolinearization principle) and even approximation, directly for the mentioned parabolic system...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} several finite-horizon Bayesian multi-armed bandit problems with side constraints. These constraints include metric switching costs between arms, <b>delayed</b> <b>feed-back</b> about observations, concave reward functions over plays, and explore-then-exploit models. These problems {{do not have}} any known optimal (or near optimal) algorithms in sub-exponential running time; several of the variants are in fact computationally intractable (NP-Hard). All of these problems violate the exchange property that the reward from the play of an arm is not contingent upon when the arm is played. This separation of scheduling and accounting of the reward is critical to almost all known analysis techniques, and yet it does not hold even in fairly basic and natural setups which {{we consider}} here. Standard index policies are suboptimal in these contexts, there has been little analysis of such policies in these settings. We present a general solution framework that yields constant factor approximation algo-rithms for all the above variants. Our framework proceeds by formulating a weakly coupled linear programming relaxation, whose solution yields a collection of compact policies whose exe-cution is restricted to a single arm. These single-arm policies are made more structured to ensur...|$|E
40|$|Darbepoetin (DARB), a human {{erythropoietin}} {{with improved}} pharmacological parameters (longer half {{life and a}} dose-response relationship independent from the route of administration) is a new treatment option for chronic nephropathy-induced anemia that in many Italian dialysis centers is substituting older erythropoietins, mainly due to greater ease of use. At current prices and at the theoretical and recommended 200 : 1 dose conversion factor, DARB pharmaceutical cost ranges from – 9 % to + 17 % of EPO cost. In this monocentric study, real drug consumption and related actual costs of a pre-switch semester with EPO were analysed and compared to the first two post-switch semesters with DARB therapy. Furthermore, erythropoetic response was recorded and related to drug exposition levels, {{in order to establish}} a real life EPO:DARB dose conversion factor. In this experience, the conversion factor was estimated in at least 250 - 280 : 1, depending on the method adopted for the estimation. The initial dose, chosen {{on the basis of the}} recommended conversion factor, induced an excessive erythropoietic response, which was generally followed by a dose reduction and successive titration to target desired Hb levels, generating the spiraliform dose-response curve associated with <b>delayed</b> <b>feed-back</b> mechanisms. The pharmacoeconomical analysis, conducted in the perspective of the public health service, indicated that the choice of substituting DARB for EPO in the treatment of chronic kidney failure-associated anemia is univocally convenient, the former being less costly and more effective...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} visuo-manual pursuit tracking in 10 adult subjects. The {{main features}} of the experiments were as follows: (a) The targets to be pursued were planar trajectories. (b) Targets were based on actual human hand movements. A set of five different movements (scribbles) were rear-projected on a digitizing table. (c) Targets were presented both as originally recorded (Condition N) and after a numerical manipulation that made the tangential velocity constant (Condition T). Individual performances were analyzed to characterize both the features common to all subjects and the idiosyncratic differences. The main {{results of the study}} were as follows: (a) Performances are extremely consistent across repetitions. (b) The single most characteristic descriptor is the instantaneous delay between target and pursuit. (c) The operating strategy is significantly modified in Condition T. (d) A simple formal scheme based on the notion of a <b>delayed</b> velocity <b>feed-back</b> accounts quite accurately for the experimental results. This is in contrast with most classical models of pursuit tracking...|$|R
30|$|In brief, the {{innovative}} contributions {{of this article}} are the following. We develop closed-form and implementable solutions for the power allocation in a BD-based CBST system with realistic power constraints at the transmission side. These solutions are not empirical, but they are obtained, starting from the optimal allocation, using only few approximations {{that allow us to}} understand why they perform close to the optimum. In the case of per base station power constraints, one of our proposals gives the same result as SWF [10], while the others are new. We show also that our approaches reduce dramatically the complexity with respect to the optimal search. Moreover, we consider also the effect of errors in the channel estimation and of a time-varying channel, in which the use of outdated channel state information due to the <b>feed-back</b> <b>delay</b> reduces the achievable rates.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Response {{properties}} of short-type (RI- 6) photoreceptors of the blowfly (CaUiphora vicina) were investigated with intracellular recordings using repeated sequences of pseudorandomly modulated light contrast stimuli at adapting backgrounds covering 5 log intensity units. The resulting voltage responses {{were used to}} determine the effects of adaptational regulation on signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), signal induced noise, contrast gain, linearity and the dead time in phototransduction. In light adaptation the SNR of the photoreceptors improved more than 100 -fold due to (a) increased photoreceptor voltage responses to a contrast stimulus and (b) reduction of voltage noise at high intensity backgrounds. In the frequency domain the SNR was attenuated in low frequencies with an increase in the middle and high frequency ranges. A pseudorandom contrast stimulus by itself did not produce any additional noise. The contrast gain of the photoreceptor frequency responses increased with mean illumination and the gain was best fitted with a model consisting of two second order and one double pole of first order. The coherence function (a normalized measure of linearity and SNR) of the frequency responses demonstrated that the photoreceptors responded linearly (from 1 to 150 Hz) to the contrast stimuli even under fairly dim conditions. The theoretically derived and the recorded phase functions were used to calculate phototransduction dead time, which decreased in light adaptation from ~ 5 - 2. 5 ms. This analysis suggests that the ability of fly photoreceptors to maintain linear performance under dynamic stimulation conditions results from the high early gain followed by <b>delayed</b> compressive <b>feed-back</b> mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{analyzes}} {{bit error}} rate (BER) and outage probability of singular value decomposition-based multiple-input multiple-output systems with channel estimation error and <b>feed-back</b> <b>delay</b> over uncorrelated Ricean fading channels. By utilizing marginal unordered and ordered eigenvalue distributions of com-plex noncentral Wishart matrices, we derive exact closed-form expressions on the average system performance and high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) approximations on the individual eigen-subchannels, respectively, under the assumption of equal power allocation. Our expressions apply for various modulation formats and arbitrary numbers of transmit and receive antennas. Our results show that in low-to-moderate SINR regimes, both the BER and the outage probability increase with channel estimation error, feedback delay and the Ricean K-factor at a polynomial rate that is inversely proportional {{to the difference between}} the numbers of transmit and receive antennas. We also show that, with channel estimation error and feedback delay, the diversity orders of the BER and outage probability are zero and an irreducible error floor exists at high SINR.

40|$|Next {{generation}} wireless {{cellular radio}} systems are being {{designed to provide}} anytime, anywhere communication capabilities to serve a range of applications. The ability to support mobility is a key reason for the increasing demand for such systems. To accommodate this demand, efficient resource allocation schemes that can operate over the harsh wireless channel environment need to be devised. User mobility has a significant influence on the design and performance of these schemes. The focus of this dissertation is {{the analysis of the}} impact of mobility on such resource allocation schemes. What impact mobility has depends on the scheme under consideration. We first analyze the impact of user mobility on the performance of a link adaptation scheme that employs the recently proposed no-transmission mode. In this scheme, users adapt their modulation and coding for transmitting data packets based on their estimates of the link condition and suspend transmissions when link quality is very poor. Based on a simplified system model, we derive expressions for the system performance {{as a function of the}} basic, system-defining parameters. We show that for a stable system, the channel correlation, a function of user speed and <b>feed-back</b> <b>delay</b> of estimates, is an important factor that determines the optimal link adaptation thresholds. We then study a packet based multiple access scheme called Packet Reservation Multiple Access (PRMA), which can simultaneously handle the different traffic requirements of periodic, delay intolerant (voice) and bursty, delay tolerant (data) users. An approximate technique is developed to analyze the impact of user mobility as well as channel fading and interference-induced packet errors on PRMA. Both these effects lead to a premature loss of reservation and, consequently, more dropped packets for voice users. Finally, we look at dedicated channel assignment schemes that assign an entire channel to a user for the duration of his conversation. We investigate heuristic prediction based techniques that take into account mobility traffic statistics to modify the new call access criteria. This is done so as to introduce prioritization for hand-off requests in hitherto unprioritized channel assignment schemes...|$|R
