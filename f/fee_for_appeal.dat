5000|$|For {{an appeal}} to be admissible, amongst other requirements, notice of appeal must be filed at the EPO within two months of {{notification}} of the contested decision, and the <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> <b>appeal</b> must be paid. In addition, within four months of notification of the decision, a statement setting out the grounds of appeal (i.e., the appeal grounds) must be filed, which must contain the appellant's complete case. The appellant must also be adversely affected by the appealed decision. A party is only adversely affected by an appealed decision if {{the order of the}} appealed decision does not comply with its request (i.e. what the party requested during the first instance proceedings). For instance, when [...] "the order of the decision of the opposition division is the revocation of the patent, an opponent who requested revocation of the patent in its entirety is not [...] "adversely affected by" [...] said decision... irrespective of the reasons given in the decision." ...|$|E

40|$|Since the 70 ’s UK {{immigration}} law and procedure have changed significantly. Recent changes have limited the categories {{under which people}} may enter or remain in the UK, and, by way of procedural and other policy changes, {{made it more difficult}} for people to make applications or challenge refusals. Rights of appeal and access to appellate tribunals and courts have been reduced and even abolished. Application fees have increased and <b>fees</b> introduced <b>for</b> <b>appeals.</b> Because of the specific ways in which procedures and controls affecting migrants are delivered, access to appeals and public law remedies have become less effective. The specific statuses granted to migrants have been limited, and ‘routes’ to settlement and citizenship have been lengthened and for some categories excluded altogether. Migrants accepted into ‘routes’ to settlement face ever longer periods legally defined as ‘precarious’ before acquiring permanent residence. These changes have served to distance those migrants, and the processes to which they are subject, from standard norms of public administration. This paper explores aspects of immigration control contracted out to private bodies, and procedures in which private bodies and individuals are recruited to carry out immigration checks, in order to examine the nature of that distancing, and consider to what extent the rule of law can be said to apply in this new world in which the migrant is less and less a party to legal operations affecting them...|$|R
40|$|This Bachelor's thesis {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} study-related fees at public universities in the Czech Republic. The first theoretical part describes the function {{and the performance of}} a university. It also divides universities into different types by their characteristics. Furthermore, the concept of a fee is explored, which is the main point of the thesis. The thesis then explains the fee's components and functions, paying special attention to the types of study-related fees: admission-related <b>fees,</b> <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> exceeding the standard study period and the tuition <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> study in a foreign language. It also examines the charges, conditions under which they are assessed, and the procedure <b>for</b> <b>appeal</b> against the decree. The practical part compares the study-related fees at several public universities in the Czech Republic. The thesis includes a survey among students of University of economics in Prague, who already pay <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> exceeding the standard study period and focus on their views of the study-related fees at universities...|$|R

50|$|Individual litigants are {{expected}} to almost always face reductions in {{the costs associated with}} pursuing their cases whenever a switch to the CCJ is made. For instance the cost of filing an appeal with the JCPC is more than five times greater than filing an appeal with the CCJ. For the JCPC, the filing of an application <b>for</b> permission to <b>appeal</b> along with the actual notice of appeal would have cost £220, or roughly US$350 in 2013, while the CCJ requires no payment for filing an application <b>for</b> permission to <b>appeal</b> and the cost for filing a notice of appeal was US$60. In 2015, the new filing <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> the JCPC were noted as ranging from between £400 to a £5,000 or roughly US$600 to US$7,500 while the comparable <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> the CCJ remained at US$60 thus making the cost of filing an appeal with the JCPC at least ten times greater than filing an appeal with the CCJ.|$|R

40|$|To {{what degree}} are audit <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> U. S. firms with {{publicly}} traded equity higher than <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> otherwise similar firms with private equity? The answer is potentially important for evaluating regulatory regime design efficiency and for understanding audit demand and production economics. For U. S. firms with publicly traded debt, we hold constant the regulatory regime, including mandated issuer reporting and auditor responsibilities. We vary equity ownership and thus public securities market contextual factors, including any related public firm audit fees from increased audit {{effort to reduce}} audit litigation risk and/or pure litigation risk premium (litigation channel effects). In cross-section, we find that audit <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> public equity firms are 20 - 22 % higher than <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> otherwise similar private equity firms. Time-series comparisons for firms that change ownership status yield larger percentage <b>fee</b> increases (decreases) <b>for</b> those going public (private). Results are consistent with litigation channel effects giving rise to substantial incremental audit <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> U. S. firms with public equity ownership...|$|R
