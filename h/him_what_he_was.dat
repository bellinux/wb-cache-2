5|$|Morrison {{entered a}} {{classroom}} {{on the second}} floor, room 206, where teacher Sandra Smith taught Honors English. When Smith asked <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing in the classroom, {{he pulled out his}} handgun and ordered her, all of the male students, and several female students to leave. He then fired one shot into the air after Smith tried to speak to him again. After Smith and the male students left the classroom, Morrison instructed the seven remaining students to stand facing the chalkboard. He later released one student at approximately 12:15 p.m., before law enforcement arrived at the scene.|$|E
25|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Moutardier found Reid leaning {{over in his}} seat, and unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to get his attention. After she asked <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match. He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the TATP and prevented it from igniting.|$|E
25|$|When {{he came to}} a {{cave and}} lodged there, God asked <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing there. Elijah said that he had been moved by zeal for God, as the Israelites had forsaken God's covenant, thrown down God's altars, and killed God's prophets, leaving only Elijah, and they sought to kill him, too. God told Elijah to stand on the mount, and God passed by. A great wind rent the mountains, and broke the rocks in pieces, but God was not in the wind. Then an {{earthquake}} came, but God was not in the earthquake. Then a fire came, but God was not in the fire. And then came a still small voice, which asked <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing there. Elijah repeated that he had been moved by zeal for God, as the Israelites had forsaken God's covenant, thrown down God's altars, and killed God's prophets, leaving only Elijah, and they sought to kill him, too. God told him to go to Damascus and anoint Hazael to be king over Aram, to anoint Jehu to be king over Israel, and to anoint Elisha to succeed Elijah as prophet. God foretold that any who escaped the sword of Hazael would be killed by Jehu; any who escaped the sword of Jehu would be killed by Elisha; and God would leave alive in Israel only the 7 thousand who had not bowed to Baal. So Elijah found Elisha, who was plowing with one of his 12 yoke of oxen, and Elijah cast his mantle on Elisha. Elisha left the oxen, asked Elijah for permission to kiss his parents goodbye, killed the oxen and distributed their meat to the people, and went to follow Elijah.|$|E

25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} a heretic once asked Rabbi Akiva {{who created the}} world. Rabbi Akiva {{answered}} that God had. The heretic demanded that Rabbi Akiva give him clear proof. Rabbi Akiva asked <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> wearing. The heretic {{said that it was}} a garment. Rabbi Akiva asked him who made it. The heretic replied that a weaver had. Rabbi Akiva demanded that the heretic give him proof. The heretic asked Rabbi Akiva whether he did not realize that a garment is made by a weaver. Rabbi Akiva replied by asking the heretic whether he did not realize that the world was made by God. When the heretic had left, Rabbi Akiva's disciples asked him to explain his proof. Rabbi Akiva replied that just as a house implies a builder, a dress implies a weaver, and a door implies a carpenter, so the world proclaims the God who created it.|$|E
500|$|According to Gribbin, Madonna {{approached}} Oakenfold, asking <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{working on}} {{and whether he}} {{would be interested in}} sending her some material for which she could write lyrics. Oakenfold, along with Green and Gribbin had been working on new tracks for Oakenfold's upcoming album. They sent fifteen of those tracks to Madonna. She chose [...] "Broken" [...] and [...] "Celebration" [...] from them. Then Oakenfold, Gribbin and Green developed the chord structure, arranged the backing track and added guitars, keyboards and drums. Madonna then wrote the lyrics and melody based on this backing track.|$|E

One of the co-sponsors of the resolution, Senator Lindsey Graham, stated that, [...] "When you get 100 million Americans looking at something, you will get our attention.

500|$|Unknown to Bakshi, Krantz and {{producer}} Al Guest {{were in the}} middle of a lawsuit. Failing to reach a settlement with Guest, Krantz told Bakshi to grab the series' model sheets and return to the United States. When the studio found out, a warrant for Bakshi's arrest was issued by the Toronto police. He narrowly avoided capture before being stopped by an American border guard who asked <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing. Bakshi responded, [...] "All of these guys are heading into Canada to dodge the draft and I'm running back into the States. What the fuck is wrong with that!?" [...] The guard laughed, and let Bakshi through. Vita was detained at the airport; he was searched and interrogated for six hours.|$|E
500|$|The Season Eight DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Robert complimenting Jim and Pam's marriage and admitting his desire to share in their love, which the two take as a metaphorical compliment, Jim receiving a text from Robert asking him if Pam and he are free at 10 the following Friday which causes the two to think that California literally {{wants to be a}} part of their relationship, Pam trying to reassure Jim that Robert's odd behavior is a figment of their imagination, and Robert calling off the get-together due to this resignation as CEO of Sabre. Jim, out of curiosity, asks <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> planning, to which he replies [...] "a three-way".|$|E
500|$|When Shaw {{arrived at}} the set for filming, he ran into his friend Ian McDiarmid, the actor playing Emperor Palpatine. When McDiarmid asked <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing there, Shaw responded, [...] "I don't know, dear boy, I think it's {{something}} to do with science-fiction." [...] His presence during the filming was kept secret from all but the minimum cast and crew, and Shaw was contractually obliged not to discuss any film secrets with anyone, even his family. The unmasking scene, directed by Richard Marquand, was filmed in one day and required only a few takes, with no alteration from the original dialogue. When the film was re-released on DVD in 2004, a few changes were made: the unmasking scene with Hamill remained mostly the same, but Shaw's eyebrows were digitally removed to tie in with the injuries Anakin Skywalker suffers at the end of [...] Shaw's eyes were also digitally coloured to look like those of Hayden Christensen, the actor who played Anakin in [...] and Revenge of the Sith.|$|E

500|$|Stationed on {{the border}} with France, Bär {{achieved}} his first victory—a Curtiss P-36 Hawk—on 25 September 1939 during the Phoney War air skirmishes with the Armée de l'Air (French air force), earning him the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 27 September 1939. During the Battle of France, he was credited with two more aerial victories before adding a further 10 during the Battle of Britain. During this time, he had several emergency landings in badly damaged aircraft and was shot down over the English Channel on 2 September 1940 by a Spitfire. Bär was summoned to appear before Hermann Göring and report on this battle. When Göring asked <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> thinking about while in the water, Bär immediately replied, [...] "Your speech, Herr Reichsmarschall, in which you said that England is no longer an island!", alluding to an address that Göring had made before the German fighter pilots. Incidents like this are testimony to his often blatant disregard for higher authority. His outspokenness frequently landed him in trouble with Göring. In early 1941, he was credited with an additional four aerial victories against the Royal Air Force (RAF), bringing his total to 17.|$|E
500|$|At {{the meeting}} of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a {{solution}} to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the Château de Blois. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died {{at the foot of the}} king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, [...] "Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to do to me." [...] Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, [...] "Oh, wretched man! What has he done?... Pray for him... I see him rushing towards his ruin." [...] She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was sure he would soon be freed. He shouted at her, [...] "Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery."

2500|$|Noting that [...] calls Noah [...] "a man," [...] a Midrash {{taught that}} {{wherever}} Scripture employs the term [...] "a man," [...] it indicates a righteous man who warned his generation.

When {{they would ask}} <b>him</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, he would reply that God had informed him that God was bringing a flood. Noah's contemporaries replied that if a flood did come, it would come only on Noah's father's house. Rabbi Abba taught that God said that one herald arose for God in the generation of the Flood — Noah. But they despised him and called him a contemptible old man.|$|E

He made good his promise the next day and, after overwhelming all the Persians who were game enough to fight him, he commenced punching the air, just to show that [...] "he had all those blows left if anyone wanted to take him on." [...] However, the boorishness and gluttony of athletes was a topos of Greek comedy and even a hero like Hercules was the butt of many jokes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{symbolism}} of the scallop shell is multiple. Saint Augustine {{is said to have}} been walking along the seashore, meditating on the unfathomable mystery of the Holy Trinity.

Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church, and the shell therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church.|$|E
