5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the time they were <b>first</b> <b>brought</b> from the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E

5|$|Jacques Cartier <b>first</b> <b>brought</b> cabbage to the Americas in 1541–42, {{and it was}} {{probably}} planted by the early English colonists, {{despite the lack of}} written evidence of its existence there until the mid-17th century.

It became a favorite vegetable of Australians by the 1830s and was frequently seen at the Sydney Markets.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce {{appears in}} many medieval writings, {{especially}} as a medicinal herb. Hildegard of Bingen mentioned {{it in her}} writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses.

Lettuce was <b>first</b> <b>brought</b> to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century. Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland. Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.|$|E

The infection subsequently reached England following the importation of cattle from the continent. At the time rinderpest was a devastating disease with a mortality rate of 80–90%. The resulting loss of cattle caused famine.|$|E
