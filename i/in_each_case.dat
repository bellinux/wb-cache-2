Hack had performed significant searches at several markets to find an optimal model. Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed and evaluated the entire inventory of lemons at Fortnum and Mason’s, Selfridges, Harrods and Covent Garden, the latter of which involved examining three cases of lemons that contained around 300 lemons <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
