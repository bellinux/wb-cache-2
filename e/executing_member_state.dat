40|$|In {{the context}} of EU extension, the main way to prevent and fight against crime of all kinds is {{represented}} by the intensification in the specific activities of judicial cooperation in criminal mattersin all member states, based on a legislation anchored in the present realities. The most important form of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, based on mutual confidence in the decision taken by the competent judicial organisms is, in our opinion, the recognition and execution of foreign criminal decisions and judicial acts. One {{of the ways in which}} this type of cooperation is accomplished {{is represented by the}} mutual recognition and monitoring of suspended sentences, sentences with postponement of execution of the conviction, alternative penalties and decisions on probation, that have the purpose of increasing the chances for social reintegration of the convicted person. Recognizing and executing such an injunction in another member state than the one in which the conviction was established imposes, for the <b>executing</b> <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> the necessity of taking the most efficient measures for each singular case. The critical examination of the dispositions of the Council’s Decision Frame 2008 / 947 /JAI, that regulates this procedure, as well as the special internal law leas to the conclusion of the existence of provisions that are at least debatable and the necessity of urgent transposition of theEuropean normative act’s provisions in our internal legislation...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} and subsequently {{the execution of}} criminal penalties of deprivation of liberty byanother Member State, {{other than the one}} of the conviction, is an act of mutual trust between Member Statesof the European Union. However, the differences between criminal legal norms, particularly regarding theminimum and maximum limits of some punishment prescribed for the same offense, require a differentapproach in the sense that a member can not recognize and then enforce a sentence of deprivation of libertywith the maximum limits greater than its own legislation, for the same offense. This very sensitive issue wasresolved by adopting the Framework Decision 2008 / 909 /JHA of the Council from 27 November 2008, wherethe European legislative act allows the <b>executing</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> the re-individualization of the deprivation ofliberty sentence, the goal being that the penalty imposed is compatible with the internal law of theenforcement state. In the implementation of European legislative act depositions, any member State whichhas recognized such a court order, based on a legal decision ordered by a competent judicial body may stillre-individualize the penalty regarding its maximum limit. The examination of the European legislative acthighlights also some flaws that must be corrected, taking into account the possibility for the executingMember States to fully modify the applied punishment, as regards both its nature and its proportion applied inthe sentencing State...|$|E
40|$|Knowing {{that the}} European Union, as an union of {{sovereign}} states, was {{incorporated in the}} form of an international organization with competences higher than the state’s, seeing also that it has international legal personality, being a subject of international law, the sovereign of its States had suffered a substantial decrease. The European Union has the legal capacity to conclude treaties (ius tractum), to maintain relations and to be represented in its relations with the other international law subjects; having its own identity, it is one of the members of the international society that has a common exterior policy and security; at the same time, its obligations are opposed to the other <b>member</b> <b>states</b> that it has to comply with and <b>execute.</b> Consequently, <b>member</b> <b>states</b> maintain their sovereignty, being always subjects of international law, but their legal capacity to act at international level has been restricted. These states have a special status. EU is an union of sovereign states. The relations between EU and these <b>member</b> <b>states</b> are of special subordination nature for the latter (especially for the states that have been already collectivized); the Union undertakes on their behalf (any treaty that goes through the Union obliges the states; coexistence on the international stage of the Union with <b>member</b> <b>states</b> supposes a common exterior policy that is established at the level of the Union. <b>Member</b> <b>states</b> may conclude treaties with third party states and with international organizations to the extent in which this competence does not belong exclusively to the Union and to the extent of these treaties compatibility with their obligations undertaken as a member of the Union.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{appliance}} of non-custodial penalties, completed by the necessity of respecting the measures of surveillance and/or certain obligations imposed by the court, is to ensure the re-socialization and reintegration into the community to which they belong. In this context, at the European Union’s level it was adopted 2008 / 947 /JHA Framework Decision of the Council on 27 November 2008 regarding the appliance of mutual recognition principle {{in the case of}} judgments and probation decisions for supervising the probation measures and alternative sanctions. The most important criterion under which judicial decision can be transmitted to another Member State is referring to the convicted person residency, considering that adopting such a measure the chances of social reintegration of the sentenced person will increase, allowing them to preserve the family, linguistic, cultural links. The probation service has a critical role for community supervision of the measures and obligations imposed by the Romanian court to the sentenced person. This institution has a number of specific tasks even when the Romanian court sends the legal judgment accompanied by the certificate in another Member State, seeking its recognition and enforcement. These responsibilities relate in particular to the cooperation activity that needs to be carried out with similarauthority of the <b>executing</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State,</b> since it can always intervene the possibility of restoring the competence of executing the decision of the Romanian court.

European {{arrest warrant}} {{is the first}} and the most {{frequently}} used legal instrument in the European Union based on the mutual recognition principle. Framework decision 2002 / 584 /JHA marks the starting point {{in the development of a}} simplified EU wide system of cooperation in criminal matters. Successful functioning of EAW system (as well as the whole mutual recognition based system) is dependent on the level of mutual trust between the issuing and the <b>executing</b> <b>member</b> <b>state.</b> More than 10 years of EAW application in practice has shown that in a standard situation priority is more likely to be given to the mutual trust rather than to a proper safeguarding of human rights. This has led to numerous situations in various member states in which EAWs have been issued when it was clearly unnecessary and disproportionate. The recent developments of the EU criminal and criminal procedure law have clearly shown that an increased amount of attention is being paid to proper safeguarding of essential rights of a person who is being faced with criminal justice system. Since there are no unified standards to be equally applied throughout the EU there is a need for individual assessment of each situation in order to stay in compliance with basic human rights. Such an evaluation is exclusively important during the application of EAW since a person experiences the most restrictive coercive measures – usually, a detention. Proportionality test in the EAW procedure is the key which guarantees that the instrument will be applied in compliance with the essential human rights. However, the prevailing approach to this question is that the proportionality check can and must be done only during the issuing of EAW. The executing state is excluded from the evaluation of the proportionality. This article analyse the nature and specifics of the proportionality test identifies the stages of its application and suggests the criteria to be evaluated during the test. Authors support the idea that the proportionality check must be carried out not only during the issuing stage, but also during the execution of EAW. Such a perspective is based on the direction which is apparent in the recent EU legislation based on mutual recognition principle (mostly – Directive on the European Investigation Order), practical experience of several member states and developments of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. The proportionality test, suggested by authors, includes a wide range of material and procedural criteria. The set of criteria to be evaluated differs depending on an individual case and its specific circumstances. Thorough proportionality check during the whole process of EAW application is an option which can increase the level of procedural safeguards of an individual until criminal procedure rules are unified in the EU...|$|E
