40|$|International audienceA {{child with}} plexiform <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> is presented, in whom a {{superficial}} biopsy was misdiagnosed as an inflammatory granuloma. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a 46,X,del(X) (q 13) [3]/ 46,XX[23] karyotype. However, fluorescence {{in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis failed to detect any numerical or quantitative genomic anomaly.

40|$|Plexiform <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> is an {{uncommon}} mesenchymal tumor {{that can cause}} difficulty in diagnosis and surgical management. On clinical and histologic examination, these tumors can potentially be misdiagnosed as sebaceous/epidermal cysts. We report a case of plexiform <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> in a young female, which on initial clinical evaluation was diagnosed as sebaceous cyst. The tumor was deeply invasive, with positive margins on two excisional biopsy specimens. The importance of recognition of this entity, potential pitfalls and prognosis are discussed and the literature is reviewed...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{chemokine}} receptors {{are expressed}} in many malignant tumors. These receptors promote tumor growth and metastasis in response to endogenous chemokines. We analyzed the expression of CXCR 4, CCR 6 and CCR 7 in <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumors,</b> including dermatofibrosarcoma protuberance (DFSP), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), dermatofibroma (DF) using immunohistochemistry. We also investigated the relationship between CXCR 4 and CD 34, the latter of which is an immunohistochemical marker for DFSP. We observed a higher expression of CXCR 4 in DFSP and MFH as compared with DF. Interestingly, a significantly higher expression of CXCR 4 was detected in relapsed DFSP than in non-relapsed DFSP, but {{no significant differences were}} detected between non-relapsed DFSP and DFSP with CD 34 immunostaining. Moreover, MFH had strong immunoreactivity for CXCR 4, CCR 6 and CCR 7. These findings suggest that the assessment of CXCR 4 immunoreactivity in <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumors</b> is a useful tool for predicting tumor aggressiveness...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHemosiderotic <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> lipomatous <b>tumors</b> {{are rare}} {{neoplasms}} that were first described in 2000. Initially considered a benign lipotamous lesion {{of the soft}} tissues, nowadays they {{are considered to be}} a locally aggressive tumor. They occur mainly in the foot and ankle of women in their fifth and sixth decades, although they may be found in any place in the lower limbs and, more rarely, {{in other parts of the}} body. Histologically, hemosiderotic <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> lipomatous <b>tumors</b> consist of a mixture of mature adipose tissue, fusiform cell fascicles, macrophages that often contain cytoplasmic hemosiderin, mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate, and stroma that may be focally myxoid. Local recurrence is observed in nearly one-third of all cases. There is no consensus in the literature whether this tumor is a part of a spectrum that comprises pleomorphic hyalinizing angiectatic tumors and myxoinflammatory fibroblastic malignant tumors, or if it is an independent entity. The authors report a case of a neoplasia after a diagnosis of a hemosiderotic <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> lipomatous <b>tumor</b> in a 38 -year-old woman, with two recurrences and later sarcomatous transformation. An immunohistochemical study indicated myofibroblastic differentiation of a malignant neoplasm. To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, there are only few reported cases of malignant transformation in hemosiderotic <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> lipomatous <b>tumors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Myxoid neurothekeoma {{is a rare}} benign {{cutaneous}} neoplasm {{of nerve}} sheath origin. It usually arise in childhood and early adult life. It can occur in skin, soft tissue or intraspinal location. Most commonly involves head, neck and shoulder. This rare tumor is misdiagnosed as other more common benign neuronal tumors. It should be distinguished from certain malignant <b>tumors</b> like <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumors</b> or plexiform cell tumors, neurotrophic melanomas and clear cell sarcoma. This case report describes a rare case of neurothekeoma presenting as scalp swelling in a 29 year old female. Clinically, it was diagnosed as sebaceous cyst. Hence {{it is important to}} be aware of this entity to avoid misdiagnosis. Key words: Neurothekeoma, benign neoplasm, nerve sheath origin...|$|R
40|$|Cystic <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> of {{the lung}} {{is a rare}} neoplasm. In many cases it {{represents}} a metastasis from a benign or low-grade <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> of the skin, but occasionally it may be primary. Radiologically it usually occurs as a cystic change of multiple pulmonary nodules, and pneumothorax is the most frequent presenting symptom. We present here a 16 -year-old man with recurrent right pneumothorax. The patient had no history of cutaneous fibrohistiocytic lesions. He underwent videothoracoscopic right apical segmentectomy, right lower lobe nodulectomy, and pleuroabrasion. Microscopy of the apical segmentectomy showed a cystic <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor,</b> whereas the nodule of the lower lobe was an intraparenchymal lymph node. The patient is alive with no tumor recurrence. The differential diagnosis includes Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, pleuropulmonary blastoma, and metastatic endometrial stromal sarcoma. This disease usually occurs with multiple pulmonary cysts and cavitation. This case is the first reported presenting as a single lesion...|$|E
40|$|Plexiform <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> is an {{intermediate}} malignant tumor situated in superficial soft tissues. It affects {{children and young}} adults. The tumor is most commonly located on upper extremities, whereas involvement of back region is rare. Mitotic activity is generally low (~ 3 / 10 HPF). It is rare, but it can exhibit aggressive behavior, so total excision with clear surgical margins and long-term followup is necessary to detect local recurrence and metastases. We report {{a child with a}} solid mass on back region which was found to be a mitotically active plexiform <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> (6 / 10 HPF) after excision. Plexiform <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> (PFT) is a mesenchymal neoplasm of children, adolescents, and young adults. It is characterized by fibrohistiocytic cytomorphology and multinodular growth pattern. Clinically it is usually a slow-growing mass of upper extremities with frequent local recurrence and rare regional lymphatic and systemic metastasis (Fletcher et al. (2002), Enzinger and Zhang (1988), Remstein et al. (1999)) ...|$|E
40|$|Background. Plexiform <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> is a {{distinctive}} mesenchymal neoplasm of low-grade malignancy, {{with the capacity}} for biphasic differentiation toward a fibroblastic or histiocyte-like morphology. Clinically, these lesions affect {{different areas of the}} body and appear as painless, slowly growing, dermal or subcutaneous masses. To date, only three cases of myxoid variant {{have been reported in the}} English literature. Case Presentation. A 45 -year-old female patient presented with a subcutaneous nodule in the right popliteal fossa. The initial impression was a benign ganglion cyst. The soft tissue tumor has been treated by local excision. The histopathological and the immunohistochemical findings supported the diagnosis of myxoid plexiform <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor.</b> The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient received regular follow-up examination. She is alive without any recurrence. Conclusions. This case demonstrates how to distinguish this distinctive plexiform <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> from other problematic soft tissue tumors. It is also remarkable for its rarely reported extensive myxoid change. Currently, there is no clear-cut correlation between the clinicopathologic findings and the behavior of this unusual variant...|$|E
40|$|Expression of S 100 A 6 {{protein in}} a broad {{spectrum}} of cutaneous tumors using tissue microarrays Background: S 100 A 6, a calcium-binding protein in the S 100 family, has been observed in melanocytic nevi, neural <b>tumors,</b> <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumors</b> and is overexpressed in melanoma. Previous studies reported S 100 A 6 expression in atypical fibroxanthomas (AFX) but not in a small number of desmoplastic melanomas (DM). Limited data on S 100 A 6 expression in cutaneous epithelial tumors exists in the literature. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the specificity and sensitivity of S 100 A 6 protein in a spectrum of cutaneous mesenchymal or epithelial tumors. Methods: Tissue microarrays of cutaneous epithelial neoplasms, mesenchymal neoplasms, DM and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) were stained with S 100 A 6 antibody. Results: Eleven basal cell carcinomas (BCC) failed to express S 100 A 6, whereas all 10 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) expressed S 100 A 6. Four of seven microcystic adnexal carcinomas (MAC) stained for S 100 A 6. Tumors with duct differentiation variously expressed S 100 A 6 protein, with two hidradenomas showing the strongest staining. Malignant spindle cell tumors, with the exception of 13 of 30 MPNST, had a high incidence of S 100 A 6 positivity. Conclusions: S 100 A 6 expression may distinguish SCC from BCC, MAC from BCC and hidradenoma from other adnexal tumors. S 100 A 6 expression favors DM over MPNST but overlap limits its diagnostic use. Fullen DR, Garrisi AJ, Sanders D, Thomas D.

40|$|Dermatofibromas are benign, <b>fibrohistiocytic,</b> dermal <b>tumors.</b> Solitary dermatofibromas may be {{incidental}} findings, whereas multiple dermatofibromas may {{be associated}} with systemic conditions or previous therapies. Two women and one man with multiple dermatofibromas and an associated systemic condition, immunosuppression, or both, are described. Nine dermatofibromas developed in a woman with hypothyroidism, optic neuritis, and Arnold Chiari I malformation. Five dermatofibromas developed in a woman with breast cancer who had received several systemic antineoplastic therapies. Eleven dermatofibromas developed in a man with HIV whose systemic therapies included acyclovir, darunavir/cobicistat, dolutegravir, etravirine, and ritonavir. Conditions associated with multiple dermatofibromas include autoimmune diseases, cancer, chromosomal abnormalities, immunodeficiencies, metabolic disturbances, and altered physiologic states such as pregnancy. Medications received by patients with multiple dermatofibromas included immunosuppressive agents, psoriasis therapies, and antineoplastic drugs. Multiple dermatofibromas can be observed in patients with associated medical conditions, systemic therapies, or both. Therefore, in individuals presenting with multiple dermatofibromas, not only evaluation for associated disorders, but also review of prior and current drug therapies, should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Desmoplastic {{melanoma}} {{represents a}} variant of melanoma {{that is difficult to}} diagnose because 71 % of patients have amelanotic skin lesions. In the acral region of the limbs, the clinical diagnosis is more difficult, especially in cases in which there are not clear, rapidly growing, pigmented nail streaks. Histopathological identification of desmoplastic melanoma is confusing because of the intense fibrous reaction in the dermis and minimal, atypical melanocytic proliferation at the dermal-epidermal junction. For these reasons, it is still misdiagnosed unfortunately as a variety of entities, including simple scar, <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> neoplasms, neural <b>tumors,</b> and superficial fibromatoses-with potentially devastating consequences. In equivocal cases, the use of immunohistochemistry (in particular S- 100 and neuron-specific enolase) may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Because of the high local recurrence rate for desmoplastic melanoma of the finger, amputation is recommended in an effort to gain effective tumor control. Lymph node dissection may be reserved for patients with positive axillary nodes...|$|R

40|$|Total RNA was {{extracted}} from five malignant fibrous histiocytomas and two benign fibrohistiocytic lesions and assayed for mRNA expressions for transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) and c-sis by Northern blot analysis.

40|$|A plexiform <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> (PFT) {{is a rare}} mesenchymal {{neoplasm}} primarily {{occurring in}} children and young adults.

We report a 17 -year-old girl presenting with a nasal root tumor and concurrent cervical lymphadenopathy. Light microscopy and immunohistochemical findings were compatible with a PFT, for both the nasal root tumor and the cervical lymph nodes. Under the diagnostic impression of a PFT with neck lymph node metastasis, the patient underwent wide excision of the primary tumor and cervical lymph node dissection, followed by concurrent chemo-radiotherapy.

40|$|Dermatofibroma is {{a common}} benign <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> and its {{diagnosis}} is easy when it presents classical clinicopathological features.

Clinical dermal atrophy {{is a common}} phenomenon in dermatofibromas as demonstrated by the dimpling on lateral pressure. However, this feature is exaggerated in the atrophic variant of dermatofibroma. Atrophic dermatofibroma is defined by dermal atrophy of more than 50 % of the lesion apart from the usual features of common dermatofibroma. The keloidal variant of dermatofibroma should not be overlooked as a simple keloid.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionCellular fibrohistiocytoma (CFH) {{is a type}} of <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> that {{commonly}} {{occurs in}} the dermis and superficial subcutis.

40|$|Two {{uncommon}} {{cases of}} dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans with prominent myxoid changes are presented. The tumors appeared as large multinodular cutaneous plaques that arose at {{the sites of}} excision of previous tumors some years earlier. In addition to limited fibrous storiform features, focally observed in deep and peripheral portions of the tumors, a diffuse myxoid pattern could be observed. The latter consisted of homogeneous areas of rare, stellate or spindle-shaped cells, haphazardly scattered in abundant myxoid matrix. Cells of myxoid neoplastic tissue showed mainly a positive immunoreaction for fibrohistocytic markers and the absence either of muscular, neural or human progenitor cell antigens. Mitotic figures were fewer and cell proliferation rates were lower in myxoid as compared to those of typical dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans used as a control. The ultrastructural examination of myxoid areas revealed a prevalent fibroblast-like cell population showing dilated cytoplasmic vesicles, sometimes containing glycosaminoglycans-like substances. The extent of myxoid changes together with the characteristic morphological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features confirm that myxoid dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a distinct variant of this <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> {{to be considered in}} the differential diagnosis among myxoid tumors of the skin...|$|E
40|$|Inflammatory pseudotumors (IPs), mostly benign lesions {{characterized}} by fibrotic ground tissue and polyclonal mononuclear infiltrate, may affect all organ systems. IPs {{originating in the}} central nervous system (IP-CNS) are very rare, and their distinct histopathologic features are poorly characterized. Three otherwise healthy patients (age 8, 15, and 17 years) presented with focal neurologic symptoms (seizures, n = 2; headaches, n = 1), corresponding to a left temporal, left occipital, and left frontal IP, respectively, extending from meningeal structures into brain tissue. After resection, no recurrence was observed in patient 1 during 5 years of follow-up, whereas patient 2 developed a rapidly progressive local recurrence and a second intracerebral lesion despite antiviral, immunosuppressive, antibiotic, and radiation therapy. In patient 3, who also showed local recurrences, sequential histopathologic investigations revealed transformation to a semimalignant <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor.</b> In this patient, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) expression was also positive, whereas it was negative in patient 1. A detailed literature analysis confirmed that most IP-CNS arise from dural/meningeal structures (n = 34). Intraparenchymatous (n = 7), mixed intraparenchymatous/meningeal (n = 4), and intraventricular lesions (n = 7) or IP extending per continuitatem from intracerebral to extracerebral sites (n = 5) were rare. The recurrence rate was 40 % within 2 years in general. It was increased after incomplete resection and in female patients (multivariate Cox regression model, P < 0. 02). Although rare, IP-CNS are important differential diagnoses among tumor-like intracranial lesions. Their potential risk of malignant transformation and high risk of recurrence necessitate close follow-up, especially when resection is incomplete. Prospective multicenter trials are needed to optimize classification and treatment of this rare inflammatory lesion. Copyright 2003, Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|To the Editor: Dermatofibroma is {{the most}} common <b>fibrohistiocytic</b> <b>tumor</b> of the skin and one of the benign neoplasias that gener-ates most visits to the dermatologist. It usually {{presents}} as an isolated lesion and rarely occurs as multiple lesions. The term multiple dermatofibroma is defined either as the appearance of at least 15 dermatofibromas within a few months 1 or, more recently, as 5 to 8 dermatofibromas in 4 months. 2 In 1984, DuprÃ© et al 3 described another form of presentation that is far less common: multiple clustered dermatofibromas. We report a new case of this rare condi-tion. A 25 -year-old woman was seen in our department for small, erythematous papular lesions, with a dark center and paler borders, and asymptomatic, residual hyperpigmented macules in smaller numbers, all located on the medial sur-face of the right thigh. The lesions had appeared at 1 year of age, increased in number and size over 2 to 3 months, and subsequently remained stable except for partial remission of isolated lesions (Fig. 1). The patient reported no general or local history of interest. She brought a magnetic reso-nance imaging scan that had been performed previously to rule out lymphangioma and that showed no atrophy of the adipose tissue or muscle, and no other relevant alterations. Biopsy of a lesion revealed epidermal hyperplasia and a proliferation of spindle cells arranged in fascicles or whorls interspersed in bundles of thickened collagen in the underly-ing reticular dermis (Fig. 2). Immunohistochemistry showed an intense, diffuse expression of vimentin and factor XIIIa. Smooth muscle actin, muscle-specific actin, and CD 34 were negative. After histopathological confirmation of the diag-nosis of dermatofibroma, it was decided to follow up the patient but to apply no treatment. We have found 13 cases of multiple clustered der-matofibromas described in the literature, the majority of which were reported in the review by Gershtenson. 4 There Please cite this article as: Castellanos-GonzÃ¡lez M, et al.
