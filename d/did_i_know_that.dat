2500|$|The famous Old English riddle Ic wæs be Sonde {{describes}} a conch: [...] "I was by sound, near seawall, at ocean-stream; I dwelt {{alone in my}} first resting place... Little <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I, ere or since, ever should speak mouthless over mead-benches." [...] Another meaning given to this riddle [...] "Ic wæs be Sonde" [...] is that {{the sound of the}} conch corresponds to spiritualised sound as heard in higher realms. In the Hindu tradition, the conch shell is used in ceremony as the sound it makes is said to correspond with higher frequency universal sounds associated with music of the spheres.|$|E
2500|$|Alderman {{was injured}} in the first test of the 1982-83 Ashes. He had taken 1-84 in the first innings {{when there was a}} pitch invasion. Alderman was hit {{in the back of the}} head by a member of the crowd, Gary Donnison. Alderman recalled, [...] "he ran off, and I could see that there were no police in the {{vicinity}} so I attempted to apprehend him." [...] Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. [...] "I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed," [...] Alderman said. [...] "At the time I thought it would just pop back in - little <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it would be a year before I could bowl in a competitive match again," [...] he said. [...] "I had to learn to swim a mile a day for eight months. What is tough in sport, is that if you have a physical injury or problem, no one wants to know you. In a way, when I came back, it was like starting another career." ...|$|E

6000|$|Again: [...] "I fancy that God {{ought to}} be good. But how <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> He really is good? I see the world full of injustice, and misery, and death. How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> this is not God's doing, God's fault in some way?" ...|$|R

2500|$|... "At 12 noon on the {{eleventh}} {{day of the}} Fifth Month, my train from Hangchow arrived at the North Station Shanghai. In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with me. As soon as I {{came out of the}} train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I did not realize that they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. Little <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and we were off like a shot. In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E

"'Twould make my griefs still heavier, <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> one who {{has shown}} so much courage in my behalf, has equal reason to feel their justice," [...] {{returned}} Violetta, quickly.

6000|$|... "'Ptarth'?" [...] {{repeated}} the man. [...] "'Helium'?" [...] He shook his head. [...] "I never {{have heard of}} these places, nor <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there dwelt upon Barsoom a race of thy strange colour. Where may these cities lie, of which you speak?

Her father, for all I knew to the contrary, {{might be the}} model of what a retired sea-captain should be; with {{possibly}} a snug little sum safely invested somewhere. And Juliana was his only child. What reason had I for rejecting this fair young creature's love for Josiah? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well; but how <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you're the man {{represented}} in that letter? Pancho Robles may <b>know</b> you, but <b>I</b> don't." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You shall come on deck if you will, Inez, {{when they}} get close alongside.

"Señora, the question, {{like its}} motive, is {{altogether}} new to me; I have the utmost {{reliance on the}} honor of the count, and then <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> his heart hath long been given to the fairest and worthiest damsel of Spain; besides, my mind hath been so much occupied with the grave subjects of your Highness' interests, that it hath had but little opportunity to dwell on minor things." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Master of Rosebury and Mr. Harris {{went out}} {{presently}} {{to look at}} a horse which was waiting the former's inspection in the stableyard of the hotel. The landlord took advantage of his business, to hear a bell which never was rung, and to ask me questions about the guest who had been staying at his house for a week past. <b>Did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> party? Mr. Pendennis said, [...] "Yes, he knew that party." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a sad}} {{task for}} me, Eric!" [...] she sighed, [...] "for how <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Baresark's hands shall not loose this helm of thine?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'But <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>know!</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{ask to be}} baptized! Cruel, cruel parents, {{to bring}} me to it! And God! Oh, why did He forgive me so soon?

Oh! brother, brother, is this the Gospel of the Christians? I came to you to be taught how to be wise, and good, and respected, and you tell me that all <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> is to live this horrible life of torture here, on the chance of escaping torture forever!

6000|$|... "That is true, sheik; and I {{should be}} well content <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you were {{travelling}} straight either for Suakim or Zanzibar, for at either place I know that I could obtain from my countrymen {{money to pay}} any ransom you might set upon me, even a sum that would buy you fast camels and much goods, and make you a wealthy man in your tribe; but I am not content to wait for years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] said Eustace Hignett gravely, [...] "could make me do that. Our souls have blended. Our {{beings have}} called {{to one another}} from their deepest depths, saying ... There are your pyjamas, over in the corner ... saying, 'You are mine!' How could I forget her after that? Well, as I was saying, we parted. Little <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she was sailing on this very boat! But just now {{she came to me}} as I writhed on deck...." ...|$|E
6000|$|As for myself, at the {{beginnings}} of my vocabulary, at so tender a period that I still made hunger noises and sleep noises, yet even then <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I had been a star-rover. Yes, I, whose lips had never lisped the word [...] "king," [...] remembered that I {{had once been the}} son of a king. More--I remembered that once I had been a slave and a son of a slave, and worn an iron collar round my neck.|$|E
5000|$|... • “Something {{is often}} lost or diminished when every detail is explained. Stay with {{questions}} {{that go beyond}} the obvious, such as “How <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> to be true?” ...|$|R

6000|$|Now when Lynette {{heard the}} words that Axatalese spoke she smote her hands very violently {{together}} and she cried out in a loud and piercing voice: [...] "Said I not so?

6000|$|... "God bless you, Corny, for this!" [...] Guert cried with feeling, as I warmly {{shook his}} hand. [...] "It {{requires}} a warm heart, and a bold one too, {{to lead a}} man into this 'lion's den.' Stay but a moment, lest some evil come of it, I beg of you. This squeeze of the hand is worth an estate {{to a man in}} my situation; but remember Anneke. Ah!

60|$|Now note two things. I {{spoke in}} French; I was not {{conscious}} that I spoke in French.

As for me, Darrell Standing, at present writing these lines in Murderers' Row of Folsom Prison, why, I know only high school French sufficient to enable {{me to read}} the language. As for my speaking it--impossible. I can scarcely intelligibly pronounce my way through a menu.|$|E
