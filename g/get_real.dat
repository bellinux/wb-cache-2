500|$|... "Basingstoke" [...] is a {{code word}} in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera Ruddigore, [...] used by the [...] "bad baronet" [...] after he reforms, to remind his bride [...] "Mad Margaret" [...] of their plan to live lives of boring respectability. In 1895, Thomas Hardy {{referred}} to Basingstoke as [...] "Stoke Barehills" [...] in Jude the Obscure. The town is also mentioned in Agatha Christie's They do it with Mirrors and is widely {{thought to be the}} location of Market Basing in the Miss Marple stories. Patrick Wilde's 1993 play, What's Wrong with Angry? is set in Basingstoke. It was later adapted into the 1998 film, <b>Get</b> <b>Real,</b> which was filmed at various locations around Basingstoke.|$|E
500|$|In his {{autobiography}} released {{a few years}} later, Gerrard reflected that Liverpool were fortunate to win, but was critical of Arsenal's [...] "bitter" [...] reaction: [...] "Wenger and Ljungberg kept complaining about the hand-balls. <b>Get</b> <b>real,</b> boys. That's football. Grow up." [...] He reserved special praise for his opponent Vieira however, saying {{a few days after}} the game: [...] "It was my job to try and stop him, but he definitely got the better of me that day. He's such a great player. He's so fit, and he dictates the pace of a game. There are a lot of things you can learn just by watching him."

500|$|Mace {{was seen}} as a strong yet very {{feminine}} female character, as she often rescues Lenny in dire situations and shows maternal concern for him. Both characters represent a significant contrast: Mace is the film's hero and moral center, whereas Lenny is the antihero; Mace is black and Lenny is white; and finally, Mace represents the [...] "hard-edged, reality-based" [...] component, while Lenny is dominated by fantasies. This is especially notable when Mace yells to him, [...] "This is your life! Right here! Right now! It's real time, you hear me? Real time, time to <b>get</b> <b>real,</b> not playback!" [...] The film's white characters also tend to be nihilistically concerned with the present, while black characters are generally future revolutionaries. Bigelow considered Strange Days as her most personal film, claiming that [...] "It's a synthesis of all the different tracks I've been exploring, either deliberately or unconsciously, ever since I started making art." ...|$|E
500|$|Anne Hathaway is an American {{actress who}} has {{appeared}} in film and stage. She made her acting debut in the short-lived television series <b>Get</b> <b>Real</b> (19992000) before starring in her breakthrough role of Mia Thermopolis in the successful Disney comedy The Princess Diaries (2001). The role of Mia established her as a teen idol and she later reprised the role in its sequel, [...] The following year, Hathaway made her New York stage debut in the Encores! production of Carnival! at the City Center. This {{was followed by a}} string of family-oriented films such as Nicholas Nickleby (2002) and Ella Enchanted (2004), which were box office flops. In 2005, she voiced the lead character in the highly successful animated film Hoodwinked! The same year, she made [...] the transition to more mature roles with the acclaimed gay romance Brokeback Mountain. In 2006, Hathaway starred opposite Meryl Streep in the highly successful comedy-drama The Devil Wears Prada and portrayed Jane Austen in the biographical drama Becoming Jane the following year.|$|E

500|$|The master {{tapes to}} [...] "Big Boy" [...] {{were thought to}} be lost, but in 1994, Jackson family friend Ben Brown (and a former Steeltown co-owner) said he found the tapes in his parents' kitchen pantry. Brown reissued the record in 1995, on the Inverted Records label â€” a week before Michael Jackson's HIStory album was issued. He also remastered the song, selling it by mail order, along with an {{instrumental}} version, in a limited edition package consisting of a compact disc and cassette tape â€” the package could be purchased at a cost of approximately $30. The reissue of [...] "Big Boy" [...] was promoted with a music video. In 2009, Gordon Keith put items from the Steeltown era up for auction, including [...] "a sizable number of mint-condition copies of 'Big Boy'" [...] in 45 rpm format and 100 copies of [...] "We Don't Have To Be Over 21 (to Fall in Love)". Keith stated, [...] "I could use the money... I got these guys off the ground... I didn't truly <b>get</b> <b>real</b> money for it".|$|E
500|$|In 2011, he {{starred in}} the box-office {{animated}} hit Rio, as the main character Blu, a metropolitan, domesticated male Spix's macaw who learns how to fly. He starred alongside Anne Hathaway, his former co-star (and onscreen sibling) from <b>Get</b> <b>Real,</b> as well as George Lopez, Tracy Morgan, will.i.am and Jamie Foxx. He featured in one song, [...] "Real in Rio", in the film's soundtrack, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. He also starred alongside Aziz Ansari, Danny McBride, and Nick Swardson in 30 Minutes or Less, a film noir heist-comedy about a pizza delivery man, played by Eisenberg, who is forced to rob a bank, which was released in August 2011. In October 2011, Eisenberg made his playwriting debut in Rattlestick Playwrights Theater's Off-Broadway production of Asuncion, staged at Cherry Lane Theatre. Eisenberg also acted in the play, which was directed by Kip Fagan. The play highlights two overeducated, liberal-minded friends, played by Eisenberg and Justin Bartha, whose assumptions are challenged by their new Filipina roommate, played by Camille Mana.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening scene}} {{featuring}} the alien rebels incinerating {{a group of}} Russian alien abductees was filmed without actual Russian cars. Picture car coordination Nigel Habgood noted, [...] "I couldn't <b>get</b> <b>real</b> Russian cars, so I decided to get creative and go seriously European. We burned a couple Saabs, and a BMW 2002. I'm sorry we couldn't get any Yugos." [...] For the scene after the intro wherein Mulder discovers the charred remains of abductees, the prop and the production design departments had to create specialized fake bodies. Carter later noted that it's [...] "harder than it looks to create a charred, dead body." [...] The stage for the alien abduction scene was built from scratch: construction supervisor Rob Maier was tasked with creating a full-scale replica of the Ruskin Dam bridge in order to ease up the shots. The tagline for this episode is [...] "Resist or Serve". The tagline was later used for The X-Files game, [...] {{as well as the}} official book covering the fifth season of the show. The list of victims viewed by Scully in her hospital room was made up of X-Files staffers.|$|E

500|$|... "The Duel" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta, a {{producer}} and show runner with The Office. The episode featured {{the conclusion of the}} love triangle between Dwight, Andy and Angela, a subplot that had been going on since the fourth season finale, [...] "Goodbye, Toby". The cast and writing staff saw [...] "The Duel" [...] as a defining episode for Andy Bernard because it demonstrated a softer, more emotional side of the character. Dean Holland, who directed the episode, said this was particularly effective because in past episodes, he displayed such rage problems that he had to attend anger management courses, but in [...] "The Duel" [...] he responded to horrible news in a heartrending way. Rainn Wilson particularly praised Ed Helms' performance, saying, [...] "He gives a lot of heart and soul, and Andy is such a doofus and a douche, and now you really get to see his heart break. There's some reality there. That's the great thing this show gives us, just when you think you know the characters and they're two-dimensional and they're goofy and crazy, in their own way, you <b>get</b> <b>real</b> human redemption." ...|$|E
500|$|Early episodes based much {{of their}} comedy on Stewie's [...] "super villain" [...] antics, such as his {{constant}} plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions {{to get rid of}} things he dislikes, and his constant attempts at matricide. As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began writing him with a different personality. Family Guy often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting, and occasions where the characters break the fourth wall by addressing the audience. For example, in [...] "North by North Quahog", the first episode that aired after the show's revival, included Peter telling the family that they had been cancelled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared, Action, That '80s Show, Wonderfalls, Fastlane, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Skin, Girls Club, Cracking Up, The Pitts, Firefly, <b>Get</b> <b>Real,</b> Freakylinks, Wanda at Large, Costello, The Lone Gunmen, A Minute with Stan Hooper, Normal, Ohio, Pasadena, Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie, The $treet, The American Embassy, Cedric the Entertainer Presents, The Tick, Luis, and Greg the Bunny. Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during Family Guys hiatus.|$|E

In 2002, Milian was appointed {{the host of the}} live competitive music series Becoming Presents: Wannabe on MTV, where she met director Joseph Kahn. Kahn suggested she audition for a lead role in the film Torque. Her audition was successful and she played a minor role in the film. She was subsequently cast in her first lead role in Love Don't Cost a Thing. Milian {{has been described as a}} role model to young girls; she has said that there are a lot of people who young girls look up to, but [...] "at the end of the day you have to be your own person and love yourself." [...] Milian worked with the Children Uniting Nations charity, in which she was a big sister to foster children, and says her favorite charity is the Penny Lane Foundation. Milian was awarded with a humanitarian award at The Reign fundraiser from the Elton John AIDS Foundation for being a role model for young children. Milian said, [...] "I've never been rewarded that way and never been acknowledged like that. That was really nice of them, and I was happy I was able to show up for the kids." ...|$|E
