5|$|The Other Hand, {{also known}} as Little Bee, is a 2008 novel by British author Chris Cleave. It is a dual {{narrative}} story about a Nigerian asylum-seeker and a British magazine editor, who meet during the oil conflict in the Niger Delta, and are re-united in England several years later. Cleave, inspired as a university student by his temporary employment in an asylum detention centre, wrote the book {{in an attempt to}} <b>humanise</b> the plight of asylum-seekers in Britain. The novel examines the treatment of refugees by the asylum system, as well as issues of British colonialism, globalization, political violence and personal accountability.|$|E

40|$|Antibody {{engineering}} {{has made}} it possible to design antibodies with optimal characteristics for delivery of radionuclides for tumour imaging and therapy. A <b>humanised</b> divalent-Fab′ cross-linked with a bis-maleimide linker referred to as <b>humanised</b> divalent-Fab′ maleimide was produced {{as a result of this}} design process. It is a <b>humanised</b> divalent antibody with no Fc, which can be produced in bacteria and has enhanced stability compared with F(ab′) 2. Here we describe a clinical study in patients with colorectal cancer using <b>humanised</b> divalent-Fab′ maleimide generated from the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibody A 5 B 7 radiolabelled with iodine- 131. Ten patients received an i. v. injection of iodine- 131 -labelled A 5 B 7 <b>humanised</b> divalent-Fab′ maleimide, and positive tumour images were obtained by gamma camera imaging in eight patients with known lesions, and one previously undetected lesion was identified. True negative results were obtained in two patients without tumour. Area under the curve analysis of serial blood gamma counting and gamma camera images showed a higher tumour to blood ratio compared to A 5 B 7 mF(ab′) 2 used previously in the clinic, implying this new molecule may be superior for radioimmunotherapy. MIRD dose calculations showed a relatively high radiation dose to the kidney, which may limit the amount of activity that could be administered in radioimmunotherapy. However the reduction in immunogenicity was also a major advantage for A 5 B 7 <b>humanised</b> divalent-Fab′ maleimide over murine versions of this antibody suggesting that <b>humanised</b> divalent-Fab′ maleimide should be a useful vehicle for repeated therapies...|$|R

25|$|After the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State in 1922, little was done to update the 1908 Act or to ensure that its rules were observed, particularly those on corporal punishment. The purpose of the Act was to <b>humanise</b> reformatory and industrial schools and orphanages, and to reduce physical punishment. The 1908 Act regulations remained in force in Ireland almost unchanged until the 1970s, while elsewhere in Europe more progressive regimes developed, mainly after 1945. In contrast, the 1941 Children's Act, drafted while Éamon de Valera was briefly Minister of the Department of Education, reduced the minimum age of inmates to below 6 years, allowing small children to be detained because of their parents' poverty.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} heavily {{based on a}} moral {{question}} posed to the Doctor by Donna: whether to warn the population of Pompeii, or to recuse themselves from the situation.

40|$|In this study, {{synchronous}} spontaneous, independent {{liver and}} gallbladder tumours were detected in a Bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps). The multiple tumours consisted of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma {{as well as}} in situ adenocarcinoma and two adenomas of the gallbladder. The biliary epithelial cells and the cholangiocarcinoma showed membranous cross-immunoreactivity for claudin- 7. The gallbladder epithelial cells, its adenoma and adenocarcinoma showed basolateral cross-reactivity for claudin- 7. We think that the <b>humanised</b> anti-claudin- 7 antibody is a good marker for the detection of different primary cholangiocellular and gallbladder tumours in Bearded dragons. The cholangiocytes, the cholangiocarcinoma, the endothelial cells of the liver and the epithelial cells and gallbladder tumours all showed claudin- 5 cross-reactivity. The <b>humanised</b> anti-cytokeratin AE 1 –AE 3 antibody showed cross-reactivity in the biliary epithelial cells, cholangiocarcinoma cells, epithelial cells and tumour cells of the gallbladder. It seems that this <b>humanised</b> antibody is a useful epithelial marker for the different neoplastic lesions of epithelial cells in reptiles. The <b>humanised</b> anti-α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) antibody showed intense cross-reactivity in the smooth muscle cells of the hepatic vessels and in the muscle layer of the gallbladder. The portal myofibroblasts, the endothelial cells of the sinusoids and the stromal cells of the cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder tumours were positive for α-SMA. The antibovine anti-vimentin and <b>humanised</b> anti-Ki- 67 antibodies did not show crossreactivity in the different samples from the Bearded dragon...|$|R
40|$|A <b>humanised</b> bispecific {{monoclonal}} antibody (bsMAb) with binding specificity for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) on {{one arm and}} a radiolabelled chelate (DTPA- 90 Y) on the other arm was generated by consecutively transfecting the <b>humanised</b> genes of an anti-CEA MAb and the chimerised genes of an anti-chelate MAb into eucaryotic BHK cells using the calcium-phosphate coprecipitation technique. The antibodies secreted were of IgG 3 isotype with a shortened hinge region (delta gamma 3) and light chains. Double transfectomas were screened for the secretion of bsMAbs using a double determinant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on solid phase attached HSA-benzyl-DTPA and an anti-idiotypic MAb selective for the CEA-specific arm. After purification on two immunoaffinity chromatography columns, the <b>humanised</b> bsMAbs were characterised by SDS-PAGE and a quantitative binding assay in antigen excess. The purification procedure resulted in 95 % reactive bispecific MAb. This <b>humanised</b> bsMAb may be employed in two phase radioimmunotherapy, binding to the tumour via the anti-CEA arm and localising a radiolabelled chelate with the other arm, without inducing a strong immune response observed sometimes with murine MAbs...|$|R
500|$|Temple and Davies {{thought that}} the episode was not a [...] "fun reappearance" [...] of an old monster; instead, they {{felt that there was}} [...] "an actual story to tell". Temple {{emphasised}} in his script that the Doctor overlooked the Ood under the shadow of the Devil, and the character had to see his shortcomings. Temple's script also emphasised the Ood's slavery; both Temple and lead actor David Tennant commented that the existence of a species born to serve was complicated, the latter stating complications with Richard Dawkins' selfish gene theory. Donna's role in the episode was to further <b>humanise</b> the Doctor, and her opinion of the Ood changing from her initial disgust at their appearance to empathy for them was important to the episode and her character development. Susie Liggat cited the writing as part of Doctor Whos importance—she thought the story about [...] "liberating oppressed people" [...] could be applied domestically or globally.|$|E

500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{said of the}} Pink Panther films, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, {{though it may be}} because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic {{self-absorption}} that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny." [...] Film critic Elvis Mitchell has said that Sellers {{was one of the few}} comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life. A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retain their dignity. On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: [...] "I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would <b>humanise</b> him and make him kind of touching." [...] His biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is [...] "the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are." [...] Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that [...] "As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism". This combination of [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was [...] "the sole representative of humanity". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a [...] "balance between character and absurdity". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could [...] "inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being".|$|E

500|$|Davies {{created the}} {{expectation}} of Rose's return in the fourth series by mentioning her in dialogue and featuring Piper in cameo appearances in [...] "Partners in Crime", [...] "The Poison Sky", and [...] "Midnight". Speaking on how Rose's character had changed between her appearances, Davies described the fourth series Rose as [...] "tougher, more independent, and [...] might, at times, seem a little harder". Piper stated she rewatched her earlier episodes to remember how the character spoke and acted as {{she felt she had}} [...] "been playing posh birds" [...] since she left the programme and by contrast [...] "Rose {{is a bit of a}} chav". Rose is re-united with the Doctor near the climax of [...] "The Stolen Earth". Director Graeme Harper insisted that the scene appear [...] "mystical" [...] because the characters' reunion was [...] "the most magical moment" [...] in the entire episode and Ernie Vincze, the Director of Photography for the show, compared the scene's feeling to the 1980s science-fiction film Blade Runner. Davies characterised the reunion between Rose and the Doctor as [...] "the biggest romance [...] has ever seen" [...] and joked that seminal films such as Gone with the Wind should have ended with a Dalek shooting the male lead. He had difficulty splitting up the characters for a second time for the necessity of the plot. He felt that [...] "Rose has to be stupid to fall in love with Doctor #2" [...] because [...] "she's doing what the plot demands, not what she'd demand". At one stage he considered giving an explanation that Rose's dimension hopping and the Dalek's meddling with reality had contaminated her with [...] "voidstuff" [...] and that she would die if she stayed in her original universe. In the final episode it is enough for her to stay that the human Doctor needs her and is able to reciprocate her love. Porter felt that the climax of [...] "Journey's End" [...] indicated that [...] "Rose's role as a sidekick has been completed" [...] as she has a second Doctor to <b>humanise,</b> one who she can be equals with.|$|E
2500|$|Byzantine Madonnas, {{and their}} Italian derivatives, were widely used as prototypes by Early Netherlandish {{artists from the}} 1420s with Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck. [...] This was a period when {{commerce}} and a desire for piety and salvation, and sometimes politics, drove the commissioners of devotional art works. Painters who explicitly adapted the Cambrai Madonna include Petrus Christus who was commissioned in 1454 to produce three separate copies, Rogier van der Weyden, Dieric Bouts and Gerard David. In general the Netherlandish artists sought to further <b>humanise</b> the image, through such devices as extending the child's arm towards his mother and painting the child in a more realistic manner.|$|E
2500|$|The False Dmitry {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{characters}} in Alexander Pushkin's blank verse drama Boris Godunov. In Pushkin's drama, the character is a young novice monk who decides to impersonate the Tsarevich when he hears they would have been the same age had the child lived. Pushkin's decision to <b>humanise</b> the False Dmitry earned him the disapproval of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, who then prevented the play from being published or staged. In an unpublished foreword, Pushkin wrote, [...] "There is much of Henri IV in Dmitri. Like him he is brave, generous and boastful, like him indifferent to religion -- both abjure their faith for a political cause, both love pleasures and war, both devote themselves to chimerical projects, both are victims of conspiracies... But Henri IV didn't have a Ksenya on his conscience -- it is true that this horrible accusation hasn't been proved and, as for me, I make a point of not believing it." [...] Pushkin intended to write further plays about the reigns of Dmitry and Vasili, as well as the subsequent Time of Troubles. Pushkin was prevented from fulfilling these plans by his death in a duel at the age of 37.|$|E

40|$|Thus far, {{none of the}} preclinically {{successful}} and promising immunomodulatory agents for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM) has conferred stable, long-term insulin independence to diabetic patients.

Considerable logistical outlays have been deployed to develop and to translate <b>humanised</b> antibodies targeting immune cells, cytokines, and cytokine receptors to the clinic.

25|$|<b>Humanised</b> {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by grafting murine hypervariable regions on amino acid domains into human antibodies. This results in a molecule of approximately 95% human origin. <b>Humanised</b> antibodies bind antigen much more weakly than the parent murine monoclonal antibody, with reported decreases in affinity of up to several hundredfold. Increases in antibody-antigen binding strength have been achieved by introducing mutations into the complementarity determining regions (CDR), using techniques such as chain-shuffling, randomization of complementarity-determining regions and antibodies with mutations within the variable regions induced by error-prone PCR, E. coli mutator strains and site-specific mutagenesis.|$|R
