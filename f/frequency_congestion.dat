The aim of the thesis is the conception of a multimodal controller working position that incorpo-rates automatic speech recognition (ASR) and the multi-touch interaction technology in order to confront current challenges of the air traffic management like the in-creased <b>frequency</b> <b>congestion</b> and high workload of the controller. To this end, the air traffic management environment is described; especially radiote-lephony and data link connection as means of interaction between controllers and pilots are considered in detail. Consequently to an investigation on the topics multimodality, ASR and multi-touch, {{the main part of}} this thesis will then be the structured development of the multimod-al concept. The resulting concept enables the controller to alternatively input commands via speech or multi-touch gestures. As the commands given via multi-touch require the usage of the not real-time capable data link, time-critical commands are to be sent via radiotelephony as regular.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of economies of density {{on the characteristics of}} an urban transport system under optimal pricing conditions. Optimal pricing rules are derived for a transport system where bus and car modes are available for peak and offpeak trips. Both modes contribute to congestion. Each demand level for bus trips requires a minimal supply of bus-kilometres. Optimal bus supply exceeds this minimum only when waiting time reductions due to increased service <b>frequency,</b> outweigh <b>congestion</b> costs and bus supply costs (measured at the marginal cost of public funds). An empirical analysis for Brussels and London shows that taking account of economies of density modestly increases the welfare gain from optimising transport prices.

In case car prices are fixed at the reference level, very low or zero public transport prices produce small welfare gains in some cases. transport; congestion; public transport...|$|R

In this paper, a recently proposed model for the prediction of the degradation of the carrier-to-interference ratio due to differential rain attenuation and cross-polarization, which is applicable only for the noise-dominant case, has been properly modified to include the general case. The proposed model is based on the lognormal assumption for the point rainfall rate statistics and the convective raincell model. Due to complexity of the proposed analysis, some simple regression-derived formulas have been generated forming a very useful tool for the system engineer.
