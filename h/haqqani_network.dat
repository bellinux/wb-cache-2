5|$|The drone attacks {{carried out}} by the CIA in Pakistan rely on local informants, who can cross the border into Pakistan in a way CIA {{officers}} cannot. CIA officers at the base were involved in the coordination, targeting and surveillance of drone strikes aimed at the Afghan Taliban, the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>network,</b> the Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda. At the time of the attack, they were conducting an aggressive campaign against the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>network,</b> a radical group run by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin Haqqani.|$|E

The 4th BCT {{deployed to}} both Wardak and Logar provinces. During this deployment {{they went to}} places such as Chakh Valley in Wardak Province and Charkh Valley in Logar Province in search of elements of the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>Network.</b> In May 2013, the brigade deployed again to Afghanistan returning home in February 2014.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{responded to}} the attack by {{increasing}} its drone attacks against militants in Pakistan. Nearly every day after the CIA facility was attacked, the U.S. military conducted drone strikes aimed at leaders of the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>network</b> in North Waziristan. In the week after the attack, the U.S. military conducted five drone strikes, an unusually high number. However, U.S. counter-terrorism officials cautioned against linking these attacks to the bombing. After reports of drone strikes, Pakistan {{said it would not}} support the attacks in its territory, as they were counterproductive.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Haqqani</b> <b>network's</b> tribal {{connections}} in Northern Waziristan and {{the de facto}} regime that it has established with courts, law enforcement, medical care, and governance have often brought it great support from locals. Its familiarity of terrain, such as mountain passes, also grants them excellent access between Afghanistan and Pakistan.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bombing of}} the Kabul {{parliament}} has highlighted differences within the Taliban in their approach to peace talks. In April 2016, President Ashraf Ghani [...] "pulled the plug" [...] on the Afghan governments failing effort to start peace talks with the Taliban. And due to the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>Networks</b> integration into the Taliban leadership, it will now be harder for peace talks to take place. Although leader of the Taliban, Haibatullah Akhundzada, said a peace agreement was possible if the government in Kabul renounced its foreign allies.|$|R
50|$|The Special Operations Joint Task Force - Afghanistan, {{the remnant}} U.S./NATO special forces organisation, {{includes}} a counter-terrorism task force. In {{the words of}} the U.S. Special Operations Command Factbook for 2015, this task force 'conducts offensive operations in Afghanistan to degrade the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>Networks</b> in order to prevent them from establishing operationally significant safe havens which threaten the stability and sovereignty of Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistanand the United States.' This task force is similar to previous forces such as Task Force 373.|$|R
5|$|In late March 2012, a US {{military}} official {{stated that the}} United States would have to use routes through the Northern Distribution Network (NDN) for supplies to Afghanistan if Pakistan refused to reopen its supply lines. However, he conceded the expensiveness of these routes and noted that negotiations with Pakistan regarding the possibility of opening of the supply routes were ongoing. After reviewing United States-Pakistan relations and outlining what was needed to repair bilateral relations, the Pakistani parliament turned the decision of reopening the NATO supply lines over to the government in April 2012. Due to an upcoming general election in Pakistan, with widespread anti-American sentiments in the country, the Pakistani government was reluctant to reopen the lines, and postponed its decision until the United States responded positively to Pakistani demands outlined in the parliamentary recommendations, such as a US apology for the November 2011 incident, the bringing {{of those involved in}} the strike to justice, and a stop to US drone airstrikes. Talks between Pakistan and the United States failed in April 2012 after Pakistan could not get an unconditional apology from the United States for the November 2011 incident. The White House refused to apologise after Taliban attacks in Kabul and other cities in Afghanistan on 15 April 2012, which according to US military and intelligence officials came from the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>network,</b> an Afghan group working from a base in North Waziristan along the Afghanistan border in Pakistan's tribal belt. Pakistani officials said they cannot open the NATO supply routes in Afghanistan without a US apology.|$|E
25|$|While {{the city}} is being developed, {{it is also the}} scene of {{occasional}} deadly suicide bombings and explosions carried out by the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>network,</b> Taliban's Quetta Shura, Hezb-i Islami, Al Qaeda, and other anti-government elements who are allegedly supported and guided by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy network.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{supporting}} the Hezb-e Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the ISI {{in conjunction with}} Saudi Arabia strongly supported the faction of Jalaluddin Haqqani (<b>Haqqani</b> <b>network)</b> and allied Arab {{groups such as the}} one surrounding financier Bin Laden, nowadays known as Al-Qaeda, during the war against the Soviets and the Afghan communist government in Afghanistan in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Haqqani</b> <b>network's</b> root {{values are}} Islamist. They are ideologically {{aligned with the}} Taliban, who have worked to {{eradicate}} Western influence and transform Afghanistan into a strictly sharia-following state. This was exemplified in the government that formed after Soviet troops were driven from Afghanistan. Both groups have the common goal of disrupting the Western military and political efforts in Afghanistan and driving them from the country permanently. Currently the group demands that US and Coalition Forces, made up mostly of NATO Nations, withdraw from Afghanistan and no longer interfere with the politics or educational systems of Islamic nations.|$|R
50|$|Maulvi Ahmed Jan (died November 21, 2013) was {{a former}} Taliban {{official}} who eventually became the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>Network's</b> chief spiritual adviser. Hailing from Ghazni province of Afghanistan, Ahmad Jan had also served the Taliban government of Mullah Omar as federal minister for water and power, before being appointed the Governor of the Zabul Province in 2000. His name figured on the CIA’s list of most wanted Taliban commanders, mainly because he was being accused of masterminding a number of deadly suicide attacks in Afghanistan. According to the United Nations in 2000 an individual known as Maulavi Ahmad Jan was the Taliban's Governor of Zabol Province.The United Nations listed him as an individual subject to the sanctions authorized by United Nations Security Council resolutions 1267 and 1333.|$|R

The unit also participated and started the first training of Afghan National Army artillery units in Paktika. These efforts allowed the ANA to fire their first autonomous combat missions in support of their own troops engaged with insurgent activities. The 2nd Battalion, 32nd Field Artillery, were able to conduct join fire missions with the ANA D-30 units.|$|R

It became Public Law 110-53. In July 2012, U.S. Senate passed a resolution urging that the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>Network</b> be designated a foreign terrorist organization.|$|E
25|$|As of 2014, the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) {{have been}} in charge of {{security}} in and around the city. Kabul is periodically the scene of deadly suicide bombings carried out by the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>network,</b> the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province, the Taliban's Quetta Shura, Hezbi Islami, al-Qaeda, and other anti-state groups. Government employees, soldiers and ordinary civilians have all been targets of attacks. The Afghan government called the actions of the terrorists war crimes.|$|E
25|$|After the May 2011 {{death of}} Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, many {{prominent}} Afghan figures were assassinated. Afghanistan–Pakistan border skirmishes intensified and many large scale attacks by the Pakistan-based <b>Haqqani</b> <b>Network</b> also took place across Afghanistan. The United States blamed rogue {{elements within the}} Pakistani government for the increased attacks. The U.S. government spent {{tens of billions of}} dollars on development aid over 15 years and over a trillion dollars on military expenses during the same period. Corruption by Western defense and development contractors and associated Afghans reached unprecedented levels in a country where the national GDP was often only a small fraction of the U.S. government's annual budget for the conflict.|$|E
5000|$|However Sir Martin Ewans {{noted that}} the Afghan Arabs [...] "benefited {{indirectly}} from the CIA's funding, through the ISI and resistance organizations," [...] and that [...] "it has been reckoned {{that as many as}} 35,000 'Arab-Afghans' may have received military training in Pakistan at an estimated cost of $800 million in the years up to and including 1988." [...] Some of the CIA's greatest Afghan beneficiaries were Arabist commanders such as Haqqani and Hekmatyar who were key allies of bin Laden over many years. Haqqani—one of bin Laden's closest associates in the 1980s—received direct cash payments from CIA agents, without the mediation of the ISI. This independent source of funding gave Haqqani disproportionate influence over the mujahideen. <b>Haqqani</b> and his <b>network</b> {{played an important role in}} the formation and growth of al Qaeda, with Jalalhuddin Haqqani allowing bin Laden to train mujahideen volunteers in Haqqani territory and build extensive infrastructure there.|$|R
25|$|On a {{visit to}} Pakistan in 2015, Rice warned Pakistani {{political}} and military leaders that attacks in Afghanistan by militants based in Pakistan threatened regional security. Rice also delivered an invitation from President Obama for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to visit the United States in October. The meetings came at a tense time for Pakistan's relations with neighboring Afghanistan and archrival India, along with uncertainty over whether the United States would release $300 million in military aid to Pakistan. Media reports suggested the money could be held back if the United States determined Pakistan was {{not doing enough to}} combat the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>network,</b> accused of some of the deadliest attacks in neighboring Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|It {{is widely}} agreed that after Hekmatyar {{failed to take}} over power in Afghanistan, the United States and the ISI helped to found the Afghan Taliban. The ISI in {{conjunction}} with the CIA {{and other parts of the}} Pakistan military subsequently provided financial, logistical, military and direct combat support to the Taliban until the September 11 attacks of 2001. It is widely acknowledged that the ISI has given the Afghan Taliban safe havens inside Pakistan and supported the Taliban's resurgence in Afghanistan after 9/11 helping them, especially the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>network,</b> carry out attacks inside Afghanistan. Pakistani officials deny this accusation. Allegations have been raised by international government officials, policy analysts and even Pakistani military officials that the ISI {{in conjunction with the}} military leadership has also provided some amount of support and refuge to al-Qaeda. Such allegations were increasingly issued when Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed in 2011 while living in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{immediate}} repercussions {{of the incident}} is that the United States' attempts {{to end the war}} in Afghanistan peacefully may now be in jeopardy. Some Pakistani officials warned that the attack could have [...] "huge implications" [...] for the Afghan endgame. Pakistan, which is designated as a major non-NATO ally by the United States and is seen as a key facilitator in bringing the United States to the negotiations table with the Afghan Taliban and the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>Network,</b> had already halted those efforts according to an unnamed Pakistani official close to the military establishment.|$|E
500|$|Operation Zarb-e-Azb ( [...] ALA-LC: [...] ) was a joint {{military}} offensive {{conducted by}} the Pakistan Armed Forces against various militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, al-Qaeda, Jundallah and the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>network.</b> The operation was launched on 15 June 2014 in North Waziristan along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border as a renewed effort against militancy {{in the wake of}} the 8 June attack on Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, for which the TTP and the IMU claimed responsibility. Part of the war in North-West Pakistan, up to 30,000 Pakistani soldiers were involved in Zarb-e-Azb, described as a [...] "comprehensive operation" [...] to flush out all foreign and local militants hiding in North Waziristan. The operation has received widespread support from the Pakistani political, defence and civilian sectors. As a consequence, the overall security situation improved and terrorist attacks in Pakistan dropped to a six-year low since 2008. Zarb-e-Azb was followed by Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad which began in February 2017, following a resurgence in terrorist incidents.|$|E
500|$|... – The US {{supported}} {{military operations}} against Taliban militants, a spokesman from the US Embassy in Pakistan said on 16 June, and the US supported every Pakistani step taken {{for the establishment}} of peace. The United States had pressured Pakistan for a military operation in North Waziristan for years, and the US Congress linked military assistance to Pakistan for the next fiscal year with military operations in North Waziristan in June 2014. Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said that the Pentagon was unaware of Pakistan's decision to launch a new offensive in North Waziristan: [...] "The Pakistan military and the government understand the threat, and they continue to go after that threat." [...] On 5 November 2014, Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson, a senior commander for US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, said in a Pentagon-hosted video briefing from Afghanistan that the <b>Haqqani</b> <b>network</b> is now [...] "fractured" [...] like the Taliban. [...] "They are fractured. They are fractured like the Taliban is. That's based pretty much on the Pakistan's operations in North Waziristan this entire summer-fall," [...] he said, acknowledging the effectiveness of Pakistan's military offensive.
