50|$|The {{requirement}} that the false statement must have occurred under oath, in a judicial proceeding, which is a sine qua non for the offence of perjury under sections 156 of the Penal Code and 1 (1) of the English Perjury Act 1911, {{does not have a}} general application in all cases. For instance, oath may be a first step in the <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceeding,</b> for example, swearing to an affidavit in support of a motion or any fact contained in a deposition duly sworn. According to Turner, ‘ In the case of perjury in an affidavit or the like, the offence is committed when the deponent takes oath to the truth of the affidavit, and it is unnecessary to aver or prove that the affidavit was filed or in any way used.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{with the}} titled Creditors' claims in Insolvency {{proceeding}} {{deals with the}} possibility of setting up the claims of creditors in case that the court declared the debtor insolvent and was therefore initiated insolvency proceeding according to the Act no. 182 / 2006 Col., on Insolvency and Its Resolution (Insolvency Act). The introduction of the thesis also pays attention to other possibilities of enforcing and lodging the claims whether in extrajudicial proceedings or in proceedings before the court by filing an action against the debtor or in proceedings before the court or arbitration and subsequent recovery options of enforceable claims. The main aim of this thesis is to present a detailed analysis of the process of submission of claims in insolvency proceedings from the moment of <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proceeding</b> through submission of the claims to the insolvency court to their reviewing and their possible denial (together with adversary disputes) or their finding and final satisfaction. The chapter that describes the different types of claims is also closely related to the process of submitting, reviewing and satisfaction of claims as the type of the claim may determine whole process of its submission and satisfaction in the insolvency proceeding. Last chapters describe the satisfaction of admitted claims depending to the chosen method of the insolvency resolution and the destiny of unsatisfied of claims when the insolvency proceeding is over. At the end of the thesis is a practical example that should illustrate the procedure of filling the Claim submission form, including all elements of formal and content requirements...|$|E

In his view, it [...] "impermissibly expands this court’s jurisdiction and ourscope of review to second-guess the Board’s initial determinationthat the patent at issue is a 'covered business method patent.'"

Rising temperatures and increasing daylengths influence <b>the</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northward migration. Temperature also has an effect. Mated females leave the overwintering sites before the males. Monarchs travelling north do not form roosts.|$|R

Abstract – Influence of an {{ion beam}} on {{properties}} of magnetron (planar geometry) is considered {{and character of}} display of such influence on features <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abnormal glow discharge of low pressure is experimentally investigated. Character-istics <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discharge in <b>the</b> bottom range <b>of</b> pressure < 8 · 10 – 2 Pa are determined at an irradiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetron cathode a beam of ions of argon. Dominating factors <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abnormal glow discharge of low pressure in magnetron are ion–electron emission and sputter-ing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetron cathode by ion beam. Falling dependence of a voltage <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dis-charge on energy of ions and threshold dependence of a voltage <b>of</b> <b>initiation</b> on a current of an ion beam is established. <b>The</b> prospect <b>of</b> expansion of functionalities of planar magnetron is shown due to <b>the</b> coordination <b>of</b> modes <b>of</b> sputtering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetron anode by an ion beam and the magne-tron cathode by plasma ions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abnormal glow discharge. 1...|$|R
