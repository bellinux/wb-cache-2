On May 2, 2000, in a celebrity edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, he selected the Ohio Library Foundation to receive his $500,000 winnings. He later {{went on to win}} an additional $32,000 on the second celebrity Millionaire, making him one of the biggest winning contestants on Millionaire who did not win the top prize. Carey also has played on the World Poker Tour in the Hollywood Home games for the Cleveland Public Library charity. In June 2007, Carey offered to donate up to $100,000 (in $10,000 increments) to the Mooch Myernick Memorial Fund <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> could beat him at the video game FIFA Soccer 07 for the Xbox 360. He dared five players from both the U.S. Men's and Women's National Teams to compete against him. Carey ended up donating $100,000, plus $60,000 for losing two games out of the six games he played.|$|E

With a broken leg Anderson swam over to a wounded officer {{in the water and}} attempted to pull him to one of the life rafts but the man died of his wound first and a few moments later the Germans lowered boats and began rescuing the Americans. The Germans fired 148 shells and one torpedo while Stanvac Calcutta fired only twenty-five, hundreds of machine gun rounds were also expended by both sides.|$|E
25|$|That night, Karl and Harry have a {{confrontation}} backstage, in which Karl accuses Harry of murdering Carol; Harry angrily rejects the accusation and challenges that Karl merely finds {{it easier to}} believe that rather than accept the guilt of betraying his best friend. On stage, Karl begins to pioneer his psychic act, but the stooge he has hired in the crowd which he had chosen with a fake random ball toss, accidentally trips and concusses himself on the stage. Upon hearing the sad story of another selected audience member, he decides that he cannot perpetuate the fraud, admitting to the audience {{that he is not}} able to contact the dead. As a result, Dani forgives him. Harry, as 'The Black Widower', starts his guillotine act, but at the moment of truth Linda's nerve fails her and she flees the stage. Although Harry’s act would appear to be ruined when he asks <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> else wants to try, Karl steps forward and announces that he will face the guillotine instead. Karl allows himself to be locked in the guillotine, explaining that Carol was frequently unfaithful and forced Karl to have sex with her. Harry appears to decapitate Karl – although it is merely an illusion, and Karl appears unharmed, the trick having worked perfectly. Harry wins the competition, and in his acceptance speech both forgives Karl and admits that he loves Linda, who joins him on stage and the two kiss. Their friendship mended, Karl and Harry embark on a reunion tour, incorporating Dani and Linda into the act as their assistants.|$|E

500|$|The song, if not {{the title}} alone, {{was a source of}} {{irritation}} for those critics who deemed Living in the Material World overly preachy and didactic. In a full-page album review in Melody Maker, Michael Watts summarised his impression of Harrison's spiritual message: [...] "One gets this feeling of George, somewhat remote and rarefied, indicting the world for being what it is, although <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> could change the world it would be an old Beatle." [...] While noting the song as an autobiographical statement on the singer's [...] "struggle to retain personal dignity and peace of mind", Watts wrote: [...] "He's dealing in lofty sentiments and abstractions; not everyone will want to drink of the cup." ...|$|E

Dave Mustaine has since expressed that, although he believes that Risk is a great record, it [...] "should {{not have had the}} name Megadeth on it, because <b>if</b> <b>anybody</b> else's name was on 'Risk,' it would have sold". However, Mustaine has also stated that [...] "Crush 'Em" [...] was [...] "probably the dumbest" [...] song that the band has ever recorded and said that he was [...] "not too fond of" [...] it.|$|E

Davis said later in an interview, [...] "I have not ever taken any PEDs.

According to Stauffer, [...] "the disarming deflation of the passage {{goes a long way}} toward redeeming it, and is typical of the winning contradictions of the narrator's style". Tom Pocock in Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire has also highlighted the [...] "literary framework" [...] that Haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative, referencing Keats, Shakespeare, and Classical literature to imbue the story with a [...] "Gothic sensibility". Yet as Stauffer notes, [...] "Ultimately, however, one thinks of Haggard's plots, episodes, and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence.|$|E

Taylor also forced a fumble by Vikings quarterback Rich Gannon and pressured Gannon into an interception by Gary Reasons at the Minnesota 17-yard line, which positioned Matt Bahr for the game-clinching 18-yard field goal. In addition, Taylor gave several inspirational speeches to his teammates. [...] "He told us: 'I'm {{going to start}} playing the way we're supposed to play. <b>If</b> <b>anybody</b> wants to come along, fine,' [...] " [...] inside linebacker Steve DeOssie said.

The Canadian Press reported that [...] "A number of celebrities' stars are looking a bit rough around the edges." [...] The president of the Walk of Fame stated that damage {{was due to the}} freezing and thawing during Canadian winters and also sidewalk snowplows. It was announced that the city of Toronto would replace Shatner and Howe's damaged tiles, and the Walk of Fame was looking into an alternative to installing the plaques on a sidewalk where they are subjected to harsh environmental conditions.|$|E
