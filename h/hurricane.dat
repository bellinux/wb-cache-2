A Cape Verde-type <b>hurricane</b> that reached Category5 <b>hurricane</b> status on the Saffir-Simpson <b>Hurricane</b> Scale, David was the fourth named tropical cyclone, second <b>hurricane,</b> and first major <b>hurricane</b> of the 1979 Atlantic <b>hurricane</b> season, traversing through the Leeward Islands, Greater Antilles, and East Coast of the United States during late August and early September. David was the first <b>hurricane</b> to affect the Lesser Antilles since <b>Hurricane</b> Inez in 1966. With winds of 175mph (280km/h), David was the only storm of Category5 intensity to make landfall on the Dominican Republic in the 20th century and the deadliest since the 1930 Dominican Republic <b>Hurricane,</b> San Zenon, killing over 2,000people in its path.
