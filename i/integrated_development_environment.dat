25|$|Microsoft Visual Studio is an <b>integrated</b> <b>development</b> <b>environment</b> (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used {{to develop}} {{computer}} programs for Microsoft Windows, as well as web sites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.|$|E

It is implemented as a Firefox Add-On, and allows recording, editing, and debugging tests. It was previously known as Selenium Recorder. Selenium-IDE was originally created by Shinya Kasatani and donated to the Selenium project in 2006. It is little-maintained and is compatible with Selenium RC, which was deprecated.|$|E

25|$|Lisp {{languages}} {{are often used}} with an interactive command line, which may be combined with an <b>integrated</b> <b>development</b> <b>environment</b> (IDE). The user types in expressions at the command line, or directs the IDE to transmit them to the Lisp system. Lisp reads the entered expressions, evaluates them, and prints the result. For this reason, the Lisp command line is called a read–eval–print loop (REPL).|$|E
25|$|Syntax for {{documentation}} {{comments and}} their XML markup {{is defined in}} a non-normative annex of the ECMA C# standard. The same standard also defines rules for processing of such comments, and their transformation to a plain XML document with precise rules for mapping of Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) identifiers to their related documentation elements. This allows any C# <b>integrated</b> <b>development</b> <b>environment</b> (IDE) or other development tool to find documentation for any symbol in the code in a certain well-defined way.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} IBM PC market (1981–83) the major {{programming}} tool vendors all made compilers that {{worked in a}} similar fashion. For example, the Microsoft Pascal system consisted of two compiler passes and a final linking pass (which could take minutes on systems with only floppy disks for secondary storage, although programs were very much smaller than they are today). This process was less resource-intensive than the later <b>integrated</b> <b>development</b> <b>environment</b> (IDE). Vendors of software development tools aimed their products at professional developers, and the price for these basic tools plus ancillary tools like profilers ran into the hundreds of dollars.|$|E

25|$|The SDK {{includes}} a comprehensive set of development tools, including a debugger, software libraries, a handset emulator based on QEMU, documentation, sample code, and tutorials. Initially, Google's supported <b>integrated</b> <b>development</b> <b>environment</b> (IDE) was Eclipse using the Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin; in December 2014, Google released Android Studio, based on IntelliJ IDEA, as its primary IDE for Android application development. Other development tools are available, including a native development kit (NDK) for applications or extensions in C or C++, Google App Inventor, a visual environment for novice programmers, and various cross platform mobile web applications frameworks. In January 2014, Google unveiled an framework based on Apache Cordova for porting Chrome HTML5 web applications to Android, {{wrapped in a}} native application shell.|$|E
