40|$|International audienceDiabetic Macular Edema (DME) is {{the leading}} cause of {{blindness}} amongst diabetic patients worldwide. It is characterized by accumulation of water molecules in the macula leading to swelling. Early detection of the disease helps prevent further loss of vision. Naturally, automated detection of DME from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) volumes plays a key role. To this end, a pipeline for detecting DME diseases in OCT volumes is proposed in this paper. The method is based on anomaly detection using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). It starts with pre-processing the B-scans by resizing, <b>flattening,</b> <b>filtering</b> and extracting features from them. Both intensity and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features are considered. The dimensionality of the extracted features is reduced using PCA. As the last stage, a GMM is fitted with features from normal volumes. During testing, features extracted from the test volume are evaluated with the fitted model for anomaly and classification is made based on the number of B-scans detected as outliers. The proposed method is tested on two OCT datasets and achieved a sensitivity and a specificity of 80 % and 93 % on the first dataset, and 100 % and 80 % on the second one.

For each patient, two plans were generated, one with and one without the <b>flattening</b> <b>filter.</b> Plans were generated with Eclipse 8. 0 (Varian Medical Systems) commissioned with beam data measured on a Clinac 21 EX (Varian Medical Systems) operated with and without the <b>flattening</b> <b>filter.</b> Removal of the <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> increased the dose rate. The median beam-on time per field was reduced from 25 sec (with the filter) to 11 sec (without the filter), increasing the feasibility of breath-hold treatments and the efficiency of gated treatments. Differences in a dose heterogeneity index for the planning target volume between plans with flattened and unflattened beams were statistically insignificant. Differences in mean doses to organs at risk were small, typically about 10 cGy over the entire treatment.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the dosimetric effects of removing the <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> from conventional C-arm medical linear accelerators. In conventional linear accelerators used for radiotherapy, a <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> is positioned in the beam line to provide a uniform lateral dose profile at a specified depth in water. However, for some radiotherapy treatments, a uniform lateral dose profile is not necessary, e. g. stereotactic treatments with small fields or treatments with intensity modulated fields. In this work, a comprehensive set of measurements and Monte Carlo simulations for a modified Elekta Precise linear accelerator, operating with and without a <b>flattening</b> <b>filter,</b> were performed and the differences were evaluated. For an Elekta Precise linac, it was found that by removing the <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> the dose could be delivered approximately twice as fast as when the <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> is in the beam line, under certain conditions. The scatter produced in the treatment head was reduced by 30 %– 45 % when the <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> was removed and the variation of scattered radiation with field size was also reduced. Removal of the <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> resulted in a softer photon energy spectra which leads to a steeper absorbed dose fall-off with depth and less lateral variation across the field. By increasing the acceleration potential of the linac, the depth–dose profiles become more {{similar to those of the}} equivalent conventional photon beam and thus the output will also be increased. The suitability of two beam quality measures, TPR 20, 10 and %dd(10) x, in predicting water to air mass collision stopping-power ratios sw,air for flattening filter-free photon beams was also investigated. These quality measures are used in reference dosimetry for the determination of absorbed dose in water. It was shown that the relationship between TPR 20, 10 and sw,air used in a current international code of practice for reference dosimetry, overestimates the stopping-power ratio by approximately 0. 3 % for flattening filter-free photon beams, while the relationship between %dd(10) x and sw,air, used in the North American code of practice is more accurate. A new beam quality metric, consisting of both TPR 20, 10 and TPR 10, 5 was evaluated. It was found that this new beam quality specifier more accurately predicted stopping power ratios for flattening filter-free photon beams.

40|$|In some {{linear accelerators}} (Linac), the {{collected}} charges in beam monitor chamber (BMC) is partly {{caused by the}} backscattered particles from the accelerator components downstream the BMC that influence the Linac output factors. In the intensity modulated radiation therapy technique, the desired dose distribution can be achieved through an unflattened beam. Although removing the <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> provides some advantages, the amount of backscatter radiation into BMC can be changed. In this study, contribution of backscattered particles into the BMC response of a Varian 2300 C/D Linac with and without a <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> was determined for 6, 18 MV photon beams. The experimental procedure included telescopic method and calculation procedure consisted of Monte Carlo simulation (MCNPX, version 2. 4. 0), were used to investigate the contribution of backscattered particles into the BMC performance. Our results showed a 2. 3 and 3 increase in backscatter for a 0. 5 x 0. 5 cm 2 field compared to a 40 x 40 cm 2 field for 6 MV and 18 MV, respectively. The energy deposition from backscattered radiation is mainly caused by backscattered electrons.

40|$|Polarization {{sensitive}} {{mode coupling}} characteristics of tilted fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) have been exploited {{to develop a}} number of useful devices including fibre polarimeters, gain <b>flattening</b> <b>filters,</b> spectrum analyzers, polarization dependent loss (PDL) compensators, reconfigurable optical add / drop multiplexers (ROADM), as well as interferometric, and surface plasmon based sensors. Recently it was demonstrated that a single grating structure could couple the light guided in a fibre to two azimuthally separated, polarization independent, radiated beams. However the reasons for such behaviour had not been fully explained, precluding the complete understanding, exploitation and optimization of this phenomenon. This thesis explains the mechanisms underlying such behaviour through a thorough analytical examination of an existing equation formulated with the Volume Current Method (VCM), quantifying {{the degree to which}} a tilted FBG's radiation field is directionally dependent on the phase matching characteristics of a grating's three-dimensional structure as well as the polarization dependent dipole response of the medium itself. Examination of the equation's parameter space, revealed the possibility of three-beam azimuthal responses as well, and resulted in some guidelines for the design and optimization of these devices. Experimental measurements of the out-tapped field are also provided, clearly confirming these theoretical findings and reporting the fabrication of a three-beam azimuthal response grating for the first time. Drawing upon these advances, an improved polarimeter design is proposed that samples more than four detected beams with only two tilted FBGs, theoretically resulting in average Stokes vector error reductions of roughly 20 %, facilitating monitoring at lower signal to noise ratios (SNRs). Finally, this thesis undertakes an analysis and re-derivation of the VCM formulation itself, designed to expand its applicability to FBGs written with ultrafast pulsed lasers, address some of the potentially limiting assumptions identified by Li et al, and provide users with computationally efficient formulae that are as accurate as possible...|$|R

Indicators of agreement between the experimental data and the simulation results obtained with the proposed geometrical model were the dose differences, the root-mean-square error and the gamma index. The same comparisons were performed for dose profiles obtained from Monte Carlo simulations using the phase-space files distributed by Varian for the TrueBeam linac as the sources of particles. Results of comparisons show a good agreement of the dose for the ansatz geometry similar to that obtained for the simulations with the TrueBeam phase-space files for all fields and depths considered, except for the 40 x 40 cm(2) field where the ansatz geometry was able to reproduce the measured dose more accurately.

Additionally, we hypothesize that {{removal of the}} <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> will result in an enhanced relative biological effectiveness independent of the dose rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clonogenic survival was assessed after exposure to dose rates of 4 or 24 Gy/min (FFF 10 megavolt [MV] photon beam) using a Varian TrueBeam accelerator. Additionally, cells were exposed to 4 Gy/min with or without <b>flattening</b> <b>filter.</b> Relative biological effectiveness estimations were performed comparing the different beam photon spectra. RESULTS: Cell survival in tumor and normal cell lines was not influenced by high dose rate irradiation. The intrinsic radiation sensitivity of DNA repair deficient cells was not affected by high dose rate compared to normal dose rate. Furthermore, the relative biological effectiveness was {{not significantly different from}} unity in any of the cell lines for both FFF and conventional flattened beam exposures.

Recently, clinical linacs have been implemented without the <b>flattening</b> <b>filter,</b> and published theoretical analysis suggested that with these beams a dosimetric error of order 0. 6 % could be expected for IAEA TRS- 398, because the TPR 20, 10 beam quality index does not accurately predict the stopping power ratio (water to air) for the softer flattening-filter-free (FFF) beam spectra.

Our aim in this work is to investigate the sensitivity of the photon-beam subsource distributions in a MC source model (with target, primary collimator, and <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> photon subsources and an electron subsource) for 6 - and 18 -MV photon beams when the energy and radial distributions of initial electrons striking a linac target change. For this purpose, phase-space data (PSD) was calculated for various mean electron energies striking the target, various normally distributed electron energy spread, and various normally distributed electron radial intensity distributions. All PSD was analyzed in terms of energy, fluence, and energy fluence distributions, which were compared between the different parameter sets. The energy spread was found to have a negligible influence on the subsource distributions. The mean energy and radial intensity significantly changed the target subsource distribution shapes and intensities. For the primary collimator and <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> subsources, the distribution shapes of the fluence and energy fluence changed little for different mean electron energies striking the target, however, their relative intensity compared with the target subsource change, which can be accounted for by a scaling factor. This study indicates that adjustments to MC source models can likely be limited to adjusting the target subsource in conjunction with scaling the relative intensity and energy spectrum of the primary collimator, <b>flattening</b> <b>filter,</b> and electron subsources when the energy and radial distributions of the initial electron-beam change...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Recently, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in operating medical linear accelerators without a <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> Due to reduced scatter, leaf transmission and radiation head leakage a reduction of out-of-field dose is expected for <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> free beams. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the impact of unflattened beams on peripheral dose for advanced treatment techniques with a large number of MUs. Material and methods: An Elekta Precise linac was modified to provide 6 and 10 MV photon beams without a <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> Basic beam data were collected and implemented into the TPS Oncentra Masterplan (Nucletron). Leakage radiation, which predominantly contributes to peripheral dose at larger distances from the field edge, was measured using a Farmer type ionisation chamber SBRT (lung) and IMRT (prostate, head&neck) treatment plans were generated for 6 and 10 MV for both flattened and unflattened beams. All treatment plans were delivered to the relevant anatomic region of an anthropomorphic phantom which was extended by a solid water slab phantom. Dosimetric measurements were performed with TLD- 700 rods, radiochromic films and a Farmer type ionisation chamber The detectors were placed within the slab phantom and positioned along the isocentric longitudinal axis. Results: Using unflattened beams results in a reduction of treatment head leakage by 52 % for 6 and 65 % for 10 MV. Thus, peripheral doses were in general smaller for treatment plans calculated with unflattened beams. At about 20 cm distance from the field edge the dose was on average reduced by 23 and 31 % for the 6 and 10 MV SBRT plans. For the IMRT plans (10 MV) the average reduction was 16 % for the prostate and 18 % for the head&neck case, respectively. For all examined cases, the relative deviation between peripheral doses of flattened and unflattened beams was found to increase with increasing distance from the field. Conclusions: Removing the <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> lead to reduced peripheral doses for advanced treatment techniques. The relative difference between peripheral doses of flattened and unflattened beams was more pronounced when the nominal beam energy was increased. Patients may benefit by decreased exposure of normal tissue to scattered dose outside the field...|$|E
40|$|<b>Flattening</b> <b>filter</b> free (FFF) beams due {{to their}} non-uniformity, are sub-optimal for larger field sizes. The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{investigate}} the incident electron beam distributions that would produce flat FFF beams without the use of <b>flattening</b> <b>filter.</b> Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc codes have been performed to evaluate the feasibility of this approach. The dose distributions in water for open 6 MV beams were simulated using Varian 21 EX linac head model, which will be called <b>flattening</b> <b>filter</b> (FF) model. <b>Flattening</b> <b>filter</b> has then been removed from FF model, and MC simulations were performed using (1) 6 MeV electrons incident on the target, (2) 6 MeV electron beam with electron angular distributions optimized to provide as flat dose profiles as possible. Configuration (1) represents FFF beam while configuration (2) allowed producing a flat FFF (F 4) beam. Optimizations have also been performed to produce flattest profiles for a set of dose rates (DRs) in the range from 1. 25 to 2. 4 of the DR of FF beam. Profiles and percentage depth doses PDDs from 6 MV F 4 beams have been calculated and compared to those from FF beam. Calculated profiles demonstrated improved flatness of the FFF beams. In fact, up to field sizes within the circle of 35 cm diameter the flatness of F 4 beam at dmax was better or comparable to that of FF beam. At 20 cm off-axis the dose increased from 52 % for FFF to 92 % for F 4 beam. Also, profiles of F 4 beams did not change considerably with depth, and for large fields out-of-field dose was reduced by about a factor of two compared to FF beam. PDDs from F 4 beams were similar to those of FFF beam. The DR for the largest modeled (44 cm diameter) F 4 beam was higher than the DR from FF beam by a factor of 1. 25. It was shown that the DR can be increased while maintaining beam flatness, but at the cost of reduced field size. Comment: 13 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
