50|$|Traditional {{preparation}} of fried green tomatoes begins by cutting the tomatoes into approximately 1/4-inch (~0.6 cm) slices. They are then seasoned {{with salt and}} pepper, coated with plain, coarse cornmeal, and shallow fried in bacon fat {{for a few minutes}} <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> golden brown. Shallow frying is preferred, as the tomatoes do not float in the oil, which allows the weight of the tomato to press the cornmeal to the underside of the tomato. This negates the need for a 'wash' (see below).|$|E
50|$|The abdomen is {{flattened}} and has parallel sides. A suture along <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> {{the abdomen}} {{may be made}} up of fused plates.|$|R
5000|$|Stenoglossan or rachiglossan radula: each row has {{one central}} tooth and one lateral tooth on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> (<b>or</b> no lateral teeth in some cases) (most Neogastropoda).|$|R
5000|$|... 1 km2 {{means one}} square {{kilometre}} or {{the area of}} a square that measures 1000 m on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> 106 m2 (as opposed to 1000 square meters, which is the area of a square that measures 31.6 m on <b>each</b> <b>side).</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1 km3 {{means one}} cubic {{kilometre}} or {{the volume of}} a cube that measures 1000 m on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> 109 m3 (as opposed to 1000 cubic meters, which is the volume of a cube that measures 10 m on <b>each</b> <b>side).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Each {{field has}} at least one marker at each corner, on the centre line at <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> and 10 metres from each back line on <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> The goals consist of a marker on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> some {{mechanism}} at least half a metre deep to catch the ball [...]|$|R
2500|$|Other {{symbols are}} used to {{describe}} how a flag looks, such as whether it has a different design on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> if it is hung vertically, etc. [...] These are the symbols in general use: ...|$|R
25|$|A JW Fishers system offers side-scanning at 1200kHz {{with very}} high spatial resolution, {{optionally}} coupled with longer-range 600kHz (range 200ft at <b>each</b> <b>side)</b> <b>or</b> 100kHz (up to 2000ft per side, suitable for scanning large areas for big targets).|$|R
50|$|Small wheels {{used for}} steering, either one to <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> a single unit either {{in front of}} or behind the vehicle. It {{is a matter of}} debate as to whether such a vehicle would still {{properly}} be called a monowheel.|$|R
50|$|A JW Fishers system offers side-scanning at 1200 kHz {{with very}} high spatial resolution, {{optionally}} coupled with longer-range 600 kHz (range 200 ft at <b>each</b> <b>side)</b> <b>or</b> 100 kHz (up to 2000 ft per side, suitable for scanning large areas for big targets).|$|R
5000|$|The average global hectare would {{occupy the}} area of a {{standard}} hectare. A hectare ( [...] ; symbol ha) is a unit of area equal to 10000 m2 (a square 100 metres on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or,</b> a square 328.08 feet on <b>each</b> <b>side),</b> 2.471 acre, 0.00386102 square miles, or one square hectometre (100 metres squared).|$|R
50|$|To further {{balance the}} forces {{and spread out}} strain, a single large {{flywheel}} can be balanced by two half-size flywheels on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> the flywheels can be reduced in size to be a series of alternating layers spinning in opposite directions. However this increases housing and bearing complexity.|$|R
5000|$|Brunoise is {{a culinary}} knife cut {{in which the}} food item is first julienned and then turned a quarter turn and diced again, {{producing}} cubes of about 3 mm <b>or</b> less on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> 1/8-inch dice. In France, a [...] "brunoise" [...] cut is smaller, 1 to 2 mm on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> 1/16-inch dice. Some typical vegetables for a brunoise are carrots, celery, leeks, and turnips. The diced vegetables are blanched briefly in salty boiling water and then submerged in salted ice water {{for a few seconds}} to set the color. The brunoise is used as a garnish in many dishes; it is often used to garnish consommé. A brunoise should be consistent in size and shape, as this helps to create a pleasing and professional presentation.|$|R
50|$|False {{balance is}} a media bias in which journalists present an issue {{as being more}} {{balanced}} between opposing viewpoints than the evidence supports. Journalists may present evidence and arguments {{out of proportion to}} the actual evidence for <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> may omit information that would establish one side's claims as baseless.|$|R
50|$|With the canting keel {{handling}} the ballast functions, lateral resistance and steering {{can be managed}} separately with a foil (or pair of foils, either on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> fore and aft), such as daggerboards. This allows for much quicker maneuverability than traditional keelboats, with about half the weight usually required for ballast.|$|R
50|$|Most {{records have}} a locked groove {{at the end}} of <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> {{individual}} band. It is usually a silent loop which keeps the needle and tonearm from drifting into the label area. However, it is possible to record sound in this groove, and some artists have included looping audio in the locked groove.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{types of}} fast-swimming fish have a {{horizontal}} caudal keel just {{forward of the}} tail fin. Much like the keel of a ship, this is a lateral ridge on the caudal peduncle, usually composed of scutes (see below), that provides stability and support to the caudal fin. There may be a single paired keel, one on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> two pairs above and below.|$|R
50|$|Bull Run to Chancellorsville is a {{tactical}} wargame that offers the player {{the opportunity to}} command the first battles of the American Civil War. Six Civil War battles are included in Volume I. Two players may manage either the Confederate or Union army, with play also governed by applying one of three handicap levels to <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> a single player can request that the computer manage either army.|$|R
50|$|According to {{traditional}} design principles, a boat utilizing a leeboard either {{needs to have}} two retractable leeboards, one on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> a method of removing the leeboard and attaching it to either side while under way, because nearly all sailboats tack {{to work their way}} upwind (with the exception of the proa). However, some small sailboat designers claim to have created seaworthy vessels with only a single, fixed leeboard.|$|R
50|$|The thermal bump {{uses the}} {{thermoelectric}} effect, {{which is the}} direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage and vice versa. Simply put, a thermoelectric device creates a voltage {{when there is a}} different temperature on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> when a voltage is applied to it, it creates a temperature difference. This effect can be used to generate electricity, to measure temperature, to cool objects, or to heat them.|$|R
5000|$|Air combats are fought between fighter {{units from}} <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> between fighter units and other units, like strategic, naval or {{tactical}} bombers. The non-fighter unit types are generally easily destroyed in air-to-air combat, and air-combats are usually fought to hinder the opposing player's non-fighter aircraft in performing a bombing, resupply <b>or</b> paradrop mission. <b>Each</b> <b>side</b> divides its aircraft units into fighters and either bombers or air transports, in two sequences of units numbered from first to last. The first unit {{is called the}} [...] "front fighter" [...] or [...] "front bomber".|$|R
50|$|Crash cymbals were {{traditionally}} {{placed on the}} left side of the drum set (for a right-handed drummer), since the normally larger ride cymbal is usually on the right, however some drummers set up their crash on the right. Often a drummer will have multiple crashes, and so may set them up with one <b>or</b> two on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> less commonly, with one mounted very closely above another, usually larger crash or ride.|$|R
5000|$|A {{medium-sized}} tree, it {{can grow}} to 15 m tall. Major trunks have a dark, hard bark that is furrowed. In contrast, smaller branches {{near the top}} of the canopy have smooth white bark (hence the names [...] "smooth-branched" [...] and [...] "gum-topped"). Leaves are alternate, concolorous (same colour in <b>each</b> <b>side)</b> <b>or</b> slightly discolorous and semi-glossy. The leaves range in size from 15 to 30 mm long. The woody fruits are 7 - 10 mm long.|$|R
5000|$|Earlier {{the iron}} ore {{transport}} from the mines in Ghelari to the chutes and tipplers of the ironworks from Govăjdia {{was done by}} horses with two baskets attached on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> other hired carriers until the demand and the price for the transported iron ore rose in 1859 from 18.6 Fillér/1 quintal to 53.6 Fillér/1 quintal of transported iron ore. Because of the rising expenses for the transportation of iron ore, the administration was forced to replace the transport system.|$|R
5|$|Like the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament (1999), the game includes almost every character from past Tekken games, {{giving it the}} largest playable roster in a Tekken game to date. Players can choose either a team of two characters on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> a solo character. Tekken Tag Tournament 2 has been positively received by critics, earning averaged review scores {{in the range of}} 82-83% at both GameRankings and Metacritic for the PlayStation 3, Wii U and Xbox 360 versions, as well as several fighting-game-of-the-year awards.|$|R
50|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of a {{freelance}} journalist who has just arrived in Jerusalem facing challenges. The goal is to create and get an article published for a newspaper by collecting quotes from the dialog in the game. The player can either get information by building up trust with <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> take a more confrontational approach to dig out information. In the end, the story with the most news-value will get the best exposure. The player must be careful what they submit for print, because it will affect their standings with both sides.|$|R
25|$|The {{band was}} backed by both an six-member {{instrumental}} band and a complement of ten backup dancers (five male and five female). The band would sometimes split up and perform with one member to <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> corner of the stage, but {{for much of the}} show, they performed to one side at a time, circling the stage (often as part of the choreographed dancing) throughout each song. The backup dancers sometimes performed for opposite side of the stage as the band. A video feed of the show was shown on video screens circling the overhead lighting rig.|$|R
2500|$|The {{defensive}} armament of the PBB {{consisted of}} five powered turrets, equipped with Browning [...]50 M2 machine guns. They were {{installed in the}} nose, in the tail, on the upper fuselage just aft of {{the trailing edge of}} the wing, and in two waist positions at the rear fuselage. Except for the waist guns, the turrets had two guns each. Offensive armament could consist of up to 20,000lb of bombs in internal bomb bays in the wing center section (five bays on <b>each</b> <b>side)</b> <b>or</b> of two Mk.13 or Mk.15 torpedoes slung under the wing center section.|$|R

50|$|The V-100 was a {{projected}} side-by-side twin-rotor combat aircraft from Kamov. It had a pusher propeller located behind the rear tailplane, {{to have the}} aircraft exceed {{a projected}} speed of 400 km/h. Integral gun armament was planned to consist of two mobile AO-9 single barrel derivatives of the GSh-23 (one on <b>each</b> <b>side)</b> <b>or</b> a single fixed AO-10 (early version of the GSh-30-1). Other weapons would have included the Kh-25 missile and other stores on two high capacity fuselages {{and a total of}} six underwing hardpoints with a combined warload of up to 3000 kg. This project was abandoned and only one model of the aircraft exists.|$|R
50|$|The modern {{embankment}} may {{be constructed}} within a cofferdam: two parallel {{steel sheet pile}} or concrete retaining walls, anchored to each other with steel cables or rods. This construction may {{also serve as a}} dyke that keeps two bodies of water apart, such as bodies with a different water level on <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> with salt water on one side and fresh water on the other. This may also be the primary purpose of a structure, the road providing a hardened crest for the dike, slowing erosion {{in the event of an}} overflow. It also provides access for maintenance as well perhaps, as a public service.|$|R
50|$|Tennis {{is played}} on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, and 27 ft wide for singles matches and 36 ft for doubles matches. Additional clear space around the court is {{required}} in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it into two equal ends. It is held up by either a metal cable or cord that can {{be no more than}} 0.8 cm. The net is 3 ft high at the posts and 3 ft high in the center. The net posts are 3 ft outside the doubles court on <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or,</b> for a singles net, 3 ft outside the singles court on <b>each</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
40|$|A new-type of {{weldable}} composite {{steel plate}} shear wall, {{which consists of}} a steel plate sandwiched by either of two or one composite panels at <b>each</b> <b>side</b> <b>or</b> at one <b>side,</b> has been proposed. An analytical model for such shear wall – via shell model is derived and the vibrational modes are discussed. Truss reinforcement is used to increase the integration between the steel and composite layers and the cross sectional properties were graded by magnetic nanoparticles fillers. The thickness shear modes at the composite wall appear {{higher than those of}} thickness stretch modes, but they are varied in a very orderly manner with respect to the vibrational mode. Also, some of characteristics are examined...|$|R
