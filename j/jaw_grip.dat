50|$|The venom glands of the {{beaded lizard}} are {{modified}} salivary glands {{located in the}} reptile's lower jaw. Each gland has a separate duct leading {{to the base of}} its grooved teeth. When biting, the beaded lizard hangs on its victim and chews to get its venomous saliva into the wound. Although its <b>jaw</b> <b>grip</b> is strong, its unsocketed teeth are easily broken off at their bases. The beaded lizard's venom is a weak hemotoxin, and although human deaths are rare, it can cause respiratory failure. It consists of a number of components, including L-amino acid oxidase, hyaluronidase, phospholipase A, serotonin, and highly active kallikreins that release vasoactive kinins. The venom contains no enzymes that significantly affect coagulation. Almost all documented human bites (eight in the past century) have resulted from prodding captive lizards with a finger or bare foot.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{this type}} of chuck has 4 or 6 jaws instead of 3. More <b>jaws</b> <b>grip</b> the {{workpiece}} more securely if it is truly cylindrical, and thin-walled work will deform less. Four jaws are also useful for square bar work.|$|R

40|$|Military and {{aerospace}} industries use Mil-Spec type electrical connections on bulkhead panels that require inline access for mate and demate operations. These connectors are usually in tight proximity to other connectors, or recessed within panels. The pliers described {{here have been}} designed to work in such tight spaces, and consist of a mirrored set of parallel handles, two cross links, two return springs, and replaceable polyurethane-coated end effectors. The polyurethane eliminates metal-to-metal contact and provides a high-friction surface between the jaw and the connector. Operationally, the user would slide the pliers over the connector shell until the molded polyurethane lip makes contact with the connector shell edge. Then, by squeezing the handles, the end effector <b>jaws</b> <b>grip</b> the connector shell, allowing the connector to be easily disconnected by rotating the pliers. Mating the connector occurs by reversing the prescribed procedure, except the connector shell is placed into the jaws by hand. The molded lip within the jaw allows the user to apply additional force for difficult-to-mate connectors. Handle design has been carefully examined to maximize comfort, limit weight, incorporate tether locations, and improve ergonomics. They have been designed with an off-axis offset for wiring harness clearance, while placing the connector axis of rotation close to the user s axis of wrist rotation. This was done to eliminate fatigue during multiple connector panel servicing. To limit handle opening width, with user ergonomics in mind, the pliers were designed using a parallel jaw mechanism. A cross-link mechanism was used to complete this task, while ensuring smooth operation...|$|R

40|$|Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} a Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) {{procedure}} which is {{performed in the}} abdominal cavity. In this paper, the spleen tissue and a laparoscopic surgical grasper were modeled using ABAQUS software to investigate the tool-tissue interaction, considering large deformations for the spleen tissue. The spleen tissue was modeled as a hyper-elastic material. The laparoscopic grasper includes three <b>gripping</b> <b>jaws</b> that always remain parallel. The sliding can occur between the <b>gripping</b> <b>jaws</b> and the spleen tissue. It {{was found that the}} relationship between the pinch forces and push forces keeps its linearity in different values of friction coefficient (0 - 0. 3). The pushing force varies from 0 (N) in pinch force of 1 (N) and the frictionless situation to 6. 125 (N) in pinch force of 6 (N) and the friction coefficient equal to 0. 3. Changing the shape of jaws can increase the pushing force up to 100 %. The results could help surgeons to predict the correlation between grasping conditions and applied forces for a safe grasping procedure in the laparoscopic operations...|$|R

30|$|The red {{imported}} {{fire ant}} (RIFA) Solenopsis invicta is a globally invasive species, {{in part because}} it lives in high densities and may dominate potential food sources (Vinson 1994; Holway et al. 2002). The species is omnivorous, opportunistic, and exploits recently disturbed habitats by searching for food sources through a pheromonal pathway (Tschinkel et al. 1995; Taber 2000). The species utilizes a foraging distance of around 40  m from the mound (Martin et al. 1998). Evolution has modified the ants' sting in various ways to produce chemical substances to inject in, smear upon, or expel predators and potential competitors (Hölldobler and Wilson 1990). Unlike many other ants, S. invicta only uses its <b>jaws</b> to <b>grip,</b> and instead uses its abdominal petiole to inject 0.01 to 0.11  μl of poison (Tschinkel 2006). Furthermore, these ants use their poison for prey capture in territorial disputes and for colony defense (Haight and Tschinkel 2003).|$|R

5000|$|Ratchet-based pencils are {{a variant}} of the clutch pencil, in which the lead is held in place by two or three small jaws inside a ring at the tip. The jaws are {{controlled}} by a button on the end or the side of the pencil. When the button is pushed, the jaws move forward and separate, allowing the lead to advance. When the button is released and the jaws retract, the [...] "lead retainer" [...] (a small rubber device inside the tip) keeps the lead in place, preventing the lead from either falling freely outward or riding back up into the barrel until the <b>jaws</b> recover their <b>grip.</b> Other designs use a precisely-fitted metal sleeve to guide and support the lead, and do not need a rubber retainer.|$|R
25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities.

Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper <b>jaws</b> and <b>grip</b> the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off rollers grip the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike Poma's grips, Doppelmayr grips are double {{position}} grips. When {{the chair}} enters a terminal, the angled roller is pushed {{down by a}} metal strip, which opens a <b>grip</b> <b>jaw.</b> The jaw remains open until the chair reattaches to the cable upon departing the terminal. Grip clamping force is measured {{just prior to the}} double position grips reattaching to the haul rope while a carrier (chair) is exiting the terminal, in contrast to Poma's grips, in which grip force can be measured as the grip travels through the contour. Insufficient grip force triggers an alarm and brings the lift to a halt before the carrier reaches the first breakover tower after the terminal. Because of this design, most Doppelmayr detachable lifts are designed to allow operation in reverse. This allows a grip force-alarmed grip and carrier to be backed into the terminal for inspection or removal.|$|R

5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its buccal cavity {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its <b>jaws</b> forward to <b>grip</b> the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows.
