50|$|Gene {{trapping}} is a high-throughput {{approach that}} is used to introduce insertional mutations across the mammalian genome. It is performed with gene trap vectors whose principal element is a gene trapping cassette consisting of a promoterless reporter gene and/or selectable genetic marker flanked by an upstream 3’ splice site (splice acceptor; SA) and a downstream transcriptional termination sequence (polyadenylation sequence; polyA). When inserted into an intron of an expressed gene, the gene trap cassette is transcribed from the endogenous promoter of that gene {{in the form of a}} fusion transcript in which the exon(s) upstream of the insertion site is spliced in frame to the reporter/selectable marker gene. Since transcription is terminated prematurely at the inserted polyadenylation site, the processed fusion transcript encodes a truncated and nonfunctional version of the cellular protein and the reporter/selectable marker. Thus, gene traps simultaneously inactivate and report the expression of the trapped gene at the insertion site, and provide a <b>DNA</b> <b>tag</b> (gene trap sequence tag, GTST) for the rapid identification of the disrupted gene.An international public consortium International Gene Trap Consortium is centralizing the data and cell lines can be requested from them.|$|E

The assay detects a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) surface protein using an antibody bound to a 15 -nm gold nanoparticle cofunctionalized with thiolated DNA complementary to a hybridized 76 -base <b>tag</b> <b>DNA</b> with a <b>tag</b> DNA/antibody ratio of 50 : 1.

40|$|Replication-incompetent {{retroviral}} vectors encoding histochemical reporter genes {{have been used}} for studying lineal relationships in a variety of species. A crucial element in the interpretation of data generated by this method is the identification of sibling relationships, or clonal boundaries. The use of a library of viruses in which each member is unique can greatly facilitate this aspect of the analysis. A previously reported murine retroviral library containing about 80 members demonstrated the utility of the library approach. However, the relatively low number of tags in the murine library necessitated using low infection rates in order to give confidence in clonal assignments. To obviate the need for low infection rates, a far more complex library was created and characterized. The CHAPOL library was constructed such that each member encodes a histochemical reporter gene and has a <b>DNA</b> <b>tag</b> derived from a degenerate oligonucleotide pool synthesized to have a complexity of > 1 x 10 (7). The library was tested after infection of cells in vitro or in vivo. The <b>DNA</b> <b>tag</b> from each histochemically labeled cell or clone of cells was recovered by PCR and sequenced for unambiguous identification. Three hundred and twenty tags have been identified after infection, and so far no tag has been seen to result from more than one independent infection.

To extend the yeast <b>DNA</b> <b>tag</b> methodology {{to a wide variety}} of microorganisms and applications, we have created a universal, sequence-verified TagModule collection. A hallmark of the 4280 TagModules is that they are cloned into a Gateway entry vector, thus facilitating rapid transfer to any compatible genetic system.

Our results demonstrate the optimal hybridization properties of the TagModule collection, the flexibility in applying the strategy to diverse microorganisms and the biological insights that can be gained from fitness profiling tagged mutant collections.

40|$|Cells {{are divided}} into {{compartments}} and separated from the environment by lipid bilayer membranes. Essential molecules are transported {{back and forth across}} the membranes. We have investigated how folded proteins use narrow transmembrane pores to move between compartments. During this process, the proteins must unfold. To examine co-translocational unfolding of individual molecules, we tagged protein substrates with oligonucleotides to enable potential-driven unidirectional movement through a model protein nanopore, a process that differs fundamentally from extension during force spectroscopy measurements. Our findings support a four-step translocation mechanism for model thioredoxin substrates. First, the <b>DNA</b> <b>tag</b> is captured by the pore. Second, the oligonucleotide is pulled through the pore, causing local unfolding of the C terminus of the thioredoxin adjacent to the pore entrance. Third, the remainder of the protein unfolds spontaneously. Finally, the unfolded polypeptide diffuses through the pore into the recipient compartment. The unfolding pathway elucidated here differs from those revealed by denaturation experiments in solution, for which two-state mechanisms have been proposed.
