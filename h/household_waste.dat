Despite the obvious imperative for research to identify key factors that motivate, enable or prevent <b>household</b> food <b>waste</b> reduction, little research to date has directly addressed this objective. The research presented in this thesis had two clear aims: (1) to investigate antecedents of <b>household</b> food <b>waste</b> reduction and barriers to change, and (2) to explore whether self-affirmation techniques can increase motivation to reduce <b>household</b> food <b>waste.</b> Four empirical studies were conducted. The first study qualitatively explored thoughts, feelings and experiences of 15 UK household food purchasers.

40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{management}} {{is one of the}} most challenging issues and problems faced by many governments of the developing countries across the world. Improper and poor municipal {{solid waste management}} in most developing countries has left a serious and negative impact on the environment. Consequently, it has been identified as one of the main environmental issues in Malaysia. The main objective of this study was to examine the factors that affect municipal <b>household</b> solid <b>waste</b> management in Section 17, Shah Alam and the impact on the environment. This study examined the relationship between (i) households’ lifestyle, (ii) attitude and awareness towards municipal <b>household</b> solid <b>waste</b> management, (iii) the provision of facilities and services provided for municipal <b>household</b> solid <b>waste</b> and the impact on the environment. A total of 379 households in Section 17, Shah Alam, Selangor selected as the sample for this study. A set of questionnaire was distributed to the respondents and analyzed. The results demonstrated significant relationships between households’ lifestyle, attitude and awareness towards municipal <b>household</b> solid <b>waste</b> management, the provision of facilities and services provided for municipal <b>household</b> solid <b>waste</b> and the impact on the environment. The results also revealed that households’ lifestyle was the most significant factor that affects municipal <b>household</b> solid <b>waste</b> management impacting on the environment.

40|$|Accumulation {{of solid}} <b>household</b> <b>wastes</b> {{and rates of}} their growth {{in the world as}} a whole and in Ukraine - in {{particular}} caused the raise of concerns among population. One of the reasons of this situation is that solid <b>household</b> <b>wastes</b> represent the irrational use of scarce natural resources. In addition to this wastes accumulation on landfills or their incineration causes pollution, which may result in the increase of morbidity rate. In the developed countries of the world measures on the regulation of solid <b>household</b> <b>wastes</b> generation and treatment are undertaken for about 30 years. Due to this new approaches of wastes treatment were developed as well as new types of packaging - one of the main compounds of the solid <b>household</b> <b>wastes</b> in the modern world. In the meantime recycling and reuse of scrap are the most preferred ways of waste treatment in leading countries of the world. That allows to use same materials for several times without extraction of raw materials as well as it saves space on landfills. Pollution of air and groundwaters is decreasing in turn. But in Ukraine the situation with regulation of solid <b>household</b> <b>wastes</b> is quite opposite. There are a lot of overloaded landfills and dumps. Most part of that landfills as well as incineration plants does not correspond to the ecological safety requirements. Ukrainian legislation on the wastes treatment is far from perfect. Taking into account all of the preceding it was assumed that to improve situation in Ukraine it would be useful to analyze the experience of leading countries in the field of the regulation of wastes generation and treatment. As long as Germany is a world leader in this field and industrial enterprises are directly engaged in the process of diminishing volumes of solid <b>household</b> <b>wastes</b> and their further recycling there this country appears to be a good example for that matter. On the ground of the presented in the paper German experience of the regulation of solid <b>household</b> <b>wastes</b> treatment as well as account of economic, institutional, environmental and some other peculiarities of Ukraine recommendations on the improvement of regulation of solid household wastesgeneration and treatment was offered.

40|$|Background & Aims of the Study : <b>Household</b> {{hazardous}} <b>waste</b> is {{an important}} part of municipal solid waste in any community and if it is not managed properly, it can significantly damage the health of family, community and environment. The present study aimed at evaluating the knowledge, attitude and practices of households regarding the management of <b>household</b> hazardous <b>wastes</b> in Amirkola, Mazandaran, Iran. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 330 households of Amirkola, Mazandaran, Iran in the summer of 2014. A researcher-made data collection form in accordance with the objectives of the study was used to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices of Iranian urban residents regarding the management of <b>household</b> hazardous <b>wastes</b> through observation of researchers and interview. The validity of the data collection form was confirmed by five faculty members of the Departments of Environmental Health and Community Medicine. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 19, descriptive statistical indexes, T-test and Chi- square tests, and p< 0. 05 was considered as significant level. Results : The mean age of studied people was 39. 1 ± 10 years and 51. 5 % had high school and diploma degrees. In this study, 75 %, 36. 7 % and 6. 3 % of households were good in the knowledge, attitude and practices, respectively. A major part of <b>household</b> hazardous <b>wastes</b> (78 %) was the containers of disinfectants and detergents. 43. 6 % and 10. 3 % of households separated the <b>household</b> <b>wastes</b> and <b>household</b> hazardous <b>wastes,</b> respectively and no one recycled these wastes at home. 30 % of households expressed that the lack of proper management of municipal on collecting the separated wastes as a major factor in the reluctance of them in waste separation. 86. 7 % of people need to get information about it. Conclusion : Despite appropriate knowledge of surveyed households on different kinds of <b>household</b> hazardous <b>wastes,</b> most of them had no good attitude and practices and most of them did not separate and recycle the wastes. It is necessary to train the households because of the central role of families in improving the public and environmental health and their tendency to get information on the management of <b>household</b> hazardous <b>wastes.</b>  ...|$|R
