5|$|Following his 83rd aerial victory, Müncheberg {{was summoned}} to his {{commanding}} officer, Geschwaderkommodore Schöpfel, who informed him of his transfer to Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG51—51st Fighter Wing) on the Eastern Front. Müncheberg was destined to become a Geschwaderkommodore but prior to receiving his own command <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> serve as a Kommodore in training. He went on a three weeks home leave, staying at his parents home, before he received his orders to head east on 21 July 1942.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{interference}} in the Elimination Chamber match to prevent The Undertaker from winning, Shawn Michaels cut a promo on the next episode of Raw, stating that he interfered so that The Undertaker would agree to a rematch at WrestleMania XXVI to get revenge. The Undertaker accepted the match {{on the condition that}} if Michaels lost, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> retire, to which Michaels agreed. Two weeks later, the pair agreed to make the match a no countout, no disqualification match.|$|E
5|$|Marthinus Pretorius {{hoped to}} achieve either {{federation}} or amalgamation with the Orange Free State, {{but before he}} could contemplate this <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> unite the Transvaal. In 1855 he appointed an eight-man constitutional commission, including Kruger, which presented a draft constitution in September that year. Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg rejected the proposals, calling for a less centralised government. Pretorius tried again during 1856, holding meetings with eight-man commissions in Rustenburg, Potchefstroom and Pretoria, but Stephanus Schoeman, Zoutpansberg's new Commandant-General, repudiated these efforts.|$|E

Jan duly moved from Riebeek West to Stellenbosch, spending early 1886 to late 1886 preparing for this test.|$|E

5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> earn it through his own publicly proven merits.|$|E
5|$|To {{allow the}} Sa'iqa company to perform its landing, the Port Said Sector {{was to be}} {{supplied}} 24 assault dinghies.

Khalid resorted to renting two fishing boats. Consequently, the Sa'iqa company was tasked with simply isolating the fort; no attack from the east would be carried out.|$|E

5|$|Victoria came to {{the throne}} aged {{eighteen}} on 20 June 1837. Her letters of the time show interest in Albert's education for the role <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play, although she resisted attempts to rush her into marriage. In the winter of 1838–39, the prince visited Italy, accompanied by the Coburg family's confidential adviser, Baron Stockmar.|$|E
5|$|After Lyons began programming, Billings {{started to}} study the video games market. He visited local game stores and {{attended}} a San Francisco gaming convention. Billings approached Tom Shaw from Avalon Hill—the company produced many war games that Billings played as a child—and {{one of the founders}} of Automated Simulations to share market data, but aroused no interest. The lukewarm responses made Billings believe <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> publish SSI's games. After Computer Bismarck was finished in January 1980, he searched for a graphic designer to handle the game's packaging.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp's father lived a mile (1.6km) from Cooke's estate, and {{the young}} man wanted to meet her. Beauchamp {{gradually}} gained Cooke's trust by visiting under the guise of borrowing books from her library. By summer 1821, the two became friends and began a courtship. Beauchamp was eighteen; Cooke was at least thirty-four. As the courtship progressed, Cooke told Beauchamp that, before they could be married, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> kill Solomon Sharp. Beauchamp agreed to her request, expressing his own desire to dispatch Sharp.|$|E

It was the final Great American Bash {{produced}} by World Championship Wrestling before the acquisition of WCW by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) the following March. Shane Douglas put the Wall through three tables {{at the same time}} to win. The first wrestler to put their opponent through three tables would win the match. Hollywood Hogan pinned Billy Kidman after hitting him with brass knuckles to become number one contender to the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. If Hogan <b>had</b> lost, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> retire. If Ric Flair had lost his match, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> retire. Vampiro set Sting on fire to win the match. Jeff Jarrett pinned Kevin Nash after a Spear from Goldberg. Konnan was guest bellringer, Rey Misterio Jr. was guest timekeeper, Disqo was guest beltkeeper, Juventud Guerrera was guest ring announcer. After the match, Goldberg joined the New Blood.|$|R

5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible.

Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E
5|$|Chester {{had planned}} to retire in June 2009, and the {{congregation}} embarked on {{a search for a}} new senior rabbi in 2008.

While the search was progressing, Chester had realized that, due to the 2008 financial crisis, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep working. After the main candidate withdrew, the synagogue's president approached Chester, asking if he would stay on for another term, which Chester agreed to do. Chester retired in June 2011, becoming (along with Broude) Rabbi Emeritus.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{infusion}} of cash, the banks of New York were reluctant to make the short-term loans they typically provided to facilitate daily stock trades.

At 1:30p.m. Thursday, October 24, Ransom Thomas, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, rushed to Morgan's offices to tell him that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> close the exchange early.

5|$|Fearing {{that the}} guerrilla war would spread south, the South African {{government}} pressured Rhodesia {{to advance the}} process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained. After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974. He moved in with his sister Sabina {{at her home in}} Highfield township. He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the guerrilla war, recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take command of ZANLA. This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominantly between members of the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona.|$|E
5|$|Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the {{screenplay}} and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel {{as president and}} Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of {{the cast and crew}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. The cast and crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Las Casas was {{studying}} {{a passage in}} the book Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 34:18–22 for a Pentecost sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced that all {{the actions of the}} Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. He made up his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists should do the same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go to Spain to fight there against the enslavement and abuse of the native people. Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.|$|E
