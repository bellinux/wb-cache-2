Breast expression with manual or electric breast pumps is promoted for the initiation and maintenance of lactation in this critical period. In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and maternal comfort of sequential versus simultaneous breast expression in newly delivered mothers whose infants were admitted to NICU. Materials and Methods: Thirty five mothers were followed prospectively for milk expression either sequentially (n= 21, group 1) or simultaneously (n= 14, group 2) with breast pumps for 10 days. The total amount of milk expressed per day and per each period was recorded together with the duration of breast expression. The mothers’ impressions about the easiness and comfort of the procedure, and their satisfaction {{with the amount of}} milk were evaluated with a questionnaire {{at the end of the}} study. Results: The amounts of expressed milk per day and per each <b>expression</b> <b>period</b> were similar in both groups.

40|$|International audienceMotivation: Identifying the set {{of genes}} {{differentially}} expressed along time is an important task in two-sample time course experiments. Furthermore, estimating at which time <b>periods</b> the differential <b>expression</b> is present can provide additional insight into temporal gene functions. The current differential detection methods are designed to detect difference along observation time intervals or on single measurement points, warranting dense measurements along time to characterize the full temporal differential expression patterns. Results: We propose a novel Bayesian likelihood ratio test to estimate the differential <b>expression</b> time <b>periods.</b> Applying the ratio test to systems of genes provides the temporal response timings and durations of gene expression to a biological condition. We introduce a novel non-stationary Gaussian process as the underlying expression model, with major improvements on model fitness on perturbation and stress experiments.

40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila {{circadian}} clock {{consists of}} two interlocked transcriptional feedback loops. In one loop, dCLOCK/CYCLE activates <b>period</b> <b>expression,</b> and <b>PERIOD</b> protein then inhibits dCLOCK/CYCLE activity. dClock is also rhythmically transcribed, but its regulators are unknown. vrille (vri) and Par Domain Protein 1 (Pdp 1) encode related transcription factors whose expression is directly activated by dCLOCK/CYCLE. We show here that VRI and PDP 1 proteins feed back and directly regulate dClock expression. Repression of dClock by VRI is separated from activation by PDP 1 since VRI levels peak 3 - 6 hours before PDP 1. Rhythmic vri transcription is required for molecular rhythms, and here we show that the clock stops in a Pdp 1 null mutant, identifying Pdp 1 as an essential clock gene. Thus, VRI and PDP 1, together with dClock itself, comprise a second feedback loop in the Drosophila clock that gives rhythmic expression of dClock, and probably of other genes, to generate accurate circadian rhythms...|$|R
40|$|Key {{aspects of}} seed {{development}} in flowering plants {{are held to}} be under epigenetic control and to have evolved {{as a result of}} conflict between the interests of the male and female gametes (kinship theory). Attempts to identify the genes involved have focused on imprinted sequences, although imprinting is only one mechanism by which male or female parental alleles may be exclusively expressed immediately post-fertilization. We have studied the expression of a subset of endosperm gene classes immediately following interploidy crosses in maize and show that departure from the normal 2 : 1 ratio between female and male genomes exerts a dramatic effect on the timing of expression of some, but not all, genes investigated. Paternal genomic excess prolongs the expression of early genes and delays accumulation of reserves, while maternal genomic excess foreshortens the <b>expression</b> <b>period</b> of early genes and dramatically brings forward endosperm maturation. Our data point to a striking interdependence between the phases of endosperm development, and are consonant with previous work from maize showing progression from cell proliferation to endoreduplication is regulated by the balance between maternal and paternal genomes, and from Arabidopsis suggesting that this ‘phasing’ is regulated by maternally expressed imprinted genes.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{advances}} in sociogenomics allow for comparative analyses of molecular mechanisms regulating {{the development of}} social behavior. In eusocial insects, one key aspect of their sociality, the division of labor, has received the most attention. Age-related polyethism, a derived form of division of labor in ants and bees where colony tasks are allocated among distinct behavioral phenotypes, has traditionally been {{assumed to be a}} product of convergent evolution. Previous work has shown that the circadian clock is associated with the development of behavior and division of labor in honeybee societies. We cloned the ortholog of the clock gene, period, from a harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex occidentalis) and examined circadian rhythms and daily activity patterns in a species that represents an evolutionary origin of eusociality independent of the honeybee. Results Using real time qPCR analyses, we determined that harvester ants have a daily cyclic <b>expression</b> of <b>period</b> and this rhythm is endogenous (free-running under dark-dark conditions). Cyclic <b>expression</b> of <b>period</b> is task-specific; foragers have strong daily fluctuations but nest workers inside the nest do not. These patterns correspond to differences in behavior as activity levels of foragers show a diurnal pattern while nest workers tend to exhibit continuous locomotor activity at lower levels. In addition, we found that foragers collected in the early fall (relative warm, long days) exhibit a delay in the nightly peak of <b>period</b> <b>expression</b> relative to foragers collected in the early spring (relative cold, short days). Conclusion The association of <b>period</b> mRNA <b>expression</b> levels with harvester ant task behaviors suggests that the development of circadian rhythms is associated with the behavioral development of ants. Thus, the circadian clock pathway may represent a conserved 'genetic toolkit' that has facilitated the parallel evolution of age-related polyethism and task allocation in social insects. </p...|$|R

Newly expressed ion currents localized in defined plasma membrane areas were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique {{in combination with}} a specially designed chamber, that exposed {{only part of the}} surface on the oocytes to channel agonists or inhibitors. Newly expressed currents were found to be unequally distributed in the surface membrane of the oocyte. This asymmetry was most pronounced during the early phase of expression, when channels could almost exclusively be detected in the animal hemisphere of the oocyte. 4 d after injection of the mRNA, or later, channels could be found at a threefold higher density at the animal than at the vegetal pole area. The pattern of distribution was observed to be similar with various ion channels expressed from crude tissue mRNA and from cRNAs coding for rat GABAA receptor channel subunits. Electron microscopical analysis revealed very similar microvilli patterns at both oocyte pole areas. Thus, the asymmetric current distribution is not due to asymmetric surface structure.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess currently available transfection methods and optimize the best method for use with cultured fetal hepatocytes. The Rous sarcoma virus 5 ′ long terminal repeat controlling transcription of the β-galactosidase reporter gene (pRSV lac Z II) was used to assess electroporation, lipofection, DEAE-dextran and calcium phosphate transfection in cultured primary fetal hepatocytes. The success of transfection was determined by histochemical detection and quantitation of β-galactosidase activity. Results showed that calcium phosphate transfection was optimal for fetal hepatocytes with respect to β-galactosidase activity and cell survival. For maximum transfection of cells, 10 μg/ml DNA, HEPES buffered saline transfection buffer at pH 7. 05 and a 24 hr <b>expression</b> <b>period</b> for the reporter gene were employed. Glycerol shock did not increase transfection efficiency significantly. The method was simplified by adding calcium chloride solution to DNA diluted in transfection buffer and the resulting co-precipitate added directly to the medium covering the cells.

The suitability of this method was confirmed with a liver-specific promoter controlling β-galactosidase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression. In conclusion this study shows that a modified calcium phosphate transfection method is most effective for transferring DNA to primary cultured fetal hepatocytes. It is concluded that this method is appropriate for use with fetal hepatocytes and will facilitate studies of gene regulation during liver development...|$|E
