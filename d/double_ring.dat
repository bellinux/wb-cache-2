5|$|Agaricus bitorquis, also edible, has {{a similar}} appearance, but can be {{distinguished}} by its <b>double</b> <b>ring,</b> {{and the lack of}} a fishy or briny odor. Additionally, A.bitorquis does not stain reddish when cut, and usually does not have a scaly or warty cap. The Hungarian species A.bernardiiformis, named for its similarity to A.bernardii, is distinguished from the latter by its smaller spores (6.2–8.2 by 5.4–6.2μm) and its club-shaped cheilocystidia that measure 17–35 by 7–9.5μm. MycoBank, however, considers the two species to be conspecific.|$|E
5|$|The Dangerous Alliance was a {{dominant}} force in WCW. At {{one point during}} 1992, they held every title except the WCW World Title, which was held by their main opponent and arch enemy Sting. The war between the Dangerous Alliance and Sting and friends escalated until {{it was decided to}} settle it in a <b>double</b> <b>ring</b> War Games Match at WrestleWar 1992. Sting's team won when Sting forced Eaton to give up after Larry Zbyszko accidentally struck Eaton in the arm with a metal rod. This match would be given a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} last interment, the local rulers {{abandoned}} the shaft graves in favour {{of a new and}} more imposing form of tomb already developing in Messenia, south Peloponessus, the tholos. Around 1250 BC, when the fortifications of Mycenae were extended, the Grave Circle was included inside the new wall. A <b>double</b> <b>ring</b> peribolos wall was also built around the area. It appears that the site became a temenos (sacred precinct), while a circular construction, possibly an altar was found above one grave. The burial site had been replanned as a monument, an attempt by the 13th century BC Mycenean rulers to appropriate the possible heroic past of the older ruling dynasty. Under this context, the land surface was built up to make a level precinct for ceremonies, with the stelae over the graves being re-erected. A new entrance, the Lion Gate, was constructed near the site.|$|E

50|$|Five septins {{are found}} in A. nidulans (AnAspAp, AnAspBp, AnAspCp, AnAspDp, AnAspEp). AnAspBp forms single rings at {{septation}} sites that eventually split into <b>double</b> <b>rings.</b> Additionally, AnAspBp forms a ring at sites of branch emergence which broadens into a band as the branch grows. Like in C. albicans, <b>double</b> <b>rings</b> reflect polarity of the hypha. In the case of Aspergillus nidulans polarity is conveyed by disassembly of the more basal ring (the ring further away from the hyphal growth tip), leaving the apical ring intact, potentially as a growth guidance cue.|$|R

25|$|Conventional {{techniques}} for measuring in-situ infiltration {{include the use}} of a single or <b>double</b> <b>ring</b> infiltrometer. Single and <b>double</b> <b>ring</b> infiltrometer only measures flow under ponded (saturated) conditions, and when used in soil with distinct macropores, preferential flow will dominate the flow. (See: Poiseuille's law) This does not reflect infiltration under rainfall or sprinkler irrigation. Therefore, many authors attempted to create a negative potential (tension) on the water flow. This is to exclude macropores in the flow process, hence only measuring the soil matrix flow.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{of crude}} oil source or {{processing}} history, kerosene's major components are branched and straight chain alkanes and naphthenes (cycloalkanes), which normally account for at least 70% by volume.

Olefins are usually not present at more than 5% by volume.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{cyanobacterium}} Synechocystis PCC 6803 grown under short-term iron-deficient conditions assembles a supercomplex {{consisting of}} a trimeric Photosystem I (PSI) complex encircled by a ring of 18 IsiA complexes. Furthermore, {{it has been shown}} that single or <b>double</b> <b>rings</b> of IsiA with up to 35 copies in total can surround monomeric PSI. Here we present an analysis by electron microscopy and image analysis of the various PSI–IsiA supercomplexes from a Synechocystis PCC 6803 mutant lacking the PsaL subunit after short- and long-term iron-deficient growth. In the absence of PsaL, the tendency to form complexes with IsiA is still strong, but the average number of complete rings is lower than in the wild type. The majority of IsiA copies binds into partial <b>double</b> <b>rings</b> at the side of PsaF/J subunits rather than in complete single or <b>double</b> <b>rings,</b> which also cover the PsaL side of the PSI monomer. This indicates that PsaL facilitates the formation of IsiA rings around PSI monomers but is not an obligatory structural component in the formation of PSI–IsiA complexes...|$|R

25|$|CCT is {{required}} {{in order to ensure that}} folding takes place correctly. CCT is a group II cytosolic molecular chaperone (or chaperonin, a protein that assists in the folding of other macromolecular structures). CCT is formed of a <b>double</b> <b>ring</b> of eight different subunits (hetero-octameric) and it differs from other molecular chaperones, particularly from its homologue GroEL which is found in the Archaea, as it does not require a co-chaperone to act as a lid over the central catalytic cavity. Substrates bind to CCT through specific domains. It was initially thought that it only bound with actin and tubulin, although recent immunoprecipitation studies have shown that it interacts with a large number of polypeptides, which possibly function as substrates. It acts through ATP-dependent conformational changes that on occasion require several rounds of liberation and catalysis in order to complete a reaction.|$|E
