5|$|Fibonacci {{search is}} a method similar to binary search that {{successively}} shortens the interval in which the maximum of a unimodal function lies. Given a finite interval, a unimodal function, and the maximum length of the resulting interval, Fibonacci search finds a Fibonacci number such that if the interval is divided equally into that many subintervals, the subintervals would be shorter than the maximum length. After dividing the interval, it <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> subintervals in which the maximum cannot lie until one or more contiguous subintervals remain.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E

5|$|The role of {{the main}} {{caregiver}} is often taken by the spouse or a close relative. Alzheimer's disease is known for placing a great burden on caregivers which includes social, psychological, physical or economic aspects.

5|$|USB2.0 High-Speed Inter-Chip (HSIC) is a chip-to-chip {{variant of}} USB2.0 that <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> {{conventional}} analog transceivers found in normal USB.

HSIC uses two signals at 1.2V and has a throughput of 480Mbit/s. Maximum PCB trace length for HSIC is 10cm. It does not have low enough latency to support RAM sharing between two chips.|$|E

5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium oxides are basic; they easily {{convert to}} {{hydroxides}} and can form various salts, such as sulfates, phosphates, nitrates, etc. The nitrate is usually white {{but can be}} brown due to radiolytic decomposition. Heating the nitrate in air at 400°C converts it to the white protactinium pentoxide. The polytrioxophosphate Pa(PO3)4 can be produced by reacting difluoride sulfate PaF2SO4 with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) under inert gas atmosphere. Heating the product to about 900°C <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> reaction by-products such as hydrofluoric acid, sulfur trioxide and phosphoric anhydride. Heating to higher temperatures in an inert atmosphere decomposes Pa(PO3)4 into the diphosphate PaP2O7, which is analogous to diphosphates of other actinides. In the diphosphate, the PO3 groups form pyramids of C2v symmetry. Heating PaP2O7 in air to 1400°C decomposes it into the pentoxides of phosphorus and protactinium.|$|E
5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as Servodrive subwoofers whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E

5|$|The Brazilian {{subsidiaries}} of Magneti Marelli, Delphi and Bosch {{have developed}} and announced the introduction in 2009 {{of a new}} flex engine generation that <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> need for the secondary gasoline tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting, and allowing flex vehicles to do a normal cold start at temperatures as low as, the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. Another improvement is the reduction of fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions, between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start. The Flex Start system used by the Polo was developed by Bosch.|$|E
5|$|As the President of the United States {{refuses to}} loan dataDyne the Pelagic II, the conspirators plot {{to kill him}} and replace him with a dataDyne-grown clone. To {{accomplish}} their plans, an NSA strike team led by Trent Easton invades the air base from which Air Force One will depart. When Joanna foils this strike, the NSA along with some Scandinavians take over the plane itself, which crashes after an attempt to detach a craft attached to it. Having survived the crash, Joanna <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> President's clone and rescues the real President. Meanwhile, Easton is killed by one particular Scandinavian known as Mr. Blonde, who is revealed to be a Skedar in disguise. Without permission from the President, dataDyne decides to hijack the Pelagic II and reach the ancient spacecraft. However, unbeknownst to dataDyne, the Carrington Institute learns that the spacecraft contains a powerful weapon capable of destroying a planet and that the conspirators are actually Skedar aliens disguised as Scandinavian humans who intend to test the weapon on Earth before using it against the Maian homeworld.|$|E
5|$|Mayoral {{elections}} were originally run under a two-round system. If no candidate received {{a simple majority}} of votes in the general election, the two candidates who received the most votes competed in a second runoff election held several weeks later. In 2002, the election system for city officials was overhauled {{as a result of}} a citywide referendum. The new system, known as instant-runoff voting, allows voters to select and rank three candidates based on their preferences. If no one wins more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and second-choice votes (and third-choice votes, if necessary) are counted until a candidate captures the majority. This <b>eliminates</b> <b>the</b> need to hold a separate runoff election and saves money. This was first implemented in the 2004 Board of Supervisors election after two years of preparation. In 2007, the new system was implemented in the mayoral election for the first time.|$|E
