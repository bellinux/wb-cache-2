25|$|In 2008, The Roots {{stated that}} their final album would be Rising Down (2008), until drummer and {{producer}} for The Roots, Questlove, stated via his Twitter account that the band would release an album called How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Over</b> in the summer. How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Over</b> was recorded during The Roots' tenure {{as the house}} band for Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. It was recorded in sessions at several Philadelphia studios—A House Called Quest, Fruity Loops, The Boom Room, and The Studio—and at MSR Studios in New York City.|$|E
25|$|The album debuted {{at number}} six on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 51,000 copies {{in its first}} week. How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Over</b> {{received}} universal acclaim from music critics, several of whom named {{it one of the}} best albums of 2010.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow," [...] Trent said curtly. [...] "No more now! <b>I</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>over</b> my miserable journey yet. I'm {{going to}} try and get some sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack-pots?" [...] Fatty queried. At {{sight of}} an {{irritable}} movement, he added: [...] "You see, <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> <b>over</b> to the West like Delarouse and you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite {{understand}} it myself, mamma. I suppose that my eyes have been opened altogether. At any rate, I feel that I {{have had a}} very narrow escape. I was certainly very much worried when I first learned about this, two days ago, and I was even distressed; but I think that <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>over</b> the worry, and I am sure that <b>I</b> have quite <b>got</b> <b>over</b> the distress." ...|$|R

25|$|Undun is {{an existential}} concept album about the fictional {{character}} Redford Stevens, who {{is named after}} a Sufjan Stevens song. Its reverse-chronological narrative discusses his short, tragic life set in urban poverty. Expanding on the indie influence of the band's How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Over</b> (2010), the album's music is characterized by snare-driven beats, neo soul elements, keyboard soundscapes, strings, choral arrangements, and tight dynamics.|$|E
25|$|How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Over</b> is {{the ninth}} studio album by American hip hop band The Roots, {{released}} June 22, 2010 on Def Jam Recordings. It was produced primarily by band members Black Thought, Questlove, Dice Raw, and Rick Friedrich.

A hip hop album, its music also draws on indie rock, soul, funk, gospel, and neo soul styles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I think so. I {{was doing}} pretty well when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> run <b>over,</b> and things have since slackened down. My manager can look after them while I am away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't tell. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it <b>over</b> the 'phone. I {{ran over}} here. I {{knew where the}} key was. I've been here before--afternoons--dancing.... I let myself in.... But when they--they came <b>I</b> <b>got</b> frightened and hid in the closet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yours {{is a bad}} illness for a Snow-man!' {{said the}} yard-dog. 'I also {{suffered}} from it, but <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>over</b> it. Bow-wow!' he barked. 'The weather is going to change!' he added.|$|R
500|$|A popular {{high school}} girl. Knapp's {{character}} required nudity, something {{with which she}} was initially uncomfortable, stating [...] "I just {{had a lot of}} moral issues with it but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>over</b> it and I heard that it's not that revealing. So I’m relieved." [...] Knapp described her character as a tomboy, and was given the opportunity to add to the role, move beyond a [...] "hot chick" [...] archetype.|$|E
500|$|At {{the early}} stages of filming, stars Connelly and Bowie found it {{difficult}} to interact naturally with the puppets they shared most of their scenes with. Bowie told Movieline [...] "I had some initial problems working with Hoggle and the rest because, for one thing, what they say doesn't come from their mouths, but {{from the side of the}} set, or from behind you." [...] Connelly remarked, [...] "it was a bit strange , but I think both Dave [...] and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>over</b> that and just took it as a challenge to work with these puppets. And by the end of the film, it wasn't a challenge anymore. They were there, and they were their characters." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Forget" [...] {{was written}} by Lovato along with the Jonas Brothers, who {{produced}} it with John Fields. The song features Dorian Crozier and Michael Bland on drums, and Fields on bass, guitars and keyboards. Nick Jonas also played the guitar and percussion on the song. The song is registered as [...] "Did You Forget" [...] with the Broadcast Music, Inc. Lovato has stated that [...] "Don't Forget" [...] {{is one of the}} songs on Don't Forget that she relates to the most, and that she felt [...] "a lot of emotion while recording it". In an interview with PopEater, she elaborated, [...] "Everyone goes through the experience of falling in love, but then the other person just walks away, and goes somewhere else. I went through an experience like that and wanted to write about it. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>over</b> it, and now a year later I don't have those feelings about that person anymore." [...] The song and [...] "La La Land" [...] were included as bonus tracks on European editions of her sophomore album Here We Go Again.|$|E
60|$|And as I {{opened the}} window, the great bird soared {{away like a}} flash of light through the storm, leaving me so {{astonished}} at the whole performance that <b>I</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>over</b> it yet.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{tell you}} so. I {{have been a}} fool to say {{anything}} about it. However, <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>over</b> my envy now, and am ready to go out with your aunt. Here she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay! I wished I {{could have}} {{let you know}} sooner how well <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>over</b> it,' said Harry, in the deep full voice of strong healthy manhood. 'I am afraid you have been very anxious.' ...|$|R
500|$|Simpson {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the album's twelve songs as being similar to keeping a diary, and before the album's US release she said that [...] "My inspiration came from what I have gone through in the past three years. Every single day I was thinking of what I was going through and would write songs about it." [...] The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album's lyrical content was inspired by Simpson's breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has {{described the}} album as being [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "very true to my emotions"—"I wasn't afraid to say that I was hurting and how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>over</b> it." [...] Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album's producer, John Shanks—who won a Grammy in February 2005, in part for his work as producer on Autobiography—receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs. Kara DioGuardi also receives songwriting credit, together with Simpson and Shanks, on seven of the songs, including the three singles. (See the track listing.) ...|$|E
500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>over</b> my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Metacritic, How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Over</b> was the 15th-best {{reviewed}} {{album of}} 2010. Several critics included {{it in their}} top-10 records lists for the year; it was ranked number seven by Vibe, number five by both The A.V. Club and Todd Martens from the Los Angeles Times, number 10 by both Consequence of Sound and Jim DeRogatis, and number three by BBC Music. Christgau named How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Over</b> the year's best album and wrote in The Barnes & Noble Review, [...] "in 2010 what sounded best was the Roots' brave and sometimes painful change-of-life hip-hop, a multivalent reflection on the pop lifer's danger years, the late thirties." [...] He later called it the [...] "most substantial" [...] album of the Roots' career. How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Over</b> was also nominated for a 2011 Grammy Award {{in the category of}} Best Rap Album, but lost to Eminem's album Recovery.|$|E
60|$|CHR. I {{met with}} a gentleman so soon as <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>over</b> the Slough of Despond, who persuaded me that I might, in the village before me, find a man that could take off my burden.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, {{do not let}} us {{talk about}} it, now. You are {{restored}} to us, safe and sound; and though the loss was a heavy one, and crippled me for a time, <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>over</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't worry, Mr. Stubbs," [...] said Toby, {{anxious to}} reassure his friend, {{as he sat}} upright and looked about him. [...] "I didn't get hurt any; but I {{would like to know}} how <b>I</b> <b>got</b> way <b>over</b> here." ...|$|R
2500|$|How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Over</b> {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 86, based on 23 reviews. Reviewers praised the record's slow-grooving music, {{the contributions of}} its guest artists, and the lyrical depth of the songs. AllMusic's Andy Kellman described it as [...] "deeply planted in realism... gracefully and cleverly sequenced", while Rolling Stone critic Nathan Brackett highlighted The Roots' incorporation of indie rock elements into their [...] "in the pocket" [...] sound. Pitchforks Nate Patrin deemed How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Over</b> [...] "a particularly efficient album... the Roots' shortest (a lean 42 and a half minutes), {{one of their most}} lyrically straightforward, and a work of strong stylistic cohesion". In The New York Times, Jon Pareles appraised the record as a meditative work about self-determination that he believed was particularly relevant to the economic downturn of the late 2000s. [...] "Even in its boasts, How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Over</b> is selfless: an album of doubts, parables and pep talks", Pareles wrote. James Shahan from URB found it [...] "dark and tragic in places, but also enlightening and empowering", and Spin journalist Charles Aaron said [...] "you'd have to rewind early-'90s Scarface or Wu-Tang for such convincingly cold-eyed hip-hop existentialism". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau was impressed by how the rappers on the album had expressed [...] "garden-variety upper-middle-class anxiety" [...] in a forthright, thoughtful, articulate, and enjoyable manner, while musical elements such as Kamal Gray's keyboards and Questlove's drums [...] "embodied" [...] the [...] "fortitude and even optimism" [...] of the lyrics. Eric Henderson was less enthusiastic in Slant Magazine, finding the lyrics inconsistent and [...] "mildly self-delusional" [...] while calling the album [...] "stylistically the most inert, contemplative, offputtingly soft music they've possibly ever released".|$|E
2500|$|In early 2003, Cousins {{injured his}} ankle {{in a game}} against Hawthorn but played on through five weeks of pain-killing injections. In Round 15, 2004, he injured his back and missed six games. Cousins said, [...] "That injury is {{something}} that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>over</b> and am probably no chance of getting a relapse... The other side to it is, because I have played 10 years of consistent AFL footy, I've probably got an older back than someone my age". In Round 1, 2005, he dislocated a finger and missed one round after undergoing an operation. West Coast chief executive Trevor Nesbitt said, [...] "There's no doubt that he's at his best when under pressure and he's so resilient; he plays with injuries that other players wouldn't".|$|E
2500|$|Wake Up! {{follows the}} {{releases}} of Legend's Evolver (2008) and The Roots's How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Over</b> (2010). Legend and The Roots were inspired {{to record a}} collaborative album by the 2008 United States presidential election. In an interview for Billboard, Legend explained {{the reason for the}} album's conception at the time, stating [...] "I {{was in the middle of}} campaigning for Barack Obama and feeling inspired by the atmosphere in the country at the time, so I wanted to do something musically that reflected that moment. The original idea was to do some sort of covers EP, but the more I got into it with the Roots, it felt like something that should be heard and marketed on its own". The album's title was inspired by Canadian rock band Arcade Fire's song of the same name.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, dear wife, let {{us think}} it over {{for two or three}} days, and when <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>over</b> this little vexation, if I see any reason to change my mind I shall let you know in good time." ...|$|R
60|$|She had <b>got</b> <b>over</b> the fender now, and <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>over</b> my suspicion. <b>I</b> {{told her}} that I {{believed}} she {{had given me a}} faithful account of herself, and that we had both been hapless instruments in designing hands. She thanked me, and said I was a good fellow.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{can never}} tell. So {{far as you}} are concerned, <b>I</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>over</b> the wonder of it yet. You never showed me {{so much of the}} woman {{throughout}} our engagement as you have shown me during the last few days." ...|$|R
2500|$|After obtaining his BA, Jackman {{completed}} the one-year course [...] "The Journey" [...] at the Actors' Centre in Sydney. About studying acting full-time, he stated, [...] "It wasn't until I was 22 that I {{ever thought about}} my hobby being something I could make a living out of. As a boy, I'd always {{had an interest in}} theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>over</b> that. I found the courage to stand up and say, 'I want to do it'." [...] After completing [...] "The Journey", he was offered a role on the popular soap opera Neighbours but turned it down to attend the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts of Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, from which he graduated in 1994.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>over</b> it by {{a rhetorical}} turn. [...] "Why should one {{sacrifice}} {{the future of}} the world--why should one even sacrifice one's own future--because one's mother is totally destitute of imagination?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Brisbane was visibly annoyed. [...] "I didn't {{suppose you}} would come on till eleven; that's the word <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>over</b> the 'phone. I {{particularly}} wanted to hear your deposition," [...] he added, sourly.|$|E
60|$|CRAMPTON. Those steps make me giddy. (He passes {{his hand}} over his forehead.) <b>I</b> have not <b>got</b> <b>over</b> that infernal gas yet.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>over</b> the choking in {{my throat}} {{with the help of}} a drop of water, and had steadied my mind again so as to be {{prepared}} against the worst, when I heard the hail (Lord help the poor fellows, how weak it sounded!)-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{thankful to}} say," [...] he declared, earnestly, [...] "that <b>I</b> have not <b>got</b> <b>over</b> it, that, if anything, my prejudices are {{stronger}} than ever." ...|$|R
