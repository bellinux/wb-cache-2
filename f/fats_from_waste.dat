Fleshing wastes contain approximately 50 - 80 o% protein and 20 - 40 % <b>fat.</b> Protein <b>from</b> fleshing <b>waste</b> {{can be used for}} animal feed, cornpost and gelatin. The fat {{can be used as a}} base for soap rnaking, fat liquoring at leather tanning processes, and fuel (diesel oil substitute). This research aimed to study the possibility of utilizing fat fron fleshing waste in leather tannery. The result show that fat offleshing waste could be obtained by heating or by mechanical/enzymatic extraction. <b>Fats</b> obtained <b>from</b> fleshing <b>waste</b> were called tallow that had a triglyceride with unsaturated carboxylic acid and considered to be ester group.

40|$|Abstract—People {{today are}} {{increasingly}} health conscious and therefore shopkeepers tend {{to dispose of}} fatty chicken and pork skin. Chicken and pork skins thus are sources of solid waste that are usually not utilized. This paper deals with the production of useful biodiesel <b>from</b> utilizing the <b>waste</b> chicken and pork skins. <b>Fat</b> <b>from</b> the <b>waste</b> chicken and pork skins (sourced from local shops), was first extracted and subjected to transesterification. The products of transesterification were FAME (Fatty acid methyl esters) and glycerol. The FAME produced was tested for five parameters namely calorific value, pour point and cloud point when compared to ASTM E 2515 - 11 standard values. Comparison of the obtained values of the five parameters with the standard values for diesel was performed to determine {{the viability of the}} biodiesel produced. The results of this experiment showed that the calorific values of FAME produced from chicken skin and pork skin fat were close to that of petroleum derived diesel. However, two test parameters namely kinematic viscosity and pour point differed when compared to diesel; this problem can be circumvented by modifying an automobile’s internal combustion engine. Due to the relatively high yield value of biodiesel, it is feasible to utilize chicken skin and pork skin fat at a rural level to produce FAME that can be an alternative to diesel in this time of acute fuel scarcity...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAnimal <b>fat</b> {{residues}} (AFR) <b>from</b> <b>waste</b> {{water were}} used as feedstock to produce biodiesel by a two-step acid-catalyzed process. Treatment of the AFRs with 5. 4 % (w/w) of 17 M H 2 SO 4 at a methanol/AFR ratio of 13 : 1 (50 % w/w) at 60 degrees C converted more than 95 % of the triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with an acid value (AV) of 1. 3 mg(KOH) /g(biodiesel). Response surface methodology indicated that a lower AV cannot be reached using a one-step acid catalyzed process. Thus a two-step acid catalyzed process was employed using 3. 6 % catalyst and 30 % methanol for 5 h for the first step and 1. 8 % catalyst and 10 % methanol for I h in the second step, resulting in a yield higher than 98 % and an AV of 0. 3 mg(KOH) /g(biodiesel). The product thus conforms to the European norm EN 14214 concerning biodiesel. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The topical area of research is the search for new technologies for processing waste to produce fish oil as a valuable source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins and other biologically active substances. In the work the technology of enzymatic hydrolysis of fish wastes has been tested and compared with the traditional thermal technology of obtaining <b>fat</b> <b>from</b> fish <b>waste.</b> The object of the study has been frozen <b>waste</b> <b>from</b> the herring processing. The optimal parameters of obtaining fish oil <b>from</b> processing <b>wastes</b> has been determined by simulating the process by the method of mathematical planning of experiment using orthogonal central composite plan of the second order for two factors. The variation of the factors of traditional thermal processing {{has been carried out}} in the temperature range of 60 ± 10 °C for 120 ± 20 min. Enzymatic hydrolysis has been held using the enzyme preparation of proteolytic action Protosubtilin G 3 x (Protosubtilin G 3 x) in the range factors of 0. 20 ± 0. 05 g/kg dose of enzyme for 80 ± 20 min at the optimal temperature of hydrolysis. Organoleptic indicators of fat (appearance, color, smell, taste, transparency) have been determined in accordance with the requirements of state standards. The derived lipid drug has been subjected to research on indicators of safety in accordance with the requirements of Technical regulations of the Customs Union "On safety of food products". The safety performance of the obtained samples of fat (peroxide and acid numbers) has been determined by the standard methods.

40|$|Different initial {{concentrations}} of slurry waste food (discarded food), {{with and without}} the overlying layer of <b>fat</b> derived <b>from</b> the <b>waste</b> were anaerobically digested at 55 °C. At solids concentrations less than 20 g/l no significant difference was observed in terms of volatile fatty acids and methane production between samples containing fat layer and samples without it.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of poultry {{industry}} has caused large amounts of chicken wastes that must be recycled regarding environmental and economic concerns. This study aimed to assess the fat and aquaculture feed producible <b>from</b> chicken <b>wastes</b> in the Bojnoord poultry slaughterhouse, Iran. The chicken wastes including fatty tissue, viscera, and coccygeal were sampled at three different periods in 2016. Fat samples were analyzed by gas chromatography for determining the fatty acid (FA) profile. The degreased wastes then were used for producing aquaculture feed pellets once in combination with flour and once in mix with poultry by-product meal (PBM). The pellets were tested for physicochemical properties. Averagely, 58. 9 % of the fatty tissue, 14. 5 % of the viscera, and 30. 4 % of the coccygeal were recycled as fat content. Totally, 109368 kg-fat/year was extractable <b>from</b> chicken <b>wastes.</b> The oleic, palmitic, stearic, and palmitoleic represented more than 80 % of the total FA content. 67. 41 % and 67. 16 % of FA composition was unsaturated and composed of cis-isomers, respectively. The iodine value (IV) and saponification value (SV) were 58. 7 g iodine/ 100 g oil and 156. 12 mg KOH/g oil, respectively. The content of moisture, protein, fat, fiber, and ash in the feed composed of degreased chicken wastes and PBM was 7. 8, 41. 2, 34, 0. 9, and 4. 4 %, respectively. The <b>fat</b> obtained <b>from</b> chicken <b>wastes</b> was suitable for non-edible consumption. Combining degreased wastes with PBM resulted in protein-rich aquaculture feed.

Nevertheless, energy <b>from</b> <b>waste</b> presents a source of conflict between different levels of government, public and the industry. Opposition may argue that energy <b>from</b> <b>waste</b> plants pose health risk to the public, increase the cost of solid waste management, have negative environmental impacts and encourage NIMBY (not in my backyard) attitude. On the other hand, some social actors may hold opposite views because they perceive them as source of income or as effective methods of maximizing resource utilization <b>from</b> <b>waste.</b> Clearly, selecting an appropriate energy <b>from</b> <b>waste</b> strategy in democratic systems of government involves many layers of decisions and requires the construction of effective dialogue mechanisms among many social agents.
