5|$|Between 1891 and 1895, Ohio Wesleyan {{specialized}} {{the curriculum}} by establishing departments for physics, zoology, geology, speech, history, French, English, and economics. This specialization encouraged undergraduates to continue studies at graduate level, allowed professional preparation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> of Philosophy degree, and promoted exchange study in Europe. Two professional schools {{for law and}} medicine were formed in 1896.|$|E
5|$|In early 2008 Benn {{appeared}} on Scottish singer-songwriter Colin MacIntyre's album The Water, reading a poem he had composed himself. In September 2008, he {{appeared on}} the DVD release <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who story The War Machines with a vignette discussing the Post Office Tower; he became the second Labour politician, after Roy Hattersley to appear on a Doctor Who DVD.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{was used}} as an {{inspiration}} for Ken Follett's novel The Pillars of the Earth and, with a heavily modified central tower, featured as the completed fictional Kingsbridge Cathedral {{at the end of the}} 2010 television adaptation of that novel. The interior of the cathedral was used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who episode, 'The Lazarus Experiment', while the exterior shots were filmed at Southwark Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|The programme's {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies, who conceived the idea while researching for Casanova, described the episode as {{a love story}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b> The episode was filmed in England and Wales. It was well received by most critics, {{was nominated for a}} Nebula Award and won the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.|$|E
5|$|At episode's end, Rose, Sarah Jane, Mickey, and the Doctor are {{standing}} in the TARDIS. Sarah Jane declines a second chance of travelling in the TARDIS, having finally decided {{to move on with}} her life and stop waiting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b> Mickey says he would like to join the TARDIS crew, a suggestion of which Sarah Jane approves. She then asks Rose to stay with the Doctor, and to find her one day if she needs to. Sarah Jane then gets a chance to part properly with the Doctor, who leaves her with a brand new K9 as a parting gift.|$|E
5|$|Further {{appointments}} followed. Stainer {{became an}} honorary {{fellow of the}} Royal Academy of Music in 1877 and an examiner <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> of Music degree at Cambridge and London Universities. He accepted the post of Musical Director of the Madrigal Society of London. He was particularly honoured {{to be asked to}} be a juror at the French Exhibition in Paris in 1878 and in 1880 was an adjudicator at the Welsh Eisteddfod at Caernarvon. He was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1879.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} Snakedance, Saward {{requested that}} writer Christopher Bailey devise another story. The initial outline for May Time was commissioned on 24 August 1982 {{and was about}} the Doctor and his companions arriving at the court of Byzantium. Full scripts were commissioned on 16 September 1982 with the new title Man-watch, but the scripts were dropped from production for unclear reasons. A second attempt at the story under the title Children of Seth was attempted as a Sixth Doctor story, for which the scripts commissioned on 14 July 1983. This failed because of Bailey's failure to devise a structure for the new doctor's new 45 minute episode format and a tangible villain <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> to face. It was later adapted as The Children of Seth by Marc Platt for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in December 2011. This version reverts to the TARDIS crew of the Fifth Doctor, Tegan and Nyssa.|$|E
5|$|Donna {{is taken}} to a dying TARDIS, which UNIT has managed to use as {{the core of a}} crude time machine. Rose uses energy from the TARDIS to show Donna the beetle on her back, but tells her they do not know what it is. She insists that Donna travel back to the day she made the fateful turn and choose to turn left again. Donna is transported back minutes before she would make that turn, but too far away to contact her past self in time. She makes the {{decision}} to walk out in front of a passing truck and let it hit her, creating a traffic jam that causes her past self to turn left out of impatience. As Donna lies on the ground dying, Rose whispers a message into her ear <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b> The alternate universe disappears, and Donna finds herself back on Shan Shen. The beetle falls off of Donna's back, and the fortune teller runs away after uttering some terrified words about what Donna will become.|$|E
5|$|Housed in the Truman Wesley Collins Legal Center, Willamette's College of Law offers both {{full-time}} and part-time enrollment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> of jurisprudence (JD) degree, joint-degree programs, and a Master of Laws (LLM) program. The joint-degree programs {{allow students to}} earn both a JD and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) concurrently in a four-year program, or complete a bachelor's degree and JD in six years. Willamette Law's oldest legal journal is the Willamette Law Review, which started in 1960 and is housed in the Oregon Civic Justice Center. The center is a community outreach center located in a renovated library that Willamette opened in 2008. According to Willamette's 2016 ABA-required disclosures, 52.63% of the Class of 2016 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. Of all 2016 grads who passed the bar, 84.31% had full-time, long-term, JD-required employment.|$|E

5|$|However, Elton ends {{up being}} cornered in a dead end alley. As he resigns himself to being absorbed, the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor and Rose emerge from within. The Abzorbaloff {{attempts}} to ransom Elton in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> but the Doctor feigns disinterest in Elton's fate, while dropping a hint to the absorbed members of LINDA. In response, the absorbed members collectively use their willpower to suppress the Abzorbaloff, who ends up dropping his cane. At Ursula's prompting, Elton breaks the cane, which causes the Abzorbaloff to melt into the ground. The Doctor explains that the cane created a limitation field to suppress the alien's power, but with it broken, he lost control and his power caused him to be absorbed by the ground. The Doctor then recalls his first encounter with Elton, and explains {{that he was at}} Elton's house years ago tracking an elemental shade, but he was too late and the shade killed Elton's mother.|$|E
5|$|Several further {{instances}} {{have been}} expounded by critics. Taum notes that Yah's guilt over her {{past as a}} prostitute leads her to the (unfounded) fear that Tono would leave her if their relationship were known; her guilt ultimately causes their separation, while Tono feels nostalgic for the past, in which he felt happier. Balfas notes that a factor driving Tono from Tini is the latter's former relationship with Hartono; due to her guilt over the affair, she is unable to express her love <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor.</b> Siregar writes that such a theme is reflected in dialogue between Tono and Hartono, from which he suggests the novel derives its title. Balfas writes {{that there is no}} solution to the human problems presented in the novel.|$|E

30|$|Thus, Cefepime is an {{alternative}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> management of otitis media. Hence the present study would be helpful <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctors</b> and <b>the</b> Pharmacists in prescribing the medicine to the patients suffering from otitis media.|$|R
25|$|The {{makers of}} Doctor Who have {{generally}} avoided making pronouncements about canonicity, with Russell T Davies {{explaining that he}} does not think about the concept <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who TV series or its spin-offs.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 Seventh Doctor audio Return of the Daleks, set {{during the}} first Dalek Empire {{spin-off}} series, features the Daleks and Kalendorf trying to awaken their army buried on Spiridon, only <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> to thwart their plans by infecting them with light-wave sickness when they attempt to recreate their old experiments to master the secret of invisibility.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, {{a series}} of gamebooks {{featuring}} the Sixth Doctor were published by Severn House under the title Make your own adventure with Doctor Who in Britain and Find Your Fate — Doctor Who in the United States. These books were actually written by scriptwriters for the television series. Martin wrote Search <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> which {{takes place in the}} mid-21st century and features K9 Mark IV being reunited with the Sixth Doctor long after Sarah's death.|$|E

25|$|Another {{innovation}} {{of theirs}} from the eighth season onwards was {{the introduction of}} the character of the Master as a new nemesis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> conceived as a Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes. Played by Roger Delgado, he became a highly popular character, although over the following two seasons it was felt, by both the Public, and the production company, that he became a little overused. Delgado and the production team eventually agreed that he should be written out during the eleventh season by killing the character off, with some ambiguity {{as to whether or not}} he had died to save the Doctor.|$|E
25|$|Robot {{was written}} by Terrance Dicks, who had joined the series in 1968 as {{assistant}} script editor and took over the script editor position soon after. Dicks stated that a major influence for this story was King Kong. The initial script was written before Tom Baker had been cast as the Fourth Doctor, {{and there was some}} discussion of returning to an older actor. This would have required a younger character to handle the action scenes, so the character of Harry Sullivan was created. This was Sullivan's debut story, but he had been mentioned in the final episode of the preceding serial, when the Brigadier telephoned him, requesting medical help <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b>|$|E
25|$|I congratulated Michel {{and then}} sat down. On my left was Guttierez, trying to provide a sample <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor,</b> while Pollentier was in the other corner. They both had {{difficulty}} in urinating... Suddenly, the doctor cried out: 'What are you doing?' to Guttierez. I looked round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and a small plastic tube in his hand. He was confused and tried to say the tube {{had been in his}} pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm glad he isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.|$|E
5000|$|The TARDIS is {{mentioned}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time by {{name on the}} show. In part 2, Sarah Jane encounters a genuine police box and briefly mistakes it <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> TARDIS. During this sequence, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> Theme was also played. <b>The</b> Eleventh <b>Doctor</b> himself mistakes a police box for his TARDIS in [...] "The <b>Doctor,</b> <b>the</b> Widow and the Wardrobe".|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{will see}} him," [...] says Grafton, {{in a sort}} of {{helpless}} rage, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor's</b> manner baffled him. [...] "I will see him before he dies, and no man alive shall say me nay." ...|$|R
25|$|The Brigadier {{fears the}} Nestenes will return and asks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor's</b> help. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> agrees to join UNIT in {{exchange}} for facilities to help repair the TARDIS and a car like the sporty antique roadster he commandeered during the adventure. At his insistence, Liz stays on as his assistant.|$|R
