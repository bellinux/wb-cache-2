40|$|This {{study is}} based on the NCAR King Air {{aircraft}} and radiosonde observations on 31 October 1986 during the FIRE in Wisconsin over Oshkosh. Aircraft step-up and spiral <b>descent</b> <b>flights</b> are used to obtain kinematic and thermodynamic data. In the step-up maneuver, six different penetrations were made between 1528 and 1616 UTC. Each penetration was about 30 km long separated in the vertical by about 300 m. The time difference between the two spiral soundings was about 43 min. The aircraft descended at a rate of 1. 5 m/s during these spiral soundings. Kinematic, cloud physical, and radiometric observations from various instruments are used to estimate the different terms in the moisture- and heat-budget equations. The results show that the advection terms, estimated using the mean longitudinal wind and vertical velocities, and radiative fluxes are important in forming budgets for the cirrus layers. Ice-crystal growth is significant in the upper layers. The maintenance of cirrus can be attributed to relatively warm and moist air advection, radiative cooling at upper levels, and moisture advection in the vertical. Turbulent heat and moisture fluxes are found to be significant in the low levels of cirrus...|$|R

40|$|One major {{difficulty}} {{in the design}} of quiet rotor blades is the correct numerical prediction of blade vortex interaction (BVI) noise in <b>descent</b> <b>flight.</b> Current second order spatial discretization schemes inherently have too much numerical dissipation to correctly conserve vorticity in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Higher order methods have proven their worthiness to alleviate this problem, yet are costly in terms of computational resources. In this paper, the 4 th order implicit compact Pade scheme based on the finite differece formulation of the RANS equations is employed to convect the vortices in the simulation. The approach is paired with the classical finite volume approach with the Jameson-Schmidt-Turkel (JST) scheme. The robustness and flexibility of the JST scheme are exploited in the near field of the rotor blades and fuselage, while in the mid- and farfield the Pade scheme is utilized. This approach is validated against the experimental data of the HART II wind tunnel campaign. Opposing this higher order approach, a classical Panel method with a free wake model is investigated. It allows for the computation of results at similar quality of the higher order CFD scheme, however at a much reduced price. In this paper the effect of grid densities for all methods is analyzed along with the direct comparison of them for the resolution of BVI noise in <b>descent</b> <b>flight</b> of the HART II test case...|$|E
40|$|Blade vortex {{interaction}} (BVI) {{noise is}} {{a major source of}} noise radiated by helicopter rotor in <b>descent</b> <b>flight.</b> The prediction of BVI noise requires that numerical simulation code can capture and follow small concentrated vortex structures in the midst of large extent of three dimensional time dependent wake structure. The highest possible resolution regarding loads and wake characteristics are expected to capture the tip vortex structure. In order to provide evidence and obtain guideline for high resolution simulations, the isolated main rotor calculation is carried out by partner DLR and NTUA in accordance with HeliNovi work description Task 1. 1. The issue of scale refinement in BVI simulations for helicopter configurations is addressed in the NTUA GENUVP code [based on the vortex blob method and DLR UPM-Mantic code based on 3 D free wake panel method. Since the highest possible scale refinement will result in severe penalty on computational cost, some numerical techniques are applied in both NTUA GENUVP code and DLR UPM code in order to speed-up the aerodynamic computation without sacrificing general accuracy. Results are presented for the BO 105 rotor in <b>descent</b> <b>flight,</b> for four time steps down to 0. 5 deg of azimuth angle increment and two panel grids.

40|$|The final Shuttle-derived {{atmospheric}} {{data base}} is presented. The {{relational data base}} is comprised of data from 32 Space Transportation System (STS) <b>descent</b> <b>flights,</b> to include available meteorology data taken in support of each flight. For the most part, the available data are restricted to the middle atmosphere. In situ accelerations, sensed by the tri-redundant Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to an accuracy better than 1 mg, are combined with post-flight Best Estimate Trajectory (BET) information and predicted, flight-substantiated Orbiter aerodynamics to provide determinations up to altitudes of 95 km. In some instances, alternate accelerometry data with micro-g resolution were utilized to extend the data base well into the thermosphere. Though somewhat limited, the ensemble of flights permit a reasonable sampling of monthly, seasonal, and latitudinal variations which can be utilized for atmospheric science investigations and model evaluations and upgrades as appropriate. More significantly, the unparallel vertical resolution in the Shuttle-derived results indicate density shears normally associated with internal gravity waves or local atmospheric instabilities.

40|$|A {{helicopter}} rotor in <b>descent</b> <b>flight</b> encounters its own wake, {{resulting in}} a doughnut-shaped ring around the rotor disk, known as the Vortex Ring State (VRS). Flight in VRS condition can be dangerous as it may cause uncommanded drop in descent rate, loss of control effectiveness, power settling, excessive thrust and torque fluctuations, and vibration. As simple momentum theory is no longer valid for a rotor in VRS, modeling of rotor inflow in VRS continues to challenge researchers, especially for flight simulation applications. In this dissertation, a simplified inflow model, called the ring vortex model, is developed for a helicopter rotor operating in descent condition. By creating a series of vortex rings near the rotor disk, the ring vortex model addresses the strong flow interaction between the rotor wake and the surrounding airflow in <b>descent</b> <b>flight.</b> In addition, the total mass flow parameter in the existing inflow models is augmented to create a steady state transition between the helicopter and the windmill branches. With the ring vortex model, rotor inflow can now be adequately predicted {{over a wide range}} of descent rates. Validations of the ring vortex model for helicopter rotors are conducted extensively in axial and inclined descent. Effects from blade taper, blade twist, and rotor thrust are also investigated with further application of the finite-state inflow model. The ring vortex model is applied to a single main-rotor helicopter. The main effort is to establish VRS boundary based on heave stability criterion. In addition, two important phenomena observed in the <b>descent</b> <b>flight</b> tests are addressed in the dynamic simulation, including uncommanded drop in descent rate and loss of collective control effectiveness. The ring vortex model is further applied to a side-by-side rotor configuration. Lateral thrust asymmetry on the side-by-side rotor configuration can be reproduced through uneven distribution of vortex rings at the two rotors. Two important issues are investigated, including the impact of vortex rings on lateral thrust deficit and on lateral AFCS limit. Ph. D.

40|$|The present paper {{summarizes}} {{the results obtained}} during the validation phase of the aerodynamic computational tools performed {{in the framework of}} the European research project HeliNOVI and relative to the interactional phenomena arising on a full helicopter configuration. The activity was carried out by exploiting the experimental database produced during the wind tunnel test campaign of the project for a 40 % Mach and dynamically scaled BO 105 helicopter model. Seven test cases were performed. A climb, a descent and a level flight were chosen as baseline test cases aiming at highlighting the phenomenological differences among three main helicopter flight conditions. The remaining four were dedicated to the analysis of possible tail rotor (TR) modifications in order to alleviate those interactional aspects responsible for high TR noise emissions. The experimental results indicate a low influence of the main rotor (MR) as source noise in 12 ° climb and 60 m/s level flight whereas a predominance during the <b>descent</b> <b>flight</b> because of MR blade vortex interactions. Conversely, the TR noise represents the main source of noise especially in climb flight whereas is irrelevant during the <b>descent</b> <b>flight.</b> The modification of the TR operational characteristics is effective in reducing the interactional aspects and thus the noise emission.

Altogether there were 20 flights from Laramie, approximately 5 per year, and 2 from Lauder.
