5|$|As {{a part of}} the North Korean {{build-up}} in the south, the untried NK 7th Division also arrived near Masan {{with another}} 10,000 men. The 7th Division occupied key ports to protect the 6th Division against possible amphibious landings in <b>its</b> <b>rear.</b> Eventually, though, the division was committed to combat in conjunction with other North Korean units. The simultaneous attacks were hoped to overwhelm UN lines.|$|E

5|$|In his {{withdrawal}} {{instructions for}} the 7th Cavalry, Colonel Cecil Nist, the regimental commander, ordered the 2nd Battalion to disengage from the North Koreans to its front and attack to <b>its</b> <b>rear</b> to gain possession of Hills 464 and 380 on the new main line of resistance to be occupied by the regiment. Efforts to gain possession of Hill 464 by other elements had failed {{in the past several}} days.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault introduced diffuser designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new gearbox case for Massa's car to raise the pick-up points of <b>its</b> <b>rear</b> suspension to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected not to bring a new gearbox casing, but introduced a new rear diffuser to fully utilise the air blowing from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had thermal protection against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their gearbox casing to allow for the pick-up points for <b>its</b> <b>rear</b> suspension to be accommodated. After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided to use it {{for the remainder of the}} weekend.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are trained}} to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a supercell. They typically look to <b>its</b> <b>rear,</b> the main region of updraft and inflow. Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is {{the formation of a}} rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a supercell.|$|E

5|$|The invading army handily {{captured}} Longwy on 23 August and Verdun on 2 September, {{then moved}} on toward Paris through the defiles of the Forest of Argonne. In response, Dumouriez halted his advance to the Netherlands and reversed course, approaching the enemy army from <b>its</b> <b>rear.</b> From Metz, Kellermann moved to his assistance, joining him at the village of Sainte-Menehould on 19 September.|$|E
5|$|The walrus's {{body shape}} shares {{features}} with both sea lions (eared seals: Otariidae) and seals (true seals: Phocidae). As with otariids, it can turn <b>its</b> <b>rear</b> flippers forward {{and move on}} all fours; however, its swimming technique is more like that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements. Also like phocids, it lacks external ears.|$|E
5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with <b>its</b> <b>rear</b> legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1926, Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond {{together}} {{returned to}} Australia. Energised by her success, Rix Nicholas purchased a car, filled <b>its</b> <b>rear</b> compartment with painting equipment, and the pair set out to paint the landscape, ranging from Canberra and the Monaro plains to the south, up into central Queensland. This included a publicity-attracting occasion where she painted figures {{on the beach at}} Bondi, reported by various publications including Australian magazine, The Home.|$|E
5|$|Besides these unique characteristics, Sampson {{pointed out}} {{additional}} differences with two very closely related forms. The frill spikes of Achelousaurus are more outwards oriented than the spikes of Einiosaurus, which are medially curved; the spikes of Achelousaurus are nevertheless less {{directed to the}} outside than the comparable spikes of Pachyrhinosaurus. Achelousaurus also differs from Pachyrhinosaurus in its smaller nasal boss that does not reach the frontal bones at <b>its</b> <b>rear.</b> Apart from the skull, no features of the skeleton are known that distinguish Achelousaurus from {{other members of the}} Centrosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|Between 11–13 April 1941, with German and Italian troops {{advancing}} on <b>its</b> <b>rear</b> areas, the Zetska Division {{was forced}} to retreat back to the Pronisat River by the Italian 131st Armoured Division Centauro, where it remained {{until the end of}} the campaign on 16 April. The Italian armoured division along with the 18th Infantry Division Messina then advanced upon the Yugoslav fleet base of Kotor in Montenegro, also occupying Cettinje and Podgorica. The Yugoslavs lost 30,000 men captured in the Italian counterattacks.|$|E

Moreover, assessing the effect of dietary protein levels on the metabolism of this species at different densities is of particular interest. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary protein levels, rearing density, and their interaction on growth characteristics, feed utilization, and body composition of Nile tilapia, as well as their effect on the physiological status of the fish.|$|R

5|$|Bitter, {{confused}} fighting continued {{behind the}} 35th Infantry's {{line for the}} next week. Battalions, companies, and platoons, cut off and isolated, fought independently of higher control and help except for airdrops which supplied many of them. Airdrops also supplied relief forces {{trying to reach the}} front-line units. Tanks and armored cars drove to the isolated units with supplies of food and ammunition and carried back critically wounded on the return trips. In general, the 35th Infantry fought in its original battle line positions, while at first one battalion, and later two battalions, of the 27th Infantry fought toward it through the estimated 3,000 North Koreans operating in <b>its</b> <b>rear</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to <b>its</b> <b>rear.</b> Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E
5|$|Early {{the next}} morning, September 3, the North Koreans heavily {{attacked}} Check's men {{in an effort}} to regain the ridge. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire barrages, and an air strike directed from the battalion command post, met this attack. Part of the battalion had to turn and fight toward <b>its</b> <b>rear.</b> After the attack had been repulsed hundreds of North Korean lay dead around the battalion position. A prisoner estimated that during September 2 and 3 the four North Korean battalions fighting Check's battalion had lost 1,000 men.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{the assault}} of the 2nd New Zealand Division had drawn in both 15 and 21 Panzer Divisions, {{with the result}} that there was a wide gap in the Axis lines to the south west. Through this gap Montgomery pushed the {{remainder}} of his armour, breaking the Afrika Korps line and pushing westwards into <b>its</b> <b>rear</b> areas and supply lines. By 4 November, the battle was won and Montgomery was entertaining the captured Afrika Korps commander, von Thoma, to dinner in his caravan.|$|E
5|$|The JNA's {{offensive}} operations, directly {{associated with}} the campaign in the east Croatian region of Slavonia, were launched on 20 September. The assault on Croatian positions in Vukovar gradually became the main effort of the campaign as the JNA was repeatedly unable to capture the city. The fighting in and around Vukovar lasted months and eventually drew in the JNA's main armoured force, which had previously been slated to advance west towards Serb-held areas in western Slavonia. In addition to relieving its Vukovar garrison, the JNA wished to dissipate the Croatian forces in the city {{so that they would}} not pose any threat to <b>its</b> <b>rear</b> in the event that the campaign progressed west of Vinkovci.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} {{panic in}} Polish ranks convinced Muraviev to renew his assault with fresh forces, despite the losses his columns had suffered. Col. Lukash's grenadiers reinforced with two battalions of the Finnish Guards Regiment (1,300 men, four guns) outflanked Fort 73 {{from the north}} and captured a brickyard and yet another fortified inn, the Karczma Żelazna directly to <b>its</b> <b>rear.</b> Its garrison offered only light resistance before retreating in disarray. The situation seemed critical, as the Russians were now in possession of {{a large part of the}} second line of Polish defences.|$|E
