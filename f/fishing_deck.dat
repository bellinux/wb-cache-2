The location implements the idea of borrowing of scenery ("shakkei") that integrates the outside and the inside, creating an extension of the views surrounding the pavilion and connecting it with the outside world. The pavilion extends over a pond, called Ky≈çko-chi (Mirror Pond), that reflects the building. The pond contains 10 smaller islands. [...] The zen typology is seen through the rock composition, the bridges, and plants are arranged in a specific way to represent famous places in Chinese and Japanese literature. [...] Vantage points and focal points were established because of the strategic placement of the pavilion to view the gardens surrounding the pavilion. [...] A small <b>fishing</b> <b>deck</b> (tsuri-dono) is attached {{to the rear of the}} pavilion building, allowing a small boat to be moored under it. The pavilion grounds were built according to descriptions of the Western Paradise of the Buddha Amida, intending to illustrate a harmony between heaven and earth.

The four stones forming a straight line in the pond near the pavilion are intended to represent sailboats anchored at night, bound for the Isle of Eternal Life in Chinese mythology.|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{existence}} of deep-sea fishing under the German flag there have been repeated efforts to establish the occupation of the deep-sea fisherman as one requiring specialised training. Yet only during the Nazi era {{and that of the}} German Democratic Republic were these attempts crowned with success. As is illustrated by the two examples presented here, the non-existence of systematic vocational training in this field is not {{due to a lack of}} its necessity but rather to the fact that, particularly in times of labour scarcity, the shipping companies have never been interested in such training if they had the opportunity of finding employees elsewhere. ln periods of centralist, statist political systems, which intensively promoted the fishing industry and set up the fleets on the basis of political will rather than economic orientation, this one-sided interest of the shipping companies was not a factor. In interviews, former crew members have repeatedly expressed the point of view that the kind of vocational training practised in Germany before 1939 or in the Federal Republic of Germany since the end of the war- i. e. pure practical instruction on board - provides a solid basis for the everyday work on the deck of a deep-sea fishing vessel. Yet on the other hand, those who had obtained their training during the Nazi regime or received some form of instruction in coastal fishing were at a distinct advantage on board, being quickly selected for better jobs, for example net- making. In general, the comprehensive introduction of systematic vocational training for deep-sea <b>fishing</b> <b>deck</b> personnel would certainly have been welcome. But without the kind of legal initiative present, for example, in the German Democratic Republic, this aim could never be achieved. As it is, an ordinary seaman can sign onto a fishing vessel; entry into nautical college in order to qualify as an officer or captain is not dependent upon successful completion of training but merely upon time accumulated at sea. Thus there is no motivation for undergoing methodical instruction, particularly in view of the fact that doing so would cause a considerable reduction in earnings during the initial years of employment. The subject of vocational training in the deep-sea fishing industry has thus remained a direct reflection of the socioeconomic importance of this field in each of the respective political systems in Germany. ln times of economic orientation such training was non-existent and there was no legally established minimum qualification level. During eras of centralised economies, deep-sea fishing was a government priority and thus always accompanied by systematic vocational training for its deck personnel. " (author's abstract...|$|E

30|$|Tuna tubes {{have been}} {{suggested}} as an alternative solution for the transport of live medium-sized Scombrids when smaller fishing vessels are used, either by necessity of reducing costs, or to allow better manoeuvrability while approaching the fish schools (McPherson 2004). Tuna tubes are comprised of several opaque round or oval cylinders with a funnel shaped bottom, ranging in material from plastic, to polyvinyl chloride (PVC), stainless steel, or aluminium, which are installed vertically on the <b>fishing</b> vessel‚Äôs <b>deck.</b> The funnel {{at the bottom of}} each tube is connected to a water system, which can provide pressurized water supply. Once caught, each individual fish is placed head first in a tube, and water is pumped through the fish mouth and gills, providing oxygen and removing wastes (Bass and Alworth 1998; McPherson 2004). This method is used primarily by recreational fishermen to hold medium-sized Scombrids as live bait for game fish such as tuna species (Thunnus spp.), billfish (Istiophoridae family) and more. Captured fish were reported to maintain a good, healthy condition for up to 12 ¬†h (White 2011; Rudow 2011).|$|R

2500|$|Although these {{crossings}} were, {{by their}} nature, {{carried out in}} a manner to avoid enemy contact. The crews managed to equip the boats with several concealed weapons. David Howarth, who was with Special Operations Executive and Norwegian seaman, Per Blystad (1911-1942) invented many of these constructions. The most ingenious of these was a concrete-lined oil drum bolted to the deck. When the removable lid was lifted, a pair of ready loaded Lewis Guns were telescoped into firing position, {{with the aid of}} a counterweight below decks. A steel shield came automatically up to protect the gunner. Oil drums were a natural thing to carry on a <b>fishing</b> boat's <b>deck.</b> Once in the North Sea, one of the boats was inspected by a suspicious British Navy ship, all other weapons were confiscated, but they did not find the two twin machine guns mounted on deck! Special low mountings for twin 0.50" [...] Colt machine guns were mounted in the netroom, at the aft of the boat. These were not totally hidden, but with the use of folding handles, triggers, aims and shields they managed to keep them just above the edge of the gunwale, and they were easy to camouflage with a net. A similar construction was mounted in the bow, with a tarpaulin over, of the same shape as the covering of the whaling harpoons many of the Norwegian fishing boats had in the bow. At last all of the Bus boats carried seven or eight mounted, ready armed machine guns, and were able to protect themselves against enemy aircraft attacks.|$|R
50|$|With {{almost a}} quarter of her crew {{untested}} in battle Grayback departed Pearl Harbor for the East China Sea on 2 December for her ninth war patrol. Within five days of her first contact with Japanese ships, she had expended all her torpedoes in a series of attacks which netted four ships for a total of over 10,000 tons. On the night of 18 to 19 December Grayback attacked convoy of four freighters and three escorts. She sent freighter Gyokurei Maru and escort Numakaze to the bottom and damaged several others in surface attack. Two nights later, 20 to 21 December, she spotted another convoy of six ships; and, after an end-around run she fired a spread of nine torpedoes {{into the heart of the}} Japanese formation. This first attack sunk one freighter and damaged another before Grayback dived to elude depth charges. Three hours later she surfaced and sank a second freighter. After an unsuccessful attack the following night had exhausted her torpedo supply, Grayback headed home. The submarine surfaced 27 December and sank a good-sized <b>fishing</b> boat with <b>deck</b> guns before reaching Pearl Harbor on 4 January 1944.|$|R
50|$|Only 6 of the Bottom Line 44's were {{actually}} built, {{of the six}} boats that were built, only 5 actually saw service and {{were used in the}} CSY sponsored fishing school. The boats were sold to investors who then leased them back to CSY for use in the commercial fishing school. At the time one of the inducements to attend the fishing school was that if a student went through the school and then Captained one of the vessels for 5 years the Captain would then be eligible to buy the vessel at salvage value. This model was a CSY 44 hull and rigging modified to be a bottom fishing vessel. The idea was the owner/fisherman could use the sail to help defer the cost of fuel when fishing. The original idea of the vessel was to have a large fish hold centered in the boat, with a crew compartment forward and a Captains quarters aft and work center in the tall pilothouse. This commercial pilothouse provides a good visible with navigation counter, resting berth, and galley‚Äîsliding doors either side.

40|$|In {{assessment}} {{and management of}} marine fish resources, representative data of statistically good quality describing the actual catch are lacking for many fisheries. Even for the most studied fisheries in the north Atlantic, the uncertainty regarding what is actually caught has implications for management. Fish stock assessments and sound advice in most cases rely on representative samples of catches. Distant and high sea fisheries often suffer from poor sampling due to sampling personal logistics. Consequently, stock {{assessment and}} management of marine fish resources exploited by those fisheries are based on poor or scarce catch data. Presently, sampling at sea are often random in time and place, and not necessarily representative {{with respect to the}} fleet metier. Biological sampling in distant waters is a challenge due to logistics and high costs. The use of electronic scales onboard commercial fishing vessels opens for a new approach in data collection. In recent years electronic scales measuring individual <b>fish</b> weights on <b>deck</b> have been connected to GPS in combination with data on depth, fishing gear, logbook information etc. This approach will link detailed data to auxiliary information on the fishery, thereby meet the challenges of obtaining representative fishery data, continuous and full sampling providing a sufficient data basis for fish stock assessments and subsequent fisheries management for species found in distant waters...|$|R

5000|$|In the 15th century, the Dutch {{developed}} {{a type of}} sea-going herring drifter that became a blueprint for subsequent European fishing boats. This was the herring buss, used by Dutch herring fishermen until the early 19th centuries. The ship type buss has a long history. It was known around 1000 AD in Scandinavia as a b«òza, a robust variant of the Viking longship. The first herring buss was probably built in Hoorn around 1415. The last one was built in Vlaardingen in 1841. The ship was about 20 metres long and displaced between 60 and 100 tons. It was a massive round-bilged keel ship with a bluff bow and stern, the latter relatively high, and with a gallery. The busses used long drifting gill nets to catch the herring. The nets would be retrieved at night and the crews of eighteen to thirty men would set to gibbing, salting and barrelling the catch on the broad deck. The ships sailed in fleets of 400 to 500 ships to the Dogger Bank fishing grounds and the Shetland isles. They were usually escorted by naval vessels, because the English considered they were [...] "poaching". The fleet would stay at sea {{for weeks at a}} time. The catch would sometimes be transferred to special ships (called ventjagers), and taken home while the fleet would still be at sea (the picture shows a ventjager in the distance).During the 17th century, the British developed the dogger, an early type of sailing trawler or longliner, which commonly operated in the North Sea. The dogger takes its name from the Dutch word dogger, meaning a fishing vessel which tows a trawl. Dutch trawling boats were common in the North Sea, and the word dogger was given to the area where they often fished, which became known as the Dogger Bank. Doggers were slow but sturdy, capable of fishing in the rough conditions of the North Sea. Like the herring buss, they were wide-beamed and bluff-bowed, but considerably smaller, about 15 metres long, a maximum beam of 4.5 m, a draught of 1.5 m, and displacing about 13 tonnes. They could carry a tonne of bait, three tonnes of salt, half a tonne each of food and firewood for the crew, and return with six tonnes of <b>fish.</b> [...] <b>Decked</b> areas forward and aft probably provided accommodation, storage and a cooking area. An anchor would have allowed extended periods fishing in the same spot, in waters up to 18 m deep. The dogger would also have carried a small open boat for maintaining lines and rowing ashore.|$|R
6000|$|On the whole, though men {{had lost}} some of their {{original}} endurance, and their natural pity had already undergone a certain deterioration, this period {{of the development of}} the human faculties, occupying a just medium between the indolence of the primitive state and the petulant activity of our modern self-love, must have been at once the happiest and the most durable epoch. The more we reflect, the more evident we find it that this state was the least subject to revolutions and the best for man.

But from the moment that one man had need of the help of another, as soon as they perceived it to be useful for one person to have provisions for two, then equality disappeared, property was introduced, labour became necessary, and the vast forests changed into smiling fields, which had to be watered by the sweat of men, and in which they ever saw bondage and misery springing up and growing ripe with the harvests."[187] ...|$|R
40|$|Fishers {{and related}} fishing workers {{deal with a}} set of working {{conditions}} unique among all other occupations. This occupation is characterized by strenuous work, long hours, seasonal employment, and some of the most hazardous conditions in the workforce. These workers are often at sea for weeks or months at a time, sometimes having to stand on <b>deck,</b> <b>fishing</b> for long periods with little or no sleep. They are constantly being tossed around by wind and rough seas, with water in their face and under their feet, which adds an element of balance to the skills needed to do their job safely. Weather does not stop production, and given that these workers do not work in a factory or office building, it increases the unpredictability of their working conditions. Access to on-site medical care for these workers is limited to the knowledge of those on the boat with them or the response of the Coast Guard. Thanks to television shows such as Deadliest Catch, Lobstermen, Swords, Rajin Cajuns, Hook Line and Sisters, Wicked Tuna, Big Shrimpin‚Äô, and Toughest Tribes, viewers can see the hazards these workers face first hand. But what do the numbers show? Fishers and related fishing workers have had the highest fatal injury rate of any occupation since 2005. Their rate of fatal injury in 2009 was 203. 6 per 100, 000 full-time equivalent workers, more than 50 times the all-worker rate of 3. 5. From 2003 to 2009, an average of 48 fishers and related fishing workers died each year {{as a result of an}} injury incurred on the job. There were approximately 31, 000 people employed as fishers and related fishing workers in 2009.
