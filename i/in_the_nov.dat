40|$|Nodamura virus (NoV) {{is a small}} RNA {{virus that}} is {{infectious}} for insect and mammalian hosts. We have developed a highly sensitive assay of RNA interference (RNAi) in mammalian cells that shows that <b>the</b> <b>NoV</b> B 2 protein functions as an inhibitor of RNAi triggered by either short hairpin RNAs or small interfering RNAs. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> cell, <b>NoV</b> B 2 binds to pre-Dicer substrate RNA and RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) -processed RNAs and inhibits the Dicer cleavage reaction and, potentially, one or more post-Dicer activities. In vitro, NoV B 2 inhibits Dicer-mediated RNA cleavage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of any other host factors and specifically binds double-stranded RNAs corresponding in structure to Dicer substrates and products. Its abilities to bind to Dicer precursor and post-Dicer RISC-processed RNAs suggest a mechanism of inhibition that is unique among known viral inhibitors of RNAi...|$|R
