50|$|The Sister Chapel was {{exhibited}} in its entirety, {{for the first}} time in thirty-seven years, at the Rowan University Art Gallery in Glassboro, New Jersey, from March 28 through June 30, 2016. The new exhibition included Sharon Wybrants's recreation of her Self-Portrait as Superwoman because the original is lost. This was the first installation of The Sister Chapel to present the works inside the <b>fabric</b> <b>enclosure</b> designed by Maureen Connor.|$|E
50|$|The zipper {{may be used}} {{to secure}} an article of clothing, a tent or other <b>fabric</b> <b>enclosure,</b> luggage, or other soft container. Another popular method of {{securing}} clothing presses a thin and sharpened wire through the fabric using a brooch or safety pin. A buckle is used in place of a zipper at times. Buttons are another way to secure clothing, and require dexterous fingers to properly use. Snap fasteners (also named poppers and press studs) and the hook and loop fastener are a few less common zipper alternatives.|$|E

The green {{building}} design of Huizhou traditional dwellings isn’t {{the same as}} their external shape being dominant character, but being implicit among building itself, environment and building <b>fabric</b> of <b>enclosure</b> structures. The article analyses excellent ecological design of Huizhou traditional dwellings from three different aspects, settlement’s interior ecological environment, external ecological environment and building fabric gene of rounding to protect structure. At last, it expects to distill all of them and plant into modern architecture in order to explore a road of innovation suitable modern design for Huizhou residential district...|$|R
40|$|Sophisticated {{analytical}} {{models and}} computer software have facilitated the structural design of tensile membrane structures {{and this has}} produced a diverse and complex range of design and form solutions. The climate inside a typical <b>fabric</b> membrane <b>enclosure</b> is dependent on {{factors such as the}} shape (having a significant clear height) and the thermal properties of the thin “skin”, which differ considerably from traditional or more conventional “heavy” construction. However, there has been little consideration of the effect that these forms “shapes” have on their immediate environment, {{from the point of view}} of human comfort, even for the most basic of shapes. Tensile membrane structures can have an attractive dramatic effect and easily span a large area. In addition to the lighting and shading functions normally associated with tensile membrane skins, the topology of the construction type offers exciting opportunities to lend additional functionality and higher levels of comfort to the enclosure (ElNokaly et al, 2002). This paper describes the results of wind tunnel visualization and monitoring of the airflow patterns around and under conic tensile membrane structures covering open and semi-enclosed spaces. The experiments were conducted using a number of physical models representing a simple conical membrane structure. The study was designed primarily in order to ascertain the potential of conic membranes for modifying the microclimate and improving human comfort in their immediate vicinity. (Continued...|$|R
5000|$|A dog crate is a metal, wire, plastic, or <b>fabric</b> <b>enclosure</b> with a door {{in which}} a dog may be kept for {{security}} or transportation. Dog crates are designed to replicate a dog's natural den and as such can {{provide them with a}} place of refuge at home or when traveling to new surroundings. Crate training accustoms the dog with the crate. The most common reasons for using a dog crate are for toilet training a new puppy, taking a dog on short trips inside the car, displaying them at a dog show, or giving a dog a place to go when visitors come to the house. Similarly as people can have their own room to [...] "enjoy a moment of solace, your dog likes having its own room ... a little, cozy place of their own ... dog crates offer a superlative home for your dog where it can feel safe and secure." [...] Using a crate for a dog is similar to having a playpen for a toddler or a crib for a baby, and allows the owner to take their eyes off their pet. Additionally, covering a crate with a blanket, putting your pet’s favorite toys inside, and having enough packaging inside the cage to ensure your pet does not get hurt in the move are all things that will improve a pet’s move.|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{structural design}} {{and analysis of}} an inflatable habitat for installation on the moon was completed. The concept takes {{the shape of a}} sphere with a diameter of approximately 16 meters. The interior framing provides five floor levels and is enclosed by a spherical air-tight membrane holding an interior pressure of 14. 7 psi (101. 4 kpa). The spherical habitat is to be erected on the lunar surface with the lower one third below grade and the upper two thirds covered with a layer of lunar regolith for thermal insulation and shielding against radiation and meteoroids. The total dead weight (earth weight) of the structural aluminum, which is of vital interest for the costly space transportation, is presented. This structural dead weight represents a preliminary estimate without including structural details. The design results in two versions: one supports the weight of the radiation shielding in case of deflation of the <b>fabric</b> <b>enclosure</b> and the other assumes that the radiation shielding is self supporting. To gain some indication of the amount of structural materials needed if the identical habitat were installed on Mars and Earth, three additional design versions were generated where the only difference is in gravity. These additional design versions are highly academic since the difference will be much more than in gravity alone. The lateral loading due to dust storms on Mars and wind loads on Earth are some examples. The designs under the lunar gravity are realistic. They may not be adequate for final material procurement and fabrication, however, as the connection details, among other reasons, may effect the sizes of the structural members...|$|E
