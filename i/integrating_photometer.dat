5000|$|The FL1 {{standard}} requires measurements {{reported on}} the packaging to be made {{with the type of}} batteries packaged with the flashlight, or with an identified type of battery. Initial light output is measured with an <b>integrating</b> sphere <b>photometer,</b> 30 seconds after the light is switched on with fresh (or newly charged) batteries. The total light emitted is reported in lumens. Luminous intensity is determined by measuring the brightest spot in the beam produced by the flashlight, in candelas. Since this is a measure of all the light emitted in a solid angle (the [...] "cone" [...] of light in a particular direction), the beam intensity is independent of distance.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe light {{attenuation}} in a photobioreactor {{is determined}} using a fully predictive model. The optical properties were first calculated, using a data {{bank of the}} literature, from only the knowledge of pigments content, shape, and size distributions of cultivated cells which are {{a function of the}} physiology of the current species. The radiative properties of the biological turbid medium were then deduced using the exact Lorenz-Mie theory. This method is experimentally validated using a large-size <b>integrating</b> sphere <b>photometer.</b> The radiative properties are then used in a rectangular, one-dimensional two-flux model to predict radiant light attenuation in a photobioreactor, considering a quasi-collimated field of irradiance. Combination of this radiative model with the predictive determination of optical properties is finally validated by in situ measurement of attenuation profiles in a torus photobioreactor cultivating the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, after a complete and proper characterization of the incident light flux provided by the experimental set-up...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The Na and K {{concentration}} in single suprameduilary neurons of the puffer fish (Spheroides maadatus) {{was measured using}} a dual channel <b>integrating</b> ultramicroflame <b>photometer.</b> The cells were frozen in situ, sectioned at low temperatures, and freeze-dried to prevent artefactual movements of cations. The density of the nuclear fragments was 0. 15, significantly less than cytoplasm's 0. 21. The sucrose- 14 C "space " was 2. 1 - 4. 7 % in cytoplasm fragments and 0. 9 - 2. 1 % in nuclear fragments. The K {{concentration in}} cytoplasm averaged 134 mmoles/liter tissue volume and in nuclei, 113. The Na concentration in cytoplasm fragments varied between 56 and 138 mmoles/liter per tissue volume; in nuclei between 40 and 135, and in perineural tissue between 55 and 114. This intraceUular Na is several {{times greater than the}} Na concentration expected from previous estimates. It is probable, however, that the intracellular Na activity is less than half that of the Na concentration, suggesting that much of the intracellular Na is bound to organic molecules within the cell...|$|R
40|$|Amazonian várzea {{forests are}} {{seasonally}} flooded by whitewater rivers. Flood periods {{last up to}} 230 days every year. The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze the vegetative phenology of six tree species and the extent to which the aquatic phase may represent an unfavorable period (‘physiological winter’) for the trees. Leaf amount on the trees was determined by measurements of light incidence using an <b>integrating</b> quantum <b>photometer.</b> The results show that there is a period of increased leaf loss during the aquatic phase, but timing of leaf shedding and of leaf flush, and the duration of the leafless period were not directly related to the time of highest water level. All species started to produce new leaves while they were still flooded. Leaf flush occurred several weeks to months before the end of the aquatic phase. For the species analyzed, there was no period of rest and stagnation of phenological and growth activities during the whole aquatic phase, indicating that flooding did not represent a high stress factor...|$|R
40|$|AIMS—To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of glistenings on the optical quality of acrylic foldable intraocular lens.  METHODS—Several degrees of glistenings in the optic were experimentally created by immersing the lens in water at 37 °C for 48  hours and then at 25 °C for 24  hours. Optical bench tests were carried out in water including measurements of spectral transmittance with the spectrophotometer, intensity of forward scattering using the <b>integrating</b> sphere <b>photometer,</b> modulation transfer function, and resolving power at various contrasts with and without the veiling glare light source.  RESULTS—Glistenings of 1 + to 4 + degrees were created, among which the 4 + glistenings seemed to be extremely intense and thought to be beyond the range of clinical settings. Clinically feasible level of glistenings, up to 3 +, did not adversely influence spectral transmittance, scattering, modulation transfer function, and resolving power at various contrasts. The 4 + glistenings caused mild to moderate deteriorations of the optical quality of the lens.  CONCLUSION—The optical quality of the acrylic foldable intraocular lens is not significantly affected by the level of glistenings usually seen in the clinical setting. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{luminous}} flux (unit, lumen) {{is one of}} the most important characteristics of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) along with the luminous intensity, and is commonly measured using <b>integrating</b> sphere <b>photometers.</b> However, large variations of measurement results are reported among different manufacturers and users of LEDs, which is causing difficulties in trade. CIE 127 [1] gave a good solution to the problems in luminous intensity measurements, but does not give sufficient treatment for the problems in {{luminous flux}} measurement. There are issues such as the LED mounting geometry (4, 2), treatment of backward emission, the best integrating sphere geometries, etc., which are being addressed in CIE Technical Committee 2 - 45. While these issues are to be resolved, there is an urgent need for standard LEDs in order to certify measurement accuracy in industrial laboratories. To address such needs, NIST has developed measurement procedures to calibrate total luminous flux of LEDs using the existing NIST 2. 5 m integrating sphere [2]. Figure 1 shows the arrangement of the NIST integrating sphere for LED measurement. This arrangement is for integration over 4 p – the normal definition of total luminous flux...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} metrological {{analysis using}} mathematical models of three <b>integrating</b> sphere <b>photometer</b> schemes, for LED luminous flux measurement, was held. Each model {{takes into account}} the main design parameters of the photometer, typical values of which are used in the calculations. It's shown, that for given initial conditions, the greatest contribution to the total error for schemes with LED on the wall of sphere and in the center of sphere introduces instability of sphere reflectance coating, and for the scheme with LED in front of entrance aperture of sphere, for total luminous flux measurement, - instability of the distance to the diaphragm. In general, the highest accuracy for total luminous flux measurement have a scheme with LED {{in the center of the}} sphere, somewhat lower - a scheme with LED on the wall of sphere, and the lowest - a scheme with LED in front of input aperture of the sphere. The substantiated recommendations on the best practical application of each of the schemes are given. Also, for all schemes dependencies of the total relative error on the primary errors of basic design parameters, that can be used to select the optimal scheme of the photometer and selection of optimal values of design parameters are given. ???????? ????????????? ??????????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?????????????? ??????? ???? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ??? ????????? ?????? ???????????. ?????? ?????? ????????? ???????? ?????????????? ????????? ?????????, ???????? ???????? ??????? ???????????? ??? ????????. ????????, ??? ??? ?????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ????? ? ????????? ??????????? ??? ???? ?? ??????????? ?? ?????? ? ? ?????? ????? ?????? ?????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ?????, ? ??? ????? ?? ??????????? ????? ??????? ?????????? ????? ??? ????????? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ????? ?????? ?????????????? ?????????? ?? ?????????. ? ????? ????????? ???????? ????? ????????? ??????? ?????? ?? ????? ?? ??????????? ? ?????? ?????, ????????? ????? ?????? ? ?? ????? ?? ??????????? ?? ?????? ????? ? ????? ?????? - ?? ????? ?? ??????????? ????? ??????? ?????????? ?????. ???? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????????? ?????? ?? ????. ????? ??? ???? ???? ????????? ??????????? ????????? ????????????? ??????????? ?? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????????? ??????????, ??????? ????? ???????????? ??? ?????? ??????????? ????? ????????? ? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????????? ??????????...|$|R
40|$|The {{variability}} of optical properties of combustion particles generated from a propane diffusion flame under varying fuel-to-air (C/O) ratios was studied with a three-wavelength nephelometer, a particle soot absorption <b>photometer,</b> and an <b>integrating</b> sphere <b>photometer.</b> Information on particle size distribution, morphology, and elemental carbon to total carbon (EC/TC) ratios {{were obtained from}} scanning mobility particle sizer measurements, transmission electron microscopy analyses, and thermal-optical analyses. Particles generated under a low C/O ratio (0. 22) showed high elemental carbon fraction (EC/TC = 0. 77) and low brown carbon to equivalent black carbon (BrC/EBC) ratio (0. 01), and were aggregates composed of small primary particles. Rayleigh–Debye–Gans theory reproduced experimental single-scattering albedo, ω, absorption, and scattering Ångström exponents within 56, 3, and 18 %, respectively. In contrast, particles produced under a high C/O ratio (0. 60) showed low elemental carbon fraction (EC/TC = 0. 09) and high BrC/EBC ratio > 100, and were smaller and spherical in shape. Their optical properties were better modeled with Mie theory. By minimizing the difference between calculated and measured ω and Ångström exponents, refractive indices of OC at three visible wavelengths were deduced. Contrary to the widely accepted assumption that refractive index of BC is wavelength independent, BC-rich particles exhibited absorption Ångström exponent > 1. 0 which implies some degree of wavelength dependence...|$|R
40|$|A new NIST {{luminous}} flux scale has been realized using the integrating sphere method, on which theoretical and experimental studies were previously conducted and reported. The NIST 2 m integrating sphere was modified {{to add an}} opening and an additional baffle to apply this method. Flux from an external source (1000 W quartz halogen lamp) is introduced into the sphere through a limiting aperture and the opening. The flux entering the sphere is determined from the measured area of the aperture and the illuminance on the aperture plane measured with the NIST standard photometers that maintain the NIST illuminance scale. The total {{luminous flux}} {{of a group of}} standard lamps measured inside the sphere is deduced by comparison to the flux from the external source. Corrections are made for the spatial non-uniformity and the incident angle dependence of the sphere response, and the spectral mismatch of the <b>integrating</b> sphere <b>photometer</b> responsivity. The total luminous flux measured with the integrating sphere system is compared to the values obtained with a goniophotometer of PTB, Germany. The values obtained by the two methods agreed to within 0. 2 %. The magnitude of the new NIST luminous flux unit is 1. 1 % larger than previously realized. The relative expanded uncertainty (k= 2) of the NIST luminous flux scale is now 0. 5 %. Keywords...|$|R
40|$|The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) are twin 3 U CubeSats. The {{first of}} the twin CubeSats (MinXSS- 1) {{launched}} in December 2015 to the International Space Station for deployment in mid- 2016. Both MinXSS CubeSats utilize a commercial off the shelf (COTS) X-ray spectrometer from Amptek to measure the solar irradiance from 0. 5 to 30 keV with a nominal 0. 15 keV FWHM spectral resolution at 5. 9 keV, and a LASP-developed X-ray broadband photometer with similar spectral sensitivity. MinXSS design and development has involved over 40 graduate students supervised by professors and professionals at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The majority of previous solar soft X-ray measurements have been either at high spectral resolution with a narrow bandpass or spectrally <b>integrating</b> (broadband) <b>photometers.</b> MinXSS will conduct unique soft X-ray measurements with moderate spectral resolution over a relatively large energy range to study solar active region evolution, solar flares, {{and the effects of}} solar soft X-ray emission on Earth's ionosphere.

40|$|The {{development}} {{program of the}} flight model imaging camera for the PACS instrument on-board the Herschel spacecraft is nearing completion. This camera has two channels covering the 60 to 210 microns wavelength range. The focal plane of the short wavelength channel is made of a mosaic of 2 x 4 3 -sides buttable bolometer arrays (16 x 16 pixels each) {{for a total of}} 2048 pixels, while the long wavelength channel has a mosaic of 2 of the same bolometer arrays for a total of 512 pixels. The 10 arrays have been fabricated, individually tested and <b>integrated</b> in the <b>photometer.</b> They represent the first filled arrays of fully collectively built bolometers with a cold multiplexed readout, allowing for a properly sampled coverage of the full instrument field of view. The camera has been fully characterized and the ground calibration campaign will take place after its delivery to the PACS consortium in mid 2006. The bolometers, working at a temperature of 300 mK, have a NEP close to the BLIP limit and an optical bandwidth of 4 to 5 Hz that will permit the mapping of large sky areas. This paper briefly presents the concept and technology of the detectors as well as the cryocooler and the warm electronics.
