40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a {{simulation}} model for dynamic bikes redistribution process is presented. The {{objective of the}} model is to minimize the vehicles repositioning costs for bike-sharing operators, aiming {{at a high level}} users satisfaction, and assuming that it increases with the probability to find an available bike or a <b>free</b> <b>docking</b> point in any station at any time. The proposed model considers the dynamic variation of the demand (for both bikes and <b>free</b> <b>docking</b> slot) and micro-simulate the BSS in space and time determining the optimal repositioning flows, distribution patterns and time intervals between relocation operations by explicitly considering the route choice for trucks among the stations...|$|R
40|$|Protein-RNA {{complexes}} {{formed by}} specific recognition between RNA and RNA-binding proteins {{play an important}} role in biological processes. More than a thousand of such proteins in human are curated and many novel RNA-binding proteins are to be discovered. Due to limitations of experimental approaches, computational techniques are needed for characterization of protein-RNA interactions. Although much progress has been made, adequate methodologies reliably providing atomic resolution structural details are still lacking. Although protein-RNA <b>free</b> <b>docking</b> approaches proved to be useful, in general, the template-based approaches provide higher quality of predictions. Templates are key to building a high quality model. Sequence/structure relationships were studied based on a representative set of binary protein-RNA complexes from PDB. Several approaches were tested for pairwise target/template alignment. The analysis revealed a transition point between random and correct binding modes. The results showed that structural alignment is better than sequence alignment in identifying good templates, suitable for generating protein-RNA complexes close to the native structure, and outperforms <b>free</b> <b>docking,</b> successfully predicting complexes where the <b>free</b> <b>docking</b> fails, including cases of significant conformational change upon binding. A template-based protein-RNA interaction modeling protocol PRIME was developed and benchmarked on a representative set of complexes...|$|R

500|$|Development of RosettaDock diverged {{into two}} {{branches}} for subsequent CAPRI rounds as Jeffrey Gray, who {{laid the groundwork}} for RosettaDock while at the University of Washington, continued working on the method in his new position at Johns Hopkins University. Members of the Baker laboratory further developed RosettaDock in Gray's absence. [...] The two versions differed slightly in side-chain modeling, decoy selection and other areas. Despite these differences, both the Baker and Gray methods performed well in the second CAPRI assessment, placing fifth and seventh respectively out of 30 predictor groups.

50|$|The {{museum was}} founded in 1980 by local Hudson River enthusiasts, but did not move to its present property, an old boat shop, until 1983. Its {{exhibits}} include various small craft, artifacts of river steamships such as the Mary Powell, a research library, ice-harvesting tools and maps, paintings and sketches from past eras. The 1898 steam tugboat Mathilda is displayed in the yard next to the museum. In the summer months boat trips are available to nearby Rondout Lighthouse, where the creek drains into the Hudson. Boats putting in at the dock range from privately owned pleasure craft to oceangoing cruise liners. The Hudson River Sloop Clearwater has its winter home port here and visits frequently as do many historic reproduction vessels such as the Onrust and the Half Moon.

40|$|International audienceProtein-protein docking {{methods are}} of great {{importance}} for understanding interactomes at the structural level. It has become increasingly appealing to use not only experimental structures but also homology models of unbound subunits as input for docking simulations. So far we are missing a large scale assessment {{of the success of}} rigid-body <b>free</b> <b>docking</b> methods on homology models. We explored how we could benefit from comparative modeling of unbound subunits to expand docking benchmark datasets. Starting from a collection of 3157 non-redundant, high X-ray resolution heterodimers, we developed the PPI 4 DOCK benchmark containing 1417 docking targets based on unbound homology models. Rigid-body docking by Zdock showed that for 1208 cases (85. 2 %), at least one correct decoy was generated, emphasizing the efficiency of rigid-body docking in generating correct assemblies. Overall, the PPI 4 DOCK benchmark contains a large set of realistic cases and provides new ground for assessing docking and scoring methodologies.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of protein structures, particularly their binding sites, {{is essential for}} the success of modeling protein complexes. Computationally inexpensive methodology is required for genome-wide modeling of such structures. For systematic evaluation of potential accuracy in high-throughput modeling of binding sites, a statistical analysis of targettemplate sequence alignments was performed for a representative set of protein complexes. For most of the complexes, alignments containing all residues of the interface were found. The full interface alignments were obtained even in the case of poor alignments where a relatively small part of the target sequence (as low as 40 %) aligned to the template sequence, with a low overall alignment identity (, 30 %). Although such poor overall alignments might be considered inadequate for modeling of whole proteins, the alignment of the interfaces was strong enough for docking. In the set of homology models built on these alignments, one third of those ranked 1 by a simple sequence identity criteria had RMSD, 5 A˚, the accuracy suitable for low-resolution template <b>free</b> <b>docking.</b> Such models corresponded to multi-domain target proteins, whereas for single-domain proteins the best models had 5 A˚,RMSD, 10 A˚, the accuracy suitable for less sensitive structure-alignment methods.

This percentage will grow with the increasing availability of co-crystallized proteinprotei...|$|R

40|$|Carlo {{minimization}} (MCM) on both rigid-body and side-chain {{degrees of}} freedom to identify the lowest <b>free</b> energy <b>docked</b> arrangement of 2 protein structures. An improved version of the method that uses gradient-based minimization for off-rotamer sidechain optimization and includes information from unbound structures was used to create predictions for Rounds 4 and 5 of CAPRI. First, large numbers of independent MCM trajectories were carried out and the lowest <b>free</b> energy <b>docked</b> configurations identified. Second, new trajectories were started from these lowest energy structures to thoroughly sample the surrounding conformation space, and the lowest energy configurations were submitted as predictions. For all cases in which {{there were no significant}} backbone conformational changes, a small number of very low-energy configurations were identified in the first, global search and subsequently found to be close {{to the center of the}} basin of attraction in the free energy landscape in the second, local search. Following the release of the experimental coordinates, it was found that the centers of these free energy minima were remarkably close to the native structures in not only the rigid-body orientation but also the detailed conformations of the side-chains. Out of 8 targets, the lowest energy models had interface root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) less than 1. 1 Å from the correct structures for 6 targets, and interface RMSDs less than 0. 4 Å for 3 targets.
