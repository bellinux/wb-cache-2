According to Sir Bob Murray, then chairman of Sunderland A.F.C., the name Stadium of Light [...] "was chosen for two main reasons; namely as an ever-lasting tribute to the region's mine-workers and proud industrial heritage and in the expectation that the stadium would be a guiding light in the future.

The spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures produced its own mini-episode [...] "From Raxacoricofallapatorius with Love" [...] for the 2009 Comic Relief appeal. Unlike The Curse of Fatal Death, [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] {{are considered to be}} canonical. The canonicity of the two mini-episodes was affirmed by Moffat in Doctor Who Magazine. Moffat stated that, unlike Curse of the Fatal Death, [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] is not a spoof or a sketch, but rather [...] "a little miniature story" [...] {{in the style of the}} Children in Need mini-episodes. He described it as [...] "A moment of life aboard the TARDIS. But obviously life about the TARDIS instantly gets you into terrible jeopardy, and all of causality is threatened.

500|$|Albert {{continued}} to devote {{himself to the}} education of his family and the management of the royal household. His children's governess, Lady Lyttelton, thought him unusually kind and patient, and described him joining in family games with enthusiasm. He felt keenly the departure of his eldest daughter for Prussia when she married her fiancé at the beginning of 1858, and was disappointed that his eldest son, the Prince of Wales, did not respond well to the intense educational programme that Albert had designed for him. At the age of seven, the Prince of Wales was expected to take six hours of instruction, including an hour of German and an hour of French <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>When</b> the Prince of Wales failed at his lessons, Albert caned him. Corporal punishment was common at the time, and was not thought unduly harsh. Albert's biographer Roger Fulford wrote that the relationships between the family members were [...] "friendly, affectionate and normal... there is no evidence either in the Royal Archives or in the printed authorities to justify the belief that the relations between the Prince and his eldest son were other than deeply affectionate." [...] Philip Magnus wrote in his biography of Albert's eldest son that Albert [...] "tried to treat his children as equals; {{and they were able to}} penetrate his stiffness and reserve because they realised instinctively not only that he loved them but that he enjoyed and needed their company." ...|$|E

The men carried only six days rations, expecting to be resupplied en route. The food however was very poor, including hardtack, rice and bully beef, some of which had become rancid and sickening many men. They had leather toilet seats but no machetes, insect repellent, waterproof containers for medicine or personal effects, and it rained heavily <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>When</b> they received quinine pills, water chlorination tablets, vitamin pills, or salt tablets, usually a few days supply, they began to disintegrate almost as soon as the men put them in their pockets or packs.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Judah {{explained}} {{the words of}} [...] "her cry {{that has come to}} Me." [...] Noting that [...] does not say [...] "their cry" [...] but [...] "her cry," [...] Rabbi Judah told that the people of Sodom issued a proclamation that anyone who gave a loaf of bread to the poor or needy would be burned. Lot's daughter Pelotit, the wife of a magnate of Sodom, saw a poor man on the street, and was moved with compassion. <b>Every</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> she went out to draw water, she smuggled all kinds of provisions to him from her house in her pitcher. The men of Sodom questioned how the poor man could survive. When they found out, they brought Pelotit out to be burned. She cried out to God to maintain her cause, and her cry ascended before the Throne of Glory. And God said (in the words of [...] ) [...] "I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to her cry that has come to Me." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{viscosity}} can be neglected, the outflow rate of {{the water}} is governed by Torricelli's law, or more generally, by Bernoulli's principle. Viscosity will dominate the outflow rate if the water flows out through a nozzle that is sufficiently long and thin, as given by the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. Approximately, the flow rate is for such design inversely proportional to the viscosity, which depends on the temperature. Liquids generally become less viscous as the temperature increases. In the case of water, the viscosity varies {{by a factor of}} about seven between zero and 100 degrees Celsius. Thus, a water clock with such a nozzle would run about seven times faster at 100°C than at 0°C. Water is about 25 percent more viscous at 20°C than at 30°C, and a variation in temperature of one degree Celsius, in this [...] "room temperature" [...] range, produces a change of viscosity of about two percent. Therefore, a water clock with such a nozzle that keeps good time at some given temperature would gain or lose about half an hour per day if it were one degree Celsius warmer or cooler. To make it keep time within one minute per day would require its temperature to be controlled within °C (about ° Fahrenheit). There is no evidence that this was done in antiquity, so ancient water clocks with sufficiently thin and long nozzles (unlike the modern pendulum-controlled one described above) cannot have been reliably accurate by modern standards. [...] Note, however, that while modern timepieces may not be reset for long periods, water clocks were likely reset <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> refilled, based on a sundial, so the cumulative error would not have been great.|$|E

2500|$|Proclus {{said the}} statue {{was in the}} adyton of a temple at Sais, but the inner areas of Egyptian temples were not {{accessible}} to anyone but priests, and {{it is unlikely that}} a statue of a deity would have been permanently veiled; priests saw the cult image of the god <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> performing temple rites. However, a statue in a temple's courtyards or halls could have borne an inscription similar to the one Plutarch and Proclus related. The first part of the inscription—"I am all that has been and is and shall be"—means the goddess encompasses everything. This claim was commonly made of creator gods such as Ra or Amun in Egyptian religion; if the same was said about Isis, it reflected her increased status in Greco-Roman times, in which she was often said to be the creator of the world. The second part—"no one has ever lifted my mantle"—implies that the goddess was virginal, a claim that was occasionally made of Isis in Greco-Roman times but conflicted with the long-standing belief {{that she and her husband}} Osiris conceived their son Horus. Proclus's version suggests that the goddess conceived and gave birth to the sun without the participation of a male deity, which would reflect Egyptian myths about Neith as the mother of the sun god Ra. Another possible explanation, suggested by the Egyptologist Jan Assmann, is that the latter part of the Egyptian inscription said [...] "There is nobody except me", proclaiming that the all-encompassing goddess was unique, and was mistranslated into Greek as [...] "there is nobody who opened [...] my face." ...|$|E
