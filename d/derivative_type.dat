A closed-form analytical solution of geometrical skin effect at the wellbore is derived.

In this work, we extend this approach {{to the case of}} third-order derivatives by resorting to a fourth-order CONFAC decomposition. We show how different third-order <b>derivative</b> <b>types</b> can be combined into a single fourth-order CONFAC tensor model with the goal of increasing the diversity of observations, so that higher under-determinacy levels can be handled.
