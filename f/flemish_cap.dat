50|$|The <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> {{is an area}} of shallow {{waters in}} the north Atlantic Ocean {{centered}} roughly at 47° north, 45° west or about 350 miles (560 km) east of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E
50|$|The {{waters of}} the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> are deeper and warmer than the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The 58,000-square-kilometre area may have served as an {{important}} refuge for marine species during the last ice age.|$|E
5000|$|Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene. Folmer fragment: 2 {{haplotype}}s with 1 {{base pair}} difference. One haplotype (EU442194) is present throughout the North Atlantic. The second haplotype (KC574389) {{has so far}} only been found in <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> populations.|$|E
50|$|By {{studying}} spicules in sediments cores {{taken from}} sponge grounds {{on the slopes}} of the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> and Grand Bank (off Newfoundland, Canada), scientists managed to detect the presence of sponges in the past. The oldest record for Geodiidae sponges in this region was found in a long core collected in the slope of the Grand Bank, where typical sterraster spicules were found in the top of a submarine landslide deposit older than 25 000 BP. Continuous presence of sponges was recorded on the southeastern region of the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> as far as 130 000 BP. It seems the distribution range of the Geodiidae in this area significantly expended after the deglaciation.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> {{is located}} within {{an area of}} {{transition}} between the cold waters of the Labrador Current and warmer waters influenced by the Gulf Stream. The mixing of the warmer and colder waters over the plateau produces the characteristic clockwise circulation current over the cap.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> lies outside Canada's 200 {{nautical}} mile (370 km) Exclusive Economic Zone established in 1977, {{and is therefore}} in international fishing waters. Overfishing has become a serious issue in recent years. Cod and American plaice are particularly endangered here and the numbers of redfish have shown a significant decline.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} from 30 to 2000 meter depths. Most North-East Atlantic records {{are from the}} {{continental}} margins, between 200 and 500 m. In the North-West Atlantic (Grand Banks, <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap,</b> Nova Scotia, and Davis Strait), it has been recorded between 410 and 1852 meter depths. Shallow specimens are common along the Norwegian coast, especially in fjords.|$|E
5000|$|Jacquet Island was {{a phantom}} island charted at {{approximately}} [...] in the North Atlantic, {{just to the}} east of the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap.</b> Belief in its existence continued into the 19th century, when it was discussed by cartographers as a possible midway point for the transatlantic telegraph cable. John Scott of the Seaflower reported seeing it in 1836.|$|E
50|$|By 4 May, 10 ships {{had dropped}} out of the main convoy body and had been {{organized}} into two straggler groups. The convoy's screen had been reduced to seven ships. Four additional U-boats joined the attacking units, who were reorganized and repositioned to trap the convoy between Cape Farewell on the southern tip of Greenland and <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap,</b> some 300 nmi km east of Cape Race, Newfoundland.|$|E
50|$|In Late Triassic and Early Jurassic {{there were}} two stages of rifting {{involving}} extension and subsistence on the western margin of Iberia. It also extended the western margin. The Iberian Abyssal Plain, off {{the west coast of}} Portugal and Spain, formed 126 Ma. This separated Newfoundland's Grand Banks, with Galica Bank and <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> being split at 118 Ma. By Early Cretaceous, 110 Ma rifting occurs on west and north west edges.|$|E
5000|$|In the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, B. brevicauda {{is known}} from the [...] waters near Portugal, {{as well as one}} record from an area {{northwest}} of Spain as well as near the Azores. In the Western Atlantic, it has been found near Bermuda, in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Caribbean sea, and may rarely appear near the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> region. [...] B. brevicauda is also found in both the eastern and western Indian Oceans.|$|E
50|$|On {{the last}} day of February, the {{destroyer}} escorts put to sea again to follow several submarines reportedly heading west toward the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap.</b> Although the weather had improved somewhat, the warships were continually pounded by the seas and were grateful to be relieved on 14 March. Bronstein arrived in New York on 17 March for five days of voyage repairs and then, with Baker, reported to New London, Connecticut, to serve as an escort and target ship for submarine training.|$|E
5000|$|Andrea Gail {{began her}} final voyage departing from Gloucester Harbor, Massachusetts, on September 20, 1991, {{bound for the}} Grand Banks of Newfoundland {{off the coast of}} eastern Canada. After poor fishing, Captain Frank W. [...] "Billy" [...] Tyne Jr. headed east to the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> where he {{believed}} they would have better luck. Despite weather reports warning of dangerous conditions, Tyne set course for home on October 26-27. The ship's ice machine was malfunctioning and {{would not have been able}} to maintain the catch for much longer.|$|E
5000|$|Canada's EEZ {{currently}} {{occupies the}} majority of the Grand Banks except for the lucrative [...] "nose" [...] (eastern extremity, near the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap)</b> and [...] "tail" [...] (southern extremity) of the fishing bank. The 1783 Treaty of Paris gave the United States shared rights to fish in these waters, but that section of the Treaty is no longer in force. The French territory Saint Pierre and Miquelon Exclusive Economic Zone occupies a pin-shaped section at the west edge of the Grand Banks, with the 22 km radius head of the pin surrounding the islands and the needle heading south for 348 km.|$|E
5000|$|Mosley resumed ASW patrols in the Gulf of Maine on 24 March; then, until 4 April, {{she searched}} the stormy North Atlantic {{south and west}} of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap.</b> On 10 April, TG 22.14 rendezvoused at sea with a hunter-killer group built around [...] and began barrier patrols along the 30th {{meridian}} north of latitude 48°30'. One of four CVE-DE groups, Mission Bay and her escorts comprised the northern force of the First Barrier Force. Divided into two barrier forces, the hunter-killer groups formed two lines of defense against a harassing blitz by German snorkel submarines dubbed Group [...] "Seewolf".|$|E
50|$|During the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, tectonic extensional forces {{created a}} shallow angle east-dipping {{detachment}} fault. This fault cut {{from what is}} now the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> margin in Nova Scotia, eastern Canada to the Galicia margin, which is located west of the Iberian Peninsula. This fault penetrated the upper portion of the continental crust and merged into the transition between brittle upper and plastic lower crust. In time, displacement along this detachment fault decreased to zero at a point under the Galicia margin. East of this detachment fault, the structure of the Galicia NVPM is entirely pure shear resulting in rotated fault blocks, normal faults, and continent-ward dipping seismic reflectors. Simple shear is only evident in {{the western edge of the}} Galicia margin and the upper crust of the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> margin where the crust is brittle. Below this brittle crust, the ductile crust follows McKenzie’s pure shear model. Mantle material composed of peridotites is serpentinized by circulating seawater after it rises close enough to the upper crust due to its low density and isostatic forces. After sufficient thinning of the lithosphere, this serpentinized material is emplaced at the continent-ocean transition. This is why the transitional crust of NVPM are made of serpentinized peridotite instead of magmatic structures seen in VPM. Since the emplacement of the peridotite, oceanic crust has been forming at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and driving the two NVPM apart. The simple shear detachment became a deactivated detachment fault once this rifting process began the formation of new oceanic crust. This process explains the structures seen at the Galicia margin today.|$|E
5000|$|Designated Task Group 22.14, Mosley {{and sister}} escorts, , Menges, and [...] trained off Block Island before {{steaming}} to Casco Bay on 4 March. The next day, they sailed {{to seek out}} and destroy an enemy submarine reported off Newfoundland, north of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap.</b> They made first contact on 13 March, and during the next 5 days carried out persistent search-and-destroy operations. On 18 March in waters west of treacherous Sable Island, day-long hedgehog and depth charge attacks brought [...] "air bubbles, wreckage, and large quantities of oil" [...] to the surface. A violent underwater explosion at 1622 {{marked the end of}} , and the hunter killer group returned to Casco Bay on 20 March.|$|E
5000|$|The colder {{parts of}} the Gulf Stream turn northward near the [...] "tail" [...] of the Grand Banks at 50°W where the Azores Current {{branches}} off to flow south of the Azores. From there the NAC flow north-eastward east of the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> (47°N, 45°W). Approaching the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, it then turns eastward and becomes much broader and more diffuse. It then splits into a colder, north-eastern branch and a warmer eastern branch. As the warmer branch turns southward most of the subtropical component of the Gulf Stream has been diverted southward and, as a consequence, the North Atlantic is mostly supplied by subpolar waters, including a contribution from the Labrador Current recirculated into the NAC at 45°N.|$|E
5000|$|The Lusitanian Basin {{stretches}} {{along the}} mid Portuguese coast with part {{on land and}} part off shore. In Sinemurian-Callovian thick layers of carbonates were deposited. (. Off the northern coast of Portugal is the Porto Basin, also elongated in the north-south direction. Further offshore from this, and also off shore from {{the west coast of}} Spain is the Galicia Interior Basin. These basins were formed by rifting in the Late Triassic (...) [...] Further out to sea off the west coast of Spain is the Galicia Bank, which consists of continental crust, and was formerly attached to the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap.</b> The Galicia Bank has limestone and marl deposited in shallow water from the Tithonian age. This is capped by dolomite from the Berriasian age (...) [...]|$|E
5000|$|On {{the south}} side {{deposits}} of carbonates and clastic sediments formed a shelf in shallow water during late Triassic and Liassic times. This was rifted in Toarcian times (Early Jurassic 190 Ma). Active rifting was complete by 160 Ma. After this thermal subsidence occurred {{till the end of}} Cretaceous. During this time rifting separated North America from Africa forming a transform zone [...] In the late Triassic and early Jurassic there were two stages of rifting involving extension and subsidence on the western margin of Iberia. It also extended the western margin. The Iberian Abyssal Plain, off the west coast of Portugal and Spain, formed 126 Ma. This separated Newfoundland's Grand Banks, with Galicia Bank and <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> being split at 118 Ma. By Early Cretaceous, 110 Ma rifting occurs on west and north west edges.|$|E
50|$|In October 1991, the {{commercial}} fishing boat Andrea Gail returns to port in Gloucester, Massachusetts, with a poor catch. Desperate for money, Captain Billy Tyne (Clooney) convinces the Andrea Gail crew {{to join him}} for one more late season fishing expedition. The crew heads out past their usual fishing grounds in the Grand Banks, leaving a developing thunderstorm behind them. Initially unsuccessful, they head to the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap,</b> where their luck greatly improves. At the height of their fishing the ice machine breaks; {{the only way to}} sell their catch before it spoils is to hurry back to shore. After debating whether to sail through the building storm or to wait it out, the crew decides to risk the storm. However, between the Andrea Gail and Gloucester is a confluence of two powerful weather fronts and a hurricane, which the Andrea Gail crew underestimates.|$|E
5000|$|Early in January 1945, Bostwick steamed to Narragansett Bay {{to screen}} [...] while she {{conducted}} pilot qualifications. The destroyer escort returned to New York on 22 January and received orders to join [...] in TG 22.4 for more hunter-killer activities. Bostwick met the task group at sea 600 {{miles south of}} Iceland on 16 February. The group, which consisted of 12 destroyer escorts and one escort carrier, formed a scouting line 90 miles long. Searching in vain for an enemy weather-reporting submarine, TG 22.4 soon found itself in winds of hurricane force. The mountainous seas died down as the wind lessened on the 22nd, but the escorts faced rising seas again before they reached port for refueling. Bostwick put into Hvalfjordür, Iceland, late on 25 February. TG 22.4 got underway again just three days later to track several German submarines reportedly heading west toward the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap.</b> While the weather had improved, but the seas remained heavy and continued to batter TG 22.4. Bostwick and her colleagues gratefully turned their duties overto TG 22.13 on 14 March.|$|E
50|$|Hooded seals live {{primarily}} on drifting pack ice and {{in deep water}} in the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic. Although some drift away to warmer regions during the year, their best survival rate is in colder climates. They {{can be found on}} four distinct areas with pack ice: near Jan Mayen Island (northeast of Iceland); off Labrador and northeastern Newfoundland; the Gulf of St. Lawrence; and the Davis Strait (off midwestern Greenland). Males appear to be localized around areas of complex seabed, such as Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, and the <b>Flemish</b> <b>cap,</b> while females concentrate their habitat efforts {{primarily on}} shelf areas, such as the Labrador Shelf. Hooded seals are known to be a highly migratory species that often wander long distances, as far west as Alaska and as far south as the Canary Islands and Guadeloupe. Prior to the mid 1990s, hooded seal sightings in Maine and the east Atlantic were rare, but began increasing in the mid 1990s. From January 1997 to December 1999, a total of 84 recorded sightings of hooded seals occurred in the Gulf of Maine, one in France and one in Portugal. From 1996 to 2006, five strandings and sightings were noted near the Spanish coasts in the Mediterranean Sea. There is no scientific explanation for the increase in sightings and range of the hooded seal.|$|E
50|$|Equipped with {{specialized}} meteorological instruments, Manhasset {{joined the}} weather patrol in the North Atlantic Ocean to gather vital weather information used in compiling forecasts for Allied European operations against the Axis. She braved {{the dangers of}} stormy seas and the menace of German U-boats while operating her assigned and isolated patrol areas out of Argentia, Newfoundland, and Boston, Massachusetts. She averaged about one patrol a month, usually about three weeks long. Manhasset also patrolled and searched for German submarines. While cruising midway between <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> and Cape Farewell, Greenland, she depth charged a suspected U-boat, with no positive results, 27 April 1943. The following week convoy ONI-5 steamed through her patrol station, and on 5 May she provided support {{during one of the}} most savage convoy battles of World War II. The slow 43 ship convoy was attacked by U-boats between late 4 May and early 6 May. Although the convoy lost 13 ships during the hazardous passage from the United Kingdom to New York City, courageous escorts sank five submarines and repulsed the remainder. Never again did German submarines attack in such force. As Manhasset patrolled near the British merchant ship Dolius, torpedoed and abandoned earlier in the day but still afloat, she made sound contact with a submarine late in the afternoon. She made six vigorous depth charge attacks and sighted first a periscope wake followed by an oil slick. However, she sighted no wreckage and broke off attack to guard the torpedoed ship after more than 2 hours of searching.|$|E
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of World War II to the Autumn 1941, the Bdu, aided by B-Dienst decipherments of radio intelligence from Allied shore stations, built up an extensive operational intelligence map of the movement of shipping and convoys, and maintained a fairly constant strategic pattern in the North Atlantic. By the end of 1941, B-Dienst knew the general rhythm of the eastbound HX and SC and the westbound ON convoys and knew the general routes they followed. Lacking specific intelligence on a specific convoy, the Kriegsmarine {{was able to make}} an informed guess as to its probable position on any given date; easily within 500-600 miles in a generally north-south direction and within one days run 150-200 miles along the Great circle. If 10 U-Boats spaced 15 miles apart were searching a specific area, the pack could sweep the area in 2 days, and given fair visibility, would have a fair to good chance of locating the convoy. B-Dienst had computed the areas of probable greatest convoy density, and throughout the war had from two to six submarine groups patrolling these areas. They were configured in three lines, and these changed as new intelligence dictated. In the east, the group was deployed in line running south from Iceland to the 50° parallel, somewhere near the 25° meridian and groups on this line were intended to intercept ON convoys, and hunt them to 45° W, refuel and then take up patrol in the west. In the west, the line was established on an east-west direction from North of Newfoundland to the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap.</b> A third line extended from the south-east tip of Greenland in a south-easterly direction to the 40° parallel, submarine groups on the line attacked both east and west bound convoys.|$|E
5000|$|In {{spring and}} early summer, this current {{transports}} icebergs from the glaciers of Greenland southwards into the trans-Atlantic shipping lanes. The waters of the Labrador Current have a cooling effect on the Canadian Atlantic provinces and USA upper Northeast coast from Maine south to Massachusetts. The transport of the Labrador Current is believed to contain a large barotropic component. Early estimates indicated that the current may be 30% stronger than geostrophic calculations indicated {{as a result of}} a significant barotropic flow component (Hayes and Robe, 1978). Greenberg and Petrie (1988) calculated a total transport of 7.6 sverdrup. (One sverdrup (Sv) is equal to 106 cubic meters per second.) The geostrophic transport was calculated to be just 4.1 Sv (based on IIP sections). With a 30% increase (due to barotropic flow) the transport is only 5.3 Sv so, the high transport values are thought to largely from the inclusion of deep currents indicated by a deep water mooring. Speeds for the Labrador Current are about 0.3-0.5 m/s along the shelf edge (Greenberg and Petrie, Reynaud et al., 1985). Current speeds of 0.3-0.5 m/s were found by Reynaud et al. (1995) for the Labrador Current. Including the barotropic component, they estimate a value of 3 Sv for the continental shelf branch of the Labrador Current and 16 Sv transport for the slope branch of the Labrador Current. The inshore branch of the Labrador Current is approximately 100 km wide and 150 m deep and it passes through Avalon Channel and the splitting of the Labrador Current around <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> can be seen in the satellite tracked drifters (Petrie and Isenor). Within the Flemish Pass, Petrie and Isenor (1985) report that the width of the Labrador Current is reduced to 50 km with a speed of 0.25 m/s which they believe is actually 0.30 m/s.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results from {{processing}} and interpreting nine multichannel seismic reflection lines collected during the 1992 Erable experiment over the northeastern margin of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> offshore Newfoundland. These lines, combined into five cross-sections, provide increased seismic coverage over this lightly probed section of the margin and reveal tectonically significant along-strike variations in the degree and compartmentalization of crustal thinning. Similar to the southeastern margins of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> and the Grand Banks, a transitional zone of exhumed serpentinized mantle is interpreted between thinned continental and oceanic crust. The 25 km wide transitional zone bears similarities to the 120 km wide transitional zone interpreted as exhumed serpentinized mantle on the conjugate Irish Atlantic margin but the significant width difference is suggestive of an asymmetric conjugate pair. A 40 – 50 km wide zone of inferred strike-slip shearing is interpreted and observed to extend along most of the northeastern margin of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap.</b> Individual shear zones (SZs) may represent extensions of SZs and normal faults within the Orphan Basin providing further evidence for the rotation and displacement of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> out of Orphan Basin. The asymmetry between the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> and Irish conjugate pairs is likely {{due in large part}} to the rotation and displacement of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> which resulted in the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> margin displaying features of both a strike-slip margin and an extensional margin. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{otoliths}} {{of different}} <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> cod cohorts are studied {{for the period}} 1980 to 1989. It is shown ' that the annual classes of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> cod from 1979 to 1989 provide no evidence of migration. This conclusion {{is based on a}} study of their otoliths following the characterization of the rings applied to Greenland cod (H-J Ratz, 1990) ...|$|E
40|$|Flemish Pass, {{located at}} the western subpolar margin, is a passage (sill depth 1200 m) that is {{constrained}} by the Grand Banks and the underwater plateau <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap.</b> In addition to the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) pathway offshore of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap,</b> Flemish Pass represents another southward transport pathway for two modes of Labrador Sea Water (LSW), the lightest component of North Atlantic Deep Water carried with the DWBC. This pathway avoids potential stirring regions east of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> and deflection into the interior North Atlantic. Ship-based velocity measurements between 2009 and 2013 at 47 °N in Flemish Pass and in the DWBC east of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> revealed a considerable southward transport of Upper LSW through Flemish Pass (15 - 27 %, - 1. 0 to - 1. 5 Sv). About 98 % of the denser Deep LSW were carried around <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> as Flemish Pass is too shallow for considerable transport of Deep LSW. Hydrographic time series from ship-based measurements show a significant warming of 0. 3 °C/decade and a salinification of 0. 03 /decade of the Upper LSW in Flemish Pass between 1993 and 2013. Almost identical trends were found for the evolution in the Labrador Sea and in the DWBC east of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap.</b> This indicates that the long-term hydrographic variability of Upper LSW in Flemish Pass {{as well as in}} the DWBC at 47 °N is dominated by changes in the Labrador Sea, which are advected southward. Fifty years of numerical ocean model simulations in Flemish Pass suggest that these trends are part of a multidecadal cycle...|$|E
40|$|Food {{and feeding}} of 5592 {{individuals}} of American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides, Fabricius) was examined from Grand Bank (NAFO Divisions 3 NO), <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> (NAFO Div. 3 M) and Svalbard Area (ICES Div. IIb). Differencies in diet composition were observed by areas. Feeding intensity was higher on <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> (77. 6 %) and {{lower in the}} Svalbard (4. 7 %). There was significant seasonal feeding variation in the Svalbard, with higher feeding intensity in summer. The main groups of prey were Pisces (46 %), Echinodermata (20 %), Crustacea (16 %) and Mollusca (10 %). The prey spectrum was larger {{in the south of}} the Grand Bank, the main prey being Pisces (64 %), while both on <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> and in Svalbard the main prey was Ophiuroidea (39 %). Feeding pattern indicated that American plaice is a daytime feeder, and no marked differences were noted over a 24 hour period. Low cannibalism intensity was observed on Grand Bank. A greater similitude was present between the diets on <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> and in Svalbard. Composition and overlapping diet, by length classes, were also analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Sampling lenght {{and weight}} data {{collected}} during <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> surveys (1995 and 1996) and fishing activity monitoring (1993 and 1994) {{were used to}} produce relationships and lenght-weight plots for some commercial and non-commercial species encountered in the Northwest Atlantic.

40|$|The {{food and}} feeding of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> cod in summer are {{described}} {{for six years}} utilizing 3315 stomachs. The feeding intensity was high and the Fey spectrum was narrow in all years. Hyperiids and redfish stand out in the diet of <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> cod, Illex illecebrosus and polychaetes had a high annual variability. Invertebrates (crustaceans and polychaetes) were dominant in juvenile cod diets, while the most important prey in adult cod was fish, mainly redfish. The cannibalism rate has strong year to year fluctuations on the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap.</b> There is a positive relation between predator size (cod) and prey size (redfish). The Condition Factor variation is closely related with the predation intensity on Sebastes. A change in the diet composition is observed {{in the last two}} years. This change consisted of an increase of hyperiids in the adult cod diet and a decline of Sebastes sp...|$|E
40|$|Since 1988, {{when the}} <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> survey started, {{it has been}} {{observed}} a shift of cod population towards shallow waters. Although similar concentrations were related with dense-dependent effects in adjacent areas, it is not clear why in <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> this shrink happens in the shallow part of the bank. This behaviour could affect the survey catchability and so the trends of the indices of abundance-at-age that are the main information in the assessment of the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> cod status. This work has different goals: the first one is to assess the temporal trend in the shoaling movement by age group; the second one is to discuss the possible causes of this behaviour: changes in the population structure, dense-dependent factors or environmental changes, taking into account the physical features of water masses and the circulation over the Cap; by the end is also discussed the assessment implications of this behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Oceanographic {{observations}} on the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> (around 47 °N, 45 °W) from the early- 1990 s to 1999 are compared to the long-term mean and to conditions {{during the past several}} decades. The mean temperature and salinity fields and their seasonal cycles were first computed and then used to construct T/S anomaly time series. The data shows a relatively warm time period from the 1950 s through the 1960 s and three colder-than-normal periods since the early- 1970 s. In general, it was found that variations in water properties on the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> are highly correlated with those observed in the inshore branch of the Labrador Current at Station 27 and {{in other areas of the}} Newfoundland Continental Shelf. Studies have shown that these conditions are linked to the large-scale atmospheric winter circulation, sea ice conditions, local atmospheric forcing and advection. An examination of local air-sea heat flux indicate that advection of Labrador Current water into the region may be the principle cause of oceanic variability over the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap.</b> An examination of recent acoustic Doppler current measurements and geostrophic current calculations indicated the predominance of an anticyclonic gyre circulation around the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Cap</b> during the summer and a significant and persistent Labrador Current component to the circulation.
