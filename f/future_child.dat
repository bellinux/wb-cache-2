500|$|Jigger and his shipmates, {{joined by}} Billy, then sing about {{life on the}} sea ("Blow High, Blow Low"). [...] The whaler tries to recruit Billy to help with a robbery, but Billy declines, as the victim—Julie's former boss, Mr. Bascombe—might have to be killed. [...] Mrs. Mullin enters and tries to tempt Billy back to the {{carousel}} (and to her). [...] He would have to abandon Julie; a married barker cannot evoke the same sexual tension as one who is single. [...] Billy reluctantly mulls it over as Julie arrives and the others leave. [...] She tells him that she is pregnant, and Billy is overwhelmed with happiness, ending all thoughts of returning to the carousel. [...] Once alone, Billy imagines the fun he will have with Bill Jr.—until he realizes that his child might be a girl, and reflects soberly that [...] "you've {{got to be a}} father to a girl" [...] ("Soliloquy"). [...] Determined to provide financially for his <b>future</b> <b>child,</b> whatever the means, Billy decides to be Jigger's accomplice.|$|E
500|$|Season 4 {{begins in}} an {{alternate}} timeline, {{one in which}} September had failed to save the alternate version of Peter in 1985, according to the Observers. This creates a butterfly effect influencing the main characters' pasts but otherwise stabilizing both universes due {{to the creation of}} the bridge. Peter is pulled into this new timeline due to the actions of the alternate timeline's Fringe team, which includes Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel). Peter initially works to return to his own timeline, fueled by fears that his memories are altering Cortexiphan-dosed Olivia's of this timeline, but after encountering a wounded September, Peter comes to learn that this timeline is truly his home, and both he and Olivia come to accept the change, rekindling their affair. September also reveals to Peter that the Observers needed to erase Peter's son, Henry, to assure their future will be created, though noting that Peter's <b>future</b> <b>child</b> with Olivia will be important. Meanwhile, in the present, William Bell has instructed David Robert Jones, alive in this timeline, to work with the parallel universe's version of Nina Sharp to synchronize the two universes, aiming to collapse them both and pave the way for a third universe under Bell's control, using Olivia's Cortexiphan powers to enable the collapse. The Fringe division is forced to close the dimensional bridge, but this fails to stop Bell's plan. Walter is left with one choice, to shoot and kill Olivia, her death disrupting the process and saving the world. Olivia's [...] "death" [...] is only temporary, as the Cortexiphan in her body is consumed to repair the bullet wound, leaving her alive and healthy but lacking her psionic abilities. As Olivia and Peter begin their lives together, September appears to Walter and warns that the Observers [...] "are coming".|$|E

40|$|This thesis used an {{evolutionary}} framework to examine human sexual conflict over ideal family size (IFS) in Indonesian couples. Disparate reproductive goals {{between males and}} females may lead to sexual conflict. This may increase the likelihood of coercion or compromise by individuals to optimize their reproductive strategies. Using the Indonesian Family Life Survey this thesis analyzed sexual conflict between men and women in Indonesia. Three hypotheses were proposed to explore preferences in IFS and a person’s influence in achieving that preference. Specifically, what influences an individual’s choice in IFS? Within a couple, what factors influence preferences for <b>future</b> <b>children</b> and does this vary by sex? If there is a discrepancy between a husband and wife over the number of <b>future</b> <b>children,</b> who achieves his/her desired number of children? It was predicted men may have higher IFS or prefer more <b>future</b> <b>children</b> within a couple due to their reduced cost of producing offspring, but the results suggest {{that this is not the}} case. Sex is not a significant predictor of IFS. But within couples when the couples disagreed on number of children, men wanted more children. It was predicted men would be able to achieve their preference of desired future fertility (in couples where desired <b>future</b> <b>children</b> differed). This was not supported. Instead, women achieved their desired number of <b>future</b> <b>children</b> more frequently than men – approximately 55 % of the time. Other socioecological factors were explored to determine if they interacted with sex to influence IFS, desired number of <b>future</b> <b>children,</b> and who prevailed in their preference...|$|R

5000|$|Some Mormon women {{experience}} {{a vision of}} a <b>future</b> <b>child</b> that inspired them to have more children. If the next child isn't the same as the child in the vision, the woman knows that the child is still [...] "coming" [...] and has another child. Margaret K. Brady documented this narrative type and sees {{it as a way to}} relieve Mormon women from their guilt in deciding not to have more (or any) children, by giving them revelation through their own <b>future</b> <b>child.</b> Even though the result is to support the status quo and have more children, the woman is the one who has the vision and decides to have more children. Sometimes these women share this experience in a visionary narrative. Telling the story reinforces the woman's spiritual identity, thus giving her a measure of power in her religious community.|$|E

40|$|This article targets {{a flying}} {{buttress}} of normative heterosexuality: its physical reproduction via procreation and its symbolic propagation through parents’ pre-natal preferences for heterosexuality in <b>future</b> <b>children.</b> While the parental “taste for heterosexuality” is often asserted {{for the sake}} of <b>future</b> <b>children</b> themselves, this justification overlooks the role of parental self-interest, including anticipated social gains to parents from heterosexuality in children. Hence the taste sets the stage both for sexual orientation-based abuse of <b>future</b> <b>children</b> and the devaluation of sexual minority adults. Courts too have a taste for heterosexuality, shown here in two state court cases denying gays and lesbians the right to marry. These courts hold that homosexuals reproduce deliberately while heterosexuals may do so recklessly, leading the courts to conclude that only heterosexuals require marriage to ensure stable homes for children. These decisions “subsidize” normative heterosexuality and its reproduction by conferring symbolic capital on both. Apart from the burdens it places on sexual minorities, this symbolic privilege comes at a cost to heterosexuals and children alike. By privileging the reproduction of normative heterosexuality, this symbolic economy discourages heterosexuals from fully appreciating the long-term consequences of reproduction. This economy also gives them a pretext for avoiding lifestyle competition with homosexual parents, to the detriment of children who might benefit from the improved parenting technique that such competition would encourage...|$|R
