5|$|On April 20, 1925, Wright {{returned}} from eating <b>dinner</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> detached dining room {{when he noticed}} smoke billowing from his bedroom. By that time of night, most of the employees had returned home; only a driver and one apprentice were left in the complex. Unlike the first Taliesin fire, Wright {{was able to get}} help immediately.

However, the workrooms where Wright kept his architectural drafts were spared. According to Wright's autobiography, the fire appeared to have begun near a telephone in his bedroom. Wright also mentioned a lightning storm approaching immediately before noticing the fire. Wright scholars speculate that the storm may have caused an electrical surge through the telephone system, sparking the fire.|$|E

25|$|The {{requirement}} that all cadets wishing to eat <b>dinner</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mess hall must be present for a prayer {{was the basis}} for a lawsuit in 2002 when two cadets sued VMI over the prayer said before dinner.
