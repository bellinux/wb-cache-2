On complete blood count, initially 200 patients (66. 6 %) were found to have hypochromic microcytic anaemia.

Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study carried out at a private laboratory in the southern suburb of Beirut, Lebanon between 2002 and 2014. The sickling test was carried out for each patient using two methods: the classical “sodium metabisulfite sickling test”, and the new “sickling test method” used in the private lab.  As a confirmatory test, <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> was run on a random sample of 223 cases who were found to be positive using the two sickling tests.   Results: A total of 899 cases were found to be positive for the sickle cell trait out of 184, 105 subjects screened during the 12 -year period, prevalence = 0. 49 % (95 % CI: 0. 46 – 0. 52).

Study Design: This was an observational cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: This {{study was conducted}} at the Clinical Laboratory, Agha Khan University Hospital from 151 August 2003 to 31 st October 2003. Materials and Methods: Blood samples were taken from normal individuals in EDTA and were run on Coulter STKS. The indices that were taken into consideration were haemoglobin, RBC count and MCV. DF was calculated by formula as proposed by England and Fraser. Discriminant Function = MCV- (5 xHaemoglobin) -RBC- 3. 4. If the value was less than zero, it was interpreted as suspected thalassaemia minor. Mean MCV and mean RBC count in thalassemia minor and iron deficiency anaemia were calculated and compared. Results: A total of 1270 individuals were included in the study. In 70 individuals, the red cell indices were found to be low.

The result of this present study showed that, the mean±SD of red blood cell, haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume, red cell indices and red cell distribution width of HbAA in pre and post anti-malaria drug treatment were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower compared to HbAS and HbAC in pre and post anti-malaria drug treatment. This present study showed that, HbAS and HbAC suffer less malaria attack with lower incidence of clinical malaria compared to HbAA...|$|E
40|$|<b>Haemoglobin</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> {{screening}} of 2341 infants from the oases of eastern Saudi Arabia, performed {{in an attempt}} to detect cases early and then to follow up and give better management to patients with sickle cell disease, showed 20 % with S-trait and 43 with sickle cell disease (37 HbSS and 6 S-beta(0) thalassaemia). On follow-up from birth (or from 3 months) for a mean of 3 1 / 2 years there was more morbidity and mortality than in matched Saudi Arab controls, but these rates were lower than for affected black infants in the US or Jamaica. Serial haemoglobin levels were l g/dl lower than for controls; height and weight increases were the same. Mean fetal haemoglobin level was 32 % at 4 - 5 years. Half of a subsample of 23 cases had evidence of coexistent alpha-thalassaemia which appeared to protect against functional asplenia, judged by the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies; however {{there was no difference in}} degree of anaemia or clinical course. Early screening is recommended for infants at risk for sickle cell disease, and comprehensive care should be given even if the infant has the less severe type...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the feasibility of large-scale population screening for the sickle cell gene in high risk areas with limited resources. A programme designed to detect the sickle cell trait and sickle cell disease has screened 359, 823 subjects among 2, 087 (99. 7 %) of the villages in Raipur District, Chhattisgarh State, India between October 2007 and June 2010. Children aged 3 – 15  years were initially screened in the villages by solubility tests on fingerprick samples. Venipuncture was performed on subjects with positive solubility tests, and the samples were transferred to Raipur Medical College for alkaline <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b> The sickle cell trait occurred in 33, 467 (9. 30 %) and an SS phenotype in 747 (0. 21 %). The gene frequencies were not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium most likely due to a deficiency of the SS phenotype failing to enter the sampled population from either sickness or early death. Subjects with abnormal haemoglobin genotypes may factor this information into decisions regarding marriage and avoid the risks of having children with sickle cell disease. The techniques described may be a model for other developing societies with limited resources...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{preliminary}} {{reports have}} suggested potential interactions between microcytic anaemia and mood disorders. In particular, heterozygous β-thalassaemia has {{been implicated in}} the bipolar spectrum. This study surveyed relevant haematological parameters in a large sample of psychiatric outpatients {{with the aim of}} clarifying previous observations. Methods Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) was analysed in 1014 consecutive patients diagnosed according to modified Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC). <b>Haemoglobin</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> and/or chromatography was performed in blood samples from 143 patients with reduced MCV. Prevalence of heterozygous β-thalassaemia was estimated based on the rates of patients with reduced MCV and increased haemoglobin A 2 concentration. Results MCV lower than 80 μ 3 was found in greater proportions among bipolar compared with the remaining RDC subgroups (183 / 732 = 25. 0 % versus 51 / 282 = 18. 1 %; p = 0. 02; relative risk = 1. 38; Fisher's exact test). This difference can mainly be attributed to heterozygous β-thalassaemia, the estimated prevalence of which was 16. 4 % among bipolar and 9. 9 % among non-bipolar subgroups (p = 0. 01; relative risk = 1. 65). Conclusion The results are consistent with the hypothesis that heterozygous β-thalassaemia might play a role as a susceptibility factor in bipolar spectrum disorders in specific populations. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aim and objectives: β-thalassemia {{arises from}} a {{defect in the}} β {{globulin}} chain synthesis from clinically silent heterogeneous thalassemia minor to severe transfusion dependent thalassemia major. Transfusion related iron overload is the primary therapeutic complication in β-thalassemia major which leads to peroxidative stress and adversely affects the functioning of multiple organs. Hypothalamic–pituitary –thyroid axis, para-thyroid, adrenal, pancreas, gonads, all may show hypo-activity. The prognosis depends on the amount and the duration of iron overload. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the thyroid hormones in patients with β TM in a children’s hospital in New Delhi, India. Materials and Methods: 68 patients (aged 1 - 12 years) with β-thalassemia major that undergo periodical blood transfusion at Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalya Hospital, New Delhi were included in the study. The diagnosis was based on clinical examination and haematological and <b>haemoglobin</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> profile. Serum levels of ferritin, iron, thyroid hormones FT 3, FT 4 and TSH levels along with bilirubin and transaminases were estimated in all children. Results: Subclinical hypothyroidism was observed in 23 patients (34 %), who were further divided into 2 groups:- compensated hypothyroidism which included 16 patients (24 %) and decompensated hypothyroidism with 7 patients (10 %). 45 patients (66 %) wer...|$|E
