2500|$|The singer also {{performed}} the song at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards {{held at the}} Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles on 28 August 2011. After being introduced by American singer Katy Perry, Adele appeared in a black scalloped lace dress by Barbara Tfank, and standing alone on the stage, only with her pianist behind her. Her hair was pulled back and a signature ponytail draped over one shoulder she sang the song and [...] "did vocal aerobics and dripped her soulful, sultry sound over the dark ballad, while a transfixed audience watched her" [...] as stated by Kelley L. Carter of MTV. After the performance she received a standing ovation from fans and critics. According to USA Todays Cindy Clark she [...] "captivated the audience with her powerful performance". Wesley Case of The Baltimore Sun concluded, [...] "Adele's 'Someone Like You' could make a tough guy weep. <b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> gorgeous." [...] Rating the performance with A, Claire Suddath of Time magazine said [...] "it's heartening to hear a truly talented woman sing a mournful torch song {{for someone who has}} left her for someone better. And if her stellar performance, accompanied by only a piano, isn't enough to melt your heart, then her nervous wave to the audience at the end definitely will." [...] A writer of Los Angeles Times called her vocals [...] "strong and direct, and tackles grief by moving with the melody rather than trying to pummel it" [...] and added that it was [...] "less-is-more performance, a tactic award-show producers rarely indulge in, but Adele needs few adornments to impress." [...] A writer of Rolling Stone said that Adele brought a [...] "big dollop of elegance to the VMAs with a spare, moving rendition of 'Someone Like You'" [...] and added that [...] "amid all the pop art glitz, it [...] was a refreshing palate cleanser." ...|$|E
60|$|She leaned {{a little}} towards him; <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> almost beseeching.|$|E
60|$|Her eyebrows were gently raised. <b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> one {{of genuine}} surprise.|$|E
60|$|The {{glance and}} <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>were</b> quite {{sufficient}} for me. I hastened to disclaim all responsibility for Mr. Bundercombe.|$|R
6000|$|GLORIA (steadfastly). We three. (<b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> unmistakable: she is pitting her {{strength}} against {{her mother for}} the first time. The twins instantly {{go over to the}} enemy.) ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> cold, but the coldness I {{knew was}} forced--else {{had she not}} said [...] "we harass ourselves." [...] Instead of quelling my ardour, it gave it fuel.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> so very earnest that I {{raised my}} eyes in surprise.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> almost beseeching. Draconmeyer, who was {{listening}} with stony face, shivered imperceptibly.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> {{cold and}} unnatural. Her {{paroxysm}} of fear {{seemed to have}} passed.|$|E
50|$|Her themes include mutual {{attraction}} between earth {{women and}} male aliens, children with unearthly powers, Amazons in outer space, and planets ruled by matriarchies. <b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> often light and humorous.|$|R
60|$|The {{forehead}} of the Marquise was wrinkled with surprise. She stood amidst all {{the wonders}} of her magnificent drawing-room like a dainty Dresden doll--petite, cold, dressed to perfection. Her manner and <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>were</b> alike frigid.|$|R
60|$|They {{crossed the}} rustic bridge which led {{on to the}} lawn. Lady Cynthia {{came out of the}} house to meet them. She showed no signs of fatigue, but her eyes and <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>were</b> full of anxiety.|$|R
60|$|Anna had {{suddenly}} stiffened. She regarded {{the young man}} coldly. <b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> icy.|$|E
60|$|She was {{certainly}} quieter and <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> softer. She avoided looking at me.|$|E
60|$|It was Maggie who answered. <b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> lifeless, but her manner almost composed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Her</b> look, <b>her</b> <b>tone,</b> <b>were</b> so {{charged with}} {{insidious}} meanings {{as to make}} him feel that even to understand her would savour of dishonest complicity. [...] "What is it you have to tell me?" [...] he cried with a flushed frown.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Rhymes,' in truth, 'are {{stubborn}} things.' And to Rhyme she clung, and clings, But whatever song {{she sings}} Scarcely sells. If <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>be</b> grave, they say 'Give us something rather gay.' If she's skittish, then they pray 'Something else!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] said Lady Madeleine, agitated. Vivian was silent, {{and some}} moments elapsed before his {{companion}} again spoke. When {{she did her}} {{eyes were fixed on}} the ground, and <b>her</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> low; but <b>her</b> voice was calm and steady.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> final; and, with a last {{glance at}} Beatrice, Harding went out dejectedly.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him coldly. <b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> still free from any sort of emotion.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl was}} for a moment almost good-looking. Her eyes glowed, <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> eloquently appealing.|$|E
6000|$|She stopped again; {{her voice}} was failing her. For a moment, she {{struggled}} to keep her self-possession--struggled as only women can--and succeeded in the effort. She pressed her arm closer round my neck; but <b>her</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> steadier and clearer when she resumed: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, no! That's too bad. I'd rather {{never go}} to a dance at all, than sit still, or be elbowed about in the square dances. You never told me you {{expected}} that!"--and <b>her</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> of a child petulant at injustice.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} defiant--almost threatening--in <b>her</b> <b>tone.</b> Horace <b>was</b> annoyed--and he showed {{it when he}} spoke.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was to}} Razumov {{that she}} gave her death's-head smile. <b>Her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> quite imperious.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him steadily. Her cheeks were a little whiter, but <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> deliberate.|$|E
60|$|Marie leaned forward. Her face gleamed pale in the twilight, <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> almost openly contemptuous.|$|E
50|$|The {{evocation}} of this richly imagined alien world, with its different races, communities, flora, fauna, landscapes, language {{and sense of}} history, qualifies as perhaps Gentle's finest achievement in sheer world-making {{in the manner of}} J.R.R. Tolkien and Ursula K. Le Guin, though <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>is</b> different from either of those writers.|$|R
6000|$|He got up {{from his}} seat and roamed along the cliff, and she {{followed}} him, still imploring. <b>Her</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> soft, and <b>her</b> words were {{the words of a}} suppliant. Would he not relent and save her child from wretchedness, from ruin and from death. [...] "I will keep her with me till I die," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|Whether she {{did or did}} {{not suffer}} in making that confession, it was {{impossible}} to discover. <b>Her</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> quiet; <b>her</b> manner was unobtrusively respectful; the pallor of her face was not disturbed by the slightest change of colour. Was the new maid an insensible person? Iris began to fear already that she might have made a mistake.|$|R
60|$|The Duchess {{maintained}} her self-control. She {{was quite}} pale, however, and <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> growing ominously harder.|$|E
60|$|She {{bit her lip}} {{and turned}} away. When she resumed the conversation, <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> {{completely}} changed.|$|E
60|$|The faint note of mockery in <b>her</b> <b>tone</b> <b>was</b> clearly apparent. Mannering {{found it}} hard to answer her calmly.|$|E
60|$|For {{the life}} of me I could not frame the speech at once, my pity and a new-found and {{surprising}} respect for her making it doubly hard to pronounce her sentence. Suddenly she raised her head, not proudly, but with a dignity seemingly conferred by years of sorrow and of suffering. <b>Her</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> even, bereft of every vestige of hope.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Gallilee {{read the}} telegram--paused--and read it again. She {{let it drop}} on her lap; but her eyes still rested {{mechanically}} on the slip of paper. When she spoke, her voice startled Mr. Null. Usually loud and hard, <b>her</b> <b>tones</b> <b>were</b> strangely subdued. If his back had been turned towards her, he would hardly have known who was speaking to him.|$|R
6000|$|It was so {{exactly the}} {{ordinary}} second-rate American style, that Averil, who had expected something more {{in accordance with}} the refinement of everything about Cora, except a few of <b>her</b> <b>tones,</b> <b>was</b> a little disappointed, and responded with difficulty; then, while Mr. Muller greeted her sisters, she hastily laid her hand on Henry's arm, and said, under her breath, 'I've a letter from him.' ...|$|R
