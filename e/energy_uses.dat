After considering several methods {{to evaluate the}} environmental performance of <b>energy</b> <b>use,</b> including: <b>energy</b> ecological footprint, input-output analysis, emergy-exergy analysis, and multi-criteria decision-making, an environmental performance evaluation model is proposed, which combines the analytical hierarchy process, fuzzy extent analysis, and membership degree analysis. In the model, 18 sub-indicators of environmental performance from <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> planning are classified into four categories: structure of <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> and industry, technology and efficiency of <b>energy</b> <b>use,</b> environmental impacts caused by <b>energy</b> <b>use,</b> and the socio-economic benefits of <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> Membership degree analysis is applied to each indicator. Three <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> scenarios which are, respectively, environment-friendly, technology-led, and economic policy-led are evaluated. The {{results show that the}} technology-led <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> planning is best.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>use</b> is {{a common}} impact {{category}} in life cycle assessment (LCA). Many different <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> indicators are used in LCA studies, accounting for <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> in different ways. Often, however, the choice behind which <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> indicator is applied is poorly described and motivated. To contribute to a more purposeful selection of <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> indicators and to ensure consistent and transparent reporting of <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> in LCA, a general framework for <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> indicator construction and reporting in LCA studies will be presented in this article. The framework differentiates between 1) renewable and nonrenewable energies, 2) primary and secondary energies, and 3) energy intended for energy purposes versus energy intended for material purposes. This framework is described both graphically and mathematically. Furthermore, the framework is illustrated through application {{to a number of}} <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> indicators that are frequently used in LCA studies: cumulative energy demand (CED), nonrenewable cumulative energy demand (NRCED), fossil <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> (FEU), primary fossil <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> (PFEU), and secondary <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> (SEU). To illustrate how the application of different <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> indicators may lead to different results, cradle-to-gate <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> of the bionanomaterial cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) is assessed using 5 different indicators and showing a factor of 3 differences between the highest and lowest results.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>use</b> {{data are}} usually {{disaggregated}} by major end-use sector: residential, commercial, industrial, transportation. Generally speaking, data are weakest for the commercial sector, perhaps because this sector is often {{defined as a}} residual (i. e., {{that portion of the}} economy not included in the other sectors). However, <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> in commercial buildings accounts for about 15 percent of total U.

For example, commercial <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> amounted to almost 10 QBtu (10 EJ) in 1979; the average growth rate in commercial sector <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> was 1 percent per year between 1973 and 1979, compared with a growth rate of 0. 3 percent per year for total U.

25|$|With European {{countries}} such as Germany and Denmark moving to very high levels (80% and 100% respectively by 2050) of renewable energy for all <b>energy</b> <b>uses</b> there will be increasing periods of excess production of renewable electrical energy. Storage of this energy as potential electrical energy (e.g. pumped hydro) is very costly and reduces total round-trip efficiency. However, storing it as heat in district heating systems, for use in buildings where there is demand, is significantly less costly. Whilst {{the quality of the}} electrical energy is degraded, high voltage grid MW sized heat pumps would maximise efficiency whilst not wasting excess renewable electricity. Stockholm at present has about 660 MW of heat pumps connected to its district heating system.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} system boundary is split into a physical boundary which determines which renewable resources are considered (e.g. in buildings footprint, on-site or even off-site, see) respectively how many buildings {{are included in}} the balance (single building, cluster of buildings) and a balance boundary which determines the included <b>energy</b> <b>uses</b> (e.g. heating, cooling, ventilation, hot water, lighting, appliances, IT, central services, electric vehicles, and embodied energy, etc.). It should be noticed that renewable energy supply options can be prioritized (e.g. by transportation or conversion effort, availability over the lifetime of the building or replication potential for future, etc.) and therefore create a hierarchy. It may be argued that resources within the building footprint or on-site should be given priority over off-site supply options.|$|E

Moreover, he added that the problem had arisen in the first place because neither Russia nor Ukraine experience true market prices, producing inefficient <b>energy</b> <b>uses</b> amongst the states. He added that the incident would not influence Russia's acceptance into the WTO. Illarionov noted in this respect that there is no such thing as a market price for gas, because Russia offers different terms for analogous countries, e.g. gas price for Ukraine is not calculated in the same way as for Germany.|$|E

25|$|The People's Republic of China {{is by far}} {{the largest}} {{producer}} of coal in the world, producing over 2.8 billion tons of coal in 2007, or approximately 39.8 percent of all coal produced in the world during that year. For comparison, the second largest producer, the United States, produced more than 1.1 billion tons in 2007. An estimated 5 million people work in China's coal-mining industry. As many as 20,000 miners die in accidents each year. Most Chinese mines are deep underground and do not produce the surface disruption typical of strip mines. Although there is some evidence of reclamation of mined land for use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating significant acreages of abandoned mined land, which is unsuitable for agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife. Chinese underground mines often experience severe surface subsidence (6–12 meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China uses some subsidence areas for aquaculture ponds but has more than they need for that purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned with little or no air pollution control equipment, it contributes greatly to visible smoke and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{correctly}} understand and predict the <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> of a building, simulation tools is often utilized in the industry. These simulation tools can predict the estimated <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> in buildings using inserted parameters; however, studies shows that these estimates often {{differs from the}} actual <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> To adjust these deviations, calibration of the parameters is a well proven technique which corrects the simulated <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> In this report an office building is used to analyze and identify challenges with the calibration of building energy simulation models. The building was modeled in IDA-ICE, and energy simulations where performed. Detailed data of the building have been collected to enable a realistic model. Full year energy simulations of the building was performed and compared to the measured <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> The calibration was performed in three parts: the first calibration was done using building defaults, then a calibration using equipment settings, and finally a calibration using operation settings. An initial simulation was performed to identify the differences in measured and simulated <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> The <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> was compared in four subgroups, light and appliances, pumps and fans, heating, and cooling. The initial simulation showed discrepancy in all predefined groupings. After the calibration {{three of the four}} subgroups achieved a result with acceptable similarity to the measured <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> The difference in total yearly <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> between measured and simulated was reduced from 17 % to 11 %. The report failed to calibrate the cooling <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> Reviewing the measured and simulated <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> with the cooling <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> excluded, yields a difference below 0, 5 % with a full year simulation. Several challenges were identified during the calibration process. Obtaining precise and thorough data on the building used in the calibration is vital, however this can be challenging, as there are usually many parties involved in constructing a building. The influence one system has with other systems also results in challenges when adjusting parameters. A seemingly calibrated model can achieve approximately similar <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> as the measured <b>energy</b> <b>use,</b> but can still give huge discrepancies when comparing the result in a shorter time resolution.
