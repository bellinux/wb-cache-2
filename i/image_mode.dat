2500|$|In December 1997, NASA {{approved}} {{an extended}} mission for Galileo {{known as the}} Galileo Europa Mission, which ran for two years {{following the end of}} the primary mission. The focus of this extended mission was to follow up on the discoveries made at Europa with seven additional flybys to search for new evidence of a possible sub-surface water ocean. Starting in May 1999, Galileo used four flybys (20 to 23) with Callisto to lower its periapse, setting up a chance for it to fly by Io twice in late 1999. During Galileos 21st orbit, it acquired a [...] of the anti-Jovian hemisphere (the [...] "far" [...] side of Io), its highest resolution observations of Io to date. This mosaic complemented the coverage obtained by Voyager 1, whose highest resolution observations covered Io's sub-Jovian hemisphere. Galileos two flybys in late 1999, on October 11 and November 26, provided high-resolution images and spectra of various volcanoes and mountains on Io's anti-Jovian hemisphere. The camera suffered a problem with an <b>image</b> <b>mode</b> used extensively during the first encounter, causing the majority of images taken to be highly degraded (though a software algorithm was developed to partially recover some of these images). NIMS also had problems due to the high-radiation environment near Io, suffering a hardware failure that limited the number of near-infrared wavelengths it sampled. Finally, the imaging coverage was limited by the low-data rate playback (forcing Galileo to transmit data from each encounter days to weeks later on the apoapse leg of each orbit), and by an incident when radiation forced a reset of the spacecraft's computer putting it into safe mode during the November 1999 encounter. Even so, Galileo fortuitously imaged an outburst eruption at Tvashtar Paterae during the November flyby, observing a curtain of lava fountains [...] long and [...] high. An additional encounter was performed on February 22, 2000. With no new errors with Galileo's remote sensing instruments, no safing events, and more time after the flyby before the next satellite encounter, Galileo was able to acquire and send back more data. This included information on the lava flow rate at Prometheus, Amirani, and Tvashtar, very high resolution imaging of Chaac Patera and layered terrain in Bulicame Regio, and mapping of the mountains and topography around Camaxtli Patera, Zal Patera, and Shamshu Patera.|$|E

40|$|Problems {{associated}} with the large file sizes of digital mammograms have impeded the integration of digital mammography with picture archiving and communications systems. Digital mammograms irreversibly compressed by the novel wavelet Access Over Network (AON) compression algorithm were compared with lossless-compressed digital mammograms in a blinded reader study to evaluate the perceived sufficiency of irreversibly compressed images for comparison with next-year mammograms. Fifteen radiologists compared the same 100 digital mammograms in three different comparison modes: lossless-compressed vs 20 : 1 irreversibly compressed <b>images</b> (<b>mode</b> 1), lossless-compressed vs 40 : 1 irreversibly compressed <b>images</b> (<b>mode</b> 2), and 20 : 1 irreversibly compressed images vs 40 : 1 irreversibly compressed <b>images</b> (<b>mode</b> 3). Compression levels were randomly assigned between monitors. For each mode, the less compressed of the two images was correctly identified no more frequently than would occur by chance if all images were identical in compression. Perceived sufficiency for comparison with next-year mammograms was achieved by 97. 37 % of the lossless-compressed images and 97. 37 % of the 20 : 1 irreversibly compressed <b>images</b> in <b>mode</b> 1, 97. 67 % of the lossless-compressed images and 97. 67 % of the 40 : 1 irreversibly compressed <b>images</b> in <b>mode</b> 2, and 99. 33 % of the 20 : 1 irreversibly compressed images and 99. 19 % of the 40 : 1 irreversibly compressed <b>images</b> in <b>mode</b> 3.

Besides, the data flow and data check for transmitting a new image are constructed to combine the transmission reliability with efficiency. The boot sequence copying hardware configuration code and software configuration code is analyzed, and the advanced boot loader is carried out to specify boot address of the application <b>mode</b> <b>image</b> manually. Experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of updating and running a new application <b>mode</b> <b>image,</b> as well as rolling back into the factory <b>mode</b> <b>image</b> when no application <b>mode</b> <b>image</b> is available.
