5|$|The intake {{design for}} Concorde's engines was {{especially}} critical. The intakes had to provide low distortion levels (to prevent engine surge) and high efficiency for all likely ambient temperatures {{to be met}} in cruise. They had to provide adequate subsonic performance for diversion cruise and low engine-face distortion at take-off. They also had to provide an alternate path for excess intake air during engine throttling or shutdowns. The variable intake features required to meet all these requirements consisted of front and rear ramps, a <b>dump</b> <b>door,</b> an auxiliary inlet and a ramp bleed to the exhaust nozzle.|$|E
25|$|Shock waves {{gave rise}} to {{excessive}} boundary layer growth on the front ramp. The boundary layer was removed through the ramp bleed slot and bypassed the subsonic diffuser and engine where it would otherwise have caused excessive duct loss and unacceptable distortion at the engine. Since the ramp bleed slot was in the subsonic diffuser, and downstream of the shock system, changes in flow demanded by the engine would be accommodated with corresponding changes in the bleed slot flow without significantly affecting the external shock pattern. Engine flow reductions caused by throttling or shutting down were dealt with by <b>dump</b> <b>door</b> opening.|$|E

25|$|The <b>dump</b> <b>doors</b> {{were closed}} at cruise to prevent loss in thrust since air leaking from the duct does not {{contribute}} to the pressure recovery in the intake.|$|R
5000|$|Hoppers: {{similar to}} gondolas but with bottom <b>dump</b> <b>doors</b> for easy {{unloading}} {{of things like}} coal, ore, grain, cement, ballast and the like. Short hoppers for carrying iron ore are called ore jennys in the US.|$|R
50|$|A rotary car dumper or wagon tippler (UK) is a {{mechanism}} used for unloading certain railroad cars such as hopper cars, gondolas or lorries (tipplers, UK). It holds the rail {{car to a}} section of track and rotates the track and car together to dump out the contents. Used with gondola cars, it is making open hopper cars obsolete. Because hopper cars require sloped chutes in order to direct the contents to the bottom <b>dump</b> <b>doors</b> (hatches) for unloading, gondola cars allow cars to be shorter, thus lowering their center of gravity, while carrying the same gross rail load.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} [...] "hoppers" [...] or {{compartments}} between the {{fore and aft}} bulkhead of the barge. On {{the bottom of the}} barge hull, there is (are) also a large [...] "hopper door(s)", opening downwards. The doors are closed while the vessel is moving, so she can carry the materials that are to be <b>dumped.</b> The <b>door(s)</b> open when the ship has arrived at the spot where the materials are to be dumped.|$|R
5000|$|Who that is {{old enough}} does not {{remember}} the [...] "campaign" [...] of 1903, the insidious payment by instalments, the sets <b>dumped</b> at your <b>door,</b> bookcase and all, on receipt of a guinea, the scholarships, the competition questions, the reply-paid telegrams pursuing you to the innermost sanctuary of your home ("From my bath I curse you", one man wired back!), the [...] "Going, going, gone" [...] tacticsâ€”"Only five days left {{and one of them}} the shortest!" [...] so irrelevant, but so arresting! Janet E. Courtney, long-time employee of the Britannica, from her book, Recollected in Tranquillity ...|$|R
40|$|Results of {{contamination}} measurements {{performed on the}} initial four flights of the Space Shuttle Orbiter are summarized and compared with requirements contained in the Space Shuttle Flight and Ground System Specifications and those formulated by the Contamination Requirements Definition Group. In general, the results of measurements carried out with the induced environment contamination monitor indicate that molecular fluxes, deposition rates, and average counts of particulates are within the requirements and close to predicted values. Among the exceptions, were such special circumstances as water <b>dumps,</b> payload bay <b>door</b> closures, and RCS engine, APU, and flash evaporator operations which led to molecular and particulate contamination levels exceeding the limits. In cases where these circumstances would interfere with sensitive payload operations, careful mission planning to preclude a contamination source by operational limitation {{should be done to}} avoid losses...|$|R
5000|$|The ship's dragheads are 6 m {{wide and}} can dredge between 55 m and 160 m deep. The ship has three hopper {{discharge}} options of pumping ashore by pipeline, <b>dumping</b> through bottom <b>doors</b> or rainbowing. The ship has equipment to dredge almost any material; such as clay, silt, sand and rock. During the Swissair Flight 111 salvage operation, {{a mixture of}} sea water, silt and aircraft pieces was pumped out of the Atlantic Ocean. The ship assisted in the recovery of nearly 98% of the aircraft, with over 144698 kg of aircraft and cargo pieces salvaged. The pump room onboard has two [...] dredge engines {{that can be used}} in series or in parallel with the vessels two 1200 mm suction pipes or combined with a submerged outboard pump. The vessel also has three [...] jet water pumps that are used to agitate subsea material whilst trailing, collapse and liquify hopper cargo for pumping or degassing natural air pockets in the seabed using the Venturi effect.|$|R
60|$|By {{playing on}} the oaf's conceit, and {{standing}} closely over him, we got a path made round {{the corner of the}} <b>dump</b> to our <b>door,</b> so that we could come and go with decent ease; and he even enjoyed the work, for in that there were boulders to be plucked up bodily, bushes to be uprooted, and other occasions for athletic display: but cutting wood was a different matter. Anybody could cut wood; and, besides, my wife was tired of supervising him, and had other things to attend to. And in short, days went by, and Irvine came daily, and talked and lounged and spat; but the firewood remained intact as sleepers on the platform or growing trees upon the mountain-side. Irvine, as a woodcutter, we could tolerate; but Irvine as a friend of the family, at so much a day, was too bald an imposition, and at length, on the afternoon of the fourth or fifth day of our connection, I explained to him, as clearly as I could, the light in which I had grown to regard his presence. I pointed out to him that I could not continue to give him a salary for spitting on the floor; and this expression, which came after a good many others, at last penetrated his obdurate wits. He rose at once, and said if that was the way {{he was going to be}} spoke to, he reckoned he would quit. And, no one interposing, he departed.|$|R
