5|$|TGS with Tracy Jordan head writer Liz Lemon is <b>due</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> root canal. To avoid feeling lonely on Valentine's Day, she {{schedules}} her {{surgery for}} that day, but soon realizes she will {{need someone to}} escort her home from the dentist's office due to the aftereffects of anesthesia. She asks her colleagues at the 30 Rock building for a ride home, {{but all of them}} have Valentine's Day plans and cannot help. When Liz calls the dentist's office to say she does not have anyone to pick her up, the receptionist (Shinnerrie Jackson) informs her that after her procedure she can only leave alone if she signs a liability waiver. Liz initially intends to sign the document, but is dissuaded at a party by musician Jon Bon Jovi, and instead decides to claim to the receptionist that she has a ride home after all.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1221 Maulay {{was accused}} of treason by Richard Mucegros and Hubert de Burgh before the king. The {{specific}} crime was alleged to be a plot to hand over Eleanor of Brittany, then held at Corfe Castle, to King Louis IX of France. Maulay was imprisoned for a short time, but on 4 June was released after surrendering Corfe to the king. He was allowed to retain his sheriffdom. The accusation may have owed more {{to the fact that}} Maulay had recently taken Mucegros' lands into custody because Mucegros had failed to make a payment <b>due</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> royal fine. The event may also have been used by de Burgh as an opportunity to weaken Maulay's patron and de Burgh's rival for power, Peter des Roches, while des Roches was out of England. The loss of Corfe by one of des Roches' primary supporters would have weakened des Roches' standing and power. In July Peter des Roches returned to England and in late July was instrumental in the clearing of Maulay from the charges of treason. Maulay was not given back custody of Corfe, but on 29 July the royal government discharged the 7000 marks that Maulay still owed for his marriage fine. The stated reason for the release of this debt was to compensate Maulay for his expenses while controlling Corfe, but the real reason appears to have been to compensate for the loss of Corfe. In late 1221 Maulay agreed to go on crusade with Peter des Roches and Falkes de Breauté, another of des Roches supporters. The loss of Damietta in September meant that the three men postponed their departure, and in November 1221 Maulay was replaced as sheriff. In return for Maulay's agreement to the ouster, the Exchequer wrote off more debts that Maulay owed the government, this time over 8800 marks. Maulay retired to his lands in Yorkshire.|$|E
