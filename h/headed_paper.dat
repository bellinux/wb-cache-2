25|$|The {{use of the}} St. Brigid's Cross {{was chosen}} by Edith Cusack the Head of Women's Programming at the newly founded channel in early 1960s. St. Brigid is the female patron saint of Ireland. The first logo lasted until the {{formation}} of Ireland's national radio and television services Raidió Teilifís Éireann in 1966. Part of the redesign was to prevent strobing on screen. The 1966 to 1969 logo was a much simpler form of the cross and was designed by Jim Jones. The letters R, T and E {{were added to the}} logo after the formation of RTÉ as a statutory body. Before this the logo was simply the cross in black on a white background or white on a black background. Don Farrell and Jon Cogan designed the 3rd incarnation of the Brigid's Cross. This logo remain on air until 1986 when RTÉ decided that both channels in a multi-channel landscape need to be identified as clearly RTÉ. The 1986 logo coincided with the 25th anniversary of Irish Television. The Cross on RTÉ One was animated turning into a number 1, while over on RTÉ Two it turned into a number 2. On screen this logo lasted until 1988 when RTÉ Two re-branded as Network 2 moving it further away from the sister channel RTÉ One. 10 years later the logo dropped the Brigid's Cross, {{and for the first time}} placed an accent (Fadá) on the letter E. RTÉ also formal branded Network Two on screen as part of RTÉ until 1997 when the channel was once more re-branded on screen as N2. The three letters are a modern take on Celtic scripting. The Brigid's Cross was seen on many RTÉ One television idents until 2003 and remains on the <b>headed</b> <b>paper</b> of RTÉ, while a variation of the 1966 cross is used by RTÉ's Graphic Design Department. Since 2004 all RTÉ service use the 1996 logo as part of their Identity.|$|E
