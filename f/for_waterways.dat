Coupling this historical information with real-time knowledge about volumetric capacity in catchment areas, such as spare capacity in reservoirs, ground-water levels, and the degree of saturation of area aquifers is also needed in {{order to make}} the most acrate flood forecasts.|$|E

2500|$|The USDA {{shows that}} grassed {{waterways}} {{of less than}} 5% slopes for a chosen waterway will greatly reduce velocity of draining water within the land. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) offers {{the use of an}} online Soil survey to view the area of land to be planted and examine slope and soil drainage. As viewed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, soil drainage is the number one priority for location of certain grasses. [...] Poorer drainage causes less infiltration of water into the soil as groundwater recharge causing ponding and flooding of surrounding crops. [...] Higher drainage becomes more droughty which hinders the establishment of certain grasses good <b>for</b> <b>waterways.</b> [...] Medium soil drainage becomes the most suitable for planting. [...] Determining exact grasses and seed amounts to plant follows specifications of a local NRCS Field Office Technical Guide and the Contour Buffer practice standard while taking practice on land and regional environmental conditions into consideration.|$|E

2500|$|While at T.I. Group in Edgbaston, Birmingham, Dolphin {{was awarded}} a patent for his {{invention}} of improvements {{to the design of}} roadside kerbs. The new design was described as 'particularly suitable for rapid and economical edging of country roads {{in such a way that}} the metal of the roadway is contained, spillage of dirt from the verges onto the roadway is avoided, and a drainage channel for surface water is provided.' He also patented a design for pre-fabricated multi-level roadways and one of his most important inventions, sheet pile revetments <b>for</b> <b>waterways.</b> [...] This invention has had a significant benefit for the reclamation of land in waterfront areas such as Cardiff Bay. The patent describes the solution as 'revetments or retaining walls for the banks of rivers or canals and concerns an arrangement, particularly suitable for rivers and canals which are relatively shallow at the banks, in which the revetment comprises a series of sheet metal plates arranged end-to-end and suitably secured together to form a wall of sheet metal pile sections, driven into the ground vertically by a power hammer and interlocked so that a complete wall of steel piles is provided between the bank and the water. The wall is retained by tie bars linking it to anchor plates set in the bank well inshore This system of piling is undoubtedly desirable, if not essential, for deep waterways or those subject to heavy erosion, such as tidal waters.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} religion, Finland was {{strongly}} Christianized and original native traditions of Finnish paganism have gone extinct. Finnish paganism combined various layers of Finnic, Norse, Germanic and Baltic paganism. Finnic Jumala {{was some sort}} of sky-god and is shared with Estonia. Belief of a thunder-god, Ukko or Perkele, may have Baltic origins. Elements had their own protectors, such as Ahti <b>for</b> <b>waterways</b> and Tapio for forests. Local animistic deities, [...] "haltia", which resemble Scandinavian tomte, were also given offerings to, and bear worship was also known. Finnish neopaganism or [...] "suomenusko" [...] attempts to revive these traditions, which however had a break, and has not attracted a significant number of followers. Christianity was introduced to Finns and Karelians from the east, in the form of Eastern Orthodoxy. However, Swedish kings conquered western parts of Finland in the 13th century, imposing Roman Catholicism. In the following centuries, Finns who professed Catholicism or later Lutheranism were identified as [...] "Swedes" [...] (ruotsit) and Finns who professed Orthodoxy were considered [...] "Russians". Reformation in Sweden had the important effect that bishop Mikael Agricola, a student of Martin Luther, introduced written Finnish, and literacy became common during the 18th century. When Finland became independent, it was overwhelmingly Lutheran Protestant. A small number of Eastern Orthodox Finns were also included, thus the Finnish government recognized both religions as [...] "national religions". Today, 87% of the population of Finland belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and 1% to the Finnish Orthodox Church. Whereas, in Russian Ingria, there were both Lutheran and Orthodox Finns; the former were identified as Ingrian Finns while the latter were considered Izhorans or Karelians.|$|E
