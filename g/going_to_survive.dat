5|$|Mongolian is the {{official}} national language of Mongolia, where it is spoken (but not written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate), and {{the official}} provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of Inner Mongolia, China, where {{there are at least}} 4.1 million ethnic Mongols. Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate) However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012. However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the ethnic identity of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> due to the presence of urban ethnic communities. The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language. Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols. The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.|$|E

When growers {{feel like they have}} control over their own lives within the network of their cooperative, it can be very empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> in poverty.|$|E
25|$|Galen {{notes that}} the {{exanthem}}a covered the victim's entire body and was usually black. The exanthem became rough and scabby {{where there was no}} ulceration. He states that those that were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> developed a black exanthem. According to Galen, it was black because of a remnant of blood putrefied in a fever blister that was pustular. His writings state that raised blisters were present in the Antonine plague, usually {{in the form of a}} blistery rash. Galen states that the skin rash was close to the one Thucydides described. Galen describes symptoms of the alimentary tract via a patient's diarrhea and stools. If the stool was very black, the patient died. He says that the amount of black stools varied. It depended on the severity of the intestinal lesions. He observes that in cases where the stool was not black, the black exanthema appeared. Galen describes the symptoms of fever, vomiting, fetid breath, catarrh, cough, and ulceration of the larynx and trachea.|$|E

50|$|Miinnehoma was {{a popular}} runner among locals, being owned by Liverpool comedian Freddie Starr, and was sent off at 16/1 after {{finishing}} seventh behind The Fellow in the Gold Cup. The winner of the 1992 Sun Alliance Chase at Cheltenham had lost his regular partner Peter Scudamore to retirement and had had four different riders since. Only Richard Dunwoody had won {{and he took the}} ride at Aintree as his tenth National ride, having won the race previously in 1986. The pair were prominent throughout, moving into third place at the 14th fence and then <b>going</b> up <b>to</b> dispute the lead {{at the start of the}} second circuit. Miinnehoma survived a bad mistake at Becher's second time but remained at the head of the race from there until being headed by Moorcroft Boy <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the last fence. He regained the lead when the favourite broke a blood vessel, <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> the late challenge of Just So to win by one-and-a-quarter lengths. He failed to complete the course in his defence of the title in 1995.|$|R
50|$|Several tracks {{featured}} {{the voice of}} former frontman Dave Halliday, with Andy Sneap <b>going</b> <b>to</b> great lengths to lift his voice from old cassette recordings {{so that he could}} be incorporated and his memory suitably honoured. Sneap {{and the rest of the}} bandmembers also went to similar lengths (along with substantial legal and probate costs) to ensure that the album performance and compositional royalties were split six ways instead of five, with Halliday's share <b>going</b> <b>to</b> his <b>surviving</b> family - this process continues to this day, with Halliday's royalties continuing to be paid for live performance and radio airplay of songs to which he contributed writing credits. The album also ended up with a running time of 66 minutes and 6 seconds, and a file download size of 666MB. This was completely accidental and unintentional. The album also runs non-stop, with track gaps between the songs being filled by a series of musical interludes, introductions and soundscapes.|$|R
25|$|The Albany Park District {{fell behind}} on its bills by 1932 {{and it became}} clear that the district, as an {{independent}} entity, was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> the lean years of the Great Depression. In 1934 there were 22 separate park districts operating in the city of Chicago. That year, motivated by the fiscal disaster the Depression had brought to many small independent agencies, voters approved the Park Consolidation Act of 1934 and unified all 22 disparate park districts, including the Albany Park District, into the Chicago Park District. The newly formed conglomerate qualified for $82 million in federal funding through the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Public Works Administration (PWA) between 1935 and 1941. These funds allowed extensive improvements throughout the Chicago park system and Eugene Field Park saw many changes in the 1930s and early 1940s. The athletic fields were improved, paths and sidewalks laid, and through a 1941-42 WPA project the river banks were graded, and retaining wall, rip rap, and chain link fence were installed along the river bank. It was during this time that the 60 foot tall light tower was erected near the tennis courts.|$|E

50|$|In {{the midst}} of these tragic events, the city's artists, local {{government}} and civic groups decided to hold a festival of smiles, because the city {{at that time was}} also known as the City of Smiles. They reasoned that a festival was also a good opportunity to pull the residents out of the pervasive gloomy atmosphere brought by the Don Juan Tragedy. The initial festival was therefore, a declaration by the people of the city that no matter how tough and bad the times were, Bacolod City is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pull through, <b>survive,</b> and in the end, triumph.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, DFCU Financial {{merged with}} CapCom Credit Union. CapCom {{was founded in}} the 1930s as the Municipal Employees Credit Union by firemen in Lansing to serve {{municipal}} employees. The Municipal Employees Credit Union grew through mergers over the years, most recently merging with Citizens Choice, Spartan Stores, Allied Builders & Contractors and Capital Community Credit Union/LSI Financial. The merger was approved by NCUA in November 2008. The merger required approval from DFCU Financial members, since the CapCom state charter was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the <b>surviving</b> charter. The vote {{was approved by the}} DFCU Financial membership, and on March 1, 2009, the merger was finalized.|$|R

500|$|Ecosocialists {{advocate}} for the revolutionary succession of capitalism by ecosocialism—an egalitarian economic/political/social structure designed to harmonize human society with non-human ecology and to fulfill human needs—as the only sufficient solution to the present-day ecological crisis, and hence the only path towards sustainability. Sustainability is viewed not as a domain exclusive to scientists, environmental activists, and business leaders but as a holistic project that must involve the whole of humanity redefining its place in Nature: [...] "What every environmentalist needs to know ... is that capitalism is not the solution but the problem, and that if humanity is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> this crisis, it will do so because it has exercised its capacity for human freedom, through social struggle, {{in order to create}} a whole new world—in coevolution with the planet." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{addresses}} {{the death of}} Dale Horvath, who is attacked and ripped open by a walker. Since writer Robert Kirkman felt that Dale epitomized a character of morality and humanity, much of [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] explores themes related to the declining morality of individuals during a catastrophic event. Kirkman proclaimed that Dale's death was a momentous occasion, ultimately marking {{a turning point for}} future development of The Walking Dead. [...] "Dale's character has been {{the heart and soul of}} the show," [...] he iterated. [...] "He's definitely the moral compass. He’s the guy that, more so than anyone, has been warning people to be careful how you let this world change you and monitoring what lengths people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive.</b> His loss is going to mean a great deal for all the characters in the show and is definitely going to represent a turn to a darker space. His death means a lot." [...] Kirkman added that it was difficult to release DeMunn from the cast. He stated: [...] "It’s heartbreaking to lose Jeffrey DeMunn. He's really given us a lot, these last two seasons on the show. It's been amazing to work with him and get to know him and he’s an awesome dude and we’re definitely going to miss him." ...|$|E
500|$|Actor Mickey Rourke asked Bowie to be {{involved}} in one of the songs, the two having met in London where Rourke was based while filming the movie A Prayer for the Dying. Bowie had him perform the mid-song rap to the song [...] "Shining Star (Makin' My Love)." [...] Bowie jokingly referred to Rourke's performance as [...] "method rapping". Bowie described the song as one that [...] "reflects back-to-street situations, and how people are trying to get together in the face of so many disasters and catastrophes, socially around them, never knowing if they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive</b> it themselves. The one thing they have got to cling on to is each other; although it might resolve into something terrible, it's the only thing that they've got. It’s just a little love song coming out of that environment." [...] He rejected the notion that his [...] "high, little" [...] voice (which he attributed to Smokey Robinson) in the song was a new character (to follow behind Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke), instead saying it was just what the song needed, as he had tried the song in his regular voice and did not like the outcome: [...] "That never bothered me, changing voices to suit a song. You can fool about with it." [...] "Shining Star" [...] was one of Bowie's early choices to be a single for the album, but EMI had the final say and did not release the song as a single.

2500|$|It {{was said}} that those {{ancestors}} were on the Long Walk with their daughter, who was pregnant and about to give birth [...] the daughter got tired and weak and couldn't {{keep up with the}} others or go further because of her condition. So my ancestors asked the Army to hold up for a while and to let the woman give birth, but the soldiers wouldn't do it. They forced my people to move on, saying that they were getting behind the others. The soldier told the parents that they had to leave their daughters behind. [...] "Your daughter is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive,</b> anyway; sooner or later she is going to die," [...] they said in their own language.

6000|$|Through {{just such}} a period of {{reconstruction}} Europe in general and Britain in particular are now in all likelihood beginning to pass. And they will come out {{at the other end}} translated and transfigured. Laws and faiths and morals will all of them have altered. There will be a new heaven and a new earth for {{the men and women of}} the new epoch. Strange that people should make such a fuss about a detail like Home Rule, when the foundations of society are all becoming fluid.

But at the very moment when he said it, in my humble opinion, the Constitution was already well into the melting-pot, and even beginning to simmer merrily. Federalism, or something extremely like it, may with great probability be the final outcome of that particular melting; though anything else is perhaps just as probable, and in any case the melting is general, not special. The one thing we can guess with tolerable certainty is that the melting-pot stage has begun to overtake us, socially, ethically, politically, ecclesiastically; and that what will emerge from the pot at the end of it must depend at last upon the relative strength of those unknown quantities--the various formative elements.|$|E

500|$|Deep Blue Sea had {{a budget}} of $82 million and {{represented}} a test for Harlin, who had not made a commercially successful film since Cliffhanger in 1993. Harlin's main goal was to bring the horror genre back to the serious and high-budget production values of films like The Exorcist, Jaws, The Shining, {{as opposed to the}} tongue-in-cheek style of subsequent films in the genre. Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien was an influence on the casting process, as Harlin wanted to cast the characters in a way as to make it impossible for the audience to know who was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die or <b>survive.</b> <b>To</b> achieve this, he combined relatively unknown actors who could deliver solid performances and meet the physical demands of the diving and stunts with a star, Academy Award nominee Samuel L.
