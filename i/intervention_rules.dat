40|$|We {{study the}} power control problem in {{wireless}} ad hoc networks with selfish users. Without incentive schemes, selfish users tend to transmit at their maximum power levels, causing significant interference to each other. In this paper, we study {{a class of}} incentive schemes based on intervention to induce selfish users to transmit at desired power levels. An intervention scheme can be implemented by introducing an intervention device that can monitor the power levels of users and then transmit power to cause interference to users. We mainly consider first-order <b>intervention</b> <b>rules</b> based on individual transmit powers. We derive conditions on design parameters and the intervention capability to achieve a desired outcome as a (unique) Nash equilibrium and propose a dynamic adjustment process that the designer can use to guide users and the intervention device to the desired outcome. The effect of using <b>intervention</b> <b>rules</b> based on aggregate receive power is also analyzed. Our results show that with perfect monitoring intervention schemes can be designed to achieve any positive power profile while using interference from the intervention device only as a threat. We also analyze the case of imperfect monitoring and show that a performance loss can occur. Lastly, simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance improvement from using <b>intervention</b> <b>rules</b> and compare the performances of different <b>intervention</b> <b>rules.</b> Comment: 33 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{exchange rate}} dynamics in a managed floating exchange rate regime, under two alternative specifications of private expectations: adaptive expectations and long-run perfect foresight. The whole analysis follows the asset market approach to exchange rate determination. A built-in government reaction function {{is incorporated in}} a neoclassical general equilibrium portfolio balance model. The <b>intervention</b> <b>rule</b> employed, reflects both the "reference rate proposal" of Ethier and Bloomfield (1975) and the 3 rd guideline of the IMF {{for the management of}} floating exchange rates. The government intervenes in the foreign exchange market in order to minimize the discrepancies of the spot exchange rate from the government reference rate (estimate of the long-run exchange rate), at every moment in time. It is shown that the degree of success at which government intervention moderates short-run exchange rate variability depends on the degree of precision with which the government forms its estimate of the long-run exchange rate path. Any prediction errors lead to dynamic instability. A generalisation of the <b>intervention</b> <b>rule</b> leads to a stable long-run equilibrium even if the government uses the wrong estimate of the long-run exchange rate path (competitive exchange rate policies). However, the sustenance of these equilibria creates crises in the balance of payments and the system ultimately returns to the free floating long-run position. Persuance of competitive exchange rate policies increases the degree of reserve use and could lead to intervention at cross purposes, increasing the need for international liquidity. A re-interpretation of our <b>intervention</b> <b>rule</b> to reflect speculative behaviour leads to similar results as government intervention. The liquidation of speculative profits, however, creates additional short-run exchange rate variability, enhancing the non-profit making nature of government intervention...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} a banking system subject to repeated macroeconomic shocks {{and show that}} without deposit rate control, the banking system collapses with certainty. Any initial level of reserves will delay the collapse but not avoid it. Even without a banking collapse, the economy still converges to a consumption trap with positive probability. Savings are maximal in the consumption trap, but are used entirely to pay back obligations of banks. No long-term investments can be financed and GDP is minimal. We discuss stronger <b>intervention</b> <b>rules</b> that avoid both a collapse and the consumption trap, confirming that capital requirements are an early indicator signaling when intervention may become necessary.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} optimal exchange-rate {{policy in}} two-country sticky-price general equilibrium models in which households and firms optimize over an infinite horizon {{in an environment}} of uncertainty. The models are in the vein of the "new open-economy macroeconomics" as exemplified by Obstfeld and Rogoff (1995, 1998, 2000). The conditions under which fixed or floating exchange rates yield higher welfare, or the optimal foreign exchange <b>intervention</b> <b>rule,</b> depend on the exact nature of price stickiness and on the degree of risk-sharing opportunities.

40|$|Abstract. The {{overwhelming}} {{flood of}} data {{in intensive care}} medicine precludes consistent judgement of medical interventions by humans. Therefore, computerized decision support is needed to assist the health care professional in making reproducible, high-quality decisions at the bedside. Traditional expert systems rely on a tedious, labor-intensive and time-consuming approach in their development which falls short of exploiting existing numerical and qualitative data in large medical databases. Therefore, we applied a new concept of combining time series analysis and a knowledge base system with learning and revision capabilities (MOBAL) for rapid development of decision support algorithms for hemodynamic management of the critically ill. This approach could be successfully implemented in an existing intensive care database handling time-oriented data to validate and refine the <b>intervention</b> <b>rules.</b> The generation of hypotheses for identified contradictions lead to conclusive medical explanations that helped to further refine the knowledge base. This approach will provide for a more efficient and timely development of decision support algorithms. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a stochastic equilibrium model {{of an open}} economy incorporating speculation in the forward exchange market. The model is used to examine two issues.

Much risk averse speculation stabilizes domestic income against disturbances in the domestic bond market and forward exchange marketbut exacerbates the effect of foreign disturbances.

30|$|It {{is widely}} agreed that {{randomized}} controlled trials – social experiments – are {{the gold standard}} for evaluating social programs. There are, however, many important issues that cannot be tested using social experiments, and often things go wrong when conducting social experiments. This paper explores these issues and offers suggestions on ways to deal with commonly encountered problems. Social experiments are preferred because random assignment assures that any differences between the treatment and control groups are due to the intervention and not some other factor; also, the results of social experiments are more easily explained and accepted by policy officials. Experimental evaluations often lack external validity and cannot control for entry effects, scale and general equilibrium effects, and aspects of the intervention that were not randomly assigned. Experiments can also lead to biased impact estimates if the control group changes its behavior or if changing the number selected changes the impact. Other problems with conducting social experiments include increased time and cost, and legal and ethical issues related to excluding people from the treatment. Things that sometimes go wrong in social experiments include programs cheating on random assignment, and participants and/or staff not understanding the <b>intervention</b> <b>rules.</b> The random assignment evaluation of the Job Training Partnership Act in the United States is used as a case study to illustrate the issues.|$|E
40|$|The recent {{theory of}} {{exchange}} rate dynamics within a target zone holds that exchange rates under a currency band are less responsive to fundamental shocks than exchange rates under a free float, {{provided that the}} <b>intervention</b> <b>rules</b> of the Central Bank(s) are common knowledge. These results are derived after having assumed a priori that excess volatility due to rational bubbles does not occur in the foreign exchange market. In this paper we consider instead a set-up in which the existence of speculative behaviour is a datum with which the central bank has to deal. We show that the defence of the target zone {{in the presence of}} bubbles is viable if the Central Bank accommodates speculative attacks when the latter are consistent with the survival of the target zone itself and expectations are self-fulfilling. We show that the instantaneous volatility of exchange rates within a bank is not necessarily less than the volatility under free float. There need not be a constant tradeoff between the volatility of the change in the exchange rate and the volatility of the change in the interest rate differential. Fundamental-dependent bubbles can account for the excess response of the exchange rate to the fundamental. The relationship between the exchange rate and the interest differential need not be negative, even if the target zone is fully credible. Bubbles; Exchange Rates; Target Zones...|$|E
