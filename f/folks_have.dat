25|$|Just under {{half the}} world's {{population}} {{is currently on}} the Internet. Roughly 75% {{of those people are}} on social media and ¾ of those <b>folks</b> <b>have</b> social media accounts on their mobile phones. Mobile phone usage is beneficial for social media marketing because mobile phones have social networking capabilities, allowing individuals immediate web browsing and access to social networking sites. Mobile phones have grown at a rapid rate, fundamentally altering the path-to-purchase process by allowing consumers to easily obtain pricing and product information in real time and allowing companies to constantly remind and update their followers. Many companies are now putting QR (Quick Response) codes along with products for individuals to access the company website or online services with their smart phones. Retailers use QR codes to facilitate consumer interaction with brands by linking the code to brand websites, promotions, product information, or any other mobile-enabled content. In addition, Real-time bidding use in the mobile advertising industry is high and rising because of its value for on-the-go web browsing. In 2012, Nexage, a provider of real time bidding in mobile advertising, reported a 37% increase in revenue each month. Adfonic, another mobile advertisement publishing platform, reported an increase of 22 billion ad requests that same year.|$|E
500|$|Early in the {{production}} of the play, John Carmichael, president of the Church of Scientology in New York, found out that a theatrical production involving Scientology was in the works. After showing up unannounced to a rehearsal, Carmichael {{sent a letter to the}} play's New York producer, Aaron Lemon-Strauss, citing his concerns at the possibility of being ridiculed. In the letter, Carmichael also pointed out the church's many past lawsuits. Alex Timbers was quoted as saying: [...] "We've been told that the letter is a precursor to a lawsuit." [...] Carmichael visited the artistic staff a total of three times to voice his concerns before the play's debut. [...] After this occurrence, Jarrow and Timbers' attorneys advised them to insert the word [...] "Unauthorized" [...] into the title of the play. This was done to avoid potential litigation from the Church of Scientology. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Carmichael later stated: [...] "These <b>folks</b> <b>have</b> a right to write whatever play they want... but they've sunk to clichés." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost as no known {{surviving}} {{copies of the}} film exist. A synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Glade and Sears are next door neighbors and old friends. Glade has a daughter, while Sears has a son. The young people have never met, being away at school while the old <b>folks</b> <b>have</b> been cementing their friendship. As the two men own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people to do is to get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if the old folks hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together. The new plan works like a charm, and Gladys and Charlie, realizing their parents' shortcomings, decide to elope. They do so, much to the satisfaction of Glade and Sears." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nonbinary individuals, {{or those}} who {{identify}} outside of the male/female gender binary and use labels such as genderqueer, agender, bigender, and genderfluid, perform gender in a unique way. In their rejection of a strictly gendered societal and linguistic binary system, nonbinary <b>folks</b> <b>have</b> {{the freedom to choose}} or adopt a wider variety of linguistic styles, speech patterns, and vocabulary. The very nature of nonbinary identities in modern binary society forces individuals and communities to create vocabulary and redesign language to fit their understanding of gender, especially in English and Romance languages. Neopronouns, pronouns which avoid indexing gender and/or index a nonbinary gender identity, originated in the late 1800s as [...] "thon" [...] and [...] "e" [...] to refer to people without defining gender. Newer pronouns include [...] "ee," [...] "em," [...] "xe," [...] and [...] "ve." [...] Communities, especially online ones, create words to fill non-gendered spaces in the lexicon: [...] "nibling" [...] as a gender-neutral term for niece or nephew, or [...] "datefriend" [...] to replace [...] "boyfriend" [...] and [...] "girlfriend." ...|$|E

2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking, a {{daughter}} of Oglala Lakota Chief American Horse, {{was among the first}} wave of children brought from Rosebud and one of Captain Pratt's model students. Maggie had difficulty adjusting to the demands of her new lifestyle at Carlisle, and once slapped Miss Hyde, the matron, when Hyde insisted that Maggie make her bed every day and keep her room clean. Instead of retaliating, Miss Hyde stood her ground and Maggie acquiesced. Like most of the Carlisle students, Maggie was enrolled in the Summer Outing Program. After her arrival to her country home, Maggie wrote a letter to Pratt. [...] "Dear Captain Pratt: What shall I do? I have been here two weeks and I have not bathed.

2500|$|In the United States, My Love Is Your Love was {{released}} on November 17, 1998 when major records were released simultaneously for the holidays by high-profile musicians like Garth Brooks, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Jewel, Method Man, The Offspring and Seal besides her. Time magazine wrote, [...] "Music-industry <b>folks</b> <b>have</b> dubbed it Super Tuesday because more than ten major pop acts issued new CDs on the single day, making it the heaviest release date ever." [...] The week of December 5, 1998 the album entered the US Billboard 200 chart at number thirteen, which was the peak position of the album, and her lowest chart position {{at that point in}} time, with sales of 123,000 copies in its first week. That result was disappointing because the release was Houston's first non-soundtrack album in eight years and was highly anticipated. But eventually, the album became a commercial success, thanks to a series of hit singles, her energetic promotions and a successful world tour. My Love Is Your Love was present on the Billboard 200 chart for over a year, at 75 weeks, and on Billboard Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart for 79 weeks, peaking at number seven. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album 4× platinum on November 1, 1999, for shipments of four million copies. According to the Nielson SoundScan, the album has sold 2,753,000 copies.|$|E

2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus {{that a lot of}} these <b>folks</b> <b>have</b> appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also wanted to make sure that as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television with my parents, and we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E
