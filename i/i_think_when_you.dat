5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> name a record, {{you have}} to choose {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. You also want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
500|$|The win {{marked the}} second time in {{franchise}} history that the Bears won their first two games after trailing in the fourth quarter, the first being in 1971. During halftime, the team honored the 1963 Bears, two days following the death of running back Rick Casares, who was the team's leading rusher until Walter Payton surpassed him. When asked about Casares, defensive end Ed O'Bradovich stated, [...] "Oh my God, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> talk to my fellow teammates over here, what was all right, true and good about professional football was embodied in Rick Casares. Nobody loved the game more than him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also well {{received}} by former King Crimson member Greg Lake, the original lead vocalist and bassist on [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man." [...] When {{asked for his}} own stance on sampling during an interview with O2 Academy, Lake gave a positive response. He stated, [...] "What I was pleased with was, is the relevance of '21st Century Schizoid Man' today.' You know, it still sounds current. It still sounds relevant. That’s really gratifying after all of these years. I mean, that record is what — 40, 50 years old? I don’t know, but very old. Old like me! But it’s lovely to hear a really contemporary artist doing it." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lake further commented, [...] "In a way, that song still sounds modern to me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> hear Kanye West do it, or include {{it in his own}} song, it's relevant. He's speaking about that crazy world that we live in. It's as true now as it was then. It's an honor when something like that happens." [...] Due in part to West's usage, [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] has since became a favorite of Lake, who became known for opening each of his one-man shows by performing the song during his 2012 Songs of a Lifetime theatre tour. Lake went into detail regarding a typical performance of [...] "21st Century Schizoid Man" [...] at his concerts: ...|$|E

2500|$|Loss is a {{theme that}} I think a lot about, and it's {{something}} in my work that I dwell on. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> experience any kind of loss, especially the kind I did, {{you have questions about}} survival: Why do some people thrive in situations that others can’t tolerate? Would I be able to survive and get on in the world on my own? ...|$|E
2500|$|Obama also said, [...] "It's {{not that}} I want to punish your success. I {{just want to}} make sure that {{everybody}} who is behind you, that they've got a chance at success, too... My attitude is that if the economy's good for folks from the bottom up, it's gonna be good for everybody. If you've got a plumbing business, you're gonna be better off [...] if you've got a whole bunch of customers who can afford to hire you, and right now everybody's so pinched that business is bad for everybody and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|Director Joel Coen {{described}} {{the process of}} film making: [...] "I can almost set my watch by how I'm going to feel {{at different stages of}} the process. It's always identical, whether the movie ends up working or not. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> watch the dailies, the film that you shoot every day, you're very excited by it and very optimistic about how it's going to work. And when you see it the first time you put the film together, the roughest cut, is when you want to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and just go away. And then it gradually, maybe, works its way back, somewhere toward that spot you were at before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Ingleby contritely, with a {{trace of}} confusion. [...] "Certainly not. I would never have offered, only we are such old friends; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> brought that hat home after buying it you {{let me put it}} on for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait {{till you}} see him in uniform, Mabel," [...] Mr. Penfold went on. [...] "I am afraid that respect {{is one of the}} moral qualities in which you are deficient. Still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> see Ralph in his uniform, you will be struck with awe." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{encounter}} {{a person like}} this individual he was asked about, you must {{make a distinction between}} the fact of a person being gay from the fact of being a lobby, because lobbies, all are not good. That is bad. If a person is gay and seeks the Lord and has good will, well who am I to judge them? ...|$|R
2500|$|Some celebrities opposed Davis' {{decision}} {{to continue on}} the party while a police investigation was being conducted in Houston's hotel room and her body {{was still in the}} building. Chaka Khan, in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan on February 13, 2012, shared that she felt the party should have been canceled, saying: [...] "I thought that was complete insanity. And knowing Whitney I don't believe that she would have said 'the show must go on.' She's the kind of woman that would've said 'Stop everything! Un-unh. I'm not going to be there.' [...] I don't know what could motivate a person to have a party in a building where the person whose life he had influenced so enormously and whose life had been affected by hers. They were like... I don't understand how that party went on." [...] Sharon Osbourne condemned the Davis party, declaring: [...] "I think it was disgraceful that the party went on. I don't {{want to be in a}} hotel room when there's someone you admire who's tragically lost their life four floors up. I'm not interested in being in that environment and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> grieve someone, you do it privately, you do it with people who understand you. I thought it was so wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 {{the book}} was {{displayed}} in [...] "Joan Miró, Illustrated Books" [...] at the Vero Beach Museum of Art. One critic said it is [...] "an especially powerful set, {{not only for the}} rich imagery but also for the story behind the book's creation. The lithographs are long, narrow verticals, and while they feature Miró's familiar shapes, there's an unusual emphasis on texture." [...] The critic continued, [...] "I was instantly attracted to these four prints, to an emotional lushness, that's in contrast with the cool surfaces of so much of Miró's work. Their poignancy is even greater, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> read how they came to be. The artist met and became friends with Desnos, perhaps the most beloved and influential surrealist writer, in 1925, and before long, they made plans to collaborate on a livre d'artiste. Those plans were put on hold because of the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Desnos' bold criticism of the latter led to his imprisonment in Auschwitz, and he died at age 45 shortly after his release in 1945. Nearly three decades later, at the suggestion of Desnos' widow, Miró set out to illustrate the poet's manuscript. It was his first work in prose, which was written in Morocco in 1922 but remained unpublished until this posthumous collaboration." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You do see {{yourself}} a bit ghostish——" [...] said he, [...] "on {{a background of}} your ancestors. <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> stop in an old place like this you sort of keep company with your ancestors too much; I sometimes feel like {{a bit of the}} old building walking about; the old feelings of the old folks stick to you like the lichens on the walls; you sort of get hoary." ...|$|R

"Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> {{accuse me}} of self-indulgence you are against me,--me, who for myself have desired nothing but {{to be allowed to}} do my duty, and to have bread enough to keep me alive, and clothes enough to make me decent." ...|$|R

"Perhaps he has, mother; yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> so. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> see a chap so very earnest for a {{thing you}} can't help being earnest yourself; besides, you know, mother," [...] {{he went on}} a little shyly, for George had not been {{accustomed}} to talk much of these matters with his mother--"you see when one's down {{in the world and}} hard up, and not quite sure about the next meal, and without any friend, one seems to think more of these things than one does when one is jolly at school with other fellows." ...|$|R

[...] Naya replied, patting {{my hand in}} her genial way, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> before long. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> are gone, Macumazahn, {{remember}} me kindly sometimes, as I have really tried to make you as comfortable as I could with a watcher staring through every straw in the hut." ...|$|R

"She {{does not}} mean to lay it aside, Sir Mungo," [...] said Heriot, {{speaking}} loud, [...] "until she has had satisfaction from you, for betraying her disguise to me, like a false knight--and in very deed, Sir Mungo, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{told me she was}} rambling about in so strange a dress, you might have said also that she was under Lady Mansel's protection." ...|$|E

"I had {{intended}} to be here by that day," [...] replied Cameron, [...] "but one of my men cut his foot badly with an axe, and I could not leave him; then my dogs broke down on the journey, and that detained me still longer.

It {{is the sort of}} thing one reads more of in French memoirs than meets with in actual life, but I can assure you that Reginald would be absolutely miserable without her, and she--well, see what she has become through his influence and companionship. Yet they tell me that that old man has come back to his ridiculous cottage, and sits there in the front garden, reading the Bible and blasting the very gooseberry bushes with his curses against Reginald.

6000|$|... 'I don't think there's {{the least}} chance of Arthur {{returning}} to-night,' said Sheila solemnly.

6000|$|... "I {{was never}} less {{inclined}} to laugh in my life--never, I can assure you. And now I am more certain than ever that your objection to Miss Robarts arises from your not knowing her.

6000|$|... "And {{that was}} one of the days, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> proved the alibi in Belgium before the Devonshire magistrates at Tavistock yesterday," [...] the clerk went on, with a searching glance. Cyril started this time. He saw in a second the new danger thus sprung upon him. If the cashier chose to press the matter home to the hilt, he must {{necessarily}} arrive at one or other of two results. Either the alibi would break down altogether, or it would be perfectly clear that Guy had committed a forgery.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} {{worked so hard}} to educate {{yourself}} from nothing, Mr. Brant. You couldn't read, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first came to us. No? Could you really? I know it has been very difficult for Susy to get on with her studies in proportion. We had so much to first eradicate in the way of manners, style, and habits of thought which the poor child had picked up from her companions, and for which SHE was not responsible. Of course, with a boy that does not signify," [...] she added, with feline gentleness.|$|E

"May I nivir {{see that}} day, an' he an' I alive, amen," [...] said Brady, {{as he crossed}} himself in sign of the sacred truth of his wish; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Masthur Thady, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come to {{consider}} of it, you'll find plenty of manes of keepin' Mr. Keegan and Mrs. Keegan out of the parlour of Ballycloran.

5000|$|Rachel Platten {{said of her}} inspiration: [...] "'Fight Song' was {{inspired}} by a lot of experiences that were hurting me and that were making me feel like maybe I didn’t have a chance in this industry. I wrote it because I needed to remind myself that I believed in myself. No matter what, I still was gonna make music, even if it was on a small scale. Even if it was just for me." [...] She also said: [...] "I really challenged myself in writing {{the past couple of years}} to be vulnerable in my lyrics. I didn’t want to skate past what was hurting. It didn’t scare me to be vulnerable because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>when</b> <b>you</b> get something great." ...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking {{about her}} {{definition}} of an instrument {{in the context of}} The Lady's Glove, she said: [...] I've been trying to figure out at which point a controller becomes an instrument. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> use or design a controller, and if you're just using it to push buttons of trigger things, it does not really affect the way you think of the music or how you write the software. You have your ideas and you're using a controller as an interface. Then I would not call it an instrument. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it becomes an instrument when the software starts reflecting and adapting the limitations and possibilities of the controller, and your musical thinking and ideas become more a symbiosis between the controller, the software, and the hardware.|$|R
