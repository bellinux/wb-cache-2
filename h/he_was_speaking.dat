5|$|McKay {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Kimball could still serve as an apostle even if he underwent a complete laryngectomy and advised him {{to go forward with}} the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords and half of the other, leaving him barely able to speak above a hoarse whisper. After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E
5|$|Nairana had {{her final}} {{overhaul}} at Cockatoo Island between February and April 1944. By mid-1947, airlines had captured {{a significant portion}} of the passenger trade across Bass Strait, and Nairanas schedule was reduced. On 31 December, her captain collapsed and died as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> to two of his officers while the ship was alongside in Burnie; a post-mortem examination attributed the death to heart disease. Nairana made her last crossing from Tasmania to the mainland on 13–14 February 1948, after which she was retired and laid up in Melbourne. Sold for scrap to William Mussell Pty Ltd, Williamstown, Nairana broke her moorings during a gale on 18 February 1951 and was driven ashore off Port Melbourne. Unrecoverable, she was broken up in place in 1953–54.|$|E

He has been missing ever since. Tobares had moved from Argentina to Mexico in 2009 to pursue a career as a chef specialized in Mexican cuisine. He worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki, a hotel and restaurant in Jalisco. According to investigators, these two businesses were owned by Gerardo González Valencia, a suspected drug lord of Los Cuinis, a branch of the Jalisco-based criminal group Jalisco New Generation Cartel.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Giddens {{delivered}} the BBC Reith Lectures {{on the subject}} of ‘Runaway World’, subsequently published as a book of that title. The aim was to introduce the concept and implications of globalisation to a lay audience. He was the first Reith Lecturer to deliver the lectures in different places around the world; and the first to respond directly to e-mails that came in while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking.</b> The lectures were delivered in London, Washington, New Delhi and Hong Kong and responded to by local audiences. Giddens received the Asturias Prize for the social sciences in 2002. The award has been labelled ‘the Spanish Nobel Prize’, but stretches well beyond the sphere of science. Other recipients of the Prize that year included Woody Allen, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web and conductor Daniel Barenboim.|$|E

25|$|On June 23, 1967, Johnson {{traveled}} to Los Angeles for a Democratic fundraiser. Thousands of anti-war protesters tried to march past {{the hotel where}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking.</b> The march was led {{by a coalition of}} peace protestors. However, a small group of Progressive Labor Party and SDS protestors activists placed themselves {{at the head of the}} march and, when they reached the hotel, staged a sit-down. Efforts by march monitors to keep the main body of the marchers moving were only partially successful. Hundreds of LAPD officers were massed at the hotel and when the march slowed an order was given to disperse the crowd. The Riot Act was read and 51 protestors arrested. This was one of the first massive war protests in the United States and the first in Los Angeles. Ending in a clash with riot police, it set a pattern for the massive protests which followed. Due to the size and violence of this event, Johnson attempted no further public speeches in venues outside military bases.|$|E
25|$|Ivo Josipović gave a short speech {{after the}} exit polls were {{announced}} saying he was confident the official results would match the results they predicted. After the official results were published, he gave a victory speech shortly after midnight thanking his colleagues and especially his voters for their support and expressed conviction {{he would be the}} victor once again two weeks later. He said the citizens of Croatia have a choice between the light and the dark, with him being the light, referring to his untarnished political record, and Bandić being the dark, referring to his allegations of corruption. Milan Bandić arrived to his campaign headquarters {{just a couple of minutes}} before midnight and just a couple of minutes after the results were announced he gave his speech. He congratulated all the other candidates and said a new race began that night. He said he would be an independent president, not a remote-control of Zoran Milanović and accused Josipović of being a project of the highest-ranking members of SDP. He claimed Croatia needs a president that works for them, not for his party. While <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking,</b> most television networks were showing scenes from Josipović headquarters in the corner, with Milanović observing Bandić's remarks. During the middle of his speech, right when Bandić was bashing his former party and its leader, Josipović came to the stage and all television stations switched to hear what he had to say.|$|E
25|$|In his speech, Pericles {{states that}} he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to convey that the {{citizens}} of Athens must continue to support the war, to show them that what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers who <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom. He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies’ the Lacedaemonians. He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if anyone should ask, they should look at their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt {{in the mind of the}} doubtful. He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city.|$|E

500|$|Rudel {{returned}} to West Germany in 1953 {{and became a}} leading member of the Neo-Nazi nationalist political party, the German Reich Party (Deutsche Reichspartei or DRP). In the West German federal election of 1953, Rudel was the top candidate for the DRP, but was not elected to the Bundestag. According to , editor-in-chief of Die Zeit, Rudel had an egocentric character. In his political speeches, Rudel made generalizing statements, claiming that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> on behalf of most, if not all, former German soldiers of World War II. Rudel heavily criticized the Western Allies during World War II for not having supported Germany in its war against the Soviet Union. Rudel's political demeanor subsequently alienated him from his former comrades, foremost Gadermann. Müller-Marein concluded his article with the statement: [...] "Rudel no longer has a Geschwader!" [...] In 1977, he became {{a spokesman for the}} German People's Union, a nationalist political party founded by Gerhard Frey.|$|E

[...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>speaking</b> into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life".
