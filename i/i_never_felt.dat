500|$|By 1966, Meddings' {{commitments}} {{were split}} between Series Two and Thunderbirds Are Go. While Meddings {{worked on the}} film, camera operator Jimmy Elliott assumed the responsibility of directing the TV effects. By this stage, the basic frame of Thunderbird 2 had been damaged {{so many times that}} the model had needed to be rebuilt from scratch. Meddings was displeased with the result, reflecting that the replacement was [...] "not only the wrong colour, it was a completely different shape... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> our model-makers managed to recapture the look of the original." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the player}} talks {{to a number}} of {{characters}} in The Secret of Monkey Island, a close-up portrait of the character is shown. Elaine's appearance in this portrait was based on Avril Harrison, an artist working at LucasArts. Gilbert always felt bothered by these close-up portraits, stating that [...] "while they were great art, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> they matched the style {{of the rest of the}} game". In the 2009 Special Edition, these close-ups were redone in the same stylized artwork featured in the rest of the game.|$|E
500|$|... "Rehab" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad with {{a subtle}} backbeat. According to the digital sheet music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, {{it is written}} in the key of G minor and set in common time, with a moderately slow groove. The vocal range spans nearly an octave {{and a half from}} F3 to B4. [...] "Rehab" [...] opens with a string section, played by Stevie Blacke, and a violin, cello, and tambourine instrumental groove with Hannon Lane's keyboard melody. Rihanna then sings the opening lines, [...] "Baby, baby, when we first met, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> something so strong".|$|E

500|$|Graham Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods {{was listed}} in 2012 credits as the film's inspiration, and Emmerich {{said in a}} Time Out interview: [...] "I {{always wanted to do}} a biblical flood movie, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> I had the hook. I first read about the Earth's Crust Displacement Theory in Graham Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods." [...] He and composer-producer Harald Kloser worked closely together, co-writing a spec script (also {{entitled}} 2012) which was marketed to studios in February2008. A number of studios heard a budget projection and story plans from Emmerich and his representatives, a process repeated by the director after Independence Day (1996) and The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E
500|$|The {{requirement}} {{to re-create the}} various Thunderbird machines was particularly problematic {{in the case of}} Thunderbird 2, as Meddings explains: [...] "Unfortunately, its replacement was not only the wrong colour, it was a completely different shape. Although we had several more built in different scales, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> our model makers managed to re-capture the look of the original." [...] Meddings was also responsible for the design of the Zero-X spacecraft, for the representation of which a fibreglass model, 7ft (2.1m) long, weighing 50lb (23kg) and costing £2,500, was built. The appearance of the Zero-X interior was based on then unfinished aircraft Concorde, a prototype of which was under construction at Filton Airfield in Bristol.|$|E
500|$|The puzzles, {{according}} to Broady, were of uneven quality. He called some [...] "hopelessly difficult" [...] and others extremely derivative. By contrast, he viewed the Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton dialogue puzzle as [...] "brilliant", but said, [...] "Ideas as original as Horse's call for puzzles to match, not rehashes of things we've seen {{far too many}} times already." [...] Ramsey thought the puzzles were challenging but not overly difficult, arguing [...] "on almost every occasion I felt that I was making progress, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> bogged down and hopelessly lost." [...] He felt the puzzles were mostly well-integrated, and found those that were not did not detract from his enjoyment. Ivey remarked, [...] "For puzzle lovers, Drowned God is a treasure trove. ... This collection of tricky puzzlers are challenging and frequently innovative." ...|$|E

500|$|Reactions {{to the red}} culture {{movement}} were divided. Bo’s {{revival of}} Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within certain segments of society, and made Bo popular with both Marxists and neo-leftists. One student quoted in The Washington Post embraced the ethos of the campaign, saying, [...] "When I sing red songs, I find a kind of spirit <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> when singing modern songs…To surround yourself with material stuff is just a waste of time." [...] A group of retired participants in a red song routine told the Los Angeles Times [...] "We know these songs from our youth. We grew up with revolutionary spirit {{and we want to}} pass that on to our children.” Another noted that he felt compelled to participate in order to express appreciation to the Communist Party for the country’s strong economy.|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt {{returned}} to theatre acting in June 2005 {{when he appeared}} in David Nicholls' After Sun, a ten-minute-play performed {{as part of the}} Old Vic's 24-Hour Play season. Nesbitt and Catherine Tate starred as a married couple who meet a pair of newlyweds returning from their honeymoon. Later that year, he appeared in his first full-length play in 11 years, in Owen McCafferty's Shoot the Crow. He enjoyed the stimulation of learning his lines and rehearsing with the cast and director. The play opened at the Trafalgar Studios in September 2005 and his role as Socrates gained mixed reviews. In The Independent, Michael Coveney suggested the role did not fit the actor: [...] "Nesbitt is cool. But <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> that he was inside his role of a chap called Socrates [...] He grinned and shrugged through the evening which steadily became less about grouting on tiles and more about grating on nerves." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Charles Spencer described Nesbitt's acting as [...] "outstanding".|$|E
500|$|A {{month before}} {{she made her}} debut on-screen, Toyah was {{described}} as being Janice's (Vicky Entwistle) fourteen-year-old illegitimate daughter, who would become [...] "the scourge of every Weatherfield Comprehensive teacher". During {{an interview with the}} Daily Record's Polly Graham, Taylor stated [...] "Toyah's gobby and cocky and makes her parents' life a misery. But it's brilliant playing her, it's more fun than playing somebody nice." [...] Graham explained that both Toyah and her stepsister, Leanne (Jane Danson) were well known to the police for under-age drinking and burglary. Taylor said that she hated her character's clothes, as they were too revealing for her. She explained [...] "In the beginning, the clothes that Toyah wore were terrible. I was very conscious of my bum hanging out from these tiny mini-skirts. There are a lot of girls who wear those tarty skirts, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> comfortable in that sort of thing." [...] Taylor also disliked Toyah's make-up, which was initially bright pink lipstick, a lot of black eyeliner and no foundation.|$|E

500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Love Equals Death {{proved to}} be a strong band and a fun band to be in, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> {{comfortable}} in the band. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> like it was my band or that I was really a part of everyone else here ... Right before I joined LED, I started a solo project that I put on the back burner, because things were going well with LED and I ended up getting too busy to focus on it. I kept writing songs for both LED and the solo shit, knowing one day I would have to part ways with LED to fulfill my desire to express myself the way I had always dreamed. I was going to do this sooner and then [...] So I stayed to help get the band back on track and I never leave anything on a negative note.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, she {{publicly}} revealed her eight-year {{struggle with}} bulimia, explaining how during {{her time in}} the Pussycat Dolls, [...] "I just hated myself.

That's the only thing I can trust.".|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, the British {{government}} announced publicly {{that it was}} abandoning {{the use of the}} phrase [...] "War on Terror" [...] as they found it to be less than helpful. This was explained more recently by Lady Eliza Manningham-Buller. In her 2011 Reith lecture, the former head of MI5 said that the 9/11 attacks were [...] "a crime, not an act of war. So <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> it helpful to refer to a war on terror." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many saw the crossed metal as a Christian {{cross and}} felt its {{survival}} was symbolic. Fr.

[...] One minister at the site says that when a family of a man who died in the attacks came to the cross shrine and left personal effects there, [...] "It was as if the cross took in the grief and loss. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> Jesus more." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his Under the Cedars and the Stars Sheehan {{wrote of}} his childhood: [...] "Strange <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> the {{proximity}} of father and mother. [...] But of my sisters, one in particular, the only dark-haired in the family, has haunted me through life. [...] I no more doubt of her presence and her light touch {{on the issues of}} my life, than I doubt of the breath of wind that flutters the tassel of the biretta on my head. [...] Yet what is strange is not her nearness but her farness".|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} his naval stint in Honolulu that Granger {{had his first}} sexual experiences, one with a hostess at a private club {{and the other with}} a Navy officer visiting the same venue, both on the same night. He was startled to {{discover}} he was attracted to both men and women equally, and in his memoir he observed, [...] "I finally {{came to the conclusion that}} for me, everything I had done that night was as natural and as good as it felt... I never have felt the need to belong to any exclusive, self-defining, or special group... I was never ashamed, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> the need to explain or apologize for my relationships to anyone.... I have loved men. I have loved women." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{part because}} of public {{misunderstanding}} surrounding gothic aesthetics, people in the goth subculture sometimes suffer prejudice, discrimination, and intolerance. As {{is the case with}} members of various other subcultures and alternative lifestyles, outsiders sometimes marginalize goths, either by intention or by accident. Actress Christina Hendricks talked of being bullied as a goth in school and how difficult it was for her to deal with societal pressure: [...] "Kids can be pretty judgmental about people who are different. But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy. My mother was mortified and kept telling me how horrible and ugly I looked. Strangers would walk by with a look of shock on their face, so <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> pretty. I just always felt awkward". Prejudice moves people into circles of bonding where they share these similar experiences and are accepted. Young goths have to define themselves and learn beauty is an aspect of cultural relativism.|$|E
