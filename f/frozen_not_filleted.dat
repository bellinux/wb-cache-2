40|$|To date, six {{cetacean}} {{species are}} confirmed {{to occur in}} coastal waters off Ghana: five odontocetes Stenella clymene, Steno bredanensis, Tursiops truncatus, Kogia simus, Physeter macrocephalus, and Megaptera novaeangliae. A stranded humpback whale calf raised questions about breeding stock. We found no evidence {{for the presence of}} the Atlantic hump-backed dolphin Sousa teuszii; either it has become rare or it does not occur off Ghana. Unrestrained coastal development may pose a threat for nearshore species. Regular and year-round bycatches of small cetaceans are documented in artisanal gillnet fisheries from Apam, Jamestown (Accra), Kpone and Winneba. At Apam, drift gillnet fishermen intentionally capture dolphins with sharks and tuna. Annual takes at Apam and Jamestown probably count in the low hundreds, higher than at Kpone and Winneba. Bottlenose dolphins are also known to be taken in semi-industrial purse-seines (Jamestown). Carcasses are <b>not</b> <b>filleted,</b> but hacked into small portions including bone, and retailed locally for food. This explains why beach-combing around fishing villages did not yield any findings of skeletal parts. Field research and monitoring effort should continue...|$|R

40|$|Poultry meat {{production}} in Argentina has experienced an important increase. Poultry processors have incorporated different strategies to reduce processing time and improve quality of breast fillets. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the effect of deboning time and marination on meat quality of broiler breast fillets produced in Argentina. Three hundred sixty commercial 48 d old male broilers were aged for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 24 h before deboning. After deboning pH and color were determined. The right fillet of each breast was immediately quick-frozen and the left fillet was marinated by injection and then quick-frozen. All breast fillets were stored when frozen for 60 d and then thawed for pH, color, Warner-Bratzler shear force and thawing loss determinations. pH measured at deboning decreased during the first 4 h of aging in <b>not</b> marinated <b>fillets.</b> Measures taken after frozen storage showed no changes in pH with aging time. Lightness measured at deboning increased with aging time. Shear values in both marinated and <b>not</b> marinated <b>fillets</b> decreased as from 6 h of aging.

5000|$|The first {{reference}} to the term [...] "rough" [...] as applied to fish is in the historical work [...] "A History of Fish and Fishing on the Upper Mississippi River" [...] by Carlander. To summarize: In the mid-to-late 19th century, commercial fishermen in the Central United States often netted and processed large quantities of river fish in their boats for sale, particularly in the Mississippi River. They would then travel many miles up or down river to deliver these fish to market. In hot summer weather, the slow, heavily loaded boats often had to be lightened quickly {{to ensure that the}} entire catch did not become spoiled before reaching market. The common practice of the time was to save the fully processed fish, since these commanded a higher price at market. Rough-dressed fish (or fish sold [...] "in the rough" [...] - which means they had the internal organs removed but were <b>not</b> <b>filleted)</b> were discarded to lighten the boat, by dumping the carcasses into the river. Thus, originally a [...] "rough fish" [...] was a fish of any species that had been only partly processed and which could not be sold for full price. The term subsequently evolved into a derogatory term for any fish that was undesirable or unpopular.|$|R
