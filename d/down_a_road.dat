5|$|Bok tried {{twice to}} flee from slavery {{at the age}} of 14. The first {{instance}} happened early one morning after he had been sent out with the cattle. Bok blindly ran <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> for several miles before he was captured by one of Giemma's fellow militia members. Giemma's peer returned Francis to the Giemma's compound, where he was beaten with a bullwhip. Bok attempted to escape once again just two days later, when he fled in the opposite direction of his previous escape. He once again fled for several miles, this time keeping to the forest. He stopped for water at a local stream crossing, where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to be there as well. Giemma forced Francis back to his home, this time promising to kill him. Francis was beaten again, but Giemma chose not to kill him, as Francis had become too valuable to the family as a slave.|$|E

In 1969 Louis stopped making the film.|$|E

500|$|During {{the night}} of 26 July, {{sometime}} after 10:00pm, a messenger arrived with word that the enemy had reached the village of Khar, three miles from Malakand. A bugle call was immediately sounded within the camp. Lieutenant-Colonel McRae, commanding the 45th Sikhs, two units from the 31st Punjab Infantry, two Guns from No. 8 Mountain Battery and one Squadron from the 11th Bengal Lancers, {{was to have been}} sent to Amandara Pass – a distance of four miles – with orders to hold the position; however, the Pashtun column had already arrived at the South Malakand camp, surprising the British defenders, and began to open fire on the garrison with muskets. McRae immediately sent a small number of men under Major Taylor <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> from the [...] "right flank" [...] of the camp to ascertain the enemy's strength and location; McRae himself later followed with his own small group. Both parties aimed for a sharp turn in the oncoming road where, flanked by gorges, they hoped to hold the attacking force. McRae, with about 20 men, opened fire on the Pashtun tribesmen and began a fighting withdrawal 50 paces down the road before halting in an attempt to stop the attack. Taylor was mortally wounded in the incident and quickly died; McRae suffered a neck wound. Nevertheless, by 2:00am reinforcements under the command of Lieutenant Barff had enabled the British to repel the Pashtun attack. The official dispatches of General Meiklejohn noted that: ...|$|E
500|$|Director Greg Beeman found {{shooting}} the episode difficult {{because he had}} recently lost his father; he noted, [...] "I left from his funeral to go to Vancouver to direct the episode, so the emotions were very poignant for me." [...] Souders stated that the production staff wanted the climactic scene of Lana's death to be a [...] "big event". Originally, the show's producers wanted the car accident {{to be caused by}} a train. However, the show was not able to afford the special effects to pull the scene off, and so, the sequence was re-written to feature a bus crash. Souders noted that if the show had been unable to afford the bus wreck, it would have been re-written into a [...] "little car wreck". The Lana's entire sequence death was choreographed by Christopher Sayour—series stunt coordinator and Welling's stunt double. Sayour described the scene as [...] "important to me and important to a lot of people". The car crash sequence itself was actually a collage of several different shots. First, Kreuk was filmed driving a car on a process trailer with a mounted camera. A separate shot was filmed with a stunt double driving a lead car that was attached to a dummy car driving <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> at high speed. A bus was then driven in a perpendicular direction. The dummy car was attached with a detonator so that when the bus hit it, it would detach and not pull the lead car with it, and the timing for the crash was practiced several times during rehearsals. Finally, after the car was smashed by the bus, Kreuk was positioned on the ground to give the effect that she was actually in the car wreck.|$|E

500|$|A promotional music video, {{directed}} by Super Furry Animals and Martin McCarthy, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Northern Lites" [...] as a single. The video begins with a shot of Super Furry Animals' 'SFA' logo, which appears {{on the cover of}} [...] "Northern Lites", displayed above the words [...] "Public information service". This shot fades to show a full-screen translucent, fluorescent blue, image of the [...] "warrior", also from the single's cover, which moves from the centre to the bottom right before shrinking and remaining stationary in the top right {{for the duration of the}} video. The SFA logo from the introduction is shown in the top left, opposite the [...] "warrior" [...] image, and also remains throughout the video. The island Ailsa Craig is briefly shown, the island where in 2004 when the single was released, 60 to 70% of all curling stones in use were made from granite from the island and is one of only two sources for all stones in the sport, the other being the Trefor Granite Quarry in Wales. Next, images of the sea and birds in flight are shown before footage of a bearded man, sitting on rocks beside the sea and singing along to the first verse is shown. This footage is intercut with shots of a man using a hammer and chisel on some boulders before walking away with a large rock. The rock is shown being spun and polished into a curling stone. A yellow handle is added to the stone and it is placed into a wooden box alongside another stone with a red handle. The box is closed and the word Nagano is seen printed on the lid. The video then cuts to shots of a Boeing 747 before wintery scenes of Nagano are shown, including a shot of people with umbrellas stood in the snow in front of a sign that reads [...] "Nagano Olympics". Footage from curling events are then shown until 2 minutes and 40 seconds when the video cuts to show a man in a grey suit dropping a handful of grass on a road. The video then ends with shots of Irish road bowling–several men are shown throwing a bowl <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> surrounded by spectators alongside scenes of men with measuring sticks and men exchanging banknotes. In a 2008 interview with Uncut, Gruff Rhys stated that [...] "Northern Lites" [...] "didn't have a video" [...] and suggested this as the reason the track was not a [...] bigger hit than it was. The director who was originally scheduled to work on the video took up an offer of a Red Stripe commercial in Jamaica, leaving the band to collaborate with McCarthy. According to Rhys the group met the original director later and told him [...] "We understand, we'd have done the same." [...] Despite this, bassist Guto Pryce has described the [...] "Northern Lites" [...] music video as one of only a handful of the group's videos that he actually likes.|$|E

At Porlock the road was too narrow because of a wall but the owner let the men take down the corner of the house so that they could pass.

2500|$|The thrust from Lak Sao {{moved toward}} Nape Pass as planned in early December, rolling <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> freshly {{improved}} by the North Vietnamese, and brushed off a blocking attempt {{by a company}} of Pathet Lao guerrillas. This was a prelude to an aggressive resistance that began on 15 December, as the North Vietnamese committed {{a minimum of three}} battalions to confront the Laotian thrust. While sending one column down Route 8 to hit the Laotian task-force head-on, the North Vietnamese also circled around southwards through the Mu Gia Pass to strike towards Nhommarat. On 16 December, the RLA rushed the paratroopers of 11 Bataillon Parachutistes (11th Paratroop Battalion) aboard Royal Lao Air Force C-47 transports and dropped them into Khamkheut. By 19 December, the sky soldiers had worked their way over to Lak Sao and begun pushing up Route 8. At a one-lane steel bridge, the paratroopers were bloodied by PAVN forces and retreated. They passed back through friendly forces still holding at Nak Sao, and returned to their Khamkeut drop zone.

2500|$|Progressively {{after the}} late 1950s, Baconsky entirely lost his {{confidence}} in communism—an attitude which culminated in his 1972 protest. His disappointment was especially known to his intimate circle. Based on this, Cernat defines the writer as an [...] "informal anti-communist", while Călinescu, who recalls participating in such conversations, notes: [...] "Baconsky [...] an emphatic, lucid, irreconcilable anti-communism. Not even later [...] did I meet {{many people who}} had a more emphasized contempt, mixed with an intense repulsion, for {{the representatives of the}} [...] party ideology, either within the literary world or outside it." [...] He believes Baconsky's stance from 1958 onwards makes him the period's [...] "only dissident", although he also notes that the poet criticized the communist system only [...] "orally". Cornel Ungureanu, who stresses the importance of both his move to Bucharest and the numerous visits abroad, adds: [...] " [...] was to walk <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> which most celebrity authors of the 1950s' communist east [...] have walked down on: the one between fanatical exaltation and acute misanthropies." [...] According to Bogdan Creţu, 1967, when Echinoxul nebunilor was published, was the capital moment in Baconsky's non-compliance with the ideological requirements, with [...] "more than honorable behavior" [...] defining the second part of his career. However, Cernat speculates, the theory regarding his alleged collaboration to Securitate may offer clue that Baconsky's new stance was itself orchestrated by the Party, in an attempt to offer him credibility and permit him to sabotage the literary environment.|$|E
2500|$|Lip Lock was {{met with}} {{generally}} favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 62, based on 8 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". David Jeffries of AllMusic stated, [...] "If Lip Lock isn't mean enough, well, neither is Eve. She's sweeter than before and musically more adventurous. It's just a shame she burned up the title Eve-Olution on that previous release." [...] Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of Spin said, [...] "Lip Lock {{may not be the}} best rap album of 2013, but it's interesting, and it's honest. After 11 years, that's a respectable way to ride out." [...] Edwin Ortiz of HipHopDX said, [...] "Seeing Eve return is a welcoming sight, and while unexpected, the experimental arrangements of her new project can be written off as just that. The heart of the issue with Lip Lock is that Eve hasn’t restored the command she once had, which subsequently allows these new sounds to lead her <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>road</b> of uncertainty. Eve’s maturation as a person has been obtained through time; it may take more before her music catches up." [...] Lauren Martin of Fact stated, [...] "Eve doesn’t dwell on the past with underhand bitterness or glassy-eyed nostalgia. Considering it’s been eleven years, there’s a pointedly absent element of story-telling about her hiatus which leaves the listener wanting more, yet Eve was never held up as a great lyricist and can’t really be bashed for not being one now. That’s not where her appeal lies. For all her success in commercial rap Eve is first and foremost a singer. It’s the fluidity of her appeal that she’s most keenly aware of, and this gets a triumphant finale on the remix of first single ‘She Bad Bad’ featuring Pusha T and Juicy J. As the three fellow comeback success stories stand side by side like this over what is certainly the album’s most intense beat, even I feel smug listening to it. Eve is back, and she barely broke a sweat." ...|$|E
