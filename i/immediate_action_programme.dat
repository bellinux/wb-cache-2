40|$|The most {{important}} {{aim of the}} 'Federal Government's <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> to reduce youth unemployment' is undoubtedly the reduction of youth unemployment and in particular long-term unemployment among young people. In this respect one may assume that in regions with poor initial situations on the labour market and apprenticeship market the possibilities of the <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> for young people will also be used more intensively. Even though this thesis is confirmed, further examination {{makes it clear that}} the range of measures is used very differently in the employment office areas. The behaviour of the labour market players is determined both by structural basic conditions and by alternative possibilities, experiences and co-operation partners. The co-operation of the employment offices with relevant labour market partners is evaluated in depth in ten selected employment office areas. The <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is seen to {{have a positive effect on}} the intensity of co-operation between the employment office and the youth welfare and social assistance offices. The analysis provides first indications of intensive co-operation between the employment office and other regional players in labour market and social policy resulting in a reduction in youth unemployment. After this the effect that regional disparities and different strategies for implementing the <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> in 1999 had on the development of youth unemployment and persistent unemployment among young people between 1998 and 2000 is analysed using multivariate regression models. Here the considerable influence of the general employment trend on the regional reduction of youth unemployment can be seen. Taking into account regional and structural basic conditions it becomes clear in addition that the use of the <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> only explains to a small extent the differences in the regional development of youth unemployment. It is necessary to emphasise in particular the positive effects that the <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> for young people has on the reduction of long-term unemployment among young people. The proportion of long-term unemployed young people fell more considerably in employment office areas which make increased use of wage subsidies and employment creation measures with partial qualificationfor young people than it did in other areas.

40|$|Employment and {{training}} measures funded through labour market policy are gaining in importance quantitatively {{in the transition}} process of young people from general education into employment. Not least the Federal Government's <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> to reduce youth unemployment, which came into force in 1999, has contributed to this. Which young people end their unemployment by transferring into a subsidised training or employment measure? A survey of 2000 young unemployed people who were registered with the Federal Employment Services between 1998 and 1999 for longer than three months shows that the transition process follows complex patterns. Young people experience unemployment at different places on their way into employment. These transition patterns in turn affect the probability of starting training, entering employment or participating in an employment or training scheme during the further career. According to results of a multivariate logit analysis, individual, biographical, origin-related and regional characteristics have an effect. With {{the aid of a}} Cox model, the time dependence of the transition events is shown, which varies equally with individual, origin-specific and regional characteristics and defines opportunities for the further career.

40|$|One of {{the latent}} {{aims of the}} {{measures}} {{carried out in the}} context of the <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> for young people is to promote the mental health of the participants, thus strengthening their ability to cope with external and internal demands. The paper examines whether and if so, how, the mental health had changed following participation in the programme. The participants were interviewed during and after the measure and the results of the of the repetition interviews were compared. The analysis shows - differentiated according to gender - the influence of various factors on the mental health of the young people. Some of the participants' mental health seemed to have strengthened after completing the measure compared with their first interviews, in some of the other participants a deterioration of their condition could be ascertained instead. The financial situation, the degree of work involvement, the type of measure attended and the labour market status achieved are factors that can be considered to have some influence. In both male and female participants, a high level of work involvement was associated with positive effects on the mental health, whereas financial restrictions corresponded with a deterioration in health values.

40|$|Whereas {{many studies}} focus on climate skeptics {{to explain the}} lack of support for <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> on climate change, this {{research}} examines the effect of moderate believers in climate science. Using data from a representative survey of 832 Indiana residents, we find that agreement with basic scientific conclusions about climate change is the strongest predictor of support for <b>immediate</b> <b>action,</b> and the strength of that agreement is an important characteristic of this association. Responses indicate widespread acceptance of climate change, moderate levels of risk perception, and limited support for <b>immediate</b> <b>action.</b> Half of the respondents (50 %) preferred “more research” over “immediate action” (38 %) and “no action” (12 %) as a response to climate change. The probability of preferring <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> is close to zero for those who strongly or somewhat disbelieve in climate change, but as belief in climate change grows from moderate to strong, the probability of preferring <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> increases substantially; the strongest believers have a predicted probability of preferring <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> of 71 %. These findings suggest that, instead of simply engaging skeptics, increasing public support for <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> might entail motivating those with moderate beliefs in climate change to hold their views with greater conviction...|$|R

40|$|Abstract   This paper {{focuses on}} whether {{individual}} development plans {{as well as}} <b>action</b> <b>programmes</b> are needed. Pupils in need of particular support get {{to be involved in}} an <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> – the school needs to provide any particular support a pupil needs. However, the individual development plan does not substitute the <b>action</b> <b>programme.</b> Thus an <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> as well as an individual development plan will be provided to students in need of particular support. The individual development plan follows the pupil throughout the entire education, regardless of whether its content changes, whilst the <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> pertains to a limited period of time. Pupils that are not in need of particular support are not likely to need to set goals for themselves in addition to those already set outside of school. An <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is primarily concerned with affecting the conditions under which the pupils carry out their work.   The results of my study indicate that the individual development plan is yet another duty on part of the teachers, but with exceptionally scarce repayment. According to teachers at the school explored, the individual development plan generates little or no progress for pupils already involved in an <b>action</b> <b>programme.</b> A thoroughly crafted <b>action</b> <b>programme</b> is sufficient, according to teachers participating in the study. A pupil not in need of particular support will not need the individual development plan either, according to the teachers – it would merely be another paper to look at during development talks, but it would not benefit the pupil or the teacher...|$|R
