5|$|Alprazolam {{is taken}} orally, and <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> well – 80% of {{alprazolam}} binds to proteins in the serum (the majority binding to albumin). The concentration of alprazolam peaks after {{one to two}} hours.|$|E
5|$|Clearing waste: CSF {{allows for}} the removal of waste {{products}} from the brain, and is critical in the brain's lymphatic system. Metabolic waste products diffuse rapidly into the CSF and are removed into the bloodstream as CSF <b>is</b> <b>absorbed.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the hydrozoan {{jellyfish}} Aequorea victoria, some of {{the blue}} light released by aequorin in contact with calcium ions <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by green fluorescent protein; it in turn releases green light.|$|E
50|$|This new {{incarnation}} was short-lived, however. On 20 November 1919 Y Battery <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> in A Battery, on 7 January 1920 Z Battery <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> in B Battery and on 11 February 1920 AA Battery <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> in M Battery, all of I Brigade, RHA.

50|$|In 1901, part of {{the civil}} parish <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Bristol, and further parts <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Bristol between then and 1933. In 1935, the civil parish was abolished, when the {{remaining}} parts <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the civil parishes of Pilning and Severn Beach, and Almondsbury.|$|R
50|$|The Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the Cambrian Railways which, {{with the}} other companies, <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the GWR.|$|R
5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{is a global}} issue since lead mining and smelting, and battery manufacturing/disposal/recycling, are common in many countries. Lead enters the body via inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Almost all inhaled lead <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the body; for ingestion, the rate is 20–70%, with children absorbing a higher percentage than adults.|$|E
5|$|October 29, 2017– Tropical Storm Philippe <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by a non-tropical area of low pressure, {{which brought}} heavy {{rainfall}} and high winds to the state. Snow also fell in extreme western portions.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{concentration}} of cadmium <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the kidneys of humans, {{and up to}} about 30mg of cadmium is commonly inhaled throughout human childhood and adolescence. Cadmium is under preliminary research for its toxicity in humans, potentially affecting mechanisms and risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|The Dingwall & Skye <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the Highland in 1880, and the Sutherland, Duke of Sutherland's and Sutherland & Caithness Railways <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> in 1884.|$|R
5000|$|Strike Command {{was formed}} on 30 April 1968 by {{the merger of}} Bomber Command and Fighter Command, which became No. 1 Group and No. 11 Group respectively. Signals Command <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> on 1 January 1969, Coastal Command <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> on 28 November 1969 and Air Support Command (formerly Transport Command) <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> on 1 September 1972.|$|R
50|$|Prior to 1935 Misterton was {{the centre}} of the Misterton Rural District, which <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the East Retford Rural District. This in turn <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by Bassetlaw in 1974.|$|R
5|$|Ultraviolet telescopes make {{observations}} at ultraviolet wavelengths, i.e. between approximately 10 and 320 nm. Light {{at these}} wavelengths <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the Earth's atmosphere, so observations at these wavelengths must be performed {{from the upper}} atmosphere or from space. Objects emitting ultraviolet radiation include the Sun, other stars and galaxies.|$|E
5|$|When ingested, {{only about}} 0.05% of {{samarium}} salts <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> {{into the bloodstream}} and the remainder is excreted. From the blood, about 45% goes to the liver and 45% is deposited {{on the surface of}} the bones where it remains for about 10 years; the balance 10% is excreted.|$|E
5|$|Being a hunt-driven dog, the Jack Russell {{will usually}} pursue most creatures that it encounters. This {{includes}} the skunk, and the breed {{is prone to}} skunk toxic shock syndrome. The chemical in the skunk spray <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the dog and causes the red blood cells to undergo haemolysis, which can occasionally lead to fatal anaemia and kidney failure. If sprayed underground, it can also cause chemical burning of the cornea. Treatments are available to flush the toxin out of the dog's system.|$|E
50|$|In 1815 Omalur taluk <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Salem taluk, but was recreated in 1819. It <b>was</b> again <b>absorbed</b> by Salem taluk in 1860, {{and again}} recreated in 1910. In 1916 Omalur taluk {{bifurcated}} into Omalur and Mettur, and in 1941 Mettur Taluk <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Omalur.|$|R
5000|$|Many of {{the older}} factions have <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into their larger Houses or Clans, {{starting}} with the Firepower expansion in May 2005. For example, the Swordsworn <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> by House Davion, and the Stormhammers <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> by House Steiner. The Steel Wolves faction [...] "evolved" [...] into their own mercenary group known as Wolf Hunters {{with the introduction of}} Clan Wolf into the game.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} July 1941, the Fourth Army {{began to}} dissolve. The Fourth Army's staff members <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the general staff of the Central Front, and the troops <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into other armies.|$|R
5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the electron.|$|E
5|$|Metformin has an oral {{bioavailability}} of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached {{within one}} to three hours of taking immediate-release metformin and four to eight hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000l after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached {{in one or two}} days.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{its high}} radioactivity, curium and its {{compounds}} must be handled in appropriate laboratories under special arrangements. Whereas curium itself mostly emits α-particles which are absorbed by thin layers of common materials, some of its decay products emit significant fractions of beta and gamma radiation, which require a more elaborate protection. If consumed, curium is excreted {{within a few days}} and only 0.05% <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the blood. From there, about 45% goes to the liver, 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. In the bone, curium accumulates {{on the inside of the}} interfaces to the bone marrow and does not significantly redistribute with time; its radiation destroys bone marrow and thus stops red blood cell creation. The biological half-life of curium is about 20 years in the liver and 50 years in the bones. Curium <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the body much more strongly via inhalation, and the allowed total dose of 244Cm in soluble form is 0.3 μC. Intravenous injection of 242Cm and 244Cm containing solutions to rats increased the incidence of bone tumor, and inhalation promoted pulmonary and liver cancer.|$|E
50|$|Besides the conglomoration {{of minor}} clans {{that makes up}} the Mantis, there are other minor clans that have <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> by great clans. The Falcon Clan has <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the Crab (as Toritaka family).|$|R
50|$|In the Storyteller System, Backgrounds are {{advantages}} such as Contacts, Resources and Status. In the Storytelling System, Backgrounds have <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Merits. Furthermore, the Linguistics Knowledge, representing {{knowledge of}} specific languages, has also <b>been</b> <b>absorbed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sound may <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> by {{losses at}} the fluid boundaries. Near {{the surface of}} the sea losses can occur in a bubble layer or in ice, while at the bottom sound can {{penetrate}} into the sediment and <b>be</b> <b>absorbed.</b>|$|R
5|$|Rhodium is a hard, silvery, durable {{metal that}} has a high reflectance. Rhodium metal does not {{normally}} form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium, but is released on solidification. Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids: it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{receives}} 174petawatts (PW) {{of incoming}} solar radiation (insolation) {{at the upper}} atmosphere. Approximately 30% is reflected back to space while the rest <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by clouds, oceans and land masses. The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet. Most of the world's population live in areas with insolation levels of 150–300 watts/m², or 3.5–7.0 kWh/m² per day.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not {{confirmed}} that boron {{is an essential}} nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. Adult dietary intake is estimated at 0.9 to 1.4 mg/day, with about 90% absorbed. What <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> is mostly excreted in urine. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level for adults is 20 mg/day.|$|E
50|$|In July 1864 {{the line}} <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the Cambrian Railways. Cambrian Railways <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the Great Western Railway on 1 January 1922 {{as a result}} of the Railways Act 1921, and became part of British Railways in 1948.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 Cassa di Risparmio di Alessandria <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Banca di Legnano. In {{the next}} year Banca di Legnano <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into BPM on 14 September. On 31 December 2012 the bank had a {{shareholders}} equity of €960 million.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 16th century, the Three Guards {{lost their}} {{existence}} as a distinct group. Their Fuyu <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the Khorchin after they had moved to the Nonni River. Two other, Doyin and Tai'nin, <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the Five Khalkhas.|$|R
5|$|The {{index of}} refraction, a number used in physics to {{describe}} how light propagates through a particular substance, is an important property of volcanic ash. This number is complex having both real and imaginary parts, the real part indicating how light disperses and the imaginary part indicating how light <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the substance.|$|E
5|$|The {{permanganate}} {{exhibits a}} higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the mucous membrane. For example, the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. Only {{a limited amount}} <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.|$|E
5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
