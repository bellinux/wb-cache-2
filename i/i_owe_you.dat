500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling. Because {{at the end of the}} day I do think of myself as a story teller. But it's rough as f---, [...] so bear with me and give me all the support you can. It's from the heart. I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks they came here to see a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know if you like it raw.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{must now}} hasten home,' said she. 'I felt that, {{considering}} my shortcomings at our parting {{so many years}} ago, <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> <b>you</b> the initiative now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Tony {{smiled a}} little. “Well,” he said slowly, “it seemed even chances that I could reach {{him with the}} butt, and <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> <b>you</b> a good deal, you see.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Beasley, even if <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> <b>you</b> that, {{how could}} I raise so {{enormous}} a sum? <b>I</b> don't <b>owe</b> it. And <b>I</b> certainly won't {{be put off}} my property. You can't put me off." ...|$|R
500|$|After more behind-the-scenes {{contract}} wrangling, Smith {{became a}} St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool {{designed to help}} Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, [...] "Every time you hit a fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time you hit a ground ball, <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> a buck. We'll keep that going all year." [...] Smith agreed to the wager, {{and by the end}} of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, [...] "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to me that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense." ...|$|E
500|$|Hartman first {{performed}} his Clinton {{impression on}} {{an episode of}} The Tonight Show. When he met Clinton in 1993 Hartman remarked, [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> a few apologies", adding later that he [...] "sometimes [...] a twinge of guilt about [...] ". Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: [...] "You're not the president, but you play one on TV. And you're OK, mostly." [...] For his Clinton impression, Hartman copied the president's [...] "post-nasal drip" [...] and the [...] "slight scratchiness" [...] in his voice, {{as well as his}} open, [...] "less intimidating" [...] hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he felt it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose. One of Hartman's more famous sketches as Clinton saw the president visit a McDonald's restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers' food. The writers told him that he was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch – {{by the end of the}} live performance, Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak.|$|E
2500|$|Kierra Valencia [...] "Kiki" [...] Sheard (born June 20, 1987 in Detroit, Michigan) is an American gospel singer, fashion designer, {{and radio}} host. She is the {{daughter}} of gospel singer Karen Clark Sheard (member of gospel singing group The Clark Sisters) and the granddaughter of gospel choral director Mattie Moss Clark. Sheard portrayed Litha in the 2010 Christian-drama film Preacher's Kid. [...] After appearing on her mother's albums, Sheard broke onto the music scene with the release of her debut album <b>I</b> <b>Owe</b> <b>You</b> in 2004. Her hit single [...] "You Don't Know" [...] was written about her mother's bout with an almost fatal blood clot.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you {{remember}} that I tried to tell you, when I came home, what a debt of gratitude <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> <b>you,</b> dearest Agnes, and how fervently I felt towards you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I really {{believed}} that," [...] he assured her, [...] "and I shall try to, then I should feel that <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> <b>you</b> {{more than any}} person upon the earth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{who would}} not be sorry, ingenious Hosea, were it {{composed}} only of Hebrews! But thy errand; I have no gage unredeemed, nor do I know that <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>thee</b> gold." ...|$|R
2500|$|Born in Detroit, Michigan, {{and raised}} in the suburb of West Bloomfield, Sheard spent her {{formative}} years surrounded by the influences of her family, their faith, and their music. At age 6, she began singing in the choir at Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ, pastored by her father Bishop J. Drew Sheard. Even at a young age, Sheard had a preternatural grip on the signature [...] "Clark sound" [...] pioneered by her mother and aunts, executing high and fast melismata, riffs, runs, and deep, throaty growls sometimes referred to as [...] "squalls" [...] (the latter is prominently displayed on [...] "Done Did It", a traditional gospel leaning track from her album <b>I</b> <b>Owe</b> <b>You).</b>|$|E

60|$|GUNN. <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> an apology, Miss O'Dowda. I {{said it was}} by Barker.|$|E
6000|$|Ernest. How can I thank thee for thy {{tenderness}} and pity; how may I best show the gratitude <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>thee</b> for the priceless boon of freedom thou hast this day given? ...|$|R
6000|$|Glad {{old house}} of lichened stonework, What <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> <b>you</b> in my lone work, [...] Noon and night! Whensoever faint or ailing, Letting go my grasp and failing, [...] You lent light.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can have}} him. We had meant {{him for the}} Sheriff, but what you did just now lays me in your debt, and I {{would not like to}} feel <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> <b>you</b> anything." ...|$|R
60|$|CHARLES. Rowley my old Friend--I am {{sure you}} congratulate me and I suspect too that <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> much.|$|E
60|$|Const. Mr Burr, <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> {{not that}} satisfaction; {{what you have}} heard you may {{interpret}} as you please.|$|E

6000|$|Gab. [...] Still <b>you</b> <b>owe</b> me something, [...] Though not for that; and <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> <b>you</b> my safety, [...] At least my seeming safety, {{when the}} slaves [...] Of Stralenheim pursued {{me on the}} grounds [...] That I had robbed him.|$|R
6000|$|... "MY VERY DEAR GENERAL,--I {{have written}} to the King, that <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> <b>you</b> 2,125 THALERS for the Recruits; of which {{he says there are}} 600 paid: there remain, therefore, 1,525, which he will pay you directly.|$|R
6000|$|... "My son {{went with}} him," [...] replied the knight; [...] "he brought him {{here as the}} son of a Scottish lord.--I pray you, sir, to be {{finished}} with these questions; for although <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>thee,</b> as Will Shakspeare says, ...|$|R

60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> much. And {{now tell}} me what you were going to ask me just now as Lord Caversham came in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Norseman," [...] he said, [...] "small is the {{gratitude}} <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> to <b>thee.</b> 'Tis true, ye {{have treated}} {{me and my}} brother kindly since we came hither, and for that <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>thee</b> thanks, and would gladly have paid this debt before leaving, had such been consistent with flight; but kindness, however great, is not a worthy price for liberty, and when King Olaf Tryggvisson sent me to thee, I made no promise to sell my liberty at such a price. But in regard to Hake--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We will shake hands, Gride,' said Mr Bray, {{extending}} his, as old Arthur bowed. 'You mean well, no doubt. I an {{bound to}} say so now. If <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> <b>you</b> money, that was not your fault. Madeline, my love, your hand here.' ...|$|R
60|$|Boab. You with {{contempt}} on meaner gifts look down; And, aiming at my queen, disdain my crown. That crown, restored, deserves no recompence. Since you would rob the fairest jewel thence. Dare not henceforth ungrateful me to call; Whate'er <b>I</b> <b>owed</b> <b>you,</b> this has cancelled all.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Massey," [...] said Adam penitently, [...] "I'm {{very hot}} and hasty. <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} different; but you mustn't take it ill of me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But this is {{not only}} silly, but cruel to others. <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>you</b> an {{explanation}} of my unexpected appearance, and perhaps, also, of my extraordinary attire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{him with}} you," [...] said the knight. [...] "I bestow him on you freely, if he recovers. <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>thee</b> {{a reward for}} {{attendance}} on my squire, and have nothing else to pay it with. For myself, I will never again wind bugle or halloo to hound!" ...|$|R

60|$|Leonore.

Farewell, old Norna; watch thou above the helpless, and thine old age shall be made happy by my care.|$|R
