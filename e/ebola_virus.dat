Filoviruses are filament-like viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever, and include ebolaviruses and marburgviruses. Marburg virus, first discovered in 1967, attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 for an outbreak in Angola. <b>Ebola</b> <b>Virus</b> Disease has also caused intermittent outbreaks with high mortality rates since 1976 when it was first identified.

5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly <b>ebola</b> <b>virus.</b> Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} <b>Ebola</b> <b>virus</b> disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses.

Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E

He also created a website called TackleEbola.org {{as a way to}} spread awareness as well as serve as a way donors can fund projects in need. The site additionally highlights organizations working to stop Ebola that Allen supports such as International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Médecins Sans Frontières, Partners in Health, UNICEF and World Food Program USA. On April 21, 2015, Allen brought together key leaders in the Ebola fight at the Ebola Innovation Summit in San Francisco. The summit aimed to share key learnings and reinforce the need for continued action and support to bring the number of Ebola cases down to zero. As part of his ongoing commitment to end the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Paul Allen Foundation partnered with the United States Department of State and MRIGlobal to develop a new first of its kind medevac biocontainment units.

40|$|A {{panel of}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MAbs) against VP 35, VP 40 and NP viral proteins of Marburg and <b>Ebola</b> <b>viruses,</b> {{as well as}} recombinant VP 35, VP 40 and NP proteins were generated and tested for their capacity to specific immune reactions. Monoclonal antibodies to appropriate viral proteins effectively recognized the VP 35, VP 40 and NP recombinant proteins, thus allowing to develop a variant of a MAb-based ELISA analysis with different types of biotin-labeled MAbs, using these antibodies for capturing viral and recombinant antigens of Marburg and <b>Ebola</b> <b>viruses.</b> These techniques were able to detect viral and recombinant proteins in a concentration range between 1 and 150 ng/ml.
