5000|$|Extension <b>Grip</b> <b>Collars</b> are collars with indents {{that fit}} {{on the back of}} most {{extensions}} preventing it from easily rolling away and allow one to easily grip extension and finger tighten or loosen nuts and bolts by turning extension + socket with or without ratchet.|$|R
60|$|The Carrier set his <b>grip</b> {{upon the}} <b>collar</b> of the toy merchant, and shook {{him like a}} reed.|$|R
60|$|The {{next minute}} the man {{lay in the}} dory, dragged over the stern by Netty's <b>grip</b> on his <b>collar.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "'No you don't, my lily-white.' And I took {{a tighter}} <b>grip</b> on his <b>collar.</b> 'No bouncers in mine, understand! I'll go along.'" ...|$|R
60|$|She came {{none too}} soon. One dog rolled before him, well-nigh slashed in half; but a second had {{him by the}} thigh, a third <b>gripped</b> his <b>collar</b> behind, and a fourth had the blade of the sword between its teeth, tasting its own blood. He parried the leap of a fifth with his left arm.|$|R
60|$|Bob {{offered to}} help hold the unruly monkey, and, when he and Toby had taken a firm <b>grip</b> on the <b>collar,</b> the music was started again, and Ben recommenced his performance.|$|R
60|$|The painter hurled himself upon him, and, {{with a quick}} <b>grip</b> {{upon his}} <b>collar,</b> gave him half a dozen flat-handed blows {{wherever}} he could plant them and then flung him reeling away.|$|R
60|$|It was no {{time for}} pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet with a kick, and <b>gripped</b> the <b>collar</b> of the man who pulled at the slender lady's arm. He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung across his face, a third {{antagonist}} struck him between the eyes, and the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the direction from which he had come.|$|R
60|$|The criminologist made no reply. His {{eyes were}} still fixed upon the Professor, who showed some signs of {{returning}} consciousness. He was <b>gripping</b> at his <b>collar.</b> He seemed to have difficulty with his breathing. Quest suddenly braced himself. He pushed Lenora back.|$|R
60|$|He trembled--whether {{from the}} effects of {{dissipation}} or fear we cannot say--as his captor led him under the lamp, with a <b>grip</b> on the <b>collar</b> that almost choked him, but when the light fell full on his haggard face a feeling of intense pity induced the Scot to relax his hold.|$|R
60|$|In a {{state of}} utter bewilderment the {{policeman}} rushed out of the cottage, followed by his comrades and the agriculturists. Peter Pax essayed to go with them, but was restrained by an iron <b>grip</b> on his <b>collar.</b> Pulling him back, Miss Stivergill dragged her captive into a parlour and shut the door.|$|R
6000|$|M. Durand {{apparently}} was not altogether unprepared for this outburst: perhaps his peculiar position had often subjected him to similar onslaughts {{on the part}} of irate and aristocratic supplicants. Anyway, he did not seem at all disturbed, and, as soon as the Comte's <b>grip</b> on his <b>collar</b> relaxed, he readjusted his coat and his cravat, and holding out his thin hand, he said meekly: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fear of the}} {{men that}} the horse would be killed {{overpowered}} their dread of the dog, and each took a firm <b>grip</b> upon its <b>collar.</b> Then Jack placed a large pinch of snuff to its nostrils. A minute later it took effect, the iron jaws unclosed with a snap, and in an instant Bess was snatched away from the horse, which, delivered from its terrible foe, sank back groaning on the road. Bess made the most furious attempts to free herself from her captors, but in vain, and Juno strained desperately at the strap {{to come to the}} assistance of her offspring.|$|R
60|$|Running swiftly we {{were soon}} {{on the shore}} of the mill pond, having arrived without seeing or hearing {{anything}} to betoken pursuit, and believing it safe to slacken the pace that I might reserve my strength in case we were come to that pass where I must release the prisoner in order to save my own skin, I allowed the Tory cur to walk, but took good care to keep a firm <b>grip</b> on his <b>collar</b> as I mentally asked myself how {{it would be possible to}} rid myself of the prisoner with due regard to safety.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Where in {{the name}} of lifelong ruin are you to find Four Hundred?'" [...] Miss Cookham had mockingly {{repeated}} after him while he gasped as from the twist of her <b>grip</b> on his <b>collar.</b> [...] "That's your look-out, and I should have thought you'd have made sure you knew before you decided on your base perfidy." [...] And then she had mouthed and minced, with ever so false a gentility, her consistent, her sickening conclusion. [...] "Of course--I may mention again--if you too distinctly object to the trouble of looking, you know where to find me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I got him!" [...] {{observed}} the loafer.-There {{is a time}} for all things. This was essentially not the time for anyone of the male sex to <b>grip</b> the <b>collar</b> of Archie's coat. If a syndicate of Dempsey, Carpentier, and one of the Zoo gorillas had endeavoured to stay his progress at that moment, they would have had reason to consider it a rash move. Archie wanted to be elsewhere, and the blood of generations of Moffams, many of whom had swung a wicked axe in the free-for-all mix-ups of the Middle Ages, boiled within him at any attempt to revise his plans. There was {{a good deal of the}} loafer, but it was all soft. Releasing his hold when Archie's heel took him shrewdly on the shin, he received a nasty punch in what would have been the middle of his waistcoat if he had worn one, uttered a gurgling bleat like a wounded sheep, and collapsed against the wall. Archie, with a torn coat, rounded the corner, and sprinted down Ninth Avenue.|$|R
6000|$|The servant retires. MORE {{still stands}} {{looking down at}} the [...] dining-table; then putting his hand to his throat, as if to free [...] it from the <b>grip</b> of his <b>collar,</b> he pours out a glass of water, [...] and drinks it of. In the street, outside the bay window, two [...] street musicians, a harp and a violin, have taken up their [...] stand, and after some twangs and scrapes, break into music. [...] MORE goes towards the sound, and draws aside one curtain. After [...] a moment, he returns to the table, and takes up the notes of the [...] speech. He is in an agony of indecision.|$|R
6000|$|I say [...] "soused": for I {{confess that}} the shock belied {{the promise of}} our easy descent. The Lunardi floated: but it also drove before the wind. And as it dragged the car after it like a tilted pail, the four drenched and blinded aÃ«ronauts {{struggled}} through the spray and gripped the hoop, the netting--nay, dug their nails into the oiled silk. In its new element the machine became inspired with a sudden infernal malice. It sank like a pillow if we tried to climb it: it rolled us over in the brine; it allowed us no moment for a backward glance. I spied a small cutter-rigged craft tacking towards us, a mile and more to leeward, and wondered if {{the captain of the}} brig had left our rescue to it. He had not. I heard a shout behind us; a rattle of oars as the bowmen shipped them; and a hand <b>gripped</b> my <b>collar.</b> So one by one we were plucked--uncommon specimens!--from the deep; rescued from what Mr. Sheepshanks a minute later, as he sat on a thwart and wiped his spectacles, justly termed [...] "a predicament, sir, as disconcerting as any my experience supplies." ...|$|R
5000|$|In particular, the Kildare {{county of}} Ireland {{was known for}} {{excellent}} Collar-and-Elbow wrestlings of the jacket style. The rules then being to start in the namesake grip, with one hand <b>gripping</b> the opponent's <b>collar</b> firmly, the other gripping the opponent's sleeve by the elbow tightly. Once the wrestlers are informed to wrestle, it usually becomes a contest of pulling the other off balance, then employing various sweeping, tripping or throwing techniques. The focus being to put the opponent [...] "grass down" [...] on their back, with either both shoulders and one hip hitting the ground or two hips and one shoulder for [...] "3 points" [...] or both shoulders and hips hitting the ground for [...] "4 points". Scufflers of this method of Collar-and-elbow often rivaled in competitions with the Devon and Cornish Wrestlers.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Rusper laid {{one hand}} on the bicycle handle, and the other <b>gripped</b> Mr. Polly's <b>collar</b> urgently. Whereupon Mr. Polly said: [...] "Leggo!" [...] and again, [...] "D'you hear! Leggo!" [...] and then drove his elbow with {{considerable}} force into the region of Mr. Rusper's midriff. Whereupon Mr. Rusper, with a loud impassioned cry, resembling [...] "Woo kik" [...] more than any other combination of letters, released the bicycle handle, seized Mr. Polly by the cap and hair and bore his head and shoulders downward. Thereat Mr. Polly, emitting such words as everyone knows and nobody prints, butted his utmost into the concavity of Mr. Rusper, entwined a leg about him and after terrific moments of swaying instability, fell headlong beneath him amidst the bicycles and pails. There on the pavement these inexpert children of a pacific age, untrained in arms and uninured to violence, abandoned themselves to amateurish and absurd efforts to hurt and injure one another--of which the most palpable consequences were dusty backs, ruffled hair and torn and twisted collars. Mr. Polly, by accident, got his finger into Mr. Rusper's mouth, and strove earnestly for some time to prolong that aperture in the direction of Mr. Rusper's ear before it occurred to Mr. Rusper to bite him (and even then he didn't bite very hard), while Mr. Rusper concentrated his mind almost entirely on an effort to rub Mr. Polly's face on the pavement. (And their positions bristled with chances of the deadliest sort!) They didn't from first to last draw blood.|$|R
60|$|In 1845, when I was {{ten years}} old, there was an {{epidemic}} of measles in the town and it made a most alarming slaughter among the little people. There was a funeral almost daily, and the mothers of the town were nearly demented with fright. My mother was greatly troubled. She worried over Pamela and Henry and me, and took constant and extraordinary pains {{to keep us from}} coming into contact with the contagion. But upon reflection I believed that her judgment was at fault. It seemed to me that I could improve upon it if left to my own devices. I cannot remember now whether I was frightened about the measles or not, but I clearly remember that I grew very tired of the suspense I suffered on account of being continually under the threat of death. I remember that I got so weary of it and so anxious to have the matter settled one way or the other, and promptly, that this anxiety spoiled my days and my nights. I had no pleasure in them. I made up my mind to end this suspense and be done with it. Will Bowen was dangerously ill with the measles and I thought I would go down there and catch them. I entered the house by the front way and slipped along through rooms and halls, keeping sharp watch against discovery, and at last I reached Will's bed-chamber {{in the rear of the}} house on the second floor and got into it uncaptured. But that was as far as my victory reached. His mother caught me there a moment later and snatched me out of the house and gave me a most competent scolding and drove me away. She was so scared that she could hardly get her words out, and her face was white. I saw that I must manage better next time, and I did. I hung about the lane at the rear of the house and watched through cracks in the fence until I was convinced that the conditions were favorable; then I slipped through the back yard and up the back way and got into the room and into the bed with Will Bowen without being observed. I don't know how long I was in the bed. I only remember that Will Bowen, as society, had no value for me, for he was too sick to even notice that I was there. When I heard his mother coming I covered up my head, but that device was a failure. It was dead summer-time--the cover was nothing more than a limp blanket or sheet, and anybody could see that there were two of us under it. It didn't remain two very long. Mrs. Bowen snatched me out of the bed and conducted me home herself, with a <b>grip</b> on my <b>collar</b> which she never loosened until she delivered me into my mother's hands along with her opinion of that kind of a boy.|$|R
