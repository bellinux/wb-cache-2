The system would rely on signals from an earthquake detected {{at a nearby}} site, and transmit an alarm to affected areas at a further distance before strong <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> arrives. This kind of idea for front alarming already existed in the nineteenth century, and was presented by J. D. Cooper in San Francisco in 1868. However, the idea could not be implemented due to technical limitations at that time (Nakamura and Tucker 1988). Late in the twentieth century, dedicated on-site real-time monitoring systems were developed for specific facilities to detect an event and take necessary actions before strong shaking arrives. Research and development into how to forecast strong <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> at <b>a</b> given site has been carried out, independent of the big network installation and prediction research in Japan.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe present {{observations}} of ground accelerations recorded {{at a small}} array close to the fault during the Düzce earthquake and its early aftershocks. The records show the strong spatial variability of ground acceleration over distances {{of only a few}} hundred metres. During the main shock, the peak horizontal acceleration values ranged from 0. 3 to about 1. 0 g at stations distant of 1. 5 km only. We attribute this spatial variability to a fault zone site effect as peak ground acceleration steadily increases as the distance to the fault trace decreases. The spectral ratio between the ground motion recorded near the fault and the one outside the fault zone shows a shift of the spectral peak to lower frequencies with increasing peak accelerations. Such an observation suggests a non-linear behaviour of the fault zone due to the strong <b>ground</b> <b>shaking.</b> <b>As</b> much as a 45 per cent reduction in the shear wave velocity is necessary for the observed shifts.

40|$|Microzonation is {{an effort}} to {{evaluate}} and map potential hazards found in an area, urban area in particular, that could be induced by strong <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> during <b>an</b> earthquake. These hazards include: ground motion amplification, liquefaction, and slope failure. The microzonation maps, depicting ground-motion amplification, liquefaction, and landslide potentials, can be produced if the ground motion on bedrock (input) and the site conditions are known. These maps, in combi-nation with ground-motion hazard maps (on bedrock), can be used to develop a variety of hazard mitigation strategies such as seismic risk assessment, emergency response and preparedness, and land-use planning. However, these maps have certain limitations that result from the nature of regional mapping, data limitations, generalization, and computer modeling.

40|$|Records and {{analyses}} have shown that, apart from soil stratigraphy, the geomorphic conditions (such as those characterising an alluvial valley) tend {{to modify the}} amplitude, the frequency content, the duration, and the spatial variability of seismic <b>ground</b> <b>shaking.</b> <b>As</b> most of the related records and studies to date refer to weak motions (and thereby to linear soil response), the question that has been raised is whether and by how much the unavoidably nonlinear soil behaviour during strong shaking may reduce the unavoidable ""valley amplification"" effects. The paper aims at shedding some light on this important issue by analysing numerically {{the effects of the}} sub-surface geomorphic conditions of a valley on its ground surface seismic motion, with emphasis on the influence of soil nonlinearity. Two-dimensional linear and equivalent-linear ground response analyses are performed to study an alluvial valley in Japan, the behaviour of which had been monitored during many earthquakes in the early 1980 's. Then, using the geometry of this valley as a basis, a parametric investigation is performed on the effects of potential soil nonlinearity arising from the increased intensity of base excitation and/or decreased ""plasticity'"" index* of the clayey soil material.

40|$|As part {{of early}} design studies for the {{potential}} Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, the authors have performed a preliminary probabilistic seismic hazard analysis of <b>ground</b> <b>shaking.</b> <b>A</b> total of 88 Quaternary faults within 100 km of the site were considered in the hazard analysis. They were characterized {{in terms of their}} probability o being seismogenic, and their geometry, maximum earthquake magnitude, recurrence model, and slip rate. Individual faults were characterized by maximum earthquakes that ranged from moment magnitude (M{sub w}) 5. 1 to 7. 6. Fault slip rates ranged from a very low 0. 00001 mm/yr to as much as 4 mm/yr. An areal source zone representing background earthquakes up to M{sub w} 6 1 / 4 = 1 / 4 was also included in the analysis. Recurrence for these background events was based on the 1904 [...] 1994 historical record, which contains events up to M{sub w} 5. 6. Based on this analysis, the peak horizontal rock accelerations are 0. 16, 0. 21, 0. 28, and 0. 50 g for return periods of 500, 1, 000, 2, 000, and 10, 000 years, respectively. In general, the dominant contributor to the <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> hazard at Yucca Mountain are background earthquakes because of the low slip rates of the Basin and Range faults. A significant effect on the probabilistic ground motions is due to the inclusion of a new attenuation relation developed specifically for earthquakes in extensional tectonic regimes. This relation gives significantly lower peak accelerations than five other predominantly California-based relations used in the analysis, possibly due to the lower stress drops of extensional earthquakes compared to California events. Because Las Vegas is located within the same tectonic regime as Yucca Mountain, the seismic sources and path and site factors affecting the seismic hazard at Yucca Mountain also have implications to Las Vegas. These implications are discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{building}} damage due {{to strong}} earthquake ground motions {{is a difficult}} endeavor. Various earthquake intensity scales, such as the field survey-based Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale and the instrument-based Instrumental Modified Mercalli Intensity (Imm) scale, are {{used to describe the}} strength of <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> during <b>an</b> earthquake. If ground motion recording stations are available in the affected area, the current approach employed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to estimate the shaking intensity is the automated Imm approach, in which the peak values of ground acceleration and ground velocity are used. As rapid as it is, this instrument-only based approach does not account for the characteristics of buildings and, therefore, may not provide useful information about the damage state of the built environment following an earthquake. ^ Studies have shown that this method cannot estimate the degree of building damage accurately. The inaccuracy can be attributed mainly to the following: (1) <b>ground</b> <b>shaking</b> intensity is <b>an</b> ambiguous representation of building damage, and (2) structural damage does not depend solely on the ground motion but also on how the structure interacts with <b>ground</b> <b>shaking,</b> which depends on the characteristics of the buildings. ^ This research focuses on finding reliable building damage indicators using the inspection records of 104, 025 buildings surveyed {{in the aftermath of the}} 17 January 1994 Northridge, California earthquake and publicly available ground motion records from that earthquake. In this study, damage is represented using damage severity levels as prescribed by the inspectors. Each structure is associated with the ground motion parameters obtained from the closest ground motion recording station or the closest geographic grid point provided by the USGS.

A critical evaluation of parameters that have strong influence on building damage is provided. The impact of distance to recording station on observed correlations is also presented. ...|$|R

If an alarm can be issued seconds before the onset of the strong ground motions, automatic emergency actions can be initiated such as slowing down high speed trains or shutting down computers or gas distribution, for instance (Goltz 2002). EEW systems are of two main types, regional and on-site. The former uses a dense network of seismic stations to locate the earthquake, determine its magnitude, and estimate the ground motion at given sites of interest. The latter uses the observations at a single sensor to estimate the ensuing ground motion at the same site (Kanamori 2005). While regional systems work more accurately, they need more time to estimate earthquake source parameters. ...|$|R
