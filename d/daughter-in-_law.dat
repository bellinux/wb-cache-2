60|$|Although I {{have very}} little doubt that Sam would dutifully comply with these {{injunctions}} {{in a case of}} extreme necessity, and that he would do so with perfect composure and coolness, I do not apprehend things will ever come to that pass, as the old gentleman seems perfectly happy in the society of his son, his pretty <b>daughter-in-</b> <b>law,</b> and his grandchildren, and has solemnly announced his determination to 'take arter the old 'un in all respects;' from which I infer that it is his intention to regulate his conduct by the model of Mr. Pickwick, who will certainly set him the example of a single life.|$|E
60|$|She {{was evidently}} the {{absolute}} {{head of the}} family. Her <b>daughter-in-</b> <b>law</b> was a delicate little creature, who scarcely seemed able to bear {{the noise of the}} family at the long supper-table, when all talked with shrill French voices, from the two youths and their abbe tutor down to the little four-year-old Lolotte in her high chair. But to Anne, after the tedious formality of the second table at the palace, stiff without refinement, this free family life was perfectly delightful and refreshing, though as yet she was too much cramped, as it were, by long stiffness, silence, and treatment as an inferior to join, except by the intelligent dancing of her brown eyes, and replies when directly addressed.|$|E
60|$|Gradually, however, my new {{deference}} to his wishes, {{the effect of}} that patience which was born of my pity for him, won upon his affection, {{and he began to}} please himself with the endeavour to make me fill any brother's place as fully as my feebler personality would admit. I saw that the prospect which by and by presented itself of my becoming Bertha's husband was welcome to him, and he even contemplated in my case what he had not intended in my brother's--that his son and <b>daughter-in-</b> <b>law</b> should make one household with him. My softened feelings towards my father made this the happiest time I had known since childhood;--these last months in which I retained the delicious illusion of loving Bertha, of longing and doubting and hoping that she might love me. She behaved with a certain new consciousness and distance towards me after my brother's death; and I too was under a double constraint--that of delicacy towards my brother's memory and of anxiety as to the impression my abrupt words had left on her mind. But the additional screen this mutual reserve erected between us only brought me more completely under her power: no matter how empty the adytum, so that the veil be thick enough. So absolute is our soul's need of something hidden and uncertain for the maintenance of that doubt and hope and effort which are the breath of its life, that if the whole future were laid bare to us beyond to-day, the interest of all mankind would be bent on the hours that lie between; we should pant after the uncertainties of our one morning and our one afternoon; we should rush fiercely to the Exchange for our last possibility of speculation, of success, of disappointment: we should have a glut of political prophets foretelling a crisis or a no-crisis within the only twenty-four hours left open to prophecy. Conceive the condition of the human mind if all propositions whatsoever were self-evident except one, which was to become self-evident at the close of a summer's day, but in the meantime might be the subject of question, of hypothesis, of debate. Art and philosophy, literature and science, would fasten like bees on that one proposition which had the honey of probability in it, and be the more eager because their enjoyment would end with sunset. Our impulses, our spiritual activities, no more adjust themselves to the idea of their future nullity, than the beating of our heart, or the irritability of our muscles.|$|E
60|$|With this kingly countenance, and {{ourselves}} squatted on the ground, we heard several songs {{from one side}} or the other. Then royalty and its guards withdrew, and Queen Victoria's son and <b>daughter-in-</b> <b>law</b> were summoned by acclamation to the vacant throne. Our pride was perhaps a little modified when we were joined on our high places by a certain thriftless loafer of a white; and yet I was glad too, for the man had a smattering of native, and could give me some idea of the subject of the songs. One was patriotic, and dared Tembinok' of Apemama, the terror of the group, to an invasion. One mixed the planting of taro and the harvest-home. Some were historical, and commemorated kings and the illustrious chances of their time, such as a bout of drinking or a war. One, at least, was a drama of domestic interest, excellently played by the troop from Makin. It told {{the story of a man}} who has lost his wife, at first bewails her loss, then seeks another: the earlier strains (or acts) are played exclusively by men; but towards the end a woman appears, who has just lost her husband; and I suppose the pair console each other, for the finale seemed of happy omen. Of some of the songs my informant told me briefly they were 'like about the weemen'; this I could have guessed myself. Each side (I should have said) was strengthened by one or two women. They were all soloists, did not very often join in the performance, but stood disengaged at the back part of the stage, and looked (in ridi, necklace, and dressed hair) for all the world like European ballet- dancers. When the song was anyway broad these ladies came particularly to the front; and it was singular to see that, after each entry, the premiere danseuse pretended to be overcome by shame, as though led on beyond what she had meant, and her male assistants made a feint of driving her away like one who had disgraced herself. Similar affectations accompany certain truly obscene dances of Samoa, where they are very well in place. Here it was different. The words, perhaps, in this free-spoken world, were gross enough to make a carter blush; and the most suggestive feature was this feint of shame. For such parts the women showed some disposition; they were pert, they were neat, they were acrobatic, they were at times really amusing, and some of them were pretty. But this is not the artist's field; there is the whole width of heaven between such capering and ogling, and the strange rhythmic gestures, and strange, rapturous, frenzied faces with which the best of the male dancers held us spellbound through a Gilbert Island ballet.|$|E

40|$|The {{university}} curriculum includes {{literature as}} the compulsory subject {{for the students}} of English Department of Muhammadiyah University of Malang. However, there are many students who have problems in analyzing literary works such as prose, drama, and poetry which need deep thinking and challenging intelligence. These problems motivate the writer to conduct {{a study on the}} novel” Evening Street”. Literature reflects about life, thought, feeling, behavior and attitude of human being. Literature helps us understand human sentiment, human interests, and human problems. ’ Evening Street’ is a kind novel that the story is in sequence and easy to understand. Besides, the problems that are faced by the main characters could make the research interesting to analyze. The three major purposes considered being the main problems in analyzing the Victoria Andrews’ suffering are to know what Victoria’s suffering are, to know the causes of her suffering, and to know what lessons can be taken from her suffering. The study used descriptive qualitative design to analyze the data. The approach that was suitable with this analysis was objective approach because this research did not study the author’s life. Merely, the research emphasized on the novel’s physical content that is the quotations of the dialogue and explained the meaning of the quotation in an objective way. The object of this study was the novel” Evening Street” by Katrina Johnson. The results of this study show that Victoria gets suffered when she experiences many difficulties in life. The first mental suffering is related to Victoria’s father death. The second, the essential problems come from her mother in law who did not respect Victoria. The Second is Victoria Physical Suffering, that is, when she became sick, and other Victoria went away from her house. Furthermore, the causes of Victoria suffering are Victoria’s unhappy life experience in” Evening Street”, there was a conflict between Victoria and her social environment (husband and mother in law), and related to Victoria’s physical suffering. Another cause is Fred’s refusal to Victoria. The last cause is Victoria’s experience when Fred’s mother did not warmly welcome her as a <b>daughter-in-</b> <b>law.</b> ...|$|E
