25|$|The {{increasingly}} complex foreign trade system underwent expansion and decentralization {{in the late}} 1970s and 1980s. In 1979 the Ministry of Foreign Trade's nine foreign trade corporations lost their monopoly on import and <b>export</b> <b>transactions</b> as the industrial ministries were permitted to establish their own foreign trade enterprises. The provincial branch corporations of the state foreign trade corporations were granted more autonomy, and some provinces, notably Fujian, Guangdong, and the special municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai were permitted to set up independent, provincial-level import-export companies. Some selected provincial enterprises were granted autonomy in foreign trade decisions. In 1982 the State Council's Import-Export Control Commission, Foreign Investment and Control Commission, Ministry of Foreign Trade, and Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations were merged to form the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. In 1984 the foreign trade system underwent further decentralization. Foreign trade corporations under this and other ministries and under provincial-level units became independent of their parent organizations and were {{responsible for their own}} profits and losses. An agency system for foreign trade also was established, in which imports and exports were handled by specialized enterprises and corporations acting as agents on a commission basis.|$|E

Although nominally supervised by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade each of these corporations was responsible for its own profits and losses. Included among these enterprises, for example, was the Great Wall Industrial Corporation, which imported and exported transportation vehicles, satellites and other products associated with aerospace programs, mechanical equipment, electrical products, hardware and tools, medical apparatus, and chemicals. China Northern Industrial Corporation, subordinate to the Ministry of Ordnance Industry, used military production facilities to manufacture civilian products for export. The business activities of China Northern Industrial Corporation included the sale of heavy machinery, hardware and tools, and heavy-duty vehicles; light chemical industry products, such as plastic, paints, and coatings; and high-precision machinery and optical and optical-electronic equipment. Other corporations offered a variety of professional consulting services. One of these, the China International Economic Consultants Corporation, provided economic and legal expertise on investment and other economic activities.|$|E

40|$|Exploring {{the link}} between trade {{facilitation}} and the extensive and intensive margins of trade, the paper has two aims. The first and main objective is to investigate whether the extensive margin of trade in homogeneous and differentiated goods is affected {{in the same way}} by cross-border trade transaction costs. The second objective is to compare the implications for the extensive and intensive margins to ascertain the margin at which these transaction costs matter the most, again controlling for the type of goods being traded. Very detailed mirror data on imports to EU countries from developing countries in 2005 is utilized to decompose these countries’ exports into its extensive and intensive margins. Using the number of days needed to export a good as a proxy for trade transaction costs, econometric evidence is found that there is a significant and negative association between <b>export</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and the extensive margin for differentiated goods: developing countries with high <b>transaction</b> costs will <b>export</b> significantly fewer differentiated goods. However, no such negative effect on the extensive margin is found for homogeneous goods. Comparing the two margins’ effects, evidence is found that, for differentiated goods, the extensive margin is more negatively affected by <b>export</b> <b>transaction</b> costs than the intensive margin. Results also indicate that to the extent that there is an overall negative trade effect on homogeneous goods from <b>export</b> <b>transaction</b> costs, this negative effect stems from effects on the intensive margin.

In Export Credit Insurance and Trade Promotion, we present a theoretical model showing the competitiveness of OA terms in international trade, and the risk-reducing as well as export-enhancing role played by export credit insurance programs. Our theoretical analysis shows that, when exporters are risk averse, these programs are always effective without breaking the legal and financial obligations. Using Chinese export and insurance data, both static and dynamic models show a positive and statistically significant export-promoting effect of export credit insurance in China. The insurance effect across income groups also suggests the success of export credit insurance in diversifying export destinations. ...|$|R

The situations have occurred during internal transmission constraints under the following conditions: 1. The market participant (MP) is exporting power (this issue does not apply to imports because negative CMSC is offset by intertie offer guarantees). 2. The net interchange schedule limit (NISL) was binding in the market schedule. 3. The transactions did not, in whole or in part, result in the physical flow of power (i. e. the <b>export</b> <b>transaction</b> was constrained off). 4.

Findings unveil how the cornerstone of designation of origin firms is closely conjugated with the market regulator and is heavily influenced by the ‘heredity’ factor of the firms’ size. In addition, the Private Label (PL) component is a crucial element of the <b>export</b> <b>transaction.</b> Similarly, despite the fact that PDO is the main vehicle for economic growth, firms suffer from a ‘retrogressive nature’ in terms of export development, as the State’s institutional intervention discourages internationalisation.
