40|$|Cost Sharing or {{matching}} is {{the funding}} or costs contributed or allocated to a sponsored project or program not {{borne by the}} sponsor. Cost sharing can be required by law, regulation or administrative decision of a Federal agency or other sponsor. Cost sharing requirements vary by sponsor and between grants from the same sponsor. Funding agencies believe that cost sharing reflects: a grantee’s interest in or commitment to the sponsored research or, the potential benefits derived by the grantee beyond the reimbursable costs on the grant. Generally, cost sharing is applicable to grants and cooperative agreements but not usually to contracts on the Federal level. This is because grants and cooperative agreements represent financial assistance rather than the acquisition {{of goods and services}} required by contracts. In short, a proper system of <b>internal</b> financial <b>accounting</b> <b>control</b> with respect to cost sharing dictates that such costs be reasonable and necessary for the project, verifiable to the University’s financial accounting records and allowable and auditable in accordance with sponsor requirements.

The principles of good governance are not unknown to the Indian traditions. Today adoption of good corporate governance practices has emerged as an integral element for doing business.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper explores the theoretical and historical link to the structure and functioning {{of the board of directors}} with special emphasis of the norms established by the Security Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Findings – As global business interest in India keeps growing, so does the expectation that Indian companies must play – and be seen to play – by rules that are clear to international investors. Demands have long been heard for greater transparency in the way Indian companies do business. The reforms, ordained by the SEBI, are laid out in amendments to Clause 49 of the companies listing agreement with Indian stock exchanges, a section that pertains to corporate governance. Among the requirements are: more independent directors on boards and audit committees; a code of conduct for board members; a larger role for the audit committee; mandatory risk assessments and certification by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of <b>internal</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>controls.</b> Originality/value – The paper advances the understanding of board structure and performance in Indian corporate governance system by examining the norms established by the SEBI.
