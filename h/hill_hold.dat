5000|$|Hill-Holder is a {{name for}} the {{mechanism}} invented by Wagner Electric and manufactured by Bendix Brake Company in South Bend, Indiana. Studebaker and many other carmakers offered the device as either optional or standard equipment for many years. It is a device that holds the brake until the clutch is at the friction point, making it easier to start up hills from a stop in manual transmission automobiles. It was first introduced in 1936 as an option for the Studebaker President. By 1937 the device, called [...] "NoRoL" [...] by Bendix, was available on Hudson, Nash and many other cars. Another name for the mechanism is a <b>hill</b> <b>hold</b> control (HHC).|$|E
5000|$|The {{addition}} of geared, all-mechanical wheels for manual wheelchairs {{is a new}} development incorporating a hypocycloidal reduction gear into the wheel design. The 2-gear wheels {{can be added to}} a manual wheelchair. The geared wheels provide a user with additional assistance by providing leverage through gearing (like a bicycle, not a motor). The two-gear wheels offer two speed ratios- 1:1 (no help, no extra torque) and 2:1, providing 100% more hill climbing force. The low gear incorporates an automatic [...] "hill hold" [...] function which holds the wheelchair in place on a hill between pushes, but will allow the user to override the <b>hill</b> <b>hold</b> to roll the wheels backwards if needed. The low gear also provides downhill control when descending.|$|E
