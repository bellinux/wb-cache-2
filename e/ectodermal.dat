5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{composed}} of two heterogenous types of tissue. In the center is the adrenal medulla, which produces adrenaline and noradrenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, {{as part of the}} sympathetic nervous system. Surrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety of steroid hormones. These tissues come from different embryological precursors and have distinct prenatal development paths. The cortex of the adrenal gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural crest, which is of <b>ectodermal</b> origin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ectodermal</b> {{dysplasia}} describes {{abnormalities of}} structures {{derived from the}} embryonic ectoderm. These abnormalities affect both the superficial <b>ectodermal</b> layer, {{as well as the}} mesectodermal layer constituted by the neural crest.|$|E
25|$|Derived from <b>ectodermal</b> tissue.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ectodermal</b> {{dysplasia}} {{is characterized}} by absent sweat glands resulting in dry (hypohydrotic), often scale-like skin, sparse and usually coarse scalp hair that is often blonde, sparse eyebrows and eyelashes, and small brittle nails. In addition, abnormalities of <b>ectodermal</b> derivatives, neuroectodermal derivatives, and mesectodermal derivatives are often found. The <b>ectodermal</b> derivative abnormalities can affect the epidermis including mammary, pituitary and sweat glands, as well as hairs, dental enamel, nails, lens, and the internal ear. Neuroectodermal derivatives that can be affected include sensory placodes, cutaneous pigmental cells, and hair buds. Mesectodermal derivatives affected can include the dermis, hypodermis, dentin, head muscles and conjunctival cells, cervicofacial vascular endothelial cells, {{and part of the}} maxillofacial skeleton.|$|E
25|$|There is much {{discrepancy}} {{in the literature}} regarding {{the exact nature of}} the facial clefting involved in EEC. Some authors claim that the clefting involved in EEC is always cleft lip +/- palate and use this marker as a means of distinguishing EEC from other syndromes, such as AEC syndrome (ankyloblepharon, <b>ectodermal</b> dysplasia, and clefting) in which other types of clefting are found. Other authors include cleft palate only (CPO) in conjunction with ectrodactyly and <b>ectodermal</b> dysplasia as sufficient for a diagnosis of EEC.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ectodermal</b> {{dysplasia}} {{associated with}} EEC syndrome arises from abnormalities in the embryonic ectoderm, as described above. Very early in embryonic development, the {{embryonic stem cells}} differentiate into three types of cells: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. It is from these three types of cells that all body organs originate. In general terms, <b>ectodermal</b> cells generate the skin, spinal cord, and teeth (as well as the numerous derivatives mentioned above). Mesodermal cells generate blood vessels, muscle and bone, and endodermal cells generate the lungs, the digestive system and the urinary system.|$|E
25|$|The hypohydrotic {{symptoms}} of <b>ectodermal</b> dysplasia described above are evidenced {{not only in}} the skin of affected individuals, but also in their phonation and voice production. Because the vocal folds may not be as hydrated as is necessary during the adduction phase of vocal fold vibration (due to lack of lubrication), a complete seal may not be accomplished between the folds and mucosal wave movement may be disrupted. This results in air escapement between the folds and the production of breathy voice, which often accompanies the skin abnormalities of <b>ectodermal</b> dysplasia.|$|E
25|$|Grafting {{experiments}} done in Xenopus {{and chicken}} embryos show the neural plate's capability to induce {{other regions of}} cells, including the pre-placodal region, a group of <b>ectodermal</b> cells essential to the function of sensory organs.|$|E
25|$|People with Naegeli–Franceschetti–Jadassohn {{syndrome}} and dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis, which are both forms of <b>ectodermal</b> dysplasia, also have no fingerprints. Both of these rare genetic syndromes produce other {{signs and symptoms}} as well, such as thin, brittle hair.|$|E
25|$|Females {{possess a}} spermatheca, an <b>ectodermal</b> gland which opens into the oviduct. These serve as storage for sperm {{deposited}} by males. It contains glands which can nourish the spermatozoa {{until they can}} be released to fertilize eggs.|$|E
25|$|Most glia {{are derived}} from <b>ectodermal</b> tissue of the {{developing}} embryo, in particular the neural tube and crest. The exception is microglia, which {{are derived from}} hemopoietic stem cells. In the adult, microglia are largely a self-renewing population and are distinct from macrophages and monocytes, which infiltrate the injured and diseased CNS.|$|E
25|$|Proneural genes encode {{transcription}} {{factors of}} the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) class which {{are responsible for the}} development of neuroectodermal progenitor cells. Proneural genes have multiple functions in neural development. They integrate positional information and contribute to the specification of progenitor-cell identity. From the same <b>ectodermal</b> cell types, neural or epidermal cells can develop based on interactions between proneural and neurogenic genes.|$|E
25|$|The {{intercalary}} {{region of}} granular glands are more developed and mature {{in comparison with}} mucous glands. This region resides as a ring of cells surrounding the basal portion of the duct which are argued to have an <b>ectodermal</b> muscular nature due to their influence over the lumen (space inside the tube) of the duct with dilation and constriction functions during secretions. The cells are found radially around the duct and provide a distinct attachment site for muscle fibers around the gland's body.|$|E
25|$|In Drosophila, proneural {{genes are}} first {{expressed}} in quiescent <b>ectodermal</b> cells that have both epidermal and neuronal potential. Proneural activity {{results in the}} selection of progenitors that are committed to a neural fate but remain multipotent, with sense organ progenitors giving rise to neurons, glia and other non-neuronal cell types. Additionally, some neuroblasts of the central nervous system also generate both neurons and glia. Progenitors of the peripheral and central nervous system only begin to divide after proneural gene expression has subsided.|$|E
25|$|This {{striking}} data offers convincing {{support for}} the p63 gene hypothesis. This study is also cited in the demonstration that the growth and patterning of the underlying mesenchyme is highly dependent on the apical <b>ectodermal</b> ridge of the limbs, {{as well as the}} maxillary and mandibular branchial ectoderm that are so prominently disturbed in these mice. All of {{these findings are consistent with}} the clinical presentation of EEC in humans and may explain the association of limb malformation and clefting that are found in this syndrome.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two layers}} of mesoderm; intraembryonic and extraembryonic. As the intraembryonic layer grows laterally, it becomes {{continuous}} with the extraembryonic layer, forming the chorion (contributing to the blood supply). At the same time during embryonic development, the ectoderm begins to thicken and fold upward, forming the neural folds, which eventually meet to form the neural tube and neural crest. Because these two events occur {{at roughly the same}} time in embryological development, abnormalities found in this syndrome can involve not only the <b>ectodermal</b> cells, but also disruption to development in the mesectodermal layer constituted by the neural crest.|$|E
25|$|At four (4) {{weeks of}} gestational development, the neural crest cells (the {{precursors}} of the nose) begin their caudad migration (from the posterior) towards the midface. Two symmetrical nasal placodes (the future olfactory epithelium) develop inferiorly, which the nasal pits then divide into the medial and the lateral nasal processes (the future upper lip and nose). The medial processes then form the septum, the philtrum, and the premaxilla of the nose; the lateral processes form {{the sides of}} the nose; and the mouth forms from the stomodeum (the anterior <b>ectodermal</b> portion of the alimentary tract), which is inferior to the nasal complex.|$|E
25|$|Anodontia is a {{complete}} lack of tooth development, and hypodontia {{is a lack of}} some tooth development. Anodontia is rare, most often occurring in a condition called Hypohidrotic <b>ectodermal</b> dysplasia, while hypodontia {{is one of the most}} common developmental abnormalities, affecting 3.58.0% of the population (not including third molars). The absence of third molars is very common, occurring in 2023% of the population, followed in prevalence by the second premolar and lateral incisor. Hypodontia is often associated with the absence of a dental lamina, which is vulnerable to environmental forces, such as infection and chemotherapy medications, and is also associated with many syndromes, such as Down syndrome and Crouzon syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of the neural plate starts when dorsal mesoderm signals <b>ectodermal</b> cells above it to lengthen into columnar neural plate cells. This different shape distinguishes {{the cells of the}} presumptive neural plate from other pre-epidermal cells. If the neural plate is separated by itself, it will still develop to make a thinner plate but will not form a neural tube. If the region containing presumptive epidermis and neural plate tissue is isolated, small neural folds will form. Elongation that occurs throughout the {{formation of}} the neural plate and closure of the neural tube is vital; the closing areas of the neural tube are seen to have very increased elongation activity in the midline compared to already closed areas when the plate was beginning to shape itself into a tube.|$|E
25|$|Of the hh homologues, SHH {{has been}} found to have the most {{critical}} roles in development, acting as a morphogen involved in patterning many systems, including the limb and midline structures in the brain, spinal cord, the thalamus by the zona limitans intrathalamica the lungs, and the teeth. Mutations in the human sonic hedgehog gene, SHH, cause holoprosencephaly type 3 HPE3 {{as a result of the}} loss of the ventral midline. Sonic hedgehog is secreted at the zone of polarizing activity, which is located on the posterior side of a limb bud in an embryo. The sonic hedgehog transcription pathway has also been linked to the formation of specific kinds of cancerous tumors, including the embryonic cerebellar tumor, and medulloblastoma, as well as the progression of Prostate Cancer tumours. For SHH to be expressed in the developing embryo limbs, a morphogen called fibroblast growth factors must be secreted from the apical <b>ectodermal</b> ridge.|$|E
25|$|The proneural genes {{also have}} an {{important}} role in the development of distinct types of sensory organs, namely chordotonal organs (proprioceptorsthat detect mechanical and sound vibrations) and external sensory organs. Members of achaete-scute complex, such as achaete and scute, as well as ‘’atonal’’ and ‘’daughterless’’ confer to <b>ectodermal</b> cells the ability to become sensory mother cells (SMCs). In the development of sensory organs there are two main phases: determination and differentiation that may not be mechanistically separable. Proneural proteins are involved in both processes, through the activation of the downstream “differentiating genes” that in turn regulate the induction of sensory-organ-subtype characteristics. The specification of sensory organs by proneural genes is a complex process, since they elicit different cellular contexts. For instance, in Drosophila, atonal (ato) can promote the development of chordotonal organs, for the receptors of olfactory sense organs, depending on the imaginal disc in which it is expressed. In Drosophila’s embryogenesis, the proneural gene achaete is expressed in well-determined regions as in the endoderm, being responsible for the formation of particular sensory organs in the adult and larvae. According to Ruíz-Gomes and Ghysen (1993), this expression occurs in two distinct phases: a competent state, in which the proneural gene is expressed in a cell cluster; a determined state, in which a specific cell accumulate high levels of ‘’ac’’ transcripts, originating a neural precursor. The function of each of the ASC complex genes varies with the development state (larvae or adult). For example, in the adult state the ac and sc genes promote the differentiation of two sets of complementary sensory organs and ase gene as a minimal function, while in the larvae state ac and sc genes affect the same set of sensory organs and ase is responsible for the determination of a complementary set.|$|E
