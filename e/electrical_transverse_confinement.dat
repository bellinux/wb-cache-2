40|$|The {{performance}} of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) has improved greatly in recent years. Much of this improvement {{can be attributed}} to the use of native oxide layers within the laser structure, providing both <b>electrical</b> and optical <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement.</b> Understanding this optical confinement will be vital for the future realization of yet smaller lasers with ultralow threshold currents. Here the authors report the spectral and modal properties of small (0. 5 {micro}m to 5 {micro}m current aperture) VCSELs and identify Joule heating as a dominant effect in the resonator properties of the smallest lasers...|$|R

40|$|We {{study for}} the first time the effect of the {{geometry}} of quantum wire networks on their nonlinear optical properties and show that for some geometries, the first hyperpolarizability is largely enhanced and the second hyperpolarizability is always negative or zero. We use a one-electron model with tight <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement.</b> In the limit of infinite <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement,</b> the <b>transverse</b> wavefunctions drop out of the hyperpolarizabilities, but their residual effects are essential to include in the sum rules. The effects of geometry are manifested in the projections of the transition moments of each wire segment onto the 2 -D lab frame. Numerical optimization of the geometry of a loop leads to hyperpolarizabilities that rival the best chromophores. We suggest that a combination of geometry and quantum-confinement effects can lead to systems with ultralarge nonlinear response. Comment: To appear in J. Opt. Society of America...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of an externally pumped phase-conjugate resonator that uses four-wave mixing in BaTi 03 is investigated experimentally. The emergence of spatiotemporal instabilities as {{the degree of}} <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement</b> is varied by changing the Fresnel number is described in detail. Local intensity time series show that relaxing the <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement</b> leads the system from a stationary state to periodic, then to quasi-periodic, motions and finally to chaotic behavior. In some regions of parameter space two frequencies are identified in the power spectra of the time series, indicating a route to chaos following the Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse scheme. Wave-front topological defects are identified by interferometry. As the system's confinement is varied, the phase-defect density and the spatial correlation index are found to follow similar trends, indicating that the observed spatiotemporal dynamics may indeed {{be an example of}} defect-mediated turbulence...|$|R

40|$|By {{means of}} {{analytical}} and numerical methods, we study how the residual three-dimensionality affects dynamics of solitons in an attractive Bose-Einstein condensate loaded into a cigar-shaped trap. Based on an effective 1 D Gross-Pitaevskii equation that includes an additional quintic self-focusing term, {{generated by the}} tight <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement,</b> we find a family of exact one-soliton solutions and demonstrate stability of the entire family, despite the possibility of collapse in the 1 D equation with the quintic self-focusing nonlinearity. Simulating collisions between two solitons in the same setting, we find a critical velocity, $V_{c}$, below which merger of identical in-phase solitons is observed. Dependence of $V_{c} $ {{on the strength of}} the <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement</b> and number of atoms in the solitons is predicted by means of the perturbation theory and investigated in direct simulations. Symmetry breaking in collisions of identical solitons with a nonzero phase difference is also shown in simulations and qualitatively explained by means of an analytical approximation.

40|$|The {{connection}} between quantized vortices and dark solitons {{in a long}} and thin, waveguide-like trap geometry is explored {{in the framework of}} the non-linear Schrödinger equation. Variation of the <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement</b> leads from the quasi- 1 D regime where solitons are stable to 2 D (or 3 D) confinement where soliton stripes are subject to a transverse modulational instability known as the "snake instability". We present numerical evidence of a regime of intermediate confinement where solitons decay into single, deformed vortices with solitonic properties, also called svortices, rather than vortex pairs as associated with the "snake" metaphor. Further relaxing the <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement</b> leads to production of 2 and then 3 vortices, which correlates perfectly with a Bogoliubov-de Gennes stability analysis. The decay of a stationary dark soliton (or, planar node) into a single svortex is predicted to be experimentally observable in a 3 D harmonically confined dilute gas Bose-Einstein condensate.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents the}} implementation in OpenSees of an integration procedure {{based on a}} recently developed theory concerning stress integration along the chords of a shell element reinforced with uniaxial transverse links. Such a model has been developed in order to account for <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement</b> effects induced by through-the-thickness jacketing of masonry and reinforced concrete existing structures. In particular, <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement</b> induces a triaxial stress state in the core material of the shell increasing the stress spherical part and resulting in strength and ductility increments. In order to perform structural analyses with reduced computational costs, the presented tool permits to compute the response of plane elements confined by uniaxial devices. To this end, the implemented object accounts for the mutual interaction of uniaxial reinforcements with a triaxial core by means of equilibrium and compatibility equations involving several object classes of the OpenSees framework. Integration of the triaxial stress state along the thickness of a shell element is therefore performed by numerically solving the equilibrium/compatibility equation system. The adopted implementation strategy is summarized and modeling features are discussed. In conclusion, numerical examples show some possible applications of the proposed tool in common structural design practices...|$|R

40|$|We report {{results of}} a {{systematic}} analysis of matter-wave gap solitons (GSs) in three-dimensional self-repulsive Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) loaded into {{a combination of a}} cigar-shaped trap and axial optical-lattice (OL) potential. Basic cases of the strong, intermediate, and weak radial (<b>transverse)</b> <b>confinement</b> are considered, as well as settings with shallow and deep OL potentials. Only {{in the case of the}} shallow lattice combined with tight radial confinement, which actually has little relevance to realistic experimental conditions, does the usual one-dimensional (1 D) cubic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) furnish a sufficiently accurate description of GSs. However, the effective 1 D equation with the nonpolynomial nonlinearity, derived in Ref. [Phys. Rev. A 77, 013617 (2008) ], provides for quite an accurate approximation for the GSs in all cases, including the situation with weak <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement,</b> when the soliton's shape includes a considerable contribution from higher-order transverse modes, in addition to the usual ground-state wave function of the respective harmonic oscillator. Both fundamental GSs and their multipeak bound states are considered. The stability is analyzed by means of systematic simulations. It is concluded that almost all the fundamental GSs are stable, while their bound states may be stable if the underlying OL potential is deep enough.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} with Yb- 173 and Sr- 87 isotopes provide new possibilities to study high spin two-orbital systems. Within these experiments {{part of the}} atoms are excited to a higher energy metastable electronic state mimicking an additional internal (orbital) degree of freedom. The interaction between the atoms depends on the orbital states, therefore four different scattering channels can be identified in the system characterized by four independent couplings. When the system is confined into a one-dimensional chain the scattering lengths can be tuned by changing the <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement,</b> and driven through four resonances. Using the new available experimental data of the scattering lengths we analyze the phase diagram of the one-dimensional system as the couplings are tuned via <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement,</b> and the populations of the two orbital states are changed. We found that three orders compete showing power law decay: a state with dominant density wave fluctuations, another one with spin density fluctuations, and a third one characterized by exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-like pairs consisting one atom in the electronic ground state {{and one in the}} excited state. We also show that sufficiently close to the resonances the compressibility of the system starts to diverge indicating that the emerging order is unstable and collapses to a phase separated state with a first order phase transition...|$|R

40|$|We {{theoretically}} consider ultracold polar {{molecules in}} a wave guide. The particles are bosons, they experience a periodic potential due to an optical lattice oriented along the wave guide and are polarised by an electric field orthogonal to the guide axis. The array is mechanically unstable by opening the <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement</b> in the direction orthogonal to the polarizing electric field and can undergo a transition to a double-chain (zigzag) structure. For this geometry we derive a multi-mode generalized Bose-Hubbard model for determining the quantum phases of the gas at the mechanical instability {{taking into account the}} quantum fluctuations in all directions of space. Our model limits the dimension of the numerically relevant Hilbert subspace by means of an appropriate decomposition of the field operator, which is obtained from a field theoretical model of the linear-zigzag instability. We determine the phase diagrams of small systems using exact diagonalization and find that, even for tight <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement,</b> the aspect ratio between the two transverse trap frequencies controls not only the classical but also the quantum properties of the ground state in a non-trivial way. Convergence tests at the linear-zigzag instability demonstrate that our multi-mode generalized Bose-Hubbard model can catch the essential features of the quantum phases of dipolar gases in confined geometries with a limited computational effort.

40|$|Laser-cooled ions held in {{a linear}} Paul trap with strong <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement</b> {{organize}} into a one-dimensional (1 -D) linear crystal. If the <b>transverse</b> <b>confinement</b> is relaxed, the linear ion crystal undergoes a continuous, structural phase transition to a 2 -D zigzag configuration. We study the dynamics near the critical point of the linear-zigzag transition. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, we study the spontaneous nucleation and dynamics of topological kink defects, formed as a result of a rapid quench across the linear-zigzag transition. The experimental results are compared to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which provides an intuitive model of defect formation and predicts a power-law scaling for the number of defectsformed as a function of transition quench rate. The second part of this thesis is focused on one of the key requirements for investigations of the near-transition dynamics in the quantum regime. To achieve an efficient ground state cooling of the zigzag vibrational mode, we demonstrate 3 -D polarization-gradient cooling of strings of 1 - 4 trapped ions as an intermediate step between Doppler and sideband cooling, and study the polarization-gradient cooling rate and cooling limit as a function of the cooling beam intensity in and near the Lamb-Dicke regime.
