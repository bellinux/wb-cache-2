5|$|Renowned for his preaching, Baldwin's {{surviving}} sermons {{show that}} <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> continued after his death. His sermons were {{first published in}} 1662; the modern edition includes two more (titled de obedientia and de sancta cruce) that {{were not in the}} original publication. It appears that originally there were 33 sermons, with the others now lost. The sermons survive in 12 manuscripts, although only 5 are collections of substantial numbers of the works. None of the surviving manuscripts has a complete collection of the 22 sermons.|$|E
5|$|Sue Bea Montgomery, who {{had served}} as an {{associate}} producer on Chillicothe, also tried to interest studios in working with them, but was met with indifference. She determined {{that they would have}} to find greater success in independent filmmaking before anyone would take <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> and introduced the three to Maurice Kanbar, a successful entrepreneur who had made a minor investment in Chillicothe.|$|E
5|$|The First Afro-Asian Games {{were held}} {{after nearly two}} decades of delays, shifts and cancellations. The {{prolonged}} amount of time for these Games considerably reduced <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>them.</b> After the preliminary decision of hosting the Games, the venue was shuttled between New Delhi and Kuwait City. At the last moment, New Delhi was outfavoured by Hyderabad, which had hosted the National Games of India in 2002.|$|E

5|$|His family {{returns to}} Epcot, where {{the tension between}} Jim and Emily comes to a head after a drunk Jim vomits while on the Gran Fiesta Tour. Spotting the French girls, Emily argues with Jim about his obvious <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> and slaps Sara. Embarrassed, she returns to the hotel with Elliot, leaving Jim and Sara to ride on the Soarin' {{attraction}} at Spaceship Earth, where Jim imagines a beautiful topless woman superimposed over the ride's video footage of landscapes, who promises they will be together soon. After the ride, Sophie approaches and invites Jim to come with them. When Jim refuses, Sophie spits {{on his face and}} she walks off, Jim notices that Sara disappeared and searches frantically for her, but the park guards use a taser to knock him unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur and Edward Jenner {{were the}} first to develop {{vaccines}} to protect against viral infections. The nature of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s, when the science of virology gained momentum. In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses. There were epidemics of poliomyelitis that were only controlled following the development of a vaccine in the 1950s. HIV {{is one of the most}} pathogenic new viruses to have emerged in centuries. Although scientific <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> arose because of the diseases they cause, most viruses are beneficial. They drive evolution by transferring genes across species, play important roles in ecosystems and are essential to life.|$|E
5|$|The African crake is {{territorial}} on {{both the}} breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male threat display involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the flanks and belly like a fan to show the barred underparts. He may march towards the intruder, or walk {{side by side with}} another displaying male. The female may accompany the male, but with feathers less widely fanned. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping at each other and pecking. Paired females will attack other females in the territory, especially if the male has shown an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|Female California {{sea lions}} have a 12-month {{reproductive}} cycle, {{consisting of a}} 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for sea lions off California and more than 30 days for sea lions in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups on shore for 10 days and nurse them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups {{for up to a}} day. Pups left on shore tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup can distinguish each other's calls from those of other mothers and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on the efforts of the mothers. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they do take more <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year.|$|E

25|$|To {{begin with}} {{cognitive}} responses in infidelity, individuals {{whom have been}} cheated on experience jealousy cognitively for many reasons. They may feel that their partner has lost <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> and feel that they cannot compare to the persons with whom they are being cheated on with (Johnson, 2017). Therefore, they anticipate {{the loss of their}} partner's emotional <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> and become jealous for more clear reasons. They could believe that they are losing someone who they care deeply about, or they may feel as if their partner is mad at them and doing it out of spite, etc. The anticipation of jealous feelings towards an individualâ€™s significant other causes a cognitive response, even without the burden of proof.|$|E

25|$|Examples of fullerenes {{in popular}} culture are numerous.

25|$|Opening acts for {{the band}} {{included}} the bands Free, Taste and an R rock act called Delaney & Bonnie. Because Clapton liked the soulful, folksy-sounding blues of Delaney & Bonnie, he began spending {{most of his time}} with them instead of Blind Faith, letting Winwood take a more prominent role in the band. Clapton even began sitting in on their opening sets, sometimes simply playing percussion, and showing more <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> than his own band. Baker has since said it was obvious that Clapton was going to leave the band as soon as the tour was over.|$|E

Donahey liked very much the Mother Goose rhymes and took an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>them.</b> He not only illustrated children's cartoons but then started illustrating Mother Goose rhymes as well. Soon he refined his writing skills and composed his own poems and stories.|$|E

He is also a Los Angeles Clippers season ticket holder and, due to the NBA lockout, the Los Angeles Kings.

25|$|Henrik Lundqvist grew up {{with his}} {{identical}} twin brother Joel in Ã…re, JÃ¤mtland, an area where alpine skiing {{is the most popular}} winter activity, though Henrik and Joel chose to play ice hockey over the more popular winter sports. During the winters, their kindergarten teachers used the kindergarten's 9meters3meters (30ft10ft) sandpit to freeze an outdoor ice rink where the twins would frequently skate. Their interest in hockey grew even stronger when their father Peter took the twins to see VÃ¤stra FrÃ¶lunda HC play in Scandinavium, Gothenburg. Henrik has said that he and Joel were very competitive growing up, in sports as well as school. Peter worked for a company who sponsored FrÃ¶lunda, and Henrik and Joel saw many games in Scandinavium, where FrÃ¶lunda became their favorite team. In 1990, Henrik and Joel joined JÃ¤rpens IF and started playing organized hockey for the first time. During one practice, when the coach asked if anyone wanted to be a goaltender, Joel grabbed and raised Henrik's arm and said that his brother would like to. In 1993, the family moved to BÃ¥stad, SkÃ¥ne, in southern Sweden to support their older sister Gabriella's tennis career. Henrik and Joel then joined local team RÃ¶gle BK, and were both selected for Scania's regional team in Sverigepucken in 1995. Henrik was selected to play for Scania in TV-pucken in 1996, and in 1997, when Joel was also selected. During the 1997â€“98 season, Henrik and Joel were extensively scouted by FrÃ¶lunda, and while playing for RÃ¶gle in the 1998 Scandinavium Cup in Gothenburg, FrÃ¶lunda's junior team manager and under-16 coach Janne Karlsson contacted their father, who told Henrik and Joel about FrÃ¶lunda's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>them</b> while driving home to BÃ¥stad.|$|E
