5|$|As <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{imperial}} edicts, the Hongwu Emperor {{was well}} aware of the Buddhist link between Tibet and China and wanted to foster it. Rolpe Dorje, 4th Karmapa Lama (1340–1383) rejected the Hongwu Emperor's invitation, although he did send some disciples as envoys to the court in Nanjing. The Hongwu Emperor also entrusted his guru Zongluo, one of many Buddhist monks at court, to head a religious mission into Tibet in 1378–1382 in order to obtain Buddhist texts.|$|E
5|$|Both The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle were {{produced}} in co-operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich, Germany. The film was mostly shot at Emelka in Munich {{in the fall}} of 1925, and the film exteriors were shot on location in Obergurgl, in what is now the municipality of Sölden in the State of Tyrol in southwestern Austria, the Ötztal Alps standing in for the mountains and hollows of Kentucky. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom than he would have had in England, and influences in the technique and style of German cinema are <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early works.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and this was particularly <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> development of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally. Although not always consistent with each other, his primary concerns were eschatology, the denial of an eternal hell, Oneness Pentecostalism, predestination, eternal security and the serpent's seed. Branham asserted that his doctrinal teachings were given to him by divine revelation.|$|E

50|$|His {{influence}} of Hemingway was very <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> both <b>his</b> works and he considered A Farewell to Arms his favorite and masterpiece of Hemingway. He believed A Farewell to Arms an important milestone in American literature and rated Anna Karenina more than War and Peace.|$|R
60|$|The bar-keeper here {{interposed}} that <b>in</b> <b>his</b> larger medical {{experience he}} had found the exhibition of ginger in combination with gin attended with effect, although it was <b>evident</b> that <b>in</b> <b>his</b> business capacity he regarded Uncle Ben, as a drinker, with distrust.|$|R
5|$|The Bible {{is central}} in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and is crucial {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the Word of God (1522). He believed that man is a liar and only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only darkness of error.|$|E
5|$|Apocryphal and semi-legendary anecdotal stories {{surround}} {{the creation of}} Levski's Internal Revolutionary Organisation. Persecuted by the Ottoman authorities who offered 500 Turkish liras for his death and 1000 for his capture, Levski resorted to disguises to evade arrest during his travels. For example, he {{is known to have}} dyed his hair and to have worn a variety of national costumes. In the autumn of 1871, Levski and Angel Kanchev published the Instruction of the Workers for the Liberation of the Bulgarian People, a BRCC draft statute containing ideological, organisational and penal sections. It was sent out to the local committees and to the diasporic community for discussion. The political and organisational experience that Levski amassed is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> correspondence dating from 1871 to 1872; at the time, his views on the revolution had clearly matured.|$|E
5|$|Beiderbecke's cornet {{style is}} often {{described}} by contrasting it with Armstrong's markedly different approach. Armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument, and his solos often took advantage of that fact. Beiderbecke was largely, although not completely, self-taught, and the constraints imposed by that fact were <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> music. While Armstrong often soared into the upper register, Beiderbecke stayed in the middle range, more interested in exploring the melody and harmonies than in dazzling the audience. Armstrong often emphasized the performance aspect of his playing, while Beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing, uninterested in personally engaging his listeners. Armstrong was deeply influenced by the blues, while Beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as Debussy and Ravel as by his fellow jazzmen.|$|E
50|$|Sherlaw Johnson's {{interest}} in bells and bell-inspired music (he rang regularly at his local church at Stonesfield) is also <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> some of <b>his</b> own compositions.|$|R
50|$|French {{influence}} is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> some of <b>his</b> music, for example isorhythmic passages (characteristic of Machaut, but rare in Italian music). Some of the notational quirks <b>in</b> <b>his</b> work also suggest {{a connection with}} France.|$|R
50|$|It is {{said that}} Andrea da Salerno was Raphael's disciple, and absorbed most of his style. This is {{particularly}} <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> one of <b>his</b> last works, Nativity.|$|R
5|$|Reid {{occupied}} high-ranking cabinet {{positions in}} Greenfield's government {{and that of}} his successor, John Edward Brownlee. Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921. In the former capacity, he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards. He also proposed a program of eugenics through the sterilisation of the mentally handicapped, which in 1928 led to the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta. As an advocate of government-wide economy, he laid off all school inspection nurses and many public health nurses. This inclination towards thrift was also <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs, in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer a greater proportion of the responsibility for caring for indigents to the province. In 1929, he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10% of the old age pensions paid to their residents.|$|E
5|$|The Angevin-Neapolitan {{influence}} of Celestine was <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first consistory, {{during which he}} created twelve cardinals, including seven Frenchmen and three (or five) Neapolitans. This {{was the first time}} in history where a single consistory had swung the College of Cardinals so decidedly in one nationalist partisan direction. The cardinals who were not French or Angevin were members of Celestine's former order. Celestine also moved to the Castel Nuovo in Naples, where he continued to live much like a hermit until he resigned, as advocated by many Roman cardinals, including Benedetto Gaetani (who, a former lawyer, suggested that Celestine first publish a decree establishing the permissibility of papal abdication.) Gaetani, elected Pope Boniface VIII following Celestine's abdication, proceeded to have Celestine imprisoned while the legality of his abdication remained a prominent subject, and Celestine died a prisoner in 1296.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, despite {{changing}} musical trends, Peerson's music {{showed significant}} roots in Renaissance polyphony. However, he was adept {{in the use}} of then-modern compositional procedures; this is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> often daring use of chromaticism, especially seen in word painting. Some of his finest music is contained in his set of 15 Latin motets, which was probably composed {{around the turn of the}} century. Existing only in a single copy, it originally consisted of five part-books but the Cantus book is lost. Richard Rastall, professor of historical musicology at the University of Leeds, spent 12 years reconstructing the missing part. The complete Latin motets have been published by Antico Edition, and a recording of their performance by Ex Cathedra entitled Peerson: Latin Motets was produced by Hyperion Records in 2005.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{said that}} Callias {{dissipated}} all his inherited wealth on sophists, flatterers, and women. These behaviours became quite <b>evident</b> early <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life {{so that he was}} commonly spoken of, before his father's death, being the [...] "evil genius" [...] of his family.|$|R

50|$|He {{generally}} avoided {{new approaches}} to painting to protect his income. Nonetheless, impressionism is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> some of <b>his</b> published works, such as Attica Shore (1894) and Panormos Seashore in Scopelos (P. Moraitis).|$|R
5|$|Vainio began {{composing}} {{actively in}} the late 1970s, although he had already published his own compositions {{at the beginning of}} the decade. His earliest compositions include Matkarakastaja and Viisari värähtää. Among his most popular songs from the late 1970s is Käyn ahon laitaa ("I Walk by the Side of a Glade") from the 1979 album of the same name. Even though Vainio had already quit drinking, he still occasionally sang about alcohol. Vainio started writing more sensitive songs, a trend which became <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> next albums. 1981's Albatrossi ja sorsa ("The Albatross and the Duck") contains one of Vainio's most well-known songs, Albatrossi. The topic of the song was lost youth. Another sensitive song on the album is Apteekin ovikello ("The Pharmacy Doorbell"), the idea for which Vainio got from Tapio Rautavaara. Other well-known songs were Panaman konsuli ("The Consul of Panama") and Kun mä rupesin ryyppäämään ("When I Started Drinking").|$|E
5|$|Virgil C Aldrich {{reviewed}} the book alongside Religion and the Modern Mind and The Gate of Silence, also by Stace {{and published in}} 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a Hume or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because {{it is difficult to}} determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.|$|E

50|$|Reni, {{like many}} of the artists in the exhibition, was also a “queer” artist, {{although}} he never suffered the prejudices that many endured. <b>His</b> sexuality is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> many of <b>his</b> pieces, which have homoerotic aspects.|$|R
50|$|Edelen's {{promise in}} the {{marathon}} was <b>evident</b> early <b>in</b> <b>his</b> career. <b>In</b> 1962, he finished 4th at the Fukuoka Marathon in an American Record time of 2:18:57, {{making him the}} first American to run under 2:20 for the marathon. He {{was also the first}} American under 30:00 for the 10,000 m run.|$|R
50|$|Cora {{explored}} non-idiomatic improvising {{and studied}} Turkish and Eastern European folk music. The influence of this folk music is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> much of <b>his</b> work. Skeleton Crew once devoted an entire concert to playing only Eastern European folk tunes.|$|R

25|$|Other {{commentators}} such as {{film critic}} Ben Zipper believe that Kiarostami's {{work as a}} landscape artist is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> compositional distant shots of the dry hills throughout {{a number of his}} films directly impacting on his construction on the rural landscapes within his films.|$|E
25|$|As {{proof of}} his {{interest}} in scripture, so <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lyrics and his prose writing, Cave wrote the foreword to a Canongate publication of the Gospel according to Mark, published in the UK in 1998. The American edition of the same book (published by Grove Press) contains a foreword by the noted American writer Barry Hannah.|$|E
50|$|Lanovoy came to {{prominence}} through playing bold, dashing characters, combining heroic bravado with a sensitivity typical of Russian heroes, a tendency <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> many of <b>his</b> early features, such as A Certificate of Maturity (1954) and Pavel Korchagin (1956).|$|R
50|$|Robbins was a {{personal}} friend of Terence McKenna, whose influence is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> several of <b>his</b> books. A main character in Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas named Larry Diamond advocates a theory {{similar to those of}} McKenna, involving psilocybin.|$|R
50|$|Howard {{had strong}} views about race, <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> both <b>his</b> works and letters. He would be {{considered}} racist by modern standards, although {{they may have been}} mainstream in the era and location in which he lived as his attitudes towards race had significantly changed over time. In contrast, Howard had feminist views despite his era and location which he espoused in both personal and professional life.|$|R
25|$|Gecan's most {{important}} works were {{produced in the}} 1920s and 1930s. By 1921 the beginnings of expressionism were <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> paintings and drawings. Miroslav Kraljević's legacy shows in the Klinik (Clinic) cycle, where cubism combined with realism and intense colour. His later work tended to be calmer, with less tension, more art deco stylization.|$|E
25|$|As a young man, Russell had {{a decidedly}} {{religious}} bent, himself, as is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early Platonism. He longed for eternal truths, {{as he makes}} clear in his famous essay, , widely regarded as a masterpiece of prose, but a work that Russell came to dislike. While he rejected the supernatural, he freely admitted that he yearned for a deeper meaning to life.|$|E
25|$|The trochaic tetrameter catalecticfour {{pairs of}} trochees per line, {{with the final}} {{syllable}} omittedwas identified by Aristotle as the original meter of tragic dialogue (Poetics 1449a21). Euripides however employs it {{here and there in}} his later plays. He seems not to have used it in his early plays at all, The Trojan Women being the earliest appearance of it in an extant play—it is symptomatic of a curious archaizing tendency <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> later works.|$|E
50|$|He is {{considered}} by literary historians {{as one of the}} major voices in Malayalam poetry who marked the transition from the Romantic to the modern era. A scientific insight into the historical roots of social evolution and {{a deeper understanding of the}} psychological undercurrents of the human mind characterise his poetry. His mastery of the medium is <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> all <b>his</b> poems both lyrical and narrative.|$|R
