25|$|Column stills are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} production of <b>grain</b> <b>whisky</b> and are the most commonly used type of still {{in the production of}} bourbon and other American whiskeys. Column stills behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40–50% alcohol, a column still can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 95.6%; an azeotropic mixture of alcohol and water.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s, Aeneas Coffey refined {{a design}} {{originally}} created by Robert Stein for continuous stills which produced whisky much {{more efficiently than}} the traditional pot stills. Quickly, merchants began blending the malt whisky with the <b>grain</b> <b>whisky</b> distilled in the continuous stills, making the first blended Scotch whisky. The blended whisky proved quite successful, less expensive to produce than malt with more flavour and character than grain. The combination allowed the single malt producers to expand their operations as the blended whisky was more popular on the international market.|$|E

50|$|<b>Grain</b> <b>whisky</b> ordinarily {{refers to}} any whisky made, {{at least in}} part, from grains other than malted barley, such as whisky made using maize (corn), wheat or rye. Grain whiskies may also contain some malted barley (and are {{required}} to if produced in Ireland or Scotland.) Whisky made from only malted barley is generally called malt whisky rather than <b>grain</b> <b>whisky.</b> Most American and Canadian whiskies are grain whiskies.|$|E
5000|$|In both countries, [...] "grain whisky" [...] is {{typically}} distilled {{in a continuous}} column still {{in a manner that}} results in a higher percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV), but a less flavorful spirit than that derived from a pot still. As a result, <b>grain</b> <b>whisky</b> is seldom bottled by itself in either country, but is instead used primarily for blending with malt or pot still whisky to create blended whiskies, which now account for over 90% of both countries' whisky sales. The comparative lightness of the clearer, more-neutral-flavored <b>grain</b> <b>whisky</b> is used in blends to smooth out the often harsher characteristics of single malts and pot still whiskeys. Occasionally well-aged grain whiskies are released as single <b>grain</b> <b>whisky</b> if made at one distillery or blended <b>grain</b> <b>whisky</b> if combining spirits from multiple distilleries. It {{should be noted that the}} word [...] "single" [...] in this case does not refer to the use of a single type of grain to make the whisky - rather it refers to the production of the whisky solely on the site of a single distillery.|$|E

50|$|A master blender is an {{individual}} who decides on the composition of blended spirits. For example, in the Scotch whisky industry, master blenders choose which single malts and <b>grain</b> <b>whiskies</b> are combined to make particular blended whisky. An important objective is often to maintain consistency over time. A typical blend might be composed of 20 different whiskies whose taste and price will vary over time, and, of course, {{it is possible that}} any one of them will go out of production. Consequently, it is sometimes necessary to replace whiskies that go into the blend. Other responsibilities include checking the maturation of spirits.|$|R
