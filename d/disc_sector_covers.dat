40|$|Aim - To {{evaluate}} and compare four different mathematical formulas {{for the early}} detection of morphometric optic nerve head changes in chronic open angle glaucoma. Methods - The optic nerve heads of 161 patients with perimetrically defined glaucomatous optic nerve damage and of 194 normal subjects were examined by confocal laser scanning tomography. Using four formulas of linear discriminant analysis and the optic cup shape measure as the single optic disc variable, the predictive power {{of each of these}} methods was examined to differentiate between the normal eyes and the glaucoma eyes. Results - The highest predictive power had an optic <b>disc</b> <b>sector</b> based formula, in particular in eyes with medium and large optic discs. This optic <b>disc</b> <b>sector</b> based formula was the one with the best agreement with the other formulas examined. It achieved a better predictability than any single optic disc variable evaluated. Conclusions - Combining quantitative optic disc variables by discriminant analysis functions, the predictive power of semiautomatic quantitative optic nerve head evaluation can be improved by providing the ophthalmologist with a diagnostic score for the detection of glaucomatous optic nerve damage. Because of the pattern of glaucomatous neuroretinal rim loss, an optic <b>disc</b> <b>sector</b> based discriminant formula may have a higher diagnostic precision than other formulas in detecting early glaucomatous damage...|$|R
