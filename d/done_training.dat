40|$|Telephone tapping or {{wiretapping}} is – {{or rather}} was - {{the practice of}} intercepting telephone conversations performed by authorities. Translators or interpreters are needed whenever these conversations are held in foreign languages; and even if tap interpreting, {{as a form of}} translation, is not yet explored in depth, it has given rise to fierce debates as it brings together two apparently contradictory notions, namely, privacy vs. security. Privacy is a worldwide recognized right; however, authorities are obliged to ensure security to their citizens. After this introductory discussion, we want to deal with terminology: “wiretap” and “interpreting” maybe is not the best terminological combination. Referring to “wire”-tap is rather obsolete in 2016 and “interpreting” is a too limited term to define what these professionals/experts do when interpreting/translating/transcribing/summarizing tapped materials. Next, we want to explore what is the situation in the Netherlands confronted to the situation in Belgium.

40|$|Iran is {{a country}} with a long dairy tradition. Dairy {{production}} has increased to a level of about 9 bn kg of milk per year. The ambition in the sector is to further increase production and {{to improve the quality of}} the milk to be able to export. Based on the analysis of available data and on a field trip to Iran, 4 key areas have been identified by the participating partners in the project where a Dutch Iranian cooperation could strengthen the Iranian dairy chain. 1. Milk quality assurance, quality standards and milk-payment systems There is a lack of trust within the Iranian dairy chain. A further improvement of the milk quality is needed if Iran wants to export. Dutch experience and technology about how to organise (governance) and implement (e. g in milk-payment systems) with all relevant stakeholders to achieve a higher quality of consumer products can help solve this issue. 2. Feed availability and quality The lack of trust also applies to the feed part of the dairy chain. Chain efficiency can be improved considerably if trust is improved. Dutch experience and technology about how to organise and implement independent assessment of feed quality and building trust in the chain can help to make the Iranian chain more transparent and efficient. 3. Water efficiency and feed production Iran has to be more efficient in its feed production, especially in relation to water use. Dutch international experience in crop production and water efficiency on farm level and knowledge on policy development on regional and national level can be used to contribute to this issue. 4. Education: both on operational level and on economics All Iranian farmers mentioned the need for operational trainings of their employees. Several had <b>done</b> <b>training</b> in the Netherlands in the past. The changing circumstances in Iran require more skills and insights related to strategic and economic decisions.

40|$|Background {{information}} Histamine fish poisoning {{which is}} also called scombroid fish poisoning is a mild to moderate form of food poisoning caused by eating spoiled or bacterial contaminated fish after capture or during subsequent handling and storage. Its symptoms {{are similar to those}} of fish allergy and because of that most physicians misdiagnose it. Aims of the study The objective of the study was to assess knowledge of histamine fish poisoning (HFP) among fish consumers and health care personnel in Dar es Salaam. Methods It was a cross sectional design study, utilizing a pre-tested structured questionnaire with pre-set ten questions pertaining to symptoms of HFP for fish consumers and twelve pre-set questions for health personnel. Two hundred and eighty fish consumers and one hundred and five health care personnel were recruited in the study through convenient sampling. Results The study showed that majority of fish consumers not aware of HFP, and awareness was found to be 26. 6 %, male (54. 1 %) being more aware than female (45. 9 %). Also, 43. 2 % fish consumers with age group 26 - 40 years had higher awareness than other age groups, though awareness was insignificantly associated with sex (P= 0. 153) and age groups (P= 0. 153). Among health care personnel interviewed, awareness was found to be high (60 %) and all physicians had awareness while only 17. 2 % of clinical officers interviewed had awareness of HFP. Awareness among health workers was significantly associated with their medical cadres. The study also showed that 97. 8 % of the fish consumers interviewed had low knowledge about HFP and 2. 2 % had average knowledge. Among health personnel, 28. 6 % had low knowledge, 57. 1 % had average knowledge and 14. 3 % had good knowledge. All clinical officers interviewed for knowledge assessment of HFP expressed low knowledge level, while physicians and residents were the only cadre with good knowledge among health care personnel. Both scombroid and non scombroid fish were listed by respondents being responsible for HFP; mackerel was frequently listed followed by tuna and king fish for scombroid fish, while Nile perch, xii Cat fish and Tilapia were frequently listed among the non scombroid. Symptoms that were recorded among the respondents included rashes, diarrhea and skin itching. Conclusion There is a need for training healthcare personnel particularly clinical officers who had low knowledge of HFP and work in peripheral health facilities where allergy tests are not <b>done.</b> <b>Training</b> should highlight how to distinguish fish allergy from histamine fish poisoning, to avoid misdiagnosis. This can be achieved by explaining the significance of making recall of previous history of allergic reactions to incriminated food (fish), since lack of previous history of allergic reaction and high attack rates in group out breaks, implies HFP and not fish allergy. Awareness campaign to fish consumers and the general public on HFP should be conducted to advocate the significance of fish handling after catch by fisherman and during processing, sale and storage, through icing and refrigeration...|$|E

The method used is by using socio-juridical method, which was the approach learned empirically the reciprocity relation between law and social phenomena. We used this method since the discussion object would be related with law in juridical way and studying several rule related with the application of fishing and sea business from the perspective of section 2 regional rule No. 7 / 2004 about Retribution of fishing and sea business in Lamongan residence and also sociological research to find out the inhibition in facing odd factors from the license application in Lamongan Residence. According to the application of fishing and sea business license arranged in section 2 regional rule No. 7 / 2004 about Retribution of fishing and sea business, the fishing and sea business license was held by the License Department of Lamongan residence. The application basically not only for the License Department but also involved Fishing Department and Fishing General Directorate of Brondong. The people role in fishing and sea license business license was also the most important element in the process of fishing and sea business license. Basically, the inhibition in fishing and sea business license came from two sides, they were the applicant side from the society and institution or bureaucracy which inhibited the license system. The retribution of fishing and sea business license generally aimed to increase the people life-standard, so that by the license, the law guarantee from the fishing and sea entrepreneurs could be protected. The effort of regional government of Lamongan residence to increase the quality of public service in fishing and sea business license could be seen from the effort of License department which was cooperated with Fishing and Sea Research Department. Besides, in order to increase the ability of License Department of Lamongan Residence worker, the License Department was also <b>done</b> <b>training</b> for the officer to do good service for the society.

40|$|Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) is {{a global}} {{entrepreneurial}} training program created, sponsored, and disseminated by the International Labour Organization. SIYB is arguably the world’s largest skills enhancement program for entrepreneurs. SIYB has been in operation since the early 1970 s and currently operates in almost 80 countries. In the decade to 2002, more than 100, 000 entrepreneurs, thousands of trainers and hundreds of small-enterprise development organizations {{around the world have}} participated in the program (Samuelsen 2003). Surprisingly for an education program of this magnitude and potential global importance, there has been relatively little program evaluation performed. What evaluation has been conducted has been unsystematic, nonquantitative and unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, in the nation of Botswana, since the mid seventies, there has been a huge growth in programs devoted to the training of small and medium entrepreneurs. The SIYB program has formed a significant component of this entrepreneurial training effort in Botswana (SIYB 1996). Since its introduction in 1983, the SIYB program has only been evaluated once (Samuelson 1993). The methods used failed to provide a satisfactory evaluation of the program. So, in Botswana, the world’s largest entrepreneurial training program continues to run {{in the absence of any}} knowledge concerning its efficacy. Furthermore, the program’s curriculum does not include vital components of entrepreneurship, namely: opportunity evaluation, self-efficacy, innovation, and competitiveness. The objective of this study i. e. the study for this dissertation was to fill this gap in our knowledge; and this was achieved by investigating the impact of the Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) training programme in Botswana. To meet the objectives of this dissertation, two fundamental questions were addressed: 1) What constitutes an appropriate theory of entrepreneurship education relevant to the context of developing (as distinct from developed) countries? 2) How efficacious (in both theory and practice) is education provided by the largest and most widespread entrepreneurship education program currently running in developing countries? Following these, other specific questions were addressed, such as: 3) Can I posit an ‘ideal curriculum model’ (ICM) for entrepreneurship education in the developing context? 4) What is the best way of evaluating the efficacy of an entrepreneurship education program? 5) Can I fit the core elements of entrepreneurial education (in an ICM) into a broader model of entrepreneurial process suitable for evaluation of a representative entrepreneurial education program current in many developing countries? An extensive entrepreneurship literature review culminated in the development of an ‘ideal curriculum model’ (ICM) for positing the generic attributes of a contextually relevant entrepreneurship education. This led to the development of an assessable entrepreneurship process and performance (EPP) model embracing the ICM elements in and other relevant performance variables. Further, a program evaluation of the (SIYB) was undertaken by conducting a formal empirical quantitative program evaluation study on business people who participated in the SIYB training program in Botswana and those who did not. The study consisted of a total of 197 participants (86 program participants and 111 non-participants) who completed questionnaires related to attitudes, support systems, curriculum goals, key entrepreneurship variables, and business performance. Group comparisons were conducted using MANOVAs. The efficacy of the integrated model was tested by determining patterns of correlation to test some specific hypotheses. The dominant specific aim of the study was to establish if there was a relationship between participation in SIYB training program and business performance. At the broadest but most critical level of assessment, the study revealed that there were no significant differences on a composite measure of business performance between people who had done the SIYB training and people who had not. Pearson r correlations indicated that business performance was not correlated with any of the variables in the model. This lack of any significant correlation suggests that none of the variables measured in this study significantly influences or predicts the measure of business performance in Botswana. A series of independent groups MANOVAs found some overall significant differences between SIYB program participants and other groups. Follow-up tests were conducted to examine the nature of the differences between groups. More specifically, planned contrasts were conducted on these variables (problem-solving and opportunity evaluation) for the SIYB training group and the non-SIYB control group. The results of planned contrasts revealed that, as originally indicated, participants who had not <b>done</b> <b>training</b> reported significantly lower levels of opportunity evaluation skills than those who had done the training. The results also indicated that people who had done the SIYB training exhibited more problem-solving skills than those who did not do training. However, there was no evidence to link these differences to the training itself. SIYB participants may have possessed these skills before joining the program. The study has both theoretical and practical implications. On the theoretical side, the study proposed ‘an ideal curriculum model’ (ICM) for entrepreneurship education and produced a testable model of entrepreneurial performance, placing educational variables in the context of non-educational variables. Since no similar or comparable models were found in the literature, these models contribute significantly to theory. The conceptual model - which was developed and empirically tested - emphasizes the role of key educational variables from the ICM. It appears robust and insightful in identifying the drivers of entrepreneurial and business performance. This insight provides opportunities for future researchers to replicate, extend, and modify the model to suit their specific research contexts and circumstances. On the practical side, education policy makers simply cannot ignore my core finding. There is scarcely any support for any efficacy of any part of the SIYB education program. So, overall, given the very small, largely insignificant differences between SIYB participants and other groups, the results demonstrate that SIYB is an ineffective program in Botswana, and thus it is likely that the program is of limited appropriateness or relevance anywhere in the developing world. The findings from the study reported in this thesis highlight the danger of assuming that training approaches for entrepreneurship in developing countries need merely make minor adjustments to what is currently provided in the developed world. The program as it exists should cease operations and be replaced by a program that embodies many of the findings discovered in this research...|$|E
