40|$|The {{enormous}} {{challenges faced}} {{in the search}} for suitable and profitable <b>feedstocks</b> to produce biodiesel cannot be over-emphasis. This paper has provided an overview of different catalysts used in processing different kinds of <b>feedstocks</b> for the production of biodiesel. Although the process of biodiesel production from refined <b>feedstocks</b> is less cumbersome and could provide biodiesel yield of more than 98, but its product cost is high. Thus, the recent biodiesel production from low-quality <b>feedstocks,</b> though presents challenges but has equally provided biodiesel yield comparable to that obtained from refined <b>feedstocks.</b> Furthermore the physicochemical properties of biodiesel derived from low-quality <b>feedstocks</b> are discussed. Additionally economic evaluation of biodiesel from low-quality <b>feedstocks</b> is examined. The result showed that if less expensive <b>feedstocks</b> are used to produce biodiesel, a 25 reduction in cost production is possible. Thus making biodiesel price reasonably closed to the price of petro-diesel. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{around the}} globe are {{scrambling}} to develop biofuel <b>feedstocks</b> that would not divert food crops to energy as the world confronts a severe rising fuel price as well as food shortage. It has become discernible that biodiesel is destined to make a substantial contribution to the future energy demands of the domestic and industrial economies {{as well as the}} capability of reducing greenhouse gas emissions significantly. There are different <b>feedstocks</b> for biodiesel production, among them, non-edible vegetable oils which are known as the second generation <b>feedstocks</b> can be taken into account as promising substitutions for traditional edible food crops for biodiesel production. Thus it becomes imperative to search for dedicated non-edible <b>feedstocks</b> and their suitability for biodiesel production. This paper presents recent development in producing biodiesel from non-edible <b>feedstocks.</b> Edible and non-edible oil <b>feedstocks</b> are identified and assessed first, then the potential of non-edible biodiesel <b>feedstocks</b> for producing biodiesel are discussed. Furthermore, methods and steps used for oil extraction from non-edible <b>feedstocks</b> and transesterification process of converting oil into biodiesel are presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Production of {{biofuels}} from <b>feedstocks</b> {{that are}} diverted from food production or that are grown on land that could grow crops has two important drawbacks: higher food prices and decreased reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. If U. S. policy were {{to change and}} place greater emphasis on food prices and greenhouse gas reductions, then we would transition away from current <b>feedstocks</b> toward {{those that do not}} reduce our ability to produce food. Examples of such <b>feedstocks</b> include crop residues, algae, municipal waste, jatropha grown on degraded land, and by-products of edible oil production. Policy options that would encourage use of these alternative <b>feedstocks</b> include placing a hard cap on ethanol and biodiesel production that comes from corn and refined vegetable oil, thereby forcing growth in biofuel production to come from alternative feedstocks; differentiation of tax credits and subsidies so that the alternative <b>feedstocks</b> receive a higher incentive than do corn and refined vegetable oil; and greatly increased funding for research to hasten the feasibility of producing and refining alternative <b>feedstocks.</b> biofuels, <b>feedstocks,</b> food prices, policy. ...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural <b>feedstocks</b> (brewer spent grains BSG, corncob CC, corn husk CH, {{wheat straw}} WS and Luffa sponge LS) were pretreated by liquid hot water (LHW) {{in order to}} {{increase}} cellulose recovery and enzymatic saccharification. LHW-pretreatment resulted in hemicellulose solubilization, and solids enriched in cellulose. Chemical analysis showed different susceptibilities of the <b>feedstocks</b> to LHW-pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis. Pretreated <b>feedstocks</b> presented higher crystallinity (determined through X-ray diffraction) and thermal stability (determined through thermogravimetric analysis) than untreated <b>feedstocks.</b> SEM images confirmed the effect of LHW-pretreatment on structural changes. Moreover, enzymatic hydrolysis and cellulose conversion to glucose (CCG) were improved for pretreated <b>feedstocks,</b> with exception of LS. CCG (in relation to glucose potential on solids) followed the order: BSG>CH>WS>CC>LS. LHW-pretreatment showed to be a good technology to pretreat multi <b>feedstocks</b> and for improving the enzymatic hydrolysis of recalcitrant agricultural <b>feedstocks</b> to sugars, which can be further converted to ethanol-fuel and other value-added chemicals.

40|$|Natural <b>feedstocks</b> {{used for}} any process are {{intrinsically}} variable. They may also contain deleterious components or low concentrations of desired fractions. For these three reasons it is standard industrial practice to beneficiate <b>feedstocks.</b> This is true across all industries which trans-form raw materials into standardized units. On the Moon {{there are three}} natural resources: vacuum, radiation and regolith. To utilize in situ resources on the Moon {{it is reasonable to}} presume some beneficiation of the regolith (ground rock) resource will be desirable if not essential. As on Earth, this will require fundamental understanding of the physics and chemistry of the relevant processes, which are exceeding complex in detail. Further, simulants are essential test articles for evaluation of components and systems planned for lunar deployment. Simulants are of course made from geologic <b>feedstocks.</b> Therefore, there is variation, deleterious components and incorrect concentrations of desired fractions in the <b>feedstocks</b> used for simulants. Thus, simulant production can benefit from beneficiation of the input <b>feedstocks.</b> Beneficiation of geologic <b>feedstocks</b> is the subject of extractive metallurgy.

40|$|Bioethanol {{production}} from corn is a well-established technology. However, emphasis on exploring non-food based <b>feedstocks</b> is intensified due to dispute over utilization of food based <b>feedstocks</b> to generate bioethanol. Chemical and biological conversion technologies for non-food based biomass <b>feedstocks</b> to biofuels have been developed. First generation bioethanol was produced from sugar based <b>feedstocks</b> such as corn and sugar cane. Availability of alternative <b>feedstocks</b> such as lignocellulosic and algal biomass and technology advancement {{led to the}} development of complex biological conversion processes, such as separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF), consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), and syngas fermentation.
