Using regional <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>Eurostat's</b> Regio database and the open web source Openflight for the period 1998 - 2010 we test whether the spatial concentration of skills has increased or decreased over time. We account for neighboring effects associated with both geographic proximity and links through civilian flights using a random spatial effect model. We find that migration contributes to convergence in regional skill endowments across member states, particularly at the Southern and Eastern periphery of the European Union. We also find that inter-regional connectivity through civilian flights has much stronger effects on the evolution of a region's skill endowment than geographic contiguity...|$|R

The authors documented the limitations of using this information for the measurement of average national health status, {{and focused on the}} use of the health information for the assessment of socioeconomic inequalities in health. Standard concentration indices were calculated using five different proxies for socioeconomic status. After decomposing the inequality data into its trend and seasonal component, health inequalities were found to have been increasing for most but by no means all countries and health indicators. These results do not appear to be sensitive to the various proxies for socioeconomic status employed. Overall, while not without problems, the LFS may well add a useful and hitherto unexploited resource for measuring socioeconomic inequalities in health across European countries and over time...|$|R

This paper {{addresses the}} question using harmonized <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>Eurostat’s</b> EU-SILC survey for nine European {{countries in the}} period 2005 - 08. There is wide heterogeneity in participation in the consumer credit market, ranging from 15 to 46 per cent across countries. Most households relying on consumer credit are those whose head is young and well educated; they are large in size, revealing more pronounced consumption needs. According to life cycle theory, they use credit to increase their welfare by consumption smoothing. Moreover, they frequently have a current medium-high income as lenders prefer to grant loans to less risky borrowers. Nonetheless, a not negligible portion of those using credit, ranging between 8 and 16 per cent across countries, are poor. Consumer credit can also help in improving their welfare. However, poor households are more frequently delinquent. In 2008, between 2 and 11 per cent of all borrowers were in arrears; the same percentage among the poor is much higher, ranging from 7 to 25 per cent. consumer credit, repayment arrears, consumption smoothing...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{international}} migrations patterns by {{skill and}} by region across the European Union {{during the period}} 1988 - 2005, which is characterised by substantial economic integration and further geographic enlargement. After presenting some facts about the regional distribution of skills of natives and foreigners, and their evolution over time, we develop a theoretical model where there is international trade and where both skilled and unskilled labour can move, and be employed in either a tradable or a non-tradable sector. The predicted skill distribution of natives and foreigners from {{both within and outside}} the European Union across regions is then tested using <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>Eurostat’s</b> Labour Force Survey. The empirical results suggest that despite some tendency towards skill concentration, migrants actually reduce cross-regional variations in skill endowments across the EU, hence the persistence of regions with above-average skill endowments reduces over time. The results also show that the concentration of skills {{is directly related to the}} size of the non-tradable sector. Against the fear that closer economic ties among member states might lead to the creation of super-regions where all skilled workers converge, these findings support a more balanced view of the effects of migration in the presence of international trade, as per the Hecksher-Ohlin model, and the possible need for a regional, rather than European, migration policy. 41 page(s...|$|R
