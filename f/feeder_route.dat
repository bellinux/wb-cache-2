5|$|In 1903 Robert Selbie was {{appointed}} Secretary of the Metropolitan Railway, {{working on the}} electrification of the London sections of the line; by 1905 the route was electrified as far as Harrow, although the sections north of Harrow, including the Chesham branch, continued to be worked by steam power. In 1908 he {{was appointed}} General Manager, a position he was to hold until 1930. Selbie realised that Watkin's schemes and the expensive electrification project had left the company with major financial liabilities, and that the MR's core business in central London would come under significant pressure {{as the use of}} automobiles increased and as the new Underground Electric Railways of London tube lines improved their services. Selbie set out to reshape the MR as a <b>feeder</b> <b>route</b> for goods and passengers into London.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} of services under the Silver Line umbrella have varying origins. The first section opened, known as Silver Line Phase I, was the line along Washington Street now {{referred to as}} SL5; it {{is the product of}} community demands for restoration of local service after the Washington Street Elevated portion of the Orange Line was demolished in 1987. Proposals to build a new subway line under Washington Street or a new trolley line along Washington Street were deemed impractical, so the Orange Line was re-routed about 1/2 mile west onto the Southwest Corridor right-of-way, leaving many local residents without a rapid-transit option. BRT was chosen to provide this service. The line started running July 20, 2002, replacing service provided by the 49 bus (which had existed as a <b>feeder</b> <b>route</b> before 1987).|$|E
25|$|TransJakarta has the world's longest BRT system (230.9km in length) in 2017, with 13 {{primary routes}} and 10 cross-corridor routes. Three more {{corridors}} {{were due to}} commence construction in 2014 or 2015 and will be partially elevated whereas the existing corridors are at ground level. In addition there are 18 'feeder' routes that continue past {{the end of the}} exclusive busways into the municipalities surrounding Jakarta and use special buses that allow for boarding at either ground level or the TransJakarta station platforms.TransJakarta has total 80 routes (corridor, cross route & <b>feeder</b> <b>route)</b> at the end of 2016. A significant increase from 41 routes in 2015. While TransJakarta deploys 1,056 buses in 2016 and also a significant increase from 605 buses in 2015. Transjakarta owned more than 1,500 buses {{in the first three months}} of 2017 and targets to have 3,000 buses by the end of the year.|$|E

25|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{average annual}} daily traffic (AADT) {{numbers for the}} year 2011 show {{an average of about}} 5,600 {{vehicles}} per day between the route's western terminus and Old Federal Road in Forsyth County, with the exception of an average vehicle load of 9,960 on a short stretch of the route around Yellow Creek Road, which is a south-to-north <b>feeder</b> <b>route</b> to the Big Canoe residential development in Pickens County. SR369's vehicle load continues to increase as it travels to the east, going from 6,470 west of Matt to just over 11,000 east of Matt to SR9. The average vehicle count then fluctuates from 16,340 between SR9 and SR400 to just 7,400 east of SR400 to SR306, peaks at 21,430 east of SR306 to the Hall County line, and then holds at around 12,000 as the route loops around Lake Lanier. Once SR369 reaches the Gainesville area, the vehicle loads increases greatly to around 27,000 between SR53 and SR13, with a peak of 36,750 in downtown Gainesville.|$|E
25|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{average annual}} daily traffic (AADT) {{numbers for the}} year 2011 show some variety in the average daily traffic load numbers as the route travels north. The traffic load averages start at their high point on the route, {{with an average of}} 16,530 {{vehicles}} using the short stretch between SR140 and the start of the Birmingham Highway portion. Those numbers then steadily decrease as SR372 heads north, going from 9,390 initially down to just over 3,000 as Cherokee County approaches. The average load stays between 3,000 and 3,500 south of SR20, climbs to 5,500 north of SR20, and goes up once more to around 6,200 north of SR369. The area south of, and into, Ball Ground sees an average vehicle load of between 7,000 and 7,500, cresting once more at 8,680 heading north out of downtown towards I-575/SR5/SR515. However, the short stretch that feeds directly into the aforementioned state route only carries 3,900 vehicles per day, illustrating that the <b>feeder</b> <b>route</b> into SR5 south of Ball Ground sees heavier traffic than this northern spur.|$|E
500|$|While he {{was still}} in Meadville, he was asked to prepare legal {{documentation}} for a new railroad that would connect to the city. The proposed railroad (likely the Pittsburgh and Erie Railroad which was sometimes known as [...] "The Meadville Line") would almost connect with a larger nearby system (the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad), which meant that it could become a <b>feeder</b> <b>route</b> to the larger railroad. Holliday saw the potential of the line and instead of asking for a standard fee to create the documents, he asked for and was granted a partnership in the new railroad. When this railroad was purchased by the larger system, Holliday earned $20,000 from the sale.|$|E
