6000|$|But {{though still}} recalling its past, the kitchen into which Tommy and Elspeth peered was trying {{successfully}} {{to be something}} else. The plate-rack had been a fixture, and the coffin-bed and the wooden bole, or board in the wall, with its round hole through which you thrust your hand when you wanted salt, and instead of a real mantelpiece there was a quaint imitation one painted over the fireplace. There were some pieces of furniture too, such as were usual in rooms of the kind, but most of them, perhaps in ignorance, had been put to novel uses, like the plate-rack, where the Painted Lady kept her many pretty shoes instead of her crockery. Gossip {{said she had a}} looking-glass of such prodigious size that it stood on the floor, and Tommy nudged Elspeth to signify, [...] "There it is!" [...] Other nudges called her attention to the carpet, the spinet, a chair that rocked like a cradle, and some smaller oddities, of which the queerest was a monster velvet glove hanging on the nail that by rights belonged to the bellows. The Painted Lady always put on this glove before she would touch the coals, which diverted Tommy, who knew that common <b>folk</b> <b>lift</b> coals with their bare hands while society uses the fringe of its second petticoat.|$|E

5000|$|In 2005, Arken {{was again}} invited {{to perform for}} the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, along with Tianshan Snow Lotus Group, this time singing Xinjiang <b>folk</b> song <b>Lift</b> Your Veil in both Uyghur and Mandarin. That May, Arken {{represented}} his hometown as the Kashgar Youth Ambassador for Xinjiang government's 50th anniversary tribute film Brothers and Sisters; Arken wrote the film score music for the movie and sang the theme song [...] "Kashgar". That year, Arken released his third solo album, City Night.|$|R
60|$|That {{night there}} was a clash in the trenches, and shots exchanged. And {{in the morning the}} igloo of Neegah was found empty of the Sunlanders' possessions. These they {{themselves}} had taken, for the signs of their trail were visible to the sun. Oloof climbed to the brow of the cliff to hurl great stones down into the pit, but the cliff overhung, and he hurled down abuse and insult instead, and promised bitter torture to them in the end. Bill-Man mocked him back in the tongue of the Bear <b>Folk,</b> and Tyee, <b>lifting</b> his head from a trench to see, had his shoulder scratched deeply by a bullet.|$|R
