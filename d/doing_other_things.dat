The Church of Scientology states in one publication that Hubbard [...] "took command of an antisubmarine escort vessel with Atlantic convoys". In a 1954 lecture, Hubbard asserted {{that he had been}} sent [...] "to Boston in the very early part of the war to take command of a corvette" [...] and had been given a crew made up of convicts from the Portsmouth Naval Prison. Hubbard stated in another lecture that he had been posted aboard [...] "corvettes, North Atlantic. And I went on fighting submarines in the North Atlantic and <b>doing</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> and so on. And I finally got a set of orders for the ship. By that time I had the squadron." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{originally}} intended as an unambiguous ending {{to the television}} series, the unexpected popularity and box office success of The Inbetweeners Movie led to speculation over {{the possibility of a}} sequel. These rumours began in early September 2011, while the film was still in cinemas, and were denied by its writers and actors. Around the same time, producer Christopher Young openly recognised the possibility of another film based on the series, claiming that [...] "if there is a sequel it will come from the creative elements... We've talked about it. In the short term people are dispersing and <b>doing</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> but I'm sure in the medium term a sequel is very possible. It won't be immediate but it's definitely not closed." [...] Co-writer Damon Beesley later admitted [...] "we didn't know how successful it would be and that it would have a life on screen. But they did translate to big-screen characters, people did care about them and did go back and see it more than once – and that's very rare in cinema. The idea of not following that up seemed insane to most people". The actors had mixed emotions on making a sequel. Although Buckley and Thomas felt put off by the success of the first film, Harrison and Bird became convinced on reading the script.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{claiming}} {{that she would}} never return to EastEnders in 1997, Lawrence was upset when she discovered that both Sid Owen and Mike Reid (Ricky and Frank) were leaving EastEnders in 2000 as, in her opinion, it ruled out any chance of her character returning to the show. She commented, [...] "It would be great fun to get all the Butcher clan back for a few months. I hear Diane's name mentioned quite a lot on the show — it makes me feel like I've never really left. But all the people I'm connected with are leaving, which makes going back harder and I'm really sorry about that. It would be great to have the Butcher clan come back for Mike's sendoff. But, sadly, I don't think there is the space for me to go back full-time." [...] In 2002, she was asked if she would ever return to the soap and she responded, [...] "If they asked me, I’d love to go back.

2500|$|Not all {{critiques of}} the {{podcasting}} format {{have been as}} equivocal. PopMatters observed that podcasting is a new distribution model, very different from television as a distribution model because it gives users access to media {{and the freedom to}} listen to episodes of a long-form story while <b>doing</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> The reviewer applauded the focus on long-form journalism and added, [...] "Suddenly you feel like the full promise of podcasting has just been unleashed. That long-form narrative nonfiction is really the way to best leverage the potential of podcasting as a distribution model." [...] A Wall Street Journal critic observed: [...] "podcasts have slipped marketers' minds. ZenithOptimedia, for example, put out a forecast predicting 0% growth for the medium after years of positive momentum." [...] Discussing the economics of podcast advertising, New York Magazine noted that the personal nature of the podcast format allows higher advertising rates: [...] "CPM (the cost to an advertiser per thousand impressions, a standard ad-industry unit) was between $20 and $45. Compare that to a typical radio CPM (roughly $1 to $18) or network TV ($5 to $20) or even a regular old web ad ($1 to $20), and the podcast wins." ...|$|E

6000|$|I add {{only that}} the Fabrice, who had poor George in his arms that night, is a man worth mentioning. The same Fabrice (Fabricius, or perhaps GOLDSCHMIDT in German) who went as Envoy from the Holstein-Gottorp people to Charles XII. in his Turkish time; and stayed with his Swedish Majesty there, {{for a year or}} two, indeed till the {{catastrophe}} came. His Official LETTERS from that scene are in print, this long while, though considerably forgotten; [Anecdotes du Sejour du Roi de Suide a Bender, ou Lettres de M. le Baron de Fabrice pour servir d'elaircissement a l'Histoire de Charles XII. (Hambourg, 1760, 8vo).] a little Volume, worth many big ones that have been published on that subject. The same Fabrice, following Hanover afterwards, came across to London in due course; and there he did another memorable thing: made acquaintance with the Monsieur Arouet, then a young French Exile there, Arouet Junior ("LE JEUNE or L. J."), who,--by an ingenious anagram, contrived in his indignation at such banishment,--writes himself VOLTAIRE ever since; who has been publishing a HENRIADE, and <b>doing</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> Now it was by questioning this Fabrice, and industriously picking the memory of him clean, that M. de Voltaire wrote another book, much more of an [...] "Epic" [...] than Henri IV.,--a HISTORY, namely, OF CHARLES XII.; [See Voltaire, OEuvres Completes, ii. 149, xxx. 7, 127.
