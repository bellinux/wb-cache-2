40|$|Growing {{rice with}} less water is direly needed due to declining water sources worldwide, but using methods that require less water inputs {{can have an}} impact on <b>grain</b> <b>characteristics</b> and recovery. A 2 -year field study was {{conducted}} to evaluate the impact of conventionally sown flooded rice and low-water-input rice systems on the <b>grain</b> <b>characteristics</b> and recovery of fine rice. Three fine grain rice cultivars—Super Basmati, Basmati 2000, and Shaheen Basmati—were grown under conventional flooded transplanted rice (CFTR), alternate wetting and drying (AWD), and aerobic rice systems. <b>Grain</b> <b>characteristics</b> and rice recovery were significantly influenced by different water regimes (production systems). Poor milling, including the lowest percentage of brown (head) rice (65. 3 %) and polished (white) rice (64. 2 – 66. 9 %) and the highest percentage of broken brown rice (10. 2 %), husk (24. 5 %– 26. 3 %), polished broken rice (24. 7 %), and bran (11. 0 – 12. 5 %), were recorded in the aerobic rice system sown with Shaheen Basmati. With a few exceptions, cultivars sown in CFTR were found to possess a higher percentage of brown (head) and polished (white) rice and they had incurred the least losses in the form of brown broken rice, husk, polished broken rice, and bran. In conclusion, better grain quality and recovery of rice can be attained by growing Super Basmati under the CFTR system. Growing Shaheen Basmati under low-water-input systems, the aerobic rice system in particular, resulted in poor <b>grain</b> <b>characteristics</b> tied with less rice recovery...|$|E

To simulate microbial fermentation in the rumen finely milled samples of grain were incubated in rumen fluid and the end products of fermentation and starch disappearance were measured.

The assays identified large differences between and within grains with respect to both susceptibility of grain to microbial fermentation and enzyme digestibility of starch. Ranking grains {{on the basis of}} total acid production identified expected differences between grains. Lactic acid was positively correlated to total acid production, which implies that strategies aimed at increasing the rate of fermentation of grain inevitably increase the risk of rumen acidosis.

We hypothesize that recurrent selection for increased yield indirectly impacted the <b>grain</b> fill <b>characteristics</b> of maize including final kernel weight, kernel fill duration, and kernel fill rate in the Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic maize population.

Results from the Premium Grains for Livestock Program show there are large variations across cereal grain species, cultivars, individual grain samples and animal types in the energy released during digestion and in the amount of grain eaten.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of materials}} {{is often described}} by its texture which is the orientation distribution (ODF) of the individual grains. The nature of this distribution governs {{the properties of the}} <b>grain</b> boundary <b>characteristics.</b> These <b>grain</b> boundary <b>characteristics</b> are known to drive the various deformation modes within the microstructure. For Mg 3 AlZn, the prevalent deformation mode is the formation of twins. It has been found that certain grain boundary misorientation angles are favorable for twin creation. This project seeks to utilize optimization methods to maximise the grain boundary misorientation distribution (GBMD) that encourages twin formation for an initial texture. The arrangement of these unit cells will be governed by the ODF given and the GBMD will be obtained from the spread of misorientation between them. The optimization problem will then be stated as having an objective function of maximising the appropriate GBMD for a given texture that encourages twin creation by allowing the texture to be changed, limited to certain orientations. Further constraints, such as ensuring that necessary planes of unit cells always intersect so there are no voids formed in the optimized microstructure, will be developed and applied as necessary.

40|$|The unique {{combination}} of thermo-mechanical and physiochemical properties of silicon carbide (SiC) provides interest and opportunity {{for its use}} in nuclear applications. One of the applications of SiC is as a very thin layer in the TRi-ISOtropic (TRISO) coated fuel particles for high temperature gas reactors (HTGRs). This SiC layer, produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), is designed to withstand the pressures of fission and transmutation product gases in a high temperature, radiation environment. Various researchers have demonstrated that macroscopic properties can be affected by changes {{in the distribution of}} grain boundary plane orientations and misorientations [1 - 3]. Additionally, various researchers have attributed the release behavior of Ag through the SiC layer as a grain boundary diffusion phenomenon [4 - 6]; further highlighting the importance of understanding the actual <b>grain</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the SiC layer. Both historic HTGR fission product release studies and recent experiments at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) [7] have shown that the release of Ag- 110 m is strongly temperature dependent.

Mixed model analyses were used for regressions of growth characteristics (or transformations of those) on yield (and log-transformed yield), allowing the slope {{to depend on the}} growing system.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Of special {{interest}} {{within the field}} of avalanche research and avalanche warning are properties related to snow grain type and snow grain size at the surface. In continental and intermountain avalanche climates weak layers or interfaces are the main cause of avalanches. Knowledge about such weak layers helps to increase the precision of avalanche forecasting. Some of these potential weak layers form on the snow surface and are preserved until burial. Optical satellite sensors measure reflected sunlight at different wavelengths. The near-infrared region is sensitive to the optical grain size of the snow. Due to the distinct size and shape characteristics of potential weak layers such as, for example, surface hoar, their reflectance is quite different from new snow in general. If the weather permits optical observations it should, therefore, be possible to detect such layers by remote sensing. We present the results of a pilot study where in situ measured surface snow <b>grain</b> <b>characteristics</b> are compared to snow <b>grain</b> <b>characteristics</b> as derived from multispectral data from the MODIS satellite sensor.
