Thus, although single-pulse activation of the mPFC either excites or inhibits equivalent numbers of dopamine neurons, activation of the OFC induces a primarily inhibitory response.

40|$|The {{midbrain}} dopamine {{system is}} involved in many aspects of purposeful behaviour and, when compromised, can have devastating effects on movement and cognition as seen in diseases like Parkinsonâs. In the healthy brain, <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> are thought to play particularly important roles in learning by signalling errors in reward prediction. The objective of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} diversity in the functional properties of the midbrain dopamine system, and how this is altered through genetic variation of relevance to Parkinson's and development of cell phenotype. This objective was addressed with a combination of behavioural experiments, in vivo single-cell recording and labelling (both in anaesthetised as well as awake rodents), immunofluorescence labelling, retrograde tracing and stereology. In a first set of experiments, it was demonstrated that chronic as well as acute genetic challenges can alter the firing patterns of midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons.</b> Using a novel bacterial artificial chromosome-transgenic rat model, it was shown that the R 1441 C mutation in human leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, which is linked to Parkinson's, leads to motor deficits and an age-dependent reduction in the in vivo firing variability and burst firing of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons.</b> These findings help reveal processes of early, pre-degenerative dysfunction in <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> in Parkinson's. Similar effects on firing variability and burst firing of SNc <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> were found in a mouse model with conditional knock- out of the transcription factors Forkhead box A 1 and A 2 (FoxA 1 / 2) in midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons.</b> These findings indicate that FoxA 1 / 2 are not only crucial for the early development of <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons,</b> but also their function in the mature brain. In a second set of experiments in wildtype mice, it was demonstrated that midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> (located in SNc and ventral tegmental area) show diverse expression of the molecular markers Calbindin, Calretinin, Aldh 1 a 1, Sox 6, Girk 2, SatB 1 and Otx 2. It was found that selective expression of these markers is of use for discriminating between midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> that project to dorsal striatum or nucleus accumbens. To elucidate whether the diverse molecular marker expression would map onto <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> whose firing correlates with distinct behavioural events, midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> were recorded and labelled in head-fixed awake mice either exposed to neutral sensory stimuli or performing a classical conditioning paradigm. The population activity of midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> was not modulated by neutral sensory stimuli. Interestingly, fewer than 50 % of identified <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> showed phasic firing increases following reward- predicting cue and/or reward delivery, despite the common assumption that most (if not all) midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> signal reward prediction errors. Instead, firing was modulated by other explanatory factors, such as licking, or showed no modulation during the task. Response types of midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> were not correlated with their anatomical location nor the selective or combinatorial expression of the markers Aldh 1 a 1, Calbindin and Sox 6. In conclusion, the first set of experiments identified how different genetic burdens can alter the in vivo firing of midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons,</b> and provide new insights into how circuits can change in pathological or compensatory ways at early disease stages in Parkinson's. The second set of experiments revealed striking heterogeneity of midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> in the intact system, and established further a functional diversity in the response types of identified midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> that is only partially consistent with canonical reward prediction error signalling. </p...|$|R

An extensive literature suggests that estrogen augments dopaminergic function. Our laboratory found that female rats exhibit increased locomotor stimulation in response to cocaine and greater cocaine-induced dopamine overflow compared to males, sex differences that emerge in early adulthood. Currently, the underlying mechanisms for these differences are poorly understood. I hypothesized that female rats would have more dopamine neurons in midbrain regions and that ovarian hormones would exert trophic effects on dopamine neurons. Immunohistochemical and stereological techniques were used to quantitate the number of cells in the SNpc and VTA {{of male and female}} rats and mice to assess: (1) if sex differences in <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> number exist and when they emerge, (2) how gonadal hormones influence dopaminergic cell number and dopamine-mediated behaviors (3) the role of specific hormone receptors in the effects on cell number (4) the possibility that <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> number is directly linked to cocaine-stimulated behavior and electrically-stimulated dopamine release and that these responses to cocaine are mediated through gonadal hormone modulation of midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> number. I discovered sex differences in midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> number; adult female rodents have more neurons in the SNpc and VTA. We also found that gonadectomy in adulthood reduced midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> number in females and increased neuron number in males, establishing the trophic effects of estrogen in the intact midbrain and possible suppressive effects of androgens. Treatment with agonists for estrogen receptor subtypes alpha and beta and androgen receptor reversed the effects of gonadectomy on cell number in females and males, respectively. In an effort to bridge cocaine-stimulated behavior and cell number in sham ovariectomized and ovariectomized females, we discovered cocaine-stimulated behavior, dopamine release and SNpc cell density were positively correlated in intact female rats, an effect that is lost with ovariectomy. This dissertation demonstrates that estrogen is critical for the maintenance of dopaminergic cell populations that enhance behavioral responses to psychostimulants in females, thereby contributing to the observed sex differences.

Thus, to discriminate one stimulus from another, elaborate sensory processing is necessary. Given that previous studies have used simpler types of reward-predictive stimuli, {{it has yet to}} be clear whether and, if so, how <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> obtain reward information from perceptually complicated stimuli. To investigate this, we recorded the activities of monkey <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> while they were performing discrimination between two coherent motion directions in random-dot motion stimuli. These coherent directions were paired with different magnitudes of reward. We found that <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> showed reward-predictive responses to random-dot motion stimuli.

40|$|Midbrain {{dopamine}} {{has demonstrated}} roles in locomotion, motivation, associative learning, habit formation, action selection and cognition. The many functions of dopamine {{can be attributed}} to the multiple projection targets of midbrain dopaminergic nuclei and to the multiple characteristic modes of <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> firing, tonic and phasic. Phasic transients of midbrain dopamine neurons are widely reported to signal errors conveying discrepancies between predicted and actual reward. Knocking out NMDARs in dopamine neurons has been shown to attenuate dopaminergic phasic firing providing a potential model for delineating the functions of tonic and phasic dopamine. In order to study the role of <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> NMDARs in rewardcontingent learning, we developed an auditory-cued binary choice task using complex auditory stimuli that lend themselves to efficient learning as well as morphing. We report that mice lacking NMDARs in dopamine neurons have a deficit in learning an auditory two-alternative choice task, in the absence of changes in response vigor. Dopamine neurons respond phasically to rewards as well as reward predictive cues. Updating the reward predictive value of cues is fundamental to shaping adaptive patterns of behavior and decision-making. Given the hypothesized role of dopamine in the updating of reward predictive cues, we were interested to see if an influence of reward history would be evident in the choices made by mice lacking <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> NMDARs. In an auditory-cued binary choice task, we find an influence of the difficulty of prior successes on subsequent decisions when mice are challenged with varying degrees of discrimination difficulty. In mice lacking <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> NMDARs, we find a lack of influence of prior decision difficulty.

Some recent results argue against a role for ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons in ethanol behavioral sensitization. The aim {{of the present study}} was to test whether in vivo ethanol locomotor sensitization correlates with changes in either basal- or ethanol evoked firing rates of dopamine neurons in vitro. Female Swiss mice were daily injected with 2. 5 g/kg ethanol (or saline in the control group) for 7 days and their locomotor activity was recorded. At the end of the sensitization procedure, extracellular recordings were made from dopaminergic neurons in midbrain slices from these mice. Significantly higher spontaneous basal firing rates of dopamine neurons were recorded in ethanol-sensitized mice relative to control mice, but without correlations with the behavioral effects. The superfusion of sulpiride, a dopamine D 2 antagonist, induced a stronger increase of <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> firing rates in ethanol-sensitized mice. This shows that the D 2 feedback in dopamine neurons is preserved after chronic ethanol administration and argues against a reduced D 2 feedback as an explanation for the increased <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> basal firing rates in ethanol-sensitized mice. Finally, ethanol superfusion (10 – 100 mM) significantly increased the firing rates of dopamine neurons and this effect was of higher magnitude in ethanol-sensitized mice. Furthermore, there were significant correlations between such a sensitization of <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> activity and ethanol behavioral sensitization. These results support the hypothesis that changes in brain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> activity contribute to the behavioral sensitization of the stimulant effects of ethanol. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Here, we explored the mechanism by which CRF affects VTA <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> firing. Using patch-clamp recordings from brain slices we first determined that the presence of Ih is an excellent predictor of dopamine content in mice.

Inhibition of the phospholipase C (PLC) –protein kinase C (PKC) signalling pathway, but not the cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signalling pathway, prevented the increase in <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> firing by CRF. Furthermore, the effect of CRF on VTA dopamine neurons was not attenuated by blockade of IA, IK(Ca) or IKir, but was completely eliminated by inhibition of Ih. Although cAMP-dependent modulation of Ih through changes in the voltage dependence of activation is well established, we surprisingly found that CRF, through a PKC-dependent mechanism, enhanced Ih independent of changes in the voltage dependence of activation. Thus, our results demonstrated that CRF acted on the CRF-R 1 to stimulate the PLC–PKC signalling pathway, which in turn enhanced Ih to increase VTA <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> firing. These findings provide a cellular mechanism of the interaction between CRF and dopamine, which can be involved in promoting the avoidance of threatening stimuli, the pursuit of appetitive behaviours, as well as various psychiatric conditions...|$|E

A recent PLoS Biology report (Kittappa et al., 2007) reveals that Foxa 2 regulates <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> generation and differentiation, and that aging foxa 2 +/− mice spontaneously develop Parkinsonism...|$|E
40|$|Early {{clinical}} trials designed to treat Parkinson's disease by transplantation of fetal tissue containing <b>dopamine</b> <b>neuron</b> precursors yielded promising results, but the approach retains several limitations. Multiple recent papers describe longer-term outcomes in these patients, and two additional studies offer novel approaches {{that may lead}} to autologous sources of transplantable dopamine neurons...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{progress}} has been made in generating fully functional and transplantable <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Before these cells can be used for cell replacement therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD), it is important to verify their functional properties and efficacy in animal models. Here we provide a comprehensive preclinical assessment of hESC-derived midbrain <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> in a rat model of PD. We show long-term survival and functionality using clinically relevant MRI and PET imaging techniques and demonstrate efficacy in restoration of motor function with a potency comparable to that seen with human fetal <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons.</b> Furthermore, we show that hESC-derived <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> can project sufficiently long distances for use in humans, fully regenerate midbrain-to-forebrain projections, and innervate correct target structures. This provides strong preclinical support for clinical translation of hESC-derived <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> using approaches similar to those established with fetal cells for the treatment of Parkinson's disease...|$|R
40|$|SummaryRecent studies {{indicate}} that <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) convey distinct signals. To explore this difference, we comprehensively identified each area's monosynaptic inputs using the rabies virus. We show that <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> in both areas integrate inputs from a more diverse collection of areas than previously thought, including autonomic, motor, and somatosensory areas. SNc and VTA <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> receive contrasting excitatory inputs: the former from the somatosensory/motor cortex and subthalamic nucleus, which may explain their short-latency responses to salient events; and the latter from the lateral hypothalamus, which may explain their involvement in value coding. We demonstrate that neurons in the striatum that project directly to <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> form patches in both the dorsal and ventral striatum, whereas those projecting to GABAergic neurons are distributed in the matrix compartment. Neuron-type-specific connectivity lays a foundation for studying how <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> compute outputs...|$|R
40|$|SummarySerotonin and {{dopamine}} {{are major}} neuromodulators. Here, {{we used a}} modified rabies virus to identify monosynaptic inputs to serotonin neurons in the dorsal and median raphe (DR and MR). We found that inputs to DR and MR serotonin neurons are spatially shifted in the forebrain, and MR serotonin neurons receive inputs from more medial structures. Then, we compared these data with inputs to <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). We found that DR serotonin neurons receive inputs from a remarkably similar set of areas as VTA <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons</b> apart from the striatum, which preferentially targets <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons.</b> Our results suggest three major input streams: a medial stream regulates MR serotonin neurons, an intermediate stream regulates DR serotonin and VTA <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons,</b> and a lateral stream regulates SNc <b>dopamine</b> <b>neurons.</b> These results provide fundamental organizational principles of afferent control for serotonin and dopamine...|$|R
