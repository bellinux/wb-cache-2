50|$|A major {{development}} of 1998 was {{the implementation of}} a central depository system, in which all listed companies are registered. This system allows <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment</b> (DVP) on a T+3 day rotating basis. The establishment of a clearinghouse, through the Bank of Mauritius, provided for a guarantee fund, which incorporates measures for securities and fund settlement failure. The exchange, in collaboration with international advisers, drafted new listing and reporting rules to ensure greater transparency for investors. These rules came into force {{during the first half of}} 1998.|$|R
50|$|In an {{electronic}} settlement system, electronic settlement takes place between participants. If a non-participant wishes to settle its interests, it {{must do so}} through a participant acting as a custodian. The interests of participants are recorded by credit entries in securities accounts maintained in their names by the operator of the system. It permits both quick and efficient settlement by removing the need for paperwork, and the simultaneous delivery of securities with the payment of a corresponding cash sum (called <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment,</b> or DVP) in the agreed upon currency.|$|R
50|$|Securities {{clearing}} {{was required}} to ensure payment had been received and the physical stock certificate delivered. This caused a few days delay between the trade date and final settlement. To reduce the risk associated with failure to deliver on the trade on settlement date, a clearing agent or clearing house often sat between the trading parties. The trading parties would deliver the physical stock certificate and the payment to the clearing house, who would then ensure the certificate was handed over and the payment complete. This process is known as <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to analyze the effect of OTC-DVP (over the counter <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment)</b> fixed income market {{introduction}} in Slovenia on the term structure estimation and on the volatility of zero coupon yields and forward interest rates. For the purpose of the analysis Slovenian zero coupon and forward curves were estimated. The model used for yield curve estimation was Nelson-Siegel model as it proved to be superior in terms of goodness of fit, to other statistical methods of yield curve estimation, namely: Svensson model, B-splines model, smoothing B-splines model and Merrill Lynch exponential splines model. Results of analysis show that OTC-DVP bond market introduction (as parallel bond market) has improved the information content of bond prices for term structure estimation purpose. The volatility of spot and forward rates for mid and long remind maturities has fallen with the highest density on the longest maturity segment. ...|$|R
40|$|Payment {{systems in}} Malaysia have been {{undergoing}} changes in recent years. Among the notable changes is {{the emergence of}} electronic-based payment systems. The central bank has been playing an active role in shaping the development of payment systems, particularly in the gradual introduction of electronic-based payment schemes, in the belief that these have the potential to increase efficiency in the economy as whole. The active introduction of e-payment instruments has increased both the value and volume of transactions per capita use of e-payment instruments in recent years. Checks continue to be the major payment instrument, however. Small- and medium-sized enterprises could benefit tremendously from the use of e-payment schemes through more efficient business operations, cost reductions, enhanced security and wider payment channel choice. Noted improvements have also resulted from the introduction of large-value payment systems, such as the <b>payment</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment</b> infrastructure for the settlement of Malaysian ringgit (RM) -United States (US) dollar (US$) foreign exchange trades and the <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment</b> settlement for US dollar securities that are issued, deposited and traded in Malaysia. The development of the domestic payment system is becoming more important {{in the development of a}} deep and active domestic financial market that promotes financial market stability and the reinvestment of savings in the country. Closer financial market integration in the region and closer cooperation and policy coordination among the monetary authorities in the region is becoming increasingly important. Eight years after implementation in Malaysia, the e-payment schemes should be studied to assess any economic benefits they may have provided. malaysian payment systems; information and communication technology; asian payment systems study...|$|R
40|$|Post-market {{infrastructures}} execute critical functions — {{clearing and}} <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment</b> — {{for the performance}} of trades in financial assets. This makes them potential vectors for destabilisation of the financial system in the event of malfunctions. Their impact on systemic risk warrants the supervisory and oversight authorities' concern for analysing the various risks that such infrastructures may incur and the efforts to establish a comprehensive set of recommendations for mitigating these risks. This objective has now been achieved with the publication of the CPSS/IOSCO recommendations in November 2001. These recommendations are intended to be universal in scope. In addition to setting adequate standards, the relevant authorities, and central banks in particular, have extended the scope of their responsibility in the field of maintaining financial stability by including the oversight of post-market infrastructures. The statutes of the Banque de France have recently been amended in such terms. Securities clearing and settlement infrastructures are changing rapidly both in Europe, where consolidation and sweeping rationalisation are taking place, and on the wider international scene. Users expect greater functional integration of infrastructures, which should contribute to the expansion of low-cost cross-border transactions and greater efficiency in securities processing. These changes have prompted the relevant authorities to co-operate more closely in the regulation, prudential supervision and oversight of the cross-border infrastructures being developed in Europe. With the development of pan-European infrastructures in the Paris financial markets, the Banque de France has played a very active role in enhancing co-ordinated oversight in conjunction with the other relevant national authorities. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{bond market}} in Sri Lanka {{has shown a}} slow but steady growth since the primary issue of Treasury Bonds that began in 1997. The Primary Dealer System that existed since 1992 {{provided}} a sound institutional framework for this growth whilst the Real Time Gross Settlement System and Scripless Securities Settlement System that came into being recently provided further impetus {{to the development of}} the bond market. With regular primary issues and secondary market trading in long-term debt, a yield curve emerged in the Treasury Bond market. The existence of a yield curve in the government bond market would encourage issuance of corporate debt as it would provide a bench mark for pricing of corporate debt. The high degree of risks involving settlement and trading in scrip securities and systemic deficiencies were minimized with the introduction of new infrastructure and efficiency in the market operations increased due to scripless trading and electronic on-line settlement in a <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> <b>payment</b> environment. With the increased competition in the market, spreads between buying and selling prices have reduced gradually. This would assist, among other things, in reducing the cost of borrowing to the Government. The large institutional investors have taken the initiative to develop their fund management skills and, with better trading skills of dealers and investors, the market will be increasingly active and even the long-term bonds will become much more liquid instruments in the market. The organizational and policy related issues, such as the delay in the formation of a public debt management office, large and widening fiscal deficit, debt sustainability and solvency issues, high proportion of short term debt, irregular cash flows, deficiencies in cash management, primitive nature of the corporate debt market and taxation on debt instruments vis-à-vis conventional sources of financing, are the key remaining issues that need to be addressed.

40|$|Like {{many other}} {{research}} subjects in obstetrics, research on immediate <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> expectant monitoring {{for women with}} hypertensive disorders of pregnancy faces certain challenges {{when it comes to}} interpretation and generalisation of the results; relatively rare outcomes are studied, in a clinically heterogeneous population, while the clinical practice in some countries has dictated that studies in term pregnancy were completed before earlier gestational ages could be studied. This has resulted in multiple smaller studies, some studying surrogate outcome measures, with different in- and exclusion criteria, and without enough power for reliable subgroup analyses. All this complicates the generation of definitive answers and implementation of the results into clinical practice. Performing multiple studies and subsequently pooling their results in a meta-analysis can be a way to overcome the difficulties of studying relatively rare outcomes and subgroups with enough power, as well as a solution to reach a final answer on questions involving an uncertain and possibly harmful intervention. However, {{in the case of the}} current studies on <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> expectant monitoring in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, differences regarding eligibility criteria, outcome measures and subgroup definitions make it difficult to pool their results in an aggregate meta-analysis. Individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA) has the potential to overcome these challenges, because it allows for flexibility regarding the choice of endpoints and standardisation of inclusion and exclusion criteria across studies. In addition, it has more statistical power for informative subgroup analyses. We therefore propose an IPDMA on immediate <b>delivery</b> <b>versus</b> expectant monitoring for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and advocate the use of IPDMA for research questions in obstetrics that face similar challenge...|$|R
