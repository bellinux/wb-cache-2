5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} {{issuance}} of the first advisory on the tropical depression, {{the government of the}} <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> issued a tropical storm watch from Barahona to its border with Haiti, while a tropical storm watch was issued from Haiti's border with the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> westward to Port-au-Prince. The United States' National Hurricane Center in Miami recommended interests in eastern Cuba to monitor the progress of the storm. When the depression was 205miles (330km) south-southeast of Santo Domingo, the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> issued a tropical storm warning from Punta Palenque to its border with Haiti. While located 155miles (250km) from the coast of Hispaniola, the government of the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> extended the tropical storm warning eastward to Isla Saona, while the government of Haiti upgraded its watch area to a tropical storm warning along the coast. The National Hurricane Center also recommended citizens in the Bahamas to monitor the progress of the storm. After the heavy rainfall began in the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic,</b> officials evacuated citizens of low-lying areas.|$|E

5|$|For decades Haitians {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including voluntary and involuntary migration, long- and short-term {{residence in the}} <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic,</b> legal and illegal entry, smuggling, and human trafficking. Haitians move across the Haitian-Dominican border in search of opportunities and they are highly vulnerable to exploitation. In fact, the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> {{has one of the}} worst records of human rights abuses, including human trafficking, against migrant workers in all of the Caribbean. Haitians in the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic</b> are widely disparaged as a migrant minority because of the countries' proximity. During the dictatorial reign of Jean-Claude Duvalier in the 1970s and 80s, he sold Haitians at bulk rates to work on sugar plantations in the <b>Dominican</b> <b>Republic.</b>|$|E
