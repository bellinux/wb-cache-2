500|$|As the U.S. vice president, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace {{were invited}} to quite a few parties, where the legend of [...] "Silent Cal" [...] was born. It is from this time {{that most of the}} jokes and anecdotes {{involving}} Coolidge originate. Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private {{he was a man of}} few words and was commonly referred to as [...] "Silent Cal". A possibly apocryphal story has it that a matron, seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, [...] "I made a bet today that I could get more than two words out of you." [...] He replied, [...] "You lose." [...] Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, [...] "How can they tell?" [...] Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, [...] "Got to eat somewhere." [...] Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a leading Republican wit, underscored Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: [...] "When he wished he were elsewhere, he pursed his lips, <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> and said nothing. He looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although it is {{not clear}} where they {{intended}} to take them, all accounts agree that Standing resisted by turning towards the mob and in a loud voice commanded them to [...] "Surrender." [...] When he made this declaration he was holding a pistol a member of the mob had left unguarded on a nearby tree stump. In response, Standing was immediately shot in forehead [...] "directly above the nose". Another member of the mob then pointed to Clawson and said [...] "Shoot that man." [...] Clawson <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and said [...] "Shoot." [...] Although he appeared calm and maintained composure, he nearly passed out in the anxiety of the moment. For reasons unknown, the same man who moments ago told the mob to shoot Clawson now said [...] "Donâ€™t shoot." [...] As Clawson examined Standing, one man said; [...] "This is terrible; that he should have killed himself in such a manner," [...] claiming that Standing accidentally shot himself [...] "while bringing his weapon into position." ...|$|E
