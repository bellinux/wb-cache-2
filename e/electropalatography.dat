50|$|When <b>electropalatography</b> is {{used for}} speech research, the data from tongue-palate contact is sampled by the {{controlling}} computer at up to 100 frames per second, and can then be printed out. An example of the printout {{can be seen in}} Fig.2, where the sequence runs from top to bottom, and where the 'O' symbol indicates contact and '.' indicates no contact. The utterance shown is 'catkin' /kæt.kɪn/; the sample numbered 344 shows when the /t/ closure is complete, and at frame 350 there is a complete velar closure. The alveolar closure is released at 351. The articulatory overlap (which is inaudible) is thus clearly shown.Individual frames of EPG contact data may be used to illustrate descriptions of consonant articulations, and this is done by Cruttenden for all the English (RP) consonants. In some research, multiple repetitions may be summed to produce graphical representations of tongue-palate contact in a way that minimizes effects of random variation on single tokens. This was done by Farnetani in studies of Italian and French coarticulation.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Previous {{research}} using <b>electropalatography</b> {{has revealed that}} high vowels are vulnerable to articulation errors in cleft palate speech. The error involves complete tongue-palate contact, which obstructs normal airflow through the mouth and increases nasal airflow. This study used <b>electropalatography</b> {{to provide a more}} detailed description of typical tongue-palate contact for high vowels than currently exists. Design: <b>Electropalatography</b> and acoustic data were recorded for multiple repetitions of monophthongs /i/, /u/, and /a/ and diphthongs /ai/, /oi/, and /au/. Participants: Ten typical English-speaking adults. Measures: Two measures were taken from <b>electropalatography</b> data during vowels; one identified <b>electropalatography</b> patterns with complete tongue-palate contact and a second calculated percentage of contact at five time points. Results: None of the vowels had <b>electropalatography</b> patterns with complete tongue-palate contact. The amount of contact varied for the different vowels at the five time points throughout the vowels and also between speakers. When contact occurred, it was located in the posterior, lateral regions of the palate, forming a central groove that was free of contact. Conclusion: Complete tongue-palate contact during vowels is not a feature of typical English speech and can be considered an error pattern. The normative date provided in this study will be useful to speech-language pathologists who use <b>electropalatography</b> in their clinical work. The implications of the findings are discussed in relation to the assessment of vowels in cleft palate speech. 8 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the use of <b>electropalatography</b> (EPG) and ultrasound in the remediation of vowels in adolescents with hearing impairment. Three adolescents with severe hearing impairment participated in a 6 -week vowel remediation programme using <b>electropalatography</b> (EPG) and dynamic two-dimensional ultrasound as adjuncts to speech therapy. Pre- and post-therapy speech productions were evaluated in terms of vowel formant values, EPG tongue-palate contact patterns and phonetic transcription. Notable changes were observed for all vowels across speakers, with most changes in the direction of the adult English targets. Transcription, acoustic and EPG tongue-palate contact results did not necessarily converge across vowels or speakers. Visual feedback as provided by EPG and ultrasound can be facilitative in promoting vowel development in adolescents with hearing impairment. Further research is required to evaluate the stability of changes, the relative impact of ultrasound and EPG and the relationship between phonetic transcriptions, tongue-palate contact and acoustic information about vowels...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To report perceptual {{and dynamic}} articulatory <b>electropalatography</b> data on clicks {{produced}} as compensatory articulations by two adolescents (S 1 and S 2) with velocardiofacial syndrome and velopharyngeal dysfunction. Results: The perceptual {{analysis showed that}} both speakers produced click substitutions for English targets /t/, /d/, /k/, /g/, and S 2 additionally produced clicks for /p/, /b/, and /t∫/, /d 3 /. The adolescents produced a range of clicks, which varied in placement (bilabial, dental, alveolar, palatal), voicing (voiced, voiceless), and nasality (nasal, nonnasal). Measurements from the <b>electropalatography</b> data for lingual clicks revealed two articulatory closures, one in the anterior and another in the posterior region of the hard palate. The data revealed how the two closures were timed precisely to produce the click sound. The clicks involved a complex and highly coordinated sequence of tongue maneuvers similar to clicks in some southern African languages. Conclusions: Clicks are interpreted as compensatory articulations enabling some speakers with velopharyngeal dysfunction to produce plosive and affricate sounds with perceptually salient acoustic bursts in the oral cavity. Clicks as compensatory articulations merit further systematic investigation, and the procedures reported {{in this study are}} considered appropriate for such research. 12 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: For better {{using of}} <b>electropalatography</b> in {{assessment}} and treatment procedures {{it is important}} to know normal tongue to palate contact patterns. Several factors can change consonant’s articulatory patterns. One of them is voicing. In addition to determine amount of spacial indices of studied consonants, this research aimed to study tongue behavior related to change in voicing. Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive analytic study. Consonant linguapalatal contacts were studied using reading <b>electropalatography</b> by recording 4 normal Persian speaking adults (aged between 21 - 25) repeating CVCV syllables (C=/s,z,t,d/, V=/a/) ten times. Contact patterns were examined for total number of electrodes contacted and other spatial indices. Comparisons were made across voicing contrast. Results: In this study amount of spacial indices of studied consonants determined. It’s found that there was not significant difference between voiced and voiceless cognate according to number of contact and other special indices. Conclusion: The findings of this study are in according with previous studies in other languages about the effect of voicing upon linguapalatal contact patterns. Difference in voicing does not make clear change in spacial indices related to tongue contact pattern. Compared to other parts, Tip of the tongue seem to be more sensitive for change in voicing and oral air pressure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Electropalatography</b> {{has been}} used {{successfully}} with several client groups (Hardcastle et al 1991). Intelligibility has been improved in children with articulation difficulties {{as a result of}} cleft palate, or with dyspraxia, or long standing phonological difficulties. There has been less work with adults and a very limited amount with acquired dysarthrics (Gibbon 1997). In the majority of cases reported, there has been a degree of improvement in intelligibility (eg Goldstein et al 1994). This is not a miraculous return to "normal speech", but an improvement, often where conventional speech therapy has failed. The Canterbury and Thanet Speech and Language Therapy Department, together with the local Community Dental Department and the University of Kent Medical Electronics Research Team, have undertaken a clinical trial. The intention was to have a subject group of at least 24 adult, acquired dysarthrics, and to compare the effects of <b>electropalatography</b> with conventional speech and language therapy in each case.

40|$|<b>Electropalatography</b> (EPG) is an {{instrumental}} technique that records {{the location and}} timing of tongue-to-palate contacts during speech (Hardcastle, 1984; Hardcastle, Gibbon, & Jones, 1991 a; Hardcastle, Jones, Knight, Trudgeon, & Calder, 1989). Such a technique would be valuable in objectively assessing the articulatory disturbances exhibited by individuals with dysarthria following traumatic brain injury (TBI).

The aims of the present study were to use EPG to assess the articulatory timing characteristics exhibited by three male subjects (aged 23, 27, and 29 years) with dysarthria following severe TBI and to examine the EPG results in relation to perceptual and physiological (nonspeech) findings. A word list, consisting of the lingual consonants, / t, d, s, z, k, g /, in the word-initial position of single-syllable real words of CV and CVC construction (where V = / a /), was read aloud three times by each subject while wearing an EPG palate.
