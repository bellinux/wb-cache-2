40|$|At {{different}} moisture levels the {{leakage current}} and the <b>disruptive</b> <b>strength</b> of SiCOH, a nonporous low-κ dielectric, has been investigated. If water {{is in the}} dielectric film, the current density increased of about 6 orders of magnitude due to the ionization of water molecules in the applied electric field. Furthermore, at a constant electric field the delay time until the highest current value is reached depends on the water concentration and the silanol amount in the dielectric film. The delay time can vary between 1 minute in an untreated sample and 39 minutes in a thinner and plasma treated sample. In addition, the <b>disruptive</b> <b>strength</b> in the dry state and in the water saturated state at 80 % relative humidity remains constant at about 10 MV/cm...|$|E
40|$|Main-belt asteroids {{have been}} {{continuously}} colliding {{with one another}} since they were formed. Its size distribution is primarily determined by the size dependence of asteroid strength against catastrophic impacts. The strength scaling law {{as a function of}} body size could depend on collision velocity, but the relationship remains unknown especially under hypervelocity collisions comparable to 10 km/sec. We present a wide-field imaging survey at ecliptic latitude of around 25 deg for investigating the size distribution of small main-belt asteroids which have highly inclined orbits. The analysis technique allowing for efficient asteroid detections and high-accuracy photometric measurements provide sufficient sample data to estimate the size distribution of sub-km asteroids with inclinations larger than 14 deg. The best-fit power-law slopes of the cumulative size distribution is 1. 25 +/- 0. 03 in the diameter range of 0. 6 - 1. 0 km and 1. 84 +/- 0. 27 in 1. 0 - 3. 0 km. We provide a simple size distribution model that takes into consideration the oscillations of the power-law slope due to the transition from the gravity-scaled regime to the strength-scaled regime. We find that the high-inclination population has a shallow slope of the primary components of the size distribution compared to the low-inclination populations. The asteroid population exposed to hypervelocity impacts undergoes collisional processes that large bodies have a higher <b>disruptive</b> <b>strength</b> and longer life-span relative to tiny bodies than the ecliptic asteroids.

40|$|AbstractDisruptive body {{coloration}} is {{a primary}} camouflage tactic of cuttlefish. Because rapid changeable coloration of cephalopods is guided visually, we can present different visual backgrounds (e. g., computer-generated, two-dimensional prints) and video record the animal’s response by describing and grading its body pattern. We showed previously that <b>strength</b> of cuttlefish <b>disruptive</b> patterning depends on the size, contrast, and density of discrete light elements on a homogeneous dark background. Here we report five experiments on the interactions {{of these and other}} features. Results show that Weber contrast of light background elements is—in combination with element size—a powerful determinant of <b>disruptive</b> response <b>strength.</b> Furthermore, the <b>strength</b> of <b>disruptive</b> patterning decreases with increasing mean substrate intensity (with other factors held constant). Interestingly, when element size, Weber contrast and mean substrate intensity are kept constant, <b>strength</b> of <b>disruptive</b> patterning depends on the configuration of clusters of small light elements. This study highlights the interactions of multiple features of natural microhabitats that directly influence which camouflage pattern a cuttlefish will choose...|$|R
40|$|The {{resistive}} switching (RS) {{properties of}} a thin Al 2 O 3 layer and TiOx/Al 2 O 3 bilayers integrated into TiN/metal oxide/Pt crossbar devices are investigated for future memristive device (ReRAM) applications. The oxide bilayer stack is realized in consecutive {{atomic layer deposition}} (ALD) processes at 300 [*]°C without any post-annealing step. Stoichiometric Al 2 O 3 and oxygen-deficient TiOx thin films are grown from dimethylaluminum isopropoxide [DMAI: (CH 3) 2 AlOCH(CH 3) 2] and tetrakis-dimethlyamido-titanium [TDMAT: Ti(N(CH 3) 2) 4], respectively, as the metal sources, and water as the oxygen source. High insulating characteristics are confirmed for as-grown amorphous Al 2 O 3 films with a dielectric permittivity of 8. 0 and <b>disruptive</b> field <b>strength</b> of about 7 MV cm− 1, whereas the oxygen-deficient TiOx shows semiconducting behavior. The bipolar-type RS characteristics of TiN/TiOx/Al 2 O 3 /Pt cells show a strong dependence on both oxide layer thicknesses. A stable OFF/ON state resistance ratio of about 105 is obtained for the bilayer structure of 5 [*]nm TiOx and 3. 7 [*]nm Al 2 O 3...|$|R
