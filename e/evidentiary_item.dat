5000|$|Our {{reading of}} the cases {{suggests}} the generalization that articles inside the relatively narrow compass of the passenger compartment of an automobile are in fact generally, even if not inevitably, within [...] "the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or <b>evidentiary</b> <b>item.</b> Chimel, supra, at 763. In order to establish the workable rule this category of cases requires, we read Chimels definition {{of the limits of}} the area that may be searched in light of that generalization. Accordingly, we hold that when a officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, officer may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.|$|E
40|$|Since 1966, when {{criminal}} defense lawyer Richard Ryder was disciplined for retaining physical evidence that connected his client to a bank robbery, lawyers and courts have struggled with the ethical dilemma of how defense lawyers should deal with physical evidence that potentially incriminates one of their clients. When a lawyer takes possession of an <b>evidentiary</b> <b>item,</b> must she always {{turn it over to}} the authorities, as required by most courts that have addressed this dilemma? Or, can defense counsel return the evidence to the source from whom counsel received it as recommended by Standard 4 - 4. 6 of the ABA Criminal Justice Standards for Prosecution and Defense Functions? This article explores three scenarios that present variations of the physical evidence conundrum and explores the extent to which existing authority provides clear guidance when lawyers find themselves wrestling with a physical evidence quandary. The article concludes that Standard 4 - 4. 6 ’s more nuanced return-to-the-source rule strikes a better balance between defense counsel’s duty as an officer of the court and her duties as a zealous advocate than the mandatory turnover rule championed by most courts and by section 119 of Restatement (Third) of the Laws Governing Lawyers. Finally, the article urges those revising Standard 4 - 4. 6 to retain its basic approach, but to address some of the weaknesses of the Standard...|$|E
40|$|If I {{understand}} them correctly, several leading Bayesioskeptics (Allen, Callen, Stein) acknowledge - {{with varying degrees}} of specificity and varying degrees of grudgingness - that standard probability theory can be useful as an analytical tool in considering evidentiary doctrines and the probative value of <b>evidentiary</b> <b>items...</b>|$|R
50|$|Since the {{original}} trial {{of these two}} men, new developments in DNA technology have become available. As we prepared for retrial, in March 2008, we submitted various <b>evidentiary</b> <b>items</b> for what is called YSTR testing. This test looks for male DNA only and is deemed {{to be the most}} accurate test for samples that are mixtures of female and male DNA, as in this case.|$|R
40|$|From the {{perspective}} of law enforcement, the ideal solution is a procedure that permits issuance of a search warrant before probable cause exists to believe the contraband or <b>evidentiary</b> <b>items</b> are present. Such a warrant then could be executed almost immediately once reason exists to believe the items sought have arrived {{at the scene of}} the authorized search. That is exactly what happened in U. S. v. Grubbs...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Laboratory is {{currently}} exploring needs and protocols for {{the storage of}} <b>evidentiary</b> <b>items</b> contaminated with radioactive material. While {{a large body of}} knowledge on the behavior of storage polymers in radiation fields exists, this knowledge has not been applied to the field of forensics and maintaining evidentiary integrity. The focus of this research was to evaluate the behavior of several traditional evidentiary containment polymers when exposed to significant alpha, beta, gamma, neutron and mixed radiation sources. Doses were designed to simulate exposures possible during storage of materials. Several products were found to be poorly suited for use in this specific application based on standardized mechanical testing results. Remaining products were determined to warrant further investigation for the storage of radiologically contaminated evidence...|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to Hotchner and Gideon, Rossi is decisively extroverted, abrasive, {{and much less}} cerebral, though still highly disciplined and focused. In one episode, Emily Prentiss describes him as a [...] "fussy, anal-retentive neat-freak who never leaves anything out of place", even color-coding his notes (blue pen for <b>evidentiary</b> <b>items,</b> red pen for supposition and theory). Intelligent and quick-witted, he seems to favor less polished, more traditional police methods in profiling and interrogation - for example, {{he had no idea}} what a PDA was. Nevertheless, he, Reid, and Gideon are the only characters who are known for being prolific writers. In later episodes, it is implied that he is more technically savvy than he was when first seen - in [...] "Epilogue", he attributes his tiredness to a long session of Rock Band and not enough coffee the night before, but claims to have [...] "wiped the floor" [...] with Ringo in the process, apparently on a high difficulty level.|$|R
5000|$|Corpus delicti {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} concepts in a murder investigation. When a person disappears and cannot be contacted, many police agencies initiate a missing person case. If, during the course of the investigation, detectives believe that he/she has been murdered, then a [...] "body" [...] of <b>evidentiary</b> <b>items,</b> including physical, demonstrative and testimonial evidence, must be obtained to establish that the missing individual has indeed been murdered before a suspect can be charged with homicide. The best and easiest evidence establishment in these cases is the physical body of the deceased. However, in the event that a physical body is not present or has not yet been discovered, it is possible to prove a crime took place if sufficient circumstantial evidence is presented to prove the matter beyond a reasonable doubt. For example, the presence at a missing person's home of spilled human blood, identifiable as that person's, in sufficient quantity to indicate exsanguination, demonstrates—even in the absence of a corpse—that the possibility that no crime has occurred, and the missing person is merely missing, is not reasonably credible.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method to devise, execute, and assess a cyber deception. The aim is to cause an adversary to believe they are under a cyber attack {{when in fact they}} are not. Cyber network defense relies on human and {{computational}} systems that can reason over multiple individual <b>evidentiary</b> <b>items</b> to detect the presence of meta events, i. e., cyber attacks. Many of these systems aggregate and reason over alerts from Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Such systems use byte patterns as attack signatures to analyze network traffic and generate corresponding alerts. Current aggregation and reasoning tools use a variety of techniques to model meta-events, among them Bayesian Networks. However, the inputs to these models are based on network traffic which is inherently subject to manipulation. In this work, we demonstrate a capability to remotely and artificially trigger specific meta events in a potentially unknown model. We use an existing and known Bayesian Network based cyber attack detection system to guide construction of deceptive network packets. These network packets are not actual attacks or exploits, but rather contain selected features of attack traffic embedded in benign content. We provide these packets to a different cyber attack detection system to gauge their generalizability and effect. We combine the deception packets' characteristics, the second system's response, and external observables to propose a deception model to assess the effectiveness of the manufactured network traffic on our target. We demonstrate the development and execution of a specific deception, and we propose the corresponding deception model...|$|R
40|$|Modern, {{forensics}} laboratories need Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) implementations {{that allow}} the lab to track <b>evidentiary</b> <b>items</b> through their examination lifecycle and also serve all pertinent laboratory personnel. The research presented here presents LIMS core requirements as viewed by respondents serving in different forensic laboratory capacities as well as different forensic laboratory environments. A product-development methodology was employed to evaluate the relative value of the key features that constitute a LIMS, {{in order to develop}} a set of relative values for these features and the specifics of their implementation. In addition to the results of the product development analysis, this paper also provides an extensive review of LIMS and provides an overview of the preparation and planning process for the successful upgrade or implementation of a LIMS. Analysis of the data indicate that the relative value of LIMS components are viewed differently depending upon respondents' job roles (i. e., evidence technicians, scientists, and lab management), as well as by laboratory size. Specifically, the data show that: (1) Evidence technicians place the most value on chain of evidence capabilities and on chain of custody tracking; (2) Scientists generally place greatest value on report writing and generation, and on tracking daughter evidence that develops during their analyses; (3) Lab. Managers place the greatest value on chain of custody, daughter evidence, and not surprisingly, management reporting capabilities; and (4) Lab size affects LIMS preference in that, while all labs place daughter evidence tracking, chain of custody, and management and analyst report generation as their top three priorities, the order of this prioritization is size dependent...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Frequently, <b>evidentiary</b> <b>items</b> {{contain an}} {{insufficient}} quantity of DNA to obtain complete or even partial DNA profiles using stand-ard forensic gentotyping techniques. Such low-copy-number (LCN) samples are usually subjected to increased amplification cylces to obtain genetic data. In this study, a 28 -cycle {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) {{was used to evaluate}} various methods of post-PCR purification for their effects on the sensitivity of fluorophore-based allelic detection subsequent to capillary electrophoretic separation. The amplified product was purified using filtra-tion, silica gel membrane, and enzyme mediated hydrolysis purification techniques and evaluated for their effect on fluorescent allelic signal intensity. A purification method was selected and its effect on fluorescent allelic signal intensity was compared with that of the unpurified PCR product. A method of post-PCR purification is described which increases the sensitivity of standard 28 -cycle PCR such that profiles from LCN DNA tem-plates (< 100 pg DNA) can be obtained. Full DNA profiles were consistently obtained with as little as 20 pg template DNA without increased cycle number. In mock case type samples with dermal ridge fingerprints, genetic profiles were obtained by amplification with 28 cycles followed by post-PCR purification whereas no profiles were obtained without purification of the PCR product. Allele dropout, increased stutter, and sporadic contami-nation typical of LCN analysis were observed; however, no contamination was observed in negative amplification controls. Post-PCR purification of the PCR product can increase the sensitivity of capillary electrophoresis {{to such an extent that}} DNA profiles can be obtained from < 100 pg of DNA using 28 -cycle amplification...|$|R
5000|$|When {{an arrest}} is made, it is {{reasonable}} for the arresting officer to search the person arrested in order to remove any weapons that the arrestee latter might seek to use in order to resist arrest or effect his escape. Otherwise, the officer's safety might well be endangered, and the arrest itself frustrated. In addition, it is entirely reasonable for the arresting officer to search for and seize any evidence on the arrestee's person {{in order to prevent}} its concealment or destruction. And the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or <b>evidentiary</b> <b>items</b> must, of course, be governed by a similar rule. A gun on a table or in a drawer in front of one who is arrested can be as dangerous to the arresting officer as one concealed in the clothing of the person arrested. There is ample justification, therefore, for a search of the arrestee's person and the area [...] "within his immediate control"—construing that phrase to mean the area from within which he might gain possession of a weapon or destructible evidence.There is no comparable justification, I however, for routinely searching any room other than that in which an arrest occurs—or, for that matter, for searching through all the desk drawers or other closed or concealed areas in that room itself. Such searches, in the absence of well recognized exceptions, may be made only under the authority of a search warrant. The [...] "adherence to judicial processes" [...] mandated by the Fourth Amendment requires no less. Justice Stewart, delivering the opinion of the Court ...|$|R
40|$|Positive {{identification}} {{of the nature of}} biological material present on <b>evidentiary</b> <b>items</b> can be crucial for understanding the circumstances surrounding a crime. However, traditional protein-based methods do not permit the {{identification of}} all body fluids and tissues, and thus molecular based strategies for the conclusive identification of all forensically relevant biological fluids and tissues need to be developed. Messenger RNA (mRNA) profiling is an example of such a molecular-based approach. Current mRNA body fluid identification assays involve capillary electrophoresis (CE) or quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) platforms, each with its own limitations. Both platforms require the use of expensive fluorescently labeled primers or probes. CE-based assays require separate amplification and detection steps thus increasing the analysis time. For qRT-PCR assays, only 3 - 4 markers can be included in a single reaction since each requires a different fluorescent dye. To simplify mRNA profiling assays, and reduce the time and cost of analysis, we have developed single- and multiplex body fluid High Resolution Melt (HRM) assays for the identification of common forensically relevant biological fluids and tissues. The incorporated biomarkers include IL 19 (vaginal secretions), IL 1 F 7 (skin), ALAS 2 (blood), MMP 10 (menstrual blood), HTN 3 (saliva) and TGM 4 (semen).   The HRM assays require only unlabeled PCR primers and a single saturating intercalating fluorescent dye (Eva Green). Each body-fluid-specific marker can easily be identified by the presence of a distinct melt peak. Usually, HRM assays are used to detect variants or isoforms for a single gene target. However, we have uniquely developed duplex and triplex HRM assays to permit the simultaneous detection of multiple targets per reaction. Here we describe the development and initial performance evaluation of the developed HRM assays. The results demonstrate the potential use of HRM assays for rapid, and relatively inexpensive, screening of biological evidence...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} well auditors triangulate audit evidence in an electronic audit workpaper environment. Evidentiary triangulation is an audit evidence evaluation technique argued to help auditors face {{the challenges of}} the contemporary audit environment. It is a technique formally proposed by Bell, Peecher and Solomon (2005) and involves the simultaneous consideration of evidence from three sources (Entity Business States, Management Information Intermediaries, Management Business Representations) that differ in their specificity and source. In particular, it is a technique argued to increase the likelihood that financial statement fraud will be prevented and/or detected. It is, however, a cognitively onerous technique, one that auditors will likely struggle to successfully apply. The proliferation of electronic audit workpaper systems, however, presents an environment with the potential to reduce (or increase) the cognitive demands of evidentiary triangulation. In particular, the way in which electronic workpapers are linked (i. e., the hyperlinking structure) may help or hinder auditors in their efforts to identify important relationships between evidence <b>items.</b> <b>Evidentiary</b> triangulation performance was investigated across three types of hyperlinking structures (indexed, embedded, combined) and two levels of experience (manager, senior) in a controlled experiment. Analysing the judgments made by 32 managers and 69 seniors, the results revealed that different hyperlinking structures were associated with superior and inferior triangulation performance across different experience levels. Inexperienced auditors&# 146; (seniors&# 146;) triangulation performance was inhibited by the simultaneous provision of both indexed and embedded hyperlinks, but facilitated by the individual presentation of each structure. The opposite was the case for experienced auditors (managers), whose triangulation performance was facilitated by a combined hyperlinking structure but inhibited by the individual presentation of each structure. Possibly reflecting a lack of training and experience in applying the evidentiary triangulation technique, the facilitating characteristics of different hyperlinking structures were not reflected in improved judgments. The results were also not consistent across differences in the directional implications of the Entity Business State evidence. The findings of this dissertation have implications for accounting firms both in terms of the ability of their auditors to triangulate audit evidence {{and the way in which}} they should structure their electronic presentation of workpapers...|$|R
