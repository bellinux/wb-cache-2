30|$|To {{simplify the}} complex {{transmission}} mechanism, mechanical relationships of the <b>free</b> <b>lever,</b> dead lever, and brake shoe can be simulated by inputting concentrated forces over braking time. In particular, the {{forces from the}} brake shoe and the <b>free</b> or dead <b>lever</b> must meet the actual braking leverage. In addition, the brake shoe force can be decomposed into the contact force and the friction force.|$|R
30|$|A notable {{exception}} from the corporate finance related literature is Grinblatt and Liu (2008) who map the financing {{policy of the}} firm via a partial differential equation {{as a function of}} time, <b>free</b> cash flows, <b>levered</b> asset value and history in a continuous time framework.|$|R

50|$|The {{tone arm}} (or tonearm) holds the pickup {{cartridge}} over the groove, the stylus tracking the groove with the desired force {{to give the}} optimal compromise between good tracking and minimizing wear of the stylus and record groove. At its simplest, a tone arm is a pivoted <b>lever,</b> <b>free</b> to move in two axes (vertical and horizontal) with a counterbalance to maintain tracking pressure.|$|R
50|$|In its {{earliest}} form, the capstan {{consisted of a}} timber mounted vertically through a vessel's structure which was <b>free</b> to rotate. <b>Levers,</b> known as bars, were inserted through holes {{at the top of}} the timber and used to turn the capstan. A rope wrapped several turns around the drum was thus hauled upon. A rudimentary ratchet was provided to hold the tension. The ropes were always wound in a clockwise direction (seen from above).|$|R
25|$|In 1992–93, the {{rebuilding}} began in earnest, with the Mavs trading Rolando Blackman—who {{by that point}} had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer—to the New York Knicks for a first-round draft pick. Blackman had made four All-Star Game appearances in his Mavericks career. Herb Williams joined the Knicks as a <b>free</b> agent. Fat <b>Lever</b> underwent more surgery and missed the entire 1992–93 season. Derek Harper was the team's sole bright spot, leading the team with 18.3 points per game.|$|R
50|$|In {{corporate}} finance, free {{cash flow}} to equity (FCFE) is a metric of how much cash can be distributed to the equity shareholders of the company as dividends or stock buybacks—after all expenses, reinvestments, and debt repayments are taken care of. Whereas dividends are the cash flows actually paid to shareholders, the FCFE is the cash flow simply available to shareholders. The FCFE is usually calculated {{as a part of}} DCF or LBO modelling and valuation. The FCFE is also called the <b>levered</b> <b>free</b> cash flow.|$|R
50|$|Unlevered free {{cash flow}} (i.e., cash flows before {{interest}} payments) is defined as EBITDA - CAPEX - changes in net working capital - taxes. This is the generally accepted definition. If there are mandatory repayments of debt, then some analysts utilize <b>levered</b> <b>free</b> cash flow, {{which is the same}} formula above, but less interest and mandatory principal repayments. The unlevered cash flow (UFCF) is usually used as the industry norm, because it allows for easier comparison of different companies’ cash flows. It is also preferred over the levered cash flow when conducting analyses to test the impact of different capital structures on the company.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the blood serum and {{regenerating}} lever of the albino not pedigree laboratory rats. The {{purpose of the}} work: the development of method of the pharmacological stimulation of processes of the nucleic acids biosynthesis into the proliferative phase and restoration of the lipidetransport system functional state in the hyperplastic phase of regeneration of the normal and disturbed by the <b>free</b> radicals <b>lever.</b> Grounded scientifically have been the mechanisms of action of prodigiosan through the stimulation of the transcription processes in the intact lever; the processes of the DNA replication synthesis in the regenerating lever {{and the ability to}} restore the lipidetransport system parameters. The indications for application of prodigiosan and riboxin have been determined depending on the lever state. Founded has been the application of preparations in the pre-operation period at operations to be performed on the organs of the hepato-biliary system as well as stimulation of the DNA reparation synthesis at gamma-radiation in doses of 1, 0 Gr order.

40|$|The {{problem in}} {{first-class}} <b>free</b> end <b>lever</b> (distal extension base) Removable Partial Denture (RPD) is the lever {{force on the}} retention point that may harm the abutment tooth which has been discussed many times, but the amount of force on the fulcrum point (rest) on the abutment tooth has never discussed yet. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyze the amount of force on the fulcrum point in the first class <b>lever</b> of lower <b>free</b> end denture on the two dimension static models. The analysis result reveals that the force on the fulcrum point is bigger than the mastication force on the free end saddle, or the force on the fulcrum point is equal to the sum of the force of the saddle and the force on the retention point. The force on the fulcrum point may cause trauma to the periodontal tissue of the abutment tooth. To decrease the amount of force on the fulcrum point is by mastication force limitation, decreasing the distance between the mastication point and the fulcrum point; and increasing the distance between retention point and fulcrum point. For clinical application, there are many biological variables to be considered...|$|R
50|$|In 1855, John Ramsbottom, later {{locomotive}} {{superintendent of}} the LNWR, described {{a new form of}} safety valve intended to improve reliability and especially to be tamper-resistant. A pair of plug valves were used, held down by a common spring-loaded lever between them with a single central spring. This lever was characteristically extended rearwards, often reaching into the cab on early locomotives. Rather than discouraging the use of the spring lever by the fireman, Ramsbottom's valve encouraged this. Rocking the <b>lever</b> <b>freed</b> up the valves alternately and checked that neither was sticking in its seat. Even if the fireman held the lever down and increased the force on the rear valve, there was a corresponding reduction of force on the forward valve.|$|R
50|$|As {{the trigger}} is pulled, the sear is {{released}} of engagement {{to allow the}} mainspring to drive the hammer forward slightly, but the rear arm on the barrel holding lever catches in a notch in the hammer to hold the hammer in firing position. The lowering of the forward arm of the barrel holding <b>lever</b> <b>frees</b> the barrel, allowing the compressed recoil spring to drive the barrel back, stripping the top cartridge from the magazine, chambering the round, and pressing the cartridge head against the standing breech. The M1894 is a double action firearm; the hammer can either be cocked manually for each shot, with the trigger performing the single action of releasing the sear, {{or it can be}} fired double-action, in which the trigger pull both cocks the hammer and releases the sear, at the expense of a heavier trigger pull.|$|R
5000|$|Wedged mauls: A typical wood {{splitting}} maul has a head weight of 6 to 8 lb or approximately 2.7 to 3.6 kg, respectively. Traditionally, mauls have a wedge-shaped head, but some modern versions have conical heads or swiveling sub-wedges. The original maul resembles an axe {{but with a}} broader head. For splitting wood, this tool {{is much better than}} a typical axe. The weight of it is more advantageous and due to its width, it is less likely to become stuck in the wood. The wedge section of a maul head must be slightly convex to avoid jamming and it cannot have the elongated [...] "hollow ground" [...] concave-section that a cutting axe may use. Unlike an axe, maul handles are normally straight and closer to round than the elongated oval axe handles tend to be. A maul's handle, unlike an axe, is intentionally used for levering as well as swinging. The handles are typically made from hickory, though synthetic fibreglass handles have become common. Plastic handles are more difficult to break and their factory-attached heads are less likely to work <b>free</b> with the <b>levering</b> action of a maul. In the early 1970s a triangular head design with an unbreakable metal handle was introduced called the [...] "Monster Maul." ...|$|R
50|$|The team endured {{numerous}} {{changes in}} 1990, losing Sam Perkins to the Lakers via free agency and suffering injuries to practically their entire 1990-91 starting lineup. The players {{they managed to}} acquire—Rodney McCray, Fat Lever and Alex English—were all in the twilight of their careers. On November 9 {{it was announced that}} Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own which ended his season. The Mavericks' season only got worse from there, and they finished with a record of 28-54, the worst in the NBA, falling behind even the second-year Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic. In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of driving while intoxicated and was suspended again by the NBA. It got even worse in 1991-92. Before the season even began, Tarpley violated the league's substance abuse policy for the third time and was banned from the NBA for life. The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete. The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury. Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season—hardly worth the cost of losing two first-round draft picks. The team finished with a 22-60 record. In 1992 - 93 the rebuilding began in earnest, with the Mavs trading Rolando Blackman—who by that point had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer—to the New York Knicks for a first-round draft pick.
