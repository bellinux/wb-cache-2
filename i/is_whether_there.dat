As an equitable doctrine, the court has discretion. When no special relationship exists, the question <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.|$|E
25|$|The first {{specific}} {{occurrence of}} aperiodic tilings arose in 1961, when logician Hao Wang tried {{to determine whether}} the Domino Problem is decidable â€” that <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> exists an algorithm for deciding if a given finite set of prototiles admits a tiling of the plane. Wang found algorithms to enumerate the tilesets that cannot tile the plane, and the tilesets that tile it periodically; by this he showed that such a decision algorithm exists if every finite set of prototiles that admits a tiling of the plane also admits a periodic tiling.|$|E
25|$|A {{theory is}} a set of formulas, which here is assumed to be closed under logical consequence. The {{question}} of decidability for a theory <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is an effective procedure that, given an arbitrary formula in the signature of the theory, decides whether the formula {{is a member of the}} theory or not. This problem arises naturally when a theory is defined as the set of logical consequences of a fixed set of axioms. Examples of decidable first-order theories include the theory of real closed fields, and Presburger arithmetic, while the theory of groups and Robinson arithmetic are examples of undecidable theories.|$|E

25|$|The D-Wave 2X system hosted at NASA Ames Research Center {{has been}} {{recently}} {{used for the}} learning of a special class of restricted Boltzmann machines that {{can serve as a}} building block for deep learning architectures. Complementary work that appeared roughly simultaneously showed that quantum annealing can be used for supervised learning in classification tasks. The same device was later used to train a fully connected Boltzmann machine to generate, reconstruct, and classify down-scaled, low-resolution handwritten digits, among other synthetic datasets. In both cases, the models trained by quantum annealing had a similar or better performance in terms of quality. The ultimate question that drives this endeavour <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is quantum speedup in sampling applications. Experience with the use of quantum annealers for combinatorial optimization suggests the answer is not straightforward.|$|E
500|$|The {{traditional}} Taw Cheng Kong rational nexus test {{is inappropriate}} where {{the issue is}} not the existence of discriminatory classification in a statute, but discriminatory application of a neutral statute. [...] This is because the statute would inevitably pass the test as the answer to whether the legislation in question differentiates between different classes of persons (stage 1 of the Taw Cheng Kong test) will always be in the negative. In Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General (2009), Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, applied a modified form of the Taw Cheng Kong test, holding that [...] "he question <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law".|$|E

The French Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau (BEA-TT, [...] ), {{which is responsible}} for investigating rail accidents in France, opened a non-judicial technical investigation that is ongoing as of December 2016. A criminal investigation and internal investigation by SNCF have also been opened.

500|$|In Eng Foong Ho, the Court of Appeal {{noted that}} it was not {{necessary}} to discuss the principle of reasonable classification of laws which was the subject of Taw Cheng Kong, since the appellants had not challenged the constitutionality of the Land Acquisition Act. In the present case, the appellants were challenging the application rather than the validity of the Act. The Court therefore applied a modified form of the Taw Cheng Kong rational nexus test, holding that [...] "he question <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law". The Court opinion relied on the principles set out in the Privy Council cases Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor (1980) and Howe Yoon Chong v. Chief Assessor (1990). These cases involved alleged inequality in property valuation for the purpose of determining property tax. The significance of the two Howe Yoon Chong cases is that they prescribed limits as to what constitutes inequality. Several salient points were drawn from the cases in Eng Foong Ho: ...|$|E

2500|$|Jay Bost, agroecologist and {{winner of}} The New York Times essay contest on {{the ethics of}} eating meat, {{summarized}} his argument in the following way: [...] "eating meat raised in specific circumstances is ethical; eating meat raised in other circumstances is unethical" [...] in regard to environmental usage. He proposes that if [...] "ethical is defined as living in the most ecologically benign way, then in fairly specific circumstances, of which each eater must educate himself, eating meat is ethical." [...] The specific circumstances he mentions include using animals to cycle nutrients and convert sun to food. Ethicists like Tom Regan and Peter Singer define [...] "ethical" [...] in terms of suffering rather than ecology. Mark Rowlands argues that the real determinant of whether it is ethical to cause suffering <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is any vital need to cause it; if not, then causing it is unethical.|$|E
2500|$|Many-one {{reductions}} are [...] "stronger" [...] than Turing reductions: if a set A is many-one reducible {{to a set}} B, then A is Turing reducible to B, but {{the converse}} does not always hold. Although the natural examples of noncomputable sets are all many-one equivalent, {{it is possible to}} construct recursively enumerable sets A and B such that A is Turing reducible to B but not many-one reducible to B. It can be shown that every recursively enumerable set is many-one reducible to the halting problem, and thus the halting problem is the most complicated recursively enumerable set with respect to many-one reducibility and with respect to Turing reducibility. Post (1944) asked whether every recursively enumerable set is either computable or Turing equivalent to the halting problem, that <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is no recursively enumerable set with a Turing degree intermediate between those two.|$|E
2500|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the test for {{liability}} for scandalizing contempt <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is a real risk that the impugned statement has undermined â€“ or might undermine â€“ {{public confidence in the}} administration of justice. It avoided a detailed elaboration of the test because it opined that the test demonstrated its value in application. On this point, the Court disagreed with the High Court's reference to [...] "a small likelihood" [...] of shaking public confidence in the administration of justice to describe a situation where no contempt was committed. It felt that such an instance would involve a marginal case of contempt that might not merit the initiation of contempt proceedings in the first place. Gary Chan has [...] "warmly welcomed" [...] the Court's confirmation that the real risk test applies in Singapore as this signals [...] "a more liberal attitude towards the alleged contemnor in cases of scandalising contempt".|$|E

2500|$|Few of {{the portraits}} {{attributed}} to Giorgione appear as straightforward {{records of the}} appearance of a commissioning individual, although it is entirely possible that many are. Many can be read as types designed to express a mood or atmosphere, and certainly many of the examples of the portrait tradition Giorgione initiated appear to have had this purpose, and not to have been sold to the sitter. The subjects of his non-religious figure paintings are equally hard to discern. Perhaps the first question to ask <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was intended to be a specific meaning to these paintings that ingenious research can hope to recover. Many art historians argue that there is not: [...] "The best evidence, perhaps, that Giorgione's pictures were not particularly esoteric in their meaning is provided by the fact that while his stylistic innovations were widely adopted, the distinguishing feature of virtually all Venetian non-religious painting {{in the first half of}} the 16th century is the lack of learned or literary content".|$|E
2500|$|In Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General (2009), the Court of Appeal was {{concerned}} with whether {{the decision by the}} Collector of Land Revenue to compulsorily acquire the piece of land on which the Jin Long Si Temple stood was contrary to Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Next to the temple was the Ramakrishna Mission and the Bartley Christian Church, but land belonging to these properties was not acquired. The appellants, who were the trustees of the temple land, argued, among other things, that the acquisition of that piece of land was against the equal protection clause as the State had discriminated against them in acquiring only their property and not the other two properties. The Court applied a modified reasonable relation test in determining the constitutionality of the land acquisition decision. It stated that to determine if it violated Article 12(1), [...] "he question <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law". The administration of a law [...] "may be unconstitutional if it amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination". The mere existence of inequalities [...] "due to inadvertence or inefficiency" [...] is insufficient, unless it is on a [...] "very substantial scale".|$|E
