40|$|Different {{organizations}} {{are committed to}} reducing deaths and serious injuries in road traffic. Their activities must be guided by research to produce measurable results contributed in reducing casualties and making roads safer. This paper provides detailed information about {{the second stage of}} the study for an evaluation of social legislation infringements for <b>international</b> <b>haulage</b> truck drivers involved in severe road transport accidents. The data were obtained from original sources of information: from digital tachograph printouts, analog tachograph data record sheets and attestations of activities. The aim of the second research stage was to find out to which extent the drivers involved in severe road traffic accidents (hereinafter RTA) have committed infringements more often and in larger quantities compared to the data obtained from the vehicle and driver regular roadside checks, i. e. compared with the drivers not involved in RTA. The second task for the paper is to analyze infringements by type and by level of drivers' riskiness {{to be involved in the}} RTA. The obtained findings and conclusions of in-depth case studies have been compiled, processed, analyzed and systematized by severity, quantity and type of simultaneously committed offences, installed tachograph type and other parameters. The statistical data have been grouped, systematized and analyzed according to the aim of the research. Based on various sources of information, an analysis of infringements for <b>international</b> <b>haulage</b> truck drivers was made between the obtained average amount of infringements per severe RTA case and per regular roadside check. The results of the research state that the drivers involved in severe RTA have committed considerably more infringements before the actual RTA has happened. The most part of infringements directly or indirectly refers to the lack of rest time and increased driving or overall working hours. These infringements for <b>international</b> <b>haulage</b> truck drivers are referred to be as major factors contributing to drivers' fatigue and high accidents risk...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the {{deregulation of the}} international road transport industry in Western Europe has affected 1 - the total quantity of cross-border road transport in the region; 2 - {{the degree to which}} shippers outsource rather than integrate vertically their cross-border transport needs; and 3 - the extent to which different countries participate in international road freight transport in Western Europe. Not surprisingly, we find that deregulation has had a large positive effect on the amount of international road transport net of the effect of the trade ties that grew over time among European Union countries. Moreover, consistent {{with the fact that the}} regulation disproportionately affected for-hire trucking, we find that deregulation has led shippers to shift toward more for-hire transport as opposed to own-account or private haulage. However, despite concerns voiced by member countries, we find no evidence that deregulation has disproportionately favored carriers of countries that were initially more (or less) intensively involved in <b>international</b> <b>haulage...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{elements}} of transport policies affecting energy efficiency of road haulage. The {{purpose is to}} present a tool developed to support decision making during the policy making process, at the stage of formulating the elements of transport policies. The paper describes a model developed {{to assess the impact}} of policy instruments on fleet energy efficiency by multi-criteria ranking applying the Analytical Network Process. The paper describes the possibilities to employ the defined model giving the example of <b>international</b> road <b>haulage</b> in the Republic of Serbia. The application led to a proposal for policy instruments which could have the highest impact on the increase of energy efficiency in this sector and which will be considered further in detail during the policy formulation process.

40|$|At {{requests}} from several insurance companies, more than 100 advisory opinions and expert conclusions on commercial vehicle driver's infringements {{in the field}} of compliance with the rules for working and resting times as well as for application of recording equipment (tachograph) in the local and <b>international</b> road <b>haulage</b> operations have been developed from 2008 to 2013. The aim of the research is to investigate the most common infringements of social provisions committed by commercial vehicle drivers involved in road transport accidents (RTA). The data included in this paper refer particularly to infringements committed by the drivers involved in driving vehicles which were registered in the Latvian registry. The paper summarizes and evaluates most common infringements of social legislation requirements for drivers involved in RTA in accordance with the Directive 2009 / 5 /EC of the European Commission and the corresponding Latvian Cabinet of Ministers Regulations No. 411 entered into force in 2008. Offences on drivers' allowed work and rest time periods, shortcomings at record keeping and inappropriate use of recording equipment (tachograph) by drivers of commercial vehicles are characterized in this paper based on findings and conclusions of in-depth case studies, advisory opinions and expert conclusions. The paper provides evaluation of infringements of social legislation requirements by their importance in relation to road safety, by type of recording equipment fitted to vehicles, by the quantity and type of offences committed simultaneously, as well as by other minor aspects. It was found that drivers have committed up to 10 different types of infringements at a single case. Most of the infringements discovered should be defined as very serious ones. Even in those cases when only one violation was found, in half of the cases it was defined as very serious infringement. The results of this paper will be further used in the next stage of research comparing the results obtained here with the data from regular roadside vehicle checks on the quantity and type of infringements of social legislation requirements...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} the technical, technological, institutional and organizational barriers of cross-border transportation of goods. The study uses an institutional approach as a methodological alternative to other approaches. The institutional and organizational problems of border crossing points arrangement, {{the consequences of}} the application of unified transport documents, the introduction of electronic communication forms are analyzed. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of demonstration actions, the daily practice of reducing the time of customs procedures and reducing the transaction costs of crossborder freight traffic. At the same time, it is specified that the way of effectiveness increase of cross-border transportation of goods is a simultaneous implementation of technical and institutional innovations. Emphasis is placed on identifying the institutional and organizational features of the international transportation of goods by road, in particular, the problems of the evolution of the customs duties guaranteed payment institute, the permission system in the implementation of cross-border goods traffic. It is especially specified that the state support of national businessmen demands the development of a mechanism providing a parity of the Russian and foreign carriers, at least in the field of freight hauling for the state needs with attraction of credit resources of banks with the state participation. It is emphasized that elimination of all informal (shadow) relations in this sphere has to become the first step on the way of improvement of the institutional environment of the <b>international</b> road <b>haulage.</b> The institutional characteristics of transportation of goods in certain areas, in particular, road haulage to China through Kazakhstan, and the challenges and prospects for the use and development of the Kaliningrad region transit potential are allocated. The institutional and organizational characteristics of multimodal transport development in cross-border traffic are showed. The findings of the study suggest that the development of cross-border transportation of goods and the transport and transit potential implementation in Eurasian Economic Union countries â€” can and should provide income for business entities, the budgets of all levels and the public, as well as become the locomotive of industrial and technological modernization as well as institutional and organizational evolution of economic systems and integration association...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceToday road <b>haulage</b> is France's most {{important}} transport mode, proving {{its ability to}} meet shippers' demands. Road haulage has several success factors, {{some of which are}} technical (for example, the speed and density of the motorway and road network). Others are economic (the low price or road transport). Last but not least, relationships among road hauliers {{play a major role in}} competitiveness. Among other factors, the opportunity that large companies have to subcontract with very small ones, with very low fixed costs and great flexibility, is often quoted as a major advantage. The ECHO survey, conducted in France in 2004, provides information on 10 000 shipments made by 3000 shippers. For each shipment, the survey gives details about the shipper, the shipment itself, and each company providing transport or logistics services for that shipment. The survey allows us to analyze subcontracting, by showing us each stage at which a shipment is contracted to the next carrier. This analysis reveals the frequency of subcontracting in France, and gives us the opportunity to study why subcontracts are made. Of course, some of the subcontracts are mainly cost driven. However, others aim at using the specialized skills of a particular haulier (a frequent service to a given destination, for example). Finally, the aim of some subcontracts is to increase transport chain efficiency. The usual transport segments are studied : single parcel delivery service, parcel delivery service, less than truck load, full truck load. The share of shipments and the number of tonnes which fall under the purview of subcontracting are studied. For each transport segment, subcontracting is described in terms of size of companies involved, services provided, and the reason for subcontracting. These results demonstrate the main features of several different types of subcontracting relationships. Beyond the search for low costs, the paper highlights the various forms of partnership between road hauliers...|$|R
