5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E

The tails are long and curved over the back while the ears and muzzle may be pointed, square or rounded. The legs are short and in one case from Hatiheu Valley the paws were pointed in the wrong direction...The early post-contact dog is white or spotted, small to medium size, with pointed snout and ears, and a long tail.

2500|$|Since {{previous}} courts had {{interpreted the}} statute broadly enough to include brokers processing sell orders as sales, [...] " [...] {{construction of the}} terms 'sell' or 'sale' which would exclude a sale by a trader on a national securities exchange would insert an exception where none appears in the Act and would operate to restrict said terms in derogation of {{the objectives of the}} Act," [...] wrote Bicks. Nor <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> that other remedies were available under contract law or the 1934 Act; the buyer had the freedom to choose whichever remedy he wished.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the use of}} strikebreakers increased, the Supreme Court {{was forced}} to address several issues arising from the practice. One key issue was motive: <b>Did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> if the use of strikebreakers was {{motivated}} by anti-union animus? In Radio Officers' Union v. NLRB, 347 U.S. 17 (1954), the Supreme Court held that proof of motive was indeed required. However, no proof of motive was needed where employer conduct [...] "inherently" [...] encouraged or discouraged union membership. A second issue involved use of the whipsaw strike. As unionization in an industry spread, unions encouraged employers to bargain as a group. To discourage employers from breaking away from the group, unions developed the whipsaw strike—-in which the union would strike one employer at a time, one after another. Employer groups would counter the whipsaw strike by locking out all workers at all employers belonging to the group, and using strikebreakers to provide temporary or permanent replacements. The question before the Court was whether the lockout was an unfair labor practice. In NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449 ("Buffalo Linen Supply Co."), 353 U.S. 87 (1957), the Court held that such a lockout was not a ULP.|$|E
