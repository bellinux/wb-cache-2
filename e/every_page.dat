5|$|Every {{driver of}} a CMV is {{required}} {{to keep track of}} his/her time with a log book or an ELD. A log book is simply a notebook with a grid pattern on <b>every</b> <b>page,</b> dividing the 24-hour day into 15-minute (1/4-hour) segments. Drivers are required to make carbon copies of each page, so one page may be kept with the driver (to be produced upon inspection by DOT officers), and so the other copy may be sent to the driver's employer.|$|E

25|$|The {{comic strip}} {{boom of the}} USA had a growing effect on Hungarian {{newspaper}} publishing until the late thirties. American comics flooded all kinds of newspapers, magazines. Hári János (see image) (1936-1937), a magazine for children {{is considered to be}} the first Hungarian comic book magazine, with comic strips on <b>every</b> <b>page.</b> Walt Disney strips, Secret Agent X-9, Little Nemo in Slumberland (Kis Némó Álomországban), George McManus strips and many others marked this period.|$|E

25|$|Rashi's oldest daughter, Yocheved, married Meir ben Samuel; {{their four}} sons were: Shmuel (Rashbam) (born 1080), Yitzchak (Rivam) (born 1090), Jacob (Rabbeinu Tam) (born 1100), and Shlomo the Grammarian, {{all of whom}} were among the most {{prolific}} of the Baalei Tosafot, leading rabbinic authorities who wrote critical and explanatory glosses on the Talmud which appear opposite Rashi's commentary on <b>every</b> <b>page</b> of the Talmud. Yocheved's daughter, Chanah, was a teacher of laws and customs relevant to women.|$|E
25|$|Blake {{could also}} colour the plates {{themselves}} in coloured inks before pressing them or tint them with watercolours after printing. Because of this aspect, {{a major component}} of relief etching was that <b>every</b> <b>page</b> of every book was a unique piece of art; no two copies of any page in Blake's entire oeuvre are identical. Variations in the actual print, different colouring choices, repainted plates, accidents during the acid bath etc., all led to multiple examples of the same plate.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{television}} sets, however, {{usually have}} a built-in memory, often for a few thousand different pages. This way, the teletext decoder captures <b>every</b> <b>page</b> sent out and stores it in memory, so when a page is requested by the user it can be loaded directly from memory {{instead of having to}} wait for the page to be transmitted. When the page is transmitted again, the television checks if the page in memory is still up-to-date and updates it if necessary.|$|E

He paid his melamed (teacher) three extra coins for <b>every</b> <b>page</b> of Talmud that he taught him, beyond the fee that his father was paying the teacher, to {{encourage}} the teacher to cover more material. From the age of six, he would go out at night to pray at the grave of his great-grandfather, the Baal Shem Tov, and immerse in the mikveh afterward.|$|E
25|$|Leibowitz led Commissioner Moody and Jackson County Circuit Clerk C.A. Wann through <b>every</b> <b>page</b> of the Jackson County jury roll to {{show that}} it {{contained}} no names of African-Americans. When, after several hours of reading names, Commissioner Moody finally claimed several names to be of African-Americans, Leibowitz got handwriting samples from all present. One man admitted that the handwriting appeared to be his. Leibowitz called in a handwriting expert, who testified that names identified as African-American had been added later to the list, and signed by former Jury Commissioner Morgan.|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcaster}} constantly {{sends out}} pages in sequence {{in one of}} two modes: Serial mode broadcasts <b>every</b> <b>page</b> sequentially whilst parallel mode divides VBI lines amongst the magazines, enabling one page from each magazine to be broadcast simultaneously. There will typically be a delay of a few seconds from requesting the page and it being broadcast and displayed, the time being entirely dependent in the number of pages being broadcast in the magazine (parallel mode) or in total (serial mode) and the number of VBI lines allocated. In parallel mode, therefore, some magazines will load faster than others.|$|E
50|$|During a reset, <b>every</b> <b>paged</b> ROM is {{switched}} in {{and asked}} how much public and private workspace it needs. Each ROM is allocated a chunk of private workspace that remains allocated at all times, and a single block of public workspace, equal {{to the size of}} the largest request, is made available to the active ROM. During operation, the paged area is rapidly switched between ROMs when file system commands are issued and unrecognised commands are put to the OS.|$|R

50|$|Pagers {{also have}} privacy {{advantages}} compared with cellular phones. Since a one-way pager is a passive receiver only (it sends no information {{back to the}} base station), its location cannot be tracked. However, this can also be disadvantageous, as a message sent to a pager must be broadcast from <b>every</b> <b>paging</b> transmitter in the pager's service area. Thus, if a pager has nationwide service, a message sent to it could be intercepted by criminals or law enforcement agencies anywhere within the nationwide service area.|$|R
25|$|The {{rapid rise}} of Sudoku in Britain from {{relative}} obscurity to a front-page feature in national newspapers attracted commentary {{in the media}} and parody (such as when The Guardian G2 section advertised itself as the first newspaper supplement with a Sudoku grid on <b>every</b> <b>page).</b> Recognizing the different psychological appeals of easy and difficult puzzles, The Times introduced both, side by side, on June 20, 2005. From July 2005, Channel 4 included a daily Sudoku game in their teletext service. On August 2, the BBC's program guide Radio Times featured a weekly Super Sudoku with a 16×16 grid.|$|E
25|$|The Cold Deck {{was a story}} {{written by}} Al Ewing which ran in 2000 AD {{at the same time}} as two other series set in Dredd's world, The Simping Detective and Low Life. These stories {{initially}} appeared to have no other connection with each other, but after each of them had been running independently for a couple of issues their plotlines unexpectedly intertwined with each other, and it became apparent that Ewing had collaborated with the writers of the other two series, Simon Spurrier and Rob Williams, to create a single large crossover story. The three series merged into a single story for their concluding part, called Trifecta, which took up <b>every</b> <b>page</b> of 2000 AD #1812.|$|E
500|$|Belgian {{publisher}} La Cinquième Couche anonymously {{produced a}} book called Katz, a remix of Spiegelman's book with all animal heads replaced with cat heads. [...] The book reproduced <b>every</b> <b>page</b> and line of dialogue from the French translation of Maus. [...] Spiegelman's French publisher, Flammarion, had the Belgian publisher destroy all copies under charges of copyright violation.|$|E
50|$|If the {{location}} areas are very large, {{there will be}} many mobiles operating simultaneously, resulting in very high <b>paging</b> traffic, as <b>every</b> <b>paging</b> request has to be broadcast to every base station in {{the location}} area. This wastes bandwidth and power on the mobile, by requiring it to listen for broadcast messages too much of the time. If on the other hand, there are too many small location areas, the mobile must contact the network very often for changes of location, which will also drain the mobile's battery. A balance has therefore to be struck.|$|R

50|$|In the {{original}} hardback editions, the books {{do not have}} chapters, and <b>every</b> second <b>page</b> has a comic strip-style illustration that sums up the main action in the text on the opposite page. The comics are one to three panels in length. Most of these illustrations are in black and white, but every so often there is a single-panel full-page colour illustration. However, later paperback editions published in the 1990s dispense with the comics and instead use black-and-white illustrations by Anne Bozellec. These illustrations only appear at intervals rather than on <b>every</b> second <b>page.</b> The paperback editions are also divided into chapters.|$|R

500|$|This terrible anti-American {{academic}} {{has finally}} passed away...The obits and commentaries mentioned his book, ‘A People’s History of the United States,’ is the ‘textbook {{of choice in}} high schools and colleges around the country.’ It is a truly execrable, anti-factual piece of disinformation that misstates American history on <b>every</b> <b>page.</b> Can someone assure {{me that it is}} not in use anywhere in Indiana?

In the British market, The Times Literary Supplement also characterised McNeile as a mass-market thriller writer, which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works.|$|E
