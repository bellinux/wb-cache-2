40|$|Download {{the latest}} version The {{duration}} of a supply relationship depends on two types of costs: (<b>i)</b> <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> cost of switching suppliers and (ii) the cost of being matched to an inefficient supplier when the relationship lasts too long. I develop a model of optimal contract duration that captures this tradeoff, and I provide conditions that identify the underlying cost structure. Latent transaction costs are identified even when the exact supplier selection mechanism is unknown. For a typical procurement good, I estimate the model and find that transaction costs are {{a significant portion of}} total costs. I conduct two counterfactual exercises. In the first, I estimate the effects of changing the maximum allowable contract duration, which is a common contracting friction. In the second, I evaluate the impact of reducing transaction costs. This second counterfactual illustrates why quantifying transaction costs is important for accurate welfare analysis. ∗I am thankful for the advice and guidance of my advisors, Ali Hortaçsu, Brent Hickman, Casey Mulligan, and Chad Syverson, and for the helpful comments and suggestions of Stephane Bonhomme.

This is the first empirical study to focus on the limitations when modelling foreign exchange rate transaction exposure in emerging insurance markets. This work is based on the cash flow methodology proposed by Martin and Mauer (2003, 2005) in reference to banks, and employed by Li et al. (2009) when assessing US insurance companies. Some econometric methodological innovations have been introduced to study the limitations of modelling foreign exchange rate transaction exposure in emerging insurance markets. An extensive literature review is followed by a quantitative investigation, to answer the following research questions. 1) <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> foreign exchange <b>transaction</b> exposure, as measured by a fundamental (economic) method of modelling the interplay of foreign exchange rates with other economic variables, significant, for all Egyptian insurance companies? 2) <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> foreign exchange <b>transaction</b> exposure, as measured by a technical (statistical) way of modelling the interplay of foreign exchange rates with other economic variables, significant for all Egyptian insurance companies? 3) <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> exchange <b>transaction</b> exposure for <b>the</b> Egyptian insurance industry, as a whole, significant?

Overview The IESO has identified situations where negative Congestion Management Settlement Credits (CMSC) may unfairly be charged to exporters under certain conditions, which could result in significant CMSC charges owing from exporters. The situations have occurred during internal transmission constraints under the following conditions: 1. The market participant (MP) is exporting power (this issue does not apply to imports because negative CMSC is offset by intertie offer guarantees). 2. The net interchange schedule limit (NISL) was binding in the market schedule. 3. <b>The</b> <b>transactions</b> did not, in whole or in part, result in the physical flow of power (<b>i.</b> e. <b>the</b> export <b>transaction</b> was constrained off). 4. <b>The</b> <b>transactions</b> attracting <b>the</b> negative CMSC were removed manually in the constrained schedule in real-time while remaining in the market schedule...|$|R
40|$|Concurrent {{programming}} is notoriously difficult because actions by concurrent threads may be interleaved {{and result in}} unanticipated interactions, particularly on a shared-memory system. One mechanism proposed to address this difficulty is transactional memory (TM) : programmers can group several operations into a transaction, which a TM implementation guarantees will appear to execute atomically, 1 {{or not at all}} (<b>i.</b> e., <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> is aborted). Thus, <b>transactions</b> reduce <b>the</b> possible interleavings and interactions that the programmer must consider. With transactional memory, it is easy to implement atomic blocks: one can simply execute the atomic block within a transaction, retrying in case <b>the</b> <b>transaction</b> aborts. Atomic blocks are typically implemented using locks to protect accessed data, in which the programmer must choose how to associate locks with data—trading simplicity against permissible concurrency—and manage the well known challenges of lock-based programming (e. g., the possibility of deadlock). Using transactions rather than locks, raises the level of abstraction, and shifts the responsibility of ensuring apparently atomic execution from the programmer to the system. Thus, programmers do not need to acquire the locks protecting the accessed data (and {{in such a way that}} avoids deadlock). Indeed, a TM implementation might not use locks to guarantee atomicity, but rathe...|$|R

We argue that it is necessary and sufficient to develop a comprehensive yet integrative theory of the firm that combines the three competing yet complementary logics. Toward this end, we propose an aspirational community theory of the firm (ACT) as a candidate theory by conceptualizing the firm as an aspirational community, the core of which is a group of like-minded people sharing similar or same aspiration/vision. To explain the comparative advantage of the firm vis-à-vis market, we make a distinction between contractual labor and aspirational labor, the former being defined as services provided by a laborer in fulfillment of a contract while the latter as services provided by a laborer in pursuit of an aspiration; and argue that firms exist because while the market may be effective and efficient for allocating contractual labor it is less effective and efficient than the firms for allocating aspirational labor...|$|R
