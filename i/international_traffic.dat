5|$|The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe {{was formed}} in 1947, and their first major act to improve {{transportation}} was the joint UN declaration numbered 1264. Signed in Geneva on September 16, 1950, it was named the Declaration on the Construction of Main <b>International</b> <b>Traffic</b> Arteries, which defined the first E-road network. This declaration was amended several times before November 15, 1975, when it {{was replaced by the}} European Agreement on Main <b>International</b> <b>Traffic</b> Arteries (AGR), which established a route-numbering system and improved standards for roads on the list. The AGR went through several changes, the last one of which, as of 2011, occurred 2008.

It appears that ethnic conflicts exacerbate the internal displacement of individuals from networks of family and community, and their access to economic and social safety nets.

In this paper, we empirically examine this link between ethnic fragmentation, conflicts, internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees and <b>international</b> <b>trafficking,</b> making use of a novel dataset of <b>international</b> <b>trafficking.</b> We conduct a direct estimation, which highlights the ultimate impact of ethnic fragmentation and conflict on <b>international</b> <b>trafficking</b> through internal and international displacements. ethnic fragmentation, conflict, displaced persons, human trafficking...|$|R

5|$|During the 1960s, a {{political}} debate started concerning {{whether or not}} a new main airport should be built for Oslo and Eastern Norway. A government report launched in 1970, suggested surveys for five locations: Gardermoen, Hurum, Askim, Nesodden and Ås. Hobøl was preliminarily selected and areas reserved for a future airport. During the 1970s, the Labour Party became concerned that Hobøl was located too centrally in relation to the growth areas around Oslo, and instead wanted to use Gardermoen, in an attempt to force the population growth further north. Commercial interests and the airlines supported Hobøl. In 1983, Parliament decided to abandon the plans for Hobøl and continue with a divided solution. Fornebu would be expanded, and all charter traffic be moved to Gardermoen. From 1988, all <b>international</b> <b>traffic</b> would also be moved, making Fornebu a purely domestic airport.|$|E

5|$|The {{slave trade}} {{was engaged in}} by European state and non-state actors such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, Portugal and private companies, as well as various African states and non-state actors. With rising anti-slavery {{sentiment}} at home and changing economic realities, Great Britain outlawed the international slave trade in 1807. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Great Britain established the West Africa Squadron {{in an attempt to}} halt the <b>international</b> <b>traffic</b> in slaves. It stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the African coast with slaves; the seized slaves were taken to Freetown, a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba Akitoye, and signing the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the Lagos Treaty of Cession. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland.
