40|$|AbstractBackgroundWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} the cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies for patients with pulmonary metastases from soft tissue sarcoma. MethodsWe constructed a decision tree to model the outcomes of 4 treatment strategies for patients with pulmonary metastases from soft tissue sarcoma: <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection,</b> systemic chemotherapy, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> and systemic chemotherapy, and no treatment. Data from 1124 patients with pulmonary metastases from soft tissue sarcoma were used to estimate disease-specific survival for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> and no treatment. Outcomes of systemic chemotherapy and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> and of systemic chemotherapy were estimated by assuming a 12 -month improvement in disease-specific survival with chemotherapy; this was done {{on the basis of}} the widely held but unproven assumption that chemotherapy provides a survival benefit in patients with metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. Direct costs were examined for a series of patients who underwent protocol-based <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> or doxorubicin/ifosfamide-based chemotherapy. ResultsThe mean cost of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> was $ 20, 339 per patient; the mean cost of 6 cycles of chemotherapy was $ 99, 033. Compared with no treatment and assuming a 12 -month survival advantage with chemotherapy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $ 14, 357 per life-year gained for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection,</b> $ 104, 210 per life-year gained for systemic chemotherapy, and $ 51, 159 per life-year gained for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> and systemic chemotherapy. Compared with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection,</b> the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> and systemic chemotherapy was $ 108, 036 per life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that certain patient and tumor features, as well as the assumed benefit of chemotherapy, affected cost-effectiveness. ConclusionsFor patients with pulmonary metastases from soft tissue sarcoma who were surgical candidates, <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> was the most cost-effective treatment strategy evaluated. Even with favorable assumptions regarding its clinical benefit, systemic chemotherapy alone, compared with no treatment, was not a cost-effective treatment strategy for these patients...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackground/ObjectiveThe {{concept of}} salvage <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> after {{definitive}} chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) {{is not yet}} commonly accepted in lung cancer treatment. We report our experience of eight patients in whom we performed salvage <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> for residual disease or isolated locoregional recurrence detected after dCRT. MethodsBetween 2005 and 2014, we performed salvage <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> for eight patients with N 2 Stage-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. The patients had initially received dCRT (radiation ≤  60  Gy), but eventually underwent <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> with curative intent for residual disease or isolated locoregional recurrence. The postoperative complications, incidence of recurrence, and survival parameters were evaluated. ResultsSalvage <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> was performed in four patients with residual disease and four patients with locoregional recurrence. Complete resection was successfully performed in all eight patients. Postoperative complications were observed in three patients, however, there were no postoperative mortalities. One patient developed local recurrence in a mediastinal lymph node and two patients died. Of the two fatalities, one was related to lung cancer. The estimated 5 -year survival rate of the eight patients was 75. 0 %. ConclusionWe report our experience of salvage <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> performed for residual disease or isolated locoregional recurrence diagnosed after dCRT in eight patients with locally advanced lung cancer. Although the postoperative complication rate was high, the survival data were favorable. A larger study is needed to confirm the safety and feasibility of salvage <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> after dCRT...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: {{although}} video-assisted thoracoscopic {{surgery for}} <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> {{appears to be}} associated with more favorable postoperative outcomes than thoracotomy, no reports have discussed its benefit at subsequent reoperative <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection.</b> Methods: between January 2000 and December 2009, 144 patients underwent reoperative <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections</b> for benign and malignant nodules at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester. Their data were evaluated retrospectively. Twenty-three (16 %) patients had prior video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, and 121 (84 %) had undergone a prior open thoracotomy. Intraoperative and short-term postoperative outcomes were analyzed and compared between the two groups, using the chi-square test or Mann-Whitney test. Results: overall reoperative mortality was 1. 38 % and morbidity was 49. 3 %. Intraoperative factor analysis showed that the prior video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group more often underwent anatomical resection (p 0. 0011) and showed a tendency towards a lower conversion rate from video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery to thoracotomy at reoperative <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> (p 0. 051). Short-term postoperative outcomes showed that the prior video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group had a significantly lower morbidity rate (p 0. 013), significantly shorter hospital stay (p 0. 002), and a tendency for a shorter duration of chest tube drainage (p 0. 09). Conclusion: our results suggest that prior video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery may lead to improved postoperative outcomes at subsequent reoperative <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection.</b> Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery may be favored for future potential reoperative <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections...</b>|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveOur {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} role of clinicopathologic factors as predictors of outcome after complete <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> for metastatic colorectal cancer. MethodsConsecutive patients undergoing radical <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> for colorectal cancer at our institution were included in the study. Clinicopathologic variables including sex, age, site and stage of the primary tumor, disease-free interval, prior hepatic <b>resection,</b> timing of <b>pulmonary</b> metastases, preoperative chemotherapy, type of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection,</b> number, size, and location of pulmonary metastases, and thoracic lymph node involvement were retrospectively collected and investigated for prognostic significance. Survival curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier technique and difference between factors were evaluated by the log–rank test. ResultsA total of 127 patients undergoing <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> between 1997 and 2009 were included in the study. The median follow-up was 67. 1 months. The median overall survival from the time of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> was 48. 9 months. The 5 -year overall survival was 45. 4 %. Among all investigated prognostic variables, the number of pulmonary metastases (1 vs > 1) was the most important factor affecting the outcome after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> (5 -year overall survival 55. 4 % vs 32. 2 %; hazard rate, 1. 92; P = . 006). ConclusionsIn this study, the presence of a single pulmonary metastasis was a favorable predictor of survival after complete <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> for metastatic colorectal cancer. All the other prognostic variables did not seem to affect survival and should not contraindicate such surgery in clinical practice. However, the study sample size does not allow us to draw any definitive conclusion, and further investigation of the role of these prognostic factors in larger series is warranted...|$|R

40|$|Background - Pulmonary {{metastasis}} is the commonest site of extrahepatic {{spread from}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the efficacy of surgical management in patients with solitary pulmonary metastases from HCC. Methods - This was a retrospective study of patients with HCC admitted for hepatectomy from July 1972 to June 1995. The records of patients who had a <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> for histologically proven pulmonary recurrence after curative hepatectomy were selected for analysis. Results - In the study interval, 380 patients with HCC underwent hepatectomy. Some 48 patients (12. 6 per cent) developed pulmonary metastases documented pathologically or radiologically. Nine (seven men and two women) were suitable for curative <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection.</b> The median disease free survival between hepatectomy and appearance of the lung metastasis was 21 months. The median survival after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> was 42 months, and the 1 -, 2 - and 5 -year survival rates were 100, 78 and 67 per cent respectively.

40|$|SummaryVideo-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) {{has become}} a common and {{globally}} accepted mode of <b>resection</b> of <b>pulmonary</b> tumors. One-lung isolation using double-lumen endobronchial tubes or endobronchial blockers has been traditionally considered mandatory for VATS. However, recent reports showed that VATS <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections</b> can also be performed safely using regional anesthesia without tracheal intubation. Mostly, nonintubated VATS <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections</b> are performed using regional anesthesia, either a thoracic epidural anesthesia or intercostal blocks, in a spontaneously breathing state after an iatrogenic open pneumothorax. Conscious sedation is usually necessary for longer and intensively manipulating procedures. Intraoperative cough reflex can be effectively inhibited by ipsilateral intrathoracic vagal blockade to facilitate major <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections.</b> The early outcomes of nonintubated VATS <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections</b> include a faster postoperative recovery and a lower complication rate as compared with its counterpart of intubated general anesthesia, which may be translated into a fast track VATS program. The future directions of nonintubated VATS should focus on its long-term outcomes, especially on oncological perspectives and overall survival in lung cancer patients...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCoexisting {{coronary}} artery disease and significant heart valve disease represent a considerable risk factor in patients undergoing <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection.</b> The possibility to perform concomitant (simultaneous) heart and lung surgery {{could be a good}} option for many patients. In the presented case report, the intervention was performed on two valves, triple {{coronary artery}} bypass and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection,</b> which has not been published in literature to date. A 68 -year-old woman with {{coronary artery disease}}, aortic valve stenosis, tricuspid valve regurgitation and pulmonary disease (malignant pathology) presented with triple vessel disease, moderate aortic valve stenosis, severe tricuspid regurgitation and tumorous infiltration in the upper lobe of the left lung. She underwent combined heart and pulmonary surgery-left upper lobectomy, aortic valve replacement, tricuspid valve repair and coronary artery bypass surgery. On the eight day of surgery, she was discharged. She continues to do well on follow-up. Simultaneous cardiac surgery and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> for malignancy become almost standard treatment of patients who require heart and lung surgery. The most often approach is midline sternotomy that enables a comfortable cardiac intervention as well as an acceptable access to lungs. The left lower lobectomy remains an exception, in which <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) is more often an option of left thoracotomy. If the use of ECC is inevitable, some authors prefer <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> before starting up ECC if the location of the neoplasm does not require resection during ECC...|$|R
40|$|General {{anesthesia}} with one-lung ventilation {{is considered}} mandatory for videothoracoscopic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> but has some adverse effects, which {{can contribute to}} the overall procedure-related morbidity. This finding has led to the concept of a more physiologic and globally less-invasive approach, entailing awake thoracoscopic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> under sole epidural anesthesia. Indications, although still investigational, include resection of undetermined solitary pulmonary nodules, pulmonary metastases, and non-small cell lung cancer in high-risk patients. Preliminary results have been highly satisfactory, showing that this modality is feasible, safe, and effective. Furthermore, some evidence seems to show that this patient-friendly approach could be more cost-effective, allow a more rapid recovery, and require reduced hospitalization.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{describe}} {{our experience}} with video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for anatomic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> at a referral center for thoracic surgery in Brazil. Methods: All patients who underwent anatomic <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> by VATS between 2010 and 2015 were included. Clinical and pathological data, {{as well as}} postoperative complications, were analyzed. Results: A total of 117 <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections</b> by VATS were performed, of which 98 were lobectomies and 19 were anatomic segmentectomies. The {{mean age of the}} patients was 63. 6 years (range, 15 - 86 years). Females predominated (n = 69; 59 %). The mean time to chest tube removal was 2. 47 days, and the mean length of ICU stay was 1. 88 days. The mean length of hospital stay was 4. 48 days. Bleeding ≥ 400 mL occurred in 15 patients. Conversion to thoracotomy was required in 4 patients. Conclusions: Our results are similar to those published in major international studies, indicating that VATS is an important strategy for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection.</b> They also show that VATS can be safely performed with adequate training.

40|$|ObjectiveMultidrug-resistant {{tuberculosis}} {{remains a}} significant health problem. The best available treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis {{is the combination}} of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> and antituberculous chemotherapy. We herein report the results of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> combined with chemotherapy for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis at our institution during the years 2000 through 2002. MethodsBetween 1983 and 2002, 87 patients underwent 95 <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections</b> for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Of these, the 30 (34 %) patients operated on from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2002, are reviewed in the present study. All patients were maintained on multidrug regimens preoperatively and postoperatively. Indications for surgical intervention included persistently positive sputum and {{a high risk of}} relapse. Thirty-three <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections</b> were performed, consisting of pneumonectomy (n = 12), lobectomy (n = 17), and segmentectomy (n = 4). The bronchial stump was reinforced with a latissimus dorsi muscle flap in 29 resections. ResultsThere was no operative mortality. Bronchopleural fistulas occurred in 2 patients. Five patients had a space problem. All patients attained sputum-negative status after the operation. Relapse occurred in 3 patients: 2 had a relapse at the bronchial stump, and the remaining patient had a relapse in the postlobectomy space. One late death occurred. Of the 29 survivors, 27 (93 %) were free from disease, with a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 8 - 47 months).

40|$|Objectives: Define the {{prevalence}} {{and patterns of}} hospital readmissions following <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection.</b> Methods: <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>resections</b> (pneumonectomy, lobectomy, segementectomy, wedge resection) from a prospectively maintained computerized thoracic surgery database were analyzed over a 5 year period (1 / 1995 - 12 / 1999). Lung biopsies were excluded. Readmissions were defined as In-patient stays or emergency department evaluations within 90 days of surgery. Readmission analysis excluded operative deaths. Results: 374 patients underwent <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections.</b> Mean age: 60. 1 (range: 14 - 88). 6 patients died (1. 6 %). Mean lengths of stay (LOS) : 6. 5 +/- 4. 5 days. Of 368 patients discharged, 60 patients (18. 8 %) were readmitted: 69 -one time, 27 -two times, 11 three-times, 4 -four times, and 2 -five times, {{for a total of}} 113 readmissions. 41 patients (59 %) were readmitted as in-patients. Readmission causes: pulmonary (27. 4 %), surgical sound infection (14. 2 %), other (15. 9 %), cardiac (7. 1 %), gastrointestinal (5. 3 %), deep venous thrombosis (2. 7 %), neurologic, psychiatric, urinary (each 0. 9 %). Mean time to readmission: 32. 5 +/- 24. 6 days. Readmission mean LOS: 2. 9 +/- 3. 5 days. Readmissions to hospitals other than where the surgery was performed: 1 st - 15. 9 %, 2 nd - 14. 8 %, 3 rd - 36. 6 %, 4 th - 25 %, 5 th - 0 %. 4 % (12 / 299) of patients discharged after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> and not requiring readmission died over the 5 years, while 11. 6 % (8 / 69) of those requiring readmission died. Conclusions: Readmission after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> is the most frequent postoperative complication. Pulmonary diagnoses and infection due to the thoracic surgery predominate as causes of readmission. Readmissions are frequently multiple. An important portion of readmissions occurs outside the institution performing the surgery. The population requiring readmission after undergoing <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> is at increased risk of subsequent mortality...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{previously}} reported {{that patients with}} preoperative B-type natriuretic peptide levels of 30 pg/mL or more have increased risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection.</b> This study evaluated the effects of human atrial natriuretic peptide on postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> for lung cancer. MethodsA prospective, randomized {{study was conducted with}} 40 patients who had preoperative elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (≥ 30 pg/mL) and underwent a scheduled <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> for lung cancer. Results were compared between patients who received low-dose human atrial natriuretic peptide and those who received a placebo. The primary end point was the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation during the first 4 days after surgery. ResultsThe incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was significantly lower in the human atrial natriuretic peptide group than in the placebo group (10 % vs 60 %; P < . 001). Patients in the human atrial natriuretic peptide group also showed significantly lower white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein levels after surgery. ConclusionsContinuous infusion of low-dose human atrial natriuretic peptide during lung cancer surgery had a prophylactic effect against postoperative atrial fibrillation after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> in patients with preoperative elevation of B-type natriuretic peptide levels.

Two-hundred and forty-nine patients underwent <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections</b> for bronchogenic carcinoma in the First Department of Surgery of Nagasaki University Hospital between 1955 -and 1978. Among 237 who tolarated operations, 32 patients (13. 5 %) survived more than 10 years after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections.</b> There were 23 men and 9 women. Among the patients with stage I, 25 / 85 (29. 4 %) survived more than 10 years, while in the cases with Stage III, only 3 / 122 (2 %) survived. There was no difference with survival rate between the patients with squamous cell carcinoma and those with adenocarnoma.

In a prospective study 500 patients undergoing lung resection (wedge resection, n � 141; lobectomies, n � 245; bilobectomies, n � 12; and pneumonectomies, n � 102) were included. In 178 patients (36 %) <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resections</b> were extended to structures or thoracic organs. Sleeve resection of the bronchus to preserve lung parenchyma was performed in 22 patients. Results. Classification of postoperative complications fell into four categories: patients without postoperative complications; patients with moderate complication...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveAlthough {{the lung}} {{is the most}} common site of extrahepatic spread from {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma, outcomes after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> and prognostic factors have not been well described. We analyzed a single-center experience with 25 patients undergoing <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> of metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma to examine the clinical factors and outcomes. MethodsPatients were candidates for resection if they had controlled intrahepatic disease with no evidence of extrathoracic lesions and if all gross tumors could be removed with preservation of respiratory function. Twenty-five patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent curative hepatectomy were suitable for the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> criteria between 1990 and 2005. Clinical features and outcomes were analyzed. ResultsThe mean actuarial 1 -, 3 -, and 5 -year survivals after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> were 80 %, 61 %, and 36 %, respectively. Tumor number (solitary or multiple) and location (unilateral or bilateral lung) did not significantly affect cancer-specific survival. Mean 5 -year survival was 25 % for patients with disease-free interval of 1 to 11 months and 62 % for those with disease-free interval of 12 months or more. Mean survival was 15. 9 months for patients with alpha-fetoprotein of 500 ng/mL or more, and 39. 2 months for those with alpha-fetoprotein less than 500 ng/mL. Five-year survival was 21 % for patients with short disease-free interval or high alpha-fetoprotein level and 74 % for those with long disease-free interval and low alpha-fetoprotein level (P =. 015). ConclusionPulmonary resection for metastases from hepatocellular carcinoma may prolong survival in selected patients. Disease-free interval greater than 12 months and alpha-fetoprotein less than 500 ng/mL are important prognostic factors...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveMany {{patients}} have their hospital discharge delayed because their chest tube drainage is too high, {{despite the fact}} that there are no data to support the commonly used 250 mL/day threshold. MethodsA retrospective cohort study was conducted with a prospective database and prospective algorithm from one surgeon. All patients underwent elective <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection.</b> The last chest tube was removed if there was no air leak and nonchylous drainage of 450 mL/day or less. ResultsThe study comprised 8608 operations and 2077 patients who underwent an elective (nonpneumonectomy) <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> via thoracotomy by one general thoracic surgeon over a 10 -year period. Eighty-nine patients went home with a chest tube owing to air leak. The remaining 1988 patients were discharged without a chest tube. Types of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> were wedge resection in 729 patients, segmentectomy in 214, lobectomy in 1104, and bilobectomy in 30. The median day of discharge was postoperative day 4. One hundred one (5 %) were readmitted to the hospital within 60 days of discharge. The most common reason for readmission was dehydration and fatigue. Only 11 (0. 55 %) had readmissions owing to recurrent symptomatic effusion and most were treated with video-assisted thoracoscopy. Follow-up was 100 % at 4  weeks and 93 % at 8 weeks. ConclusionsChest tubes can be removed with up to 450 mL/day of nonchylous drainage after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection,</b> and perhaps a higher volume could be accepted. Readmission owing to a recurrent effusion is exceedingly uncommon, and the practice of leaving the tube in longer for drainage less than 450 mL/day is unsupported in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Acute {{respiratory}} dysfunction syndrome (ARDS), {{defined as}} acute hypoxemia accompanied by radiographic pulmonary infiltrates without a clearly identifiable cause, {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection.</b> The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the pre and intraoperative factors associated with ARDS after <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> retrospectively. Methods Patients undergoing elective <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> at Adnan Menderes University Medical Faculty Thoracic Surgery Department from January 2005 to February 2010 were included in this retrospective study. The authors collected data on demographics, relevant co-morbidities, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status classification score, pulmonary function tests, type of operation, duration of surgery and intraoperative fluid administration (fluid therapy and blood products). The primary outcome measure was postoperative ARDS, defined as the need for continuation of mechanical ventilation for greater than 48 -hours postoperatively or the need for reinstitution of mechanical ventilation after extubation. Statistical analysis was performed with Fisher exact test for categorical variables and logistic regression analysis for continuous variables. Results Of one hundred forty-three <b>pulmonary</b> <b>resection</b> patients, 11 (7. 5 %) developed postoperative ARDS. Alcohol abuse (p = 0. 01, OR = 39. 6), ASA score (p = 0. 001, OR: 1257. 3), resection type (p = 0. 032, OR = 28. 6) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (p = 0. 027, OR = 1. 4) were the factors found to be statistically significant. Conclusion In the light of the current study, lung injury after lung resection has a high mortality. Preoperative and postoperative risk factor were significant predictors of postoperative lung injury. </p...|$|R
