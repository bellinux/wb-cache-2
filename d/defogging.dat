5|$|Like {{a number}} of other delta-wing {{aircraft}} designed to cruise at very high speeds, the Valkyrie included a droop-nose that allowed the pilots to view the ground during the nose-high takeoff and landing. The Concorde or Tupolev Tu-144 both used a design where the entire nose section was angled downward, including outer window panels, exposing interior windows that were more vertically angled. In the B-70 design, only the upper section of the nose moved down into a fixed lower section, and the outer window panels moved with it to become more vertical, at 24degrees slope. With the nose raised into its high-speed position, the outer windows were almost horizontal. A system that blew 600F air from the engines was used for both <b>defogging</b> and rain removal. The lower forward section included a radar bay, and production machines were to be equipped with a refueling receptacle on the upper surface of the nose.|$|E

The easier starting results from warmer, less viscous engine oil and less condensation of fuel on cold metal surfaces inside the engine; thus an engine block heater reduces a vehicle's emission of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide; also heat is available more instantly for the passenger compartment and glass <b>defogging.</b>|$|E
25|$|The bailout {{block is}} a small {{manifold}} fitted either to the harness where {{it is in a}} convenient but protected position, commonly on the right side on the waist strap, or on the helmet, also usually {{on the right side of}} the temple, with the valve knob to the side to distinguish it from the free-flow or <b>defogging</b> valve which is commonly to the front. The bailout block has a connection for the main gas supply from the umbilical through a non-return valve. This route can not be closed and supplies the helmet demand valve and free flow valve under normal circumstances. The bailout gas from the back mounted cylinder passes through a conventional scuba first stage at the cylinder valve, to the bailout block, where it is normally isolated by the bailout valve. When the diver needs to switch over to bailout gas he simply opens the bailout valve and the gas is supplied to the helmet or mask. As the valve is normally closed, a leak in the first stage regulator seat will cause the interstage pressure to rise, and unless an overpressure relief valve is fitted to the first stage the hose may burst. Aftermarket overpressure valves are available which can be fitted into a standard low-pressure port of most first stages.|$|E

50|$|For primary <b>defogging,</b> heat is {{generally}} {{provided by the}} vehicle's engine coolant via the heater core; fresh air is blown through the heater core and then ducted to and distributed over the interior surface of the windshield by a blower. This air is in many cases first dehumidified by passing it through the vehicle's operating air conditioning evaporator. Such dehumidification makes the defogger more effective and faster, for the dried air has a greater capacity to absorb water from the glass at which it is directed.|$|E
50|$|Resistive-heat defoggers {{are usually}} {{equipped}} with an automatic timer to operate for a set time period of 10 to 15 minutes before switching off. This is because most <b>defogging</b> is achieved within that timeframe, after which the vehicle's heater has usually brought {{the interior of the}} vehicle to a warm enough temperature that the fog does not recur. However, if this is not the case, the driver may activate the system again once it has timed out. There is usually a telltale on the vehicle dashboard, often on the defogger switch, to let the driver know.|$|E
5000|$|The {{attraction}} {{vehicles were}} not actual submarines, but instead boats {{in which the}} guests sat below water level. The interiors were a mix of metal paneling, rivets, and bolts, as well as Victorian-esque fittings {{in the form of}} passenger seats that could flip outwards, and armrests beneath the portholes, in keeping with the Goff concept. Each [...] "guest" [...] aboard the Nautilus had his or her own seat, as well as a round porthole to look out into the attraction. A small button located in the porthole recess was intended for <b>defogging</b> the window if needed, though this rarely worked.

50|$|First {{seen on the}} 1985 Ford Scorpio/Granada Mk. III in Europe and the Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable in the U.S., {{the system}} uses a mesh of very thin heating wires, or a silver/zinc oxide coated film {{embedded}} between two layers of windscreen glass. The overall effect when operative was <b>defogging</b> and defrosting of the windscreen {{at a very high}} rate. Landrover (UK) also fitted a similar screen to their Discovery range in the early 1990s, some of which were imported to Australia undetected by authorities, because at that stage they were not legal in any state. Owing to the high current draw, the system is engineered to operate only when the engine is running, and normally switches off after 10 minutes of operation. The metallic content of the glass has been shown to degrade the performance of certain windshield-mounted accessories, such as GPS navigators, telephone antennas and radar detectors.|$|E

The air-conditioned coaches have wide windows for a panoramic view, anti-skid flooring, sliding doorways, heating facilities, an attractive colour scheme and executive class reclining seats inside. The driver's cabin has a heating and <b>defogging</b> unit {{to take care of}} cold climatic conditions and is fitted with single lookout glass windows to give a wider view. A snow-cutting type cattle guard has been attached at the driving end of the train for clearing snow from the tracks during winter. In view of the peculiar climate of the valley, the 1,400-horsepower diesel engine for the train has been provided with a heating system for a quick and trouble-free start in the winters.

5000|$|By April 2015 U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Michael Froman and Japanese Economy Minister Akira Amari —representing the {{two largest}} economies of the 12-nation TPP—were {{involved}} in bilateral talks regarding agriculture and auto parts, the [...] "two largest obstacles for Japan." [...] These bilateral accords which would open each other's [...] "markets for products such as rice, pork and automobiles." [...] In Japan [...] "rice, wheat, barley, beef, pork, dairy goods, sugar and starch crops are considered politically sensitive products {{that have to be}} protected." [...] During the two-day ministerial TPP negotiating session held in Singapore in May 2015, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and veteran negotiator, Wendy Cutler, and Oe Hiroshi of the Japanese Gaimusho held bilateral trade talks regarding one of the most contentious trade issues—automobiles. American negotiators wanted the Japanese to open their entire keiretsu structure which is the corner stone of Japanese economy and society to American automobiles. They wanted Japanese dealer networks, such as Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Mazda, to sell American cars. Oe Hiroshi responded that there are fewer American car dealerships in Japan because Japanese consumers prefer European and Japanese cars to American cars. Different vehicle safety program structures also complicate efforts at reciprocal recognition; in Japan and Europe, new vehicles are compliance-tested before they're allowed on the market. Under American laws, automakers self-certify their cars as compliant, and cars are tested only after they go on sale. Nevertheless, as of November 2015 an agreement was released whereby Japan will recognize seven U.S. vehicle safety standards as no less stringent than Japanese national standards: those for front and rear collision, flammability of interior materials, license plate lights, interior rearview mirror impact absorption, and windshield wiping, washing, and <b>defogging</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|Heating {{glass is}} mostly used for heating of windows. It is {{especially}} useful for rooms where people {{spend much time}} by the windows, at home or at work. The most common usage of heating glass—windows of cottages, office buildings and also big areas—leaded panes, translucent roofing, garret windows, canopies and so on. Heating glass is used for <b>defogging</b> and prevention of frosting of windows of pools, saunas and other buildings of such kind. Insofar as heatable glass has a current-carrying coating, {{it can be used}} as the sensor of alarm systems. When the glass is destroyed the system of protection is activated and it results in activation of alarm system. This kind of product is widely used on objects of tightened standards in questions of protection: nuclear power plants, stations of air navigation control, museums, special storehouses, etc. Heatable glass is also used in production of windows for different kinds of vehicles: electric and diesel locomotives, vessels and boats, various kinds of aircraft and automobiles. One of well-known examples of application of heating glass is armored windows, because the protective glazing is very thick and is disposed to frosting. The usage of heating glass is especially urgent in terms of being the part of armored multiple glass of Smart Glass of switchable transparency, because the heating significantly decreases the period of reaction of liquid crystals structure. The power consumed by products depends on the type of use. Power of about 50-100 watts per square meter of the window is generally enough for maintenance of comfort temperature in the room and for maintenance of glass surface temperature at the rate from +20 degrees to +30 degrees. When the heatable glass is used as the only source of heat it is necessary to maintain the glass surface temperature at the rate from +30 degrees to -45 degrees and provide the power of 100 to 300 watt for 1 square meter of the window. The power needed for vehicle windows reaches 1.5 kilowatts per square meter or more, which is why there are such tight standards in terms of sputtering of current-carrying components. Heat power of about 500-700 watts per square meter of glazing is necessary for snow unloading and taking ice-covering off the outside protective translucent constructions in low temperatures and windy environments.|$|E

Even though <b>defogging</b> algorithms have been well studied, <b>defogging</b> performance is degraded by demosaicking artifacts and sensor noise amplification in distant scenes. In order to improve visual quality of restored images, we propose a novel approach to perform <b>defogging</b> and demosaicking simultaneously. We conclude that better <b>defogging</b> performance with fewer artifacts can be achieved when a <b>defogging</b> algorithm is combined with a demosaicking algorithm simultaneously.

In addition, we validate our theoretical analysis and observations for both synthesized datasets with ground truth fog-free images and natural scene datasets captured in a raw format...|$|E
30|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to explain how several single image <b>defogging</b> methods work using a color {{ellipsoid}} framework. The foundation of the framework is the atmospheric dichromatic model which is analogous to the reflectance dichromatic model. A key step in single image <b>defogging</b> is the ability to estimate relative depth. Therefore, properties of the color ellipsoids are tied to depth cues within an image. This framework is then extended using a Gaussian mixture model to account for multiple mixtures which gives intuition in more complex observation windows, such as observations at depth discontinuities which is a common problem in single image <b>defogging.</b> A few single image <b>defogging</b> methods are analyzed within this framework and surprisingly tied together with a common approach in using a dark prior. A new single image <b>defogging</b> method based on the color ellipsoid framework is introduced and compared to existing methods.|$|E

30|$|Even though depth from {{scattering}} is {{a well-known}} phenomenon, single image <b>defogging</b> is relatively new, {{and a growing number}} of methods exist. The first methods trying to achieve single image <b>defogging</b> were presented by Tan [7] and Fattal [8]. Both authors introduced unique methods that remove fog from a single image by inferring the transmission image or map. Soon afterwards, another unique method called the dark channel prior (DCP) by He et al. [9] supported the ability to infer a raw estimate of t using a single image with fog present. The DCP method has also influenced many more single image <b>defogging</b> methods (see [10 – 16]). Within the same time frame, Tarel and Hautière [17] introduced a fast single image <b>defogging</b> method that also estimates the transmission map.|$|E

The {{unification}} {{is that all of}} these single image <b>defogging</b> methods use the prototype in (2) to estimate transmission using a dark prior.

40|$|Dark channel prior {{is a kind}} of {{statistics}} of the haze-free outdoor images, which is widely used in image <b>defogging.</b> But when the image contains a large bright region, such as sky and white object, the prior will cause color distortion in these bright regions because of the underestimated transmission. To solve this problem, a video <b>defogging</b> technology based on adaptive tolerance is presented in this paper, and it is applied to video <b>defogging</b> by combining with the guided filter. First, the transmission of each video frame is estimated according to the dark channel prior, and then it is fast refined by the guided filter for restoration. If a large bright region exists in the video frame, the transmission of these regions will be corrected according to the adaptive tolerance, which avoids the color distortion in the video <b>defogging.</b> For the video of dynamic scenes which are caused by camera motion, each frame is defogged as a single image. But for the video of static scenes whose background is almost invariant, the transmission of the background is estimated and used for the <b>defogging</b> of all the frames instead of estimating the transmission of each frame. In this way, the rate of video <b>defogging</b> is greatly improved. Experimental results show that the algorithm has a strong applicability, and the proposed method can be further used for many applications, such as outdoor surveillance, remote sensing and intelligent vehicles...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Stereo {{reconstruction}} serves many outdoor applications, {{and thus}} sometimes faces foggy weather. The {{quality of the}} reconstruction by {{state of the art}} algorithms is then degraded as contrast is reduced with the distance because of scattering. However, as shown by <b>defogging</b> algorithms from a single image, fog provides an extra depth cue in the gray level of far away objects. Our idea is thus to take advantage of both stereo and atmospheric veil depth cues to achieve better stereo reconstructions in foggy weather. To our knowledge, this subject has never been investigated earlier by the computer vision community. We thus propose a Markov Random Field model of the stereo reconstruction and <b>defogging</b> problem which can be optimized iteratively using the α-expansion algorithm. Outputs are a dense disparity map and an image where contrast is restored. The proposed model is evaluated on synthetic images. This evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves very good results on both stereo reconstruction and <b>defogging</b> compared to standard stereo reconstruction and single image <b>defogging.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm to remove fog {{from a single}} image using a Markov random field (MRF) framework. The method estimates the transmission map of an image degradation model by assigning labels with a MRF model and then optimizes the map estimation process using the graph cut-based α-expansion technique. The algorithm employs two steps. Initially, the transmission map is estimated using a dedicated MRF model combined with a bilateral filter. Next, the restored image is obtained by taking the estimated transmission map and the ambient light into the image degradation model to recover the scene radiance. The algorithm is controlled by just a few parameters that are automatically determined by a feedback mechanism.
