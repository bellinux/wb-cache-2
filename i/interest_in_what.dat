Artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An objective <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> is seen, can be discerned from the paintings of John Constable, J M W Turner, Camille Corot and from them to the Impressionists who continued the plein air painting of the Barbizon school.|$|E
25|$|These long {{distance}} journeys were not followed up, as the Chinese Ming dynasty retreated in the haijin, {{a policy of}} isolationism, having limited maritime trade. Travels were halted abruptly after the emperor's death, as the Chinese lost <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> they termed barbarian lands turning inward, and successor emperors felt the expeditions were harmful to the Chinese state; Hongxi Emperor ended further expeditions and Xuande Emperor suppressed {{much of the information}} about Zheng He's voyages.|$|E

25|$|While {{presidential campaigns}} have {{traditionally}} obtained finance by tapping wealthy, established political donors, Dean's funds came largely in small donations over the Internet; the average overall donation was just under $80. This method of fundraising offered several important advantages over traditional fundraising, {{in addition to}} the inherent media <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> was then a novelty. First, raising money on the Internet was relatively inexpensive, compared to conventional methods such as events, telemarketing, and direct mail campaigns. Secondly, as donors on average contributed far less than the legal limit ($2,000 per person), the campaign could continue to resolicit them throughout the election season.|$|E
25|$|British writer Arthur C. Benson felt shyness is {{not mere}} self-consciousness, but a {{primitive}} suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that their motives are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which {{needs to be}} uprooted. He believed the remedy is for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy to be nice, to wonder what others need and like, <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.|$|E
25|$|Ebenezer Howard's urban {{planning}} concepts were only adopted {{on a large}} scale after World War II. The damage brought on by the war provoked significant public <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> post-war Britain would be like, which was encouraged by the government, who facilitated talk about a ‘Better Britain’ to boost morale. Post-war rebuilding initiatives saw new plans drafted for London, which, for the first time, addressed the issue of de-centralisation. Firstly, the County of London Plan 1943 recognised that displacement of population and employment was necessary if the city was to be rebuilt at a desirable density. Moreover, the Greater London Plan of 1944 went further by suggesting that over one million people would need to be displaced into a mixture of satellite suburbs, existing rural towns, and new towns.|$|E

25|$|Frederick I of Prussia, Elector of Brandenburg {{and future}} King of Prussia, saw an {{immediate}} <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> Huguenot Refugees could represent for his country. Indeed, {{he was both}} a francophile and an admirer of the French. In October 1685, he published the Edict of Potsdam granting the Huguenots everything the Edict of Fontainebleau refused them: safe passage to Brandenburg, freedom {{to live and work}} where they chose, religious freedom and the right to worship in their native French, tax exemptions for 10 years, and more, going as far as granting them the same rights as citizens of the states of Brandenburg-Prussia. Meanwhile, his envoy to King Louis XIV of France's court at Versailles, the Count of Schwerin, dispensed subsidies and passports to all who requested them, provided, of course, that those requesting appeared to be of some benefit to his sovereign. As a result, the Kingdom of Prussia became for many Huguenots, in particular for the noblesse militaire, the ideal place of refuge, for Jean de Forcade de Biaix.|$|E

500|$|As a boy, Booth was {{athletic}} and popular, {{and he became}} skilled at horsemanship and fencing. He attended the Bel Air Academy (now Bel Air High School), and was a sometimes indifferent student whom the headmaster described as [...] "not deficient in intelligence, but disinclined {{to take advantage of}} the educational opportunities offered him. Each day he rode back and forth from farm to school, taking more <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> happened along the way than in reaching his classes on time". In 1850–1851, he attended the Quaker-run Milton Boarding School for Boys located in Sparks, Maryland, and later St. Timothy's Hall, an Episcopal military academy in Catonsville, Maryland, beginning when he was 13 years old. At the Milton school, students recited classical works by such authors as Cicero, Herodotus, and Tacitus. Students at St. Timothy's wore military uniforms and were subject to a regimen of daily formation drills and strict discipline. Booth left school at 14, after his father's death.|$|E
500|$|The ninth season {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews by critics and garnered negative reaction from many long-time fans and viewers. Sabadino Parker from PopMatters, called the show [...] "a pale {{reflection of the}} show it once was". Elizabeth Weinbloom from The New York Times concluded, [...] "shoddy writing notwithstanding, it was this halfhearted culmination {{of what was once}} a beautifully complicated friendship", between Mulder and Scully that ended remaining <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> was a [...] "waning phenomenon". Another The New York Times review stated, [...] "The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination." [...] The A.V. Club listed the ninth season and the 2008 film The X-Files: I Want to Believe as the [...] "bad apple" [...] of The X-Files franchise, describing the ninth season as [...] "clumsy mish-mash of stuff that had once worked and new serialized storylines about so-called 'super soldiers'". Brian Linder from IGN, on the other hand, was more positive to the ninth season, saying that the series could still have aired if the writers created a new storyline for Patrick and Gish's characters.|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety said, [...] "Beneath the wobbly pratfalls and the scatological setpieces, there's {{no denying}} the film's mean-spirited kick, or its more-than-passing <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> makes its women tick." [...] The Hollywood Reporter's critic Todd McCarthy said: [...] "It {{would have helped}} if {{director}} Nick Cassavetes had something resembling a sure hand at comedy." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club gave the film grade C-, saying [...] "All of a sudden, a spotted Great Dane squats {{in the middle of}} a Manhattan apartment and out plop several gleaming, glistening CGI turds. It's one of those cases where a Hollywood movie inadvertently summarizes itself in a single shot." [...] Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Line to line, it's fresher than any number of guy-centric [...] "Hangover"-spawned affairs, despite director Cassavetes' lack of flair for slapstick." [...] The Boston Globe's Ty Burr gave the film one out of four stars and said, [...] "It's [...] "The First Wives Club" [...] rewritten for younger, less demanding audiences, or a [...] "9 to 5" [...] with absolutely nothing at stake." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice said, [...] "The Other Woman doesn't give these actresses much to do except look ridiculous, if not sneaky and conniving." ...|$|E

500|$|Snyder's [...] "Death of the Family" [...] {{describes}} the Joker as {{in love with}} Batman, although not in a traditionally romantic way. The Joker believes that Batman has not killed him because he makes Batman better, and he loves the villain for that. Batman comic book writer Peter Tomasi concurred, stating that the Joker's main {{goal is to make}} Batman the best that he can be. The Joker and Batman represent opposites: the extroverted Joker wears colorful clothing and embraces chaos, while the introverted, monochromatic Batman represents order and discipline. The Joker is often depicted as defining his existence through his conflict with Batman. In 1994's [...] "Going Sane", the villain tries to lead a normal life after Batman's (apparent) death, only to become his old self again when Batman reappears; in [...] "Emperor Joker", an apparently omnipotent Joker cannot destroy Batman without undoing himself. Since the Joker is simply [...] "the Joker", he believes that Batman is [...] "Batman" [...] (with or without the costume) and has no <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> is behind Batman's mask, ignoring opportunities to learn Batman's secret identity. Given the opportunity to kill Batman, the villain demurs; he believes that without their game, winning is pointless. The character has no desire for typical criminal goals like money or power; his criminality is designed only to continue his game with Batman.|$|E
500|$|Sabadino Parker from PopMatters, when {{commenting on}} the series finale, said, [...] "It's also for the good, because The X-Files has long been but a pale {{reflection}} of the show it once was." [...] Brian Linder from IGN was more positive to the ninth season, saying that the series could still have aired if the writers created a new storyline for Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish's character, which The X-Files crew did not do and continued what was seen by many critics as tiresome. Aaron Kinney from Salon magazine was more negative to the new season, even joking about the new female lead, calling her a [...] "peppy new female presence." [...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ken Tucker said the show operated in what he called [...] "quaint territory", speculating that Chris Carter {{was the only one}} who seemed to understand the complex mytharc. Elizabeth Weinbloom from The New York Times concluded with, [...] "shoddy writing notwithstanding, it was this halfhearted culmination of what was once a beautifully complicated friendship", between Mulder and Scully, ended remaining <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> was a [...] "waning phenomenon".

[...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, noted that season nine [...] "does not have a great reputation among viewers". However he argued that the season contains a few [...] "hidden gems" [...] and praised those episodes which dealt with new material, while criticising other entries for focusing too heavily on [...] "plotlines and characters from years gone by".|$|E
