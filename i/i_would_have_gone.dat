"it [...] was {{the kind}} of movie <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to see when I was a kid" [...] further {{clarifying}} [...] " [...] I feel sorry for all those people that are going through that whole trip of ‘Why would Samuel Jackson do something like this?’ and ‘It’s lowbrow.’ It’s a movie. People go to movies on Saturday {{to get away from the}} war in Iraq and taxes and election news and pedophiles online and just go and have some fun and I like doing movies that are fun.” ...|$|E
500|$|... "It is {{with some}} sadness and great relief...I quit Oasis tonight. People will write {{and say what}} they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer." [...] On 6 July 2011, Absolute Radio {{uploaded}} a video to YouTube where Noel Gallagher speaks about the night Oasis ended. Noel states within this video. 'If I had my time again <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> back and done the gig. I'd have done that gig and I'd have done the next gig and we'd have all gone away and we could have probably discussed it. We may never have split up.' ...|$|E
2500|$|At almost 18 years old, Halep {{decided that}} her large breasts were interfering with her tennis and {{underwent}} a breast reduction surgical procedure to reduce her bust size; she later explained the decision, stating, [...] "It's the weight that troubles me. My ability to react quickly; my breasts make me uncomfortable when I play. I don’t like {{them in my}} everyday life, either. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> for surgery even if I hadn’t been a sportswoman." [...] She also experienced back pain. After the surgery, she moved up constantly in the world rankings, reaching world No. 2 in 2014.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, in 2010, the South Australian {{government}} recognised {{the honesty}} of Doreen and her group, formally acknowledging that “women {{members of the}} Ngarrindjeri traditional owners were genuine in the mid-1990s when {{they said that the}} construction of the bridge would violate their most sacred beliefs.” Years later, in an interview on ABC radio with Mike Sexton in 2007, Doreen described her position on this ordeal, saying: “If I was a destructive person <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>went</b> and blown it up, and that's the truth. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>went</b> and blown it up, but I hate destroying things.” Mike Sexton {{went on to say that}} “She was defiant to the end. A decade after the phrase secret women's business entered the Australian vernacular, Doreen Kartinyeri maintained her rage against the bridge at Hindmarsh Island.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> back to Joe now, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> back to Biddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, {{because my}} sense of my own {{worthless}} conduct to them was greater than every consideration. No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could never, never, undo what I had done.|$|R

2500|$|On February 16, 2003, Butler {{received}} the American Society of Cinematographers Lifetime Achievement Award. His memorable and influential work on Jaws {{is one of}} the many reasons the ASC honored him with the award, and Spielberg wrote a letter to Butler acknowledging his award which indicated the director's mutual respect for Butler and his work behind the camera. [...] "You were the calm before, during and after every storm on the set of Jaws," [...] Spielberg wrote in the letter. [...] "Without your zen-like confidence and wonderful sense of humor, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> the way of the rest of the Jaws crew — totally out of my friggin' mind. Congratulations on this well-deserved career achievement award from your peers. All my best, Steven." ...|$|E
2500|$|Years later, Susanne {{learned that}} her brother had {{actually}} survived, in part thanks to Avey, and had lived in America with his new family until his death. While he never got to meet Ernst, {{he said that his}} surviving was [...] "bloody marvellous." [...] Ernst, like Avey, refused to burden anyone with his own suffering and never talked about Auschwitz until very late in life. But, says Avey, [...] "I, too, have left it late. I will always regret not tracking Ernst down while he was alive. If I’d known he was living in America, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> and found him, without doubt. But I am proud to have played a small part in helping one man through the obscenity of Auschwitz." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Washington fumed at {{the seeming}} procrastination. When Sherman {{proposed}} his March to the Sea, Ulysses S. Grant and Henry Halleck had objected {{to it on}} the grounds that Hood would use the opportunity to invade Tennessee. In response, Sherman airily indicated that this was exactly what he wanted and that if Hood [...] "continues to march North, all the way to Ohio, I will supply him with rations." [...] However, when the ever-confident Sherman disappeared into the heart of Georgia, Grant once again became concerned about an invasion of Kentucky or Ohio. Grant later said of the situation, [...] "If I had been Hood, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to Louisville and on north until I came to Chicago." [...] His concern doubtless reflected Abraham Lincoln's concern. Lincoln had little patience for slow generals and remarked of the situation, [...] "This seems like the McClellan and Rosecrans strategy of do nothing and let the rebels raid the country." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Clayton <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> there?" [...] exclaimed Canler, visibly chagrined. [...] "Why was I not told? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> gladly <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{and seen}} that every comfort was provided." ...|$|R
2500|$|After high school, Allen [...] {{moved to}} Conway, Arkansas, {{to attend the}} University of Central Arkansas, {{where he was a}} {{business}} major and a member of Chi Alpha campus ministries. During college, he participated in Christian missionary work around the world, including in Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, South Africa, Spain and Thailand. Allen also served as a worship leader for New Life Church in Conway and Little Rock, AR, {{as well as for the}} Chi Alpha campus ministry. He dropped out of college in the middle of his junior year to pursue music professionally, performing in local bars and working as a shoe salesman to make ends meet. Allen planned to go back to college to finish his degree and [...] "get a real job", but instead was persuaded to audition for American Idol along with his brother Daniel and his friend Cale Mills. Kris stated that [...] "If I had not made it through in American Idol, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> back to college and gotten my business degree." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Clavering, smiling. [...] "It is {{scarcely}} necessary {{to explain that}} if he hadn't been <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone.</b> <b>I</b> fancied {{he was in the}} hall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my soul <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sooner <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{without the}} pig than {{have had this}} to do!" [...] said Jude. [...] "A {{creature}} I have fed with my own hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> to bed instead, the world, <b>I</b> suppose, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on, and Sir Orlando Drought <b>would</b> still <b>have</b> led the House of Commons;--but {{things should}} be looked after, I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To these savages, too!" [...] she pursued. [...] "And {{you think}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone?</b> You {{can do what}} you like with me--but not that, not that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said. [...] "Now, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> round {{by the old}} bridge, {{only that}} Allardyce told me you let him ride across this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{blacksmith}} {{meant to}} bluff you off {{and keep the}} horse," [...] said the auctioneer. [...] "If you hadn't come back soon <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> off after you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's too bad, indeed, it is!" [...] he said earnestly. [...] "Why, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{home and}} got {{the money to pay}} for the broken stuff than have that happen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you; but it {{is quite}} a matter of {{indifference}} to me. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on any account. I was saying so to Emily and Sophia when you overtook us." ...|$|R
2500|$|Dan Rather stated, [...] "if I {{knew then}} what I know now — <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{ahead with the}} story as it was aired, and <b>I</b> {{certainly}} <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> used the documents in question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{thought it}} was the dragoons,' quoth the clerk, wiping away the drops which had started out upon his brow. 'You and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> forth and smitten them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{as far as}} Sedhurst Church, madam. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> home, but I feared {{to bring}} trouble on my father, and I came back to implore you to forgive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Maud Barrington softly. [...] "Now, at least, I {{can tell}} you I am glad you went away--but if you had asked me <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A terrible scene, child, and it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{been just}} as well if you had stayed at home and slept comfortably. If I had thought {{that you were going}} to be so foolish, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> myself." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Jacksonville Jaguars {{took him}} with their first-round {{selection}} (29th overall) in the 2000 NFL Draft. Soward {{did not take the}} pressure of being a first-round selection very well. [...] "I think the hardest part for me was dealing with all the pressure after getting drafted," [...] he recalls. [...] "I didn’t play well my first year so people were on me a lot. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>went</b> to New Orleans in the second round. I wish I hadn’t ever been a first round draft pick. I felt that New Orleans had a better staff to suit me at that time. I think being with those guys <b>would</b> <b>have</b> changed my future in the NFL." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone,</b> and gladly, on this permission, {{but these}} still strong men must ever be {{justifying}} themselves. Lord Lundie {{turned to the}} husband, who {{for the first time}} spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mary, dear, don't let Mite come in. I {{am afraid}} {{it is too}} late to keep you away, but if I had felt like this yesterday, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> {{straight}} to the fever hospital.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was plucky in you {{to stick}} out as you did," [...] was Andy's comment. [...] "I don't believe I {{could have done}} it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> out {{and picked up the}} things myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not," [...] said Marston. [...] "You {{will have}} control and command my help. If I couldn't trust {{you with my}} money, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> to Africa with you. I won't grumble if you lose the lot. The thing's a speculation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Full well do I know that," [...] {{returned}} the youth, fervently. [...] "Were {{it not for}} my dear mother's love and claim on me, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> now <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> with you to heaven. As it is, I will stay by you, dear one, to the end." ...|$|R
