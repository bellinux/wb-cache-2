5|$|Among the {{progressive}} reforms advocated by McCreary and {{passed in the}} 1912 legislative session were making women eligible to vote in school board elections, mandating <b>direct</b> <b>primary</b> elections, and allowing the state's counties to hold local option elections {{to decide whether or}} not to adopt prohibition. McCreary appointed a tax commission to study the revenue system, and the Board of Assessments and Valuation made a more realistic appraisal of corporate property. McCreary created executive departments to oversee state banking and highways, and a bipartisan vote in the General Assembly established the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Near the close of the session, McCreary County was created and named in the governor's honor. It was the last of Kentucky's 120 counties to be constituted.|$|E
5|$|Campaigning on a {{platform}} of progressive reforms, McCreary defeated Republican Edward C. O'Rear in the general election. During this second term, he became the first inhabitant of the state's second (and current) governor's mansion; he is also the only governor to have inhabited both the old and new mansions. During his second term, he succeeded in convincing the legislature to make women eligible to vote in school board elections, to mandate <b>direct</b> <b>primary</b> elections, to create a state public utilities commission, and to allow the state's counties to hold local option elections {{to decide whether or not}} to adopt prohibition. He also realized substantial increases in education spending and won passage of reforms such as a mandatory school attendance law, but was unable to secure passage of laws restricting lobbying in the legislative chambers and providing for a workers' compensation program. McCreary was one of five commissioners charged with overseeing construction of the new governor's mansion and exerted considerable influence on the construction plans. His term expired in 1915, and he died three years later. McCreary County was formed during McCreary's second term in office and was named in his honor.|$|E

40|$|This article asks why, and when, {{the process}} of nominating {{candidates}} in the United States changed from conventions to <b>direct</b> <b>primaries.</b> We conduct an event history analysis to investigate rival explanations for why the rules governing nominations changed.

Another proposes that party elites adopted <b>direct</b> <b>primaries</b> to protect their internal interests. We produce some results consistent with each explanation, but find the weight of our evidence supports the idea that rules changed in response to anti-party reform pressures...|$|R
25|$|As governor, La Follette championed {{numerous}} progressive reforms, {{including the}} first workers' compensation system, railroad rate reform, direct legislation, municipal home rule, open government, the minimum wage, non-partisan elections, the open primary system, direct election of U.S. Senators, women's suffrage, and progressive taxation. He created an atmosphere of close collaboration between the state government and the University of Wisconsin {{in the development of}} progressive policy, which became known as the Wisconsin Idea. The goals of his policy included the recall, referendum, <b>direct</b> <b>primary,</b> and initiative. All of these were aimed at giving citizens a more direct role in government.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms can be {{directly}} or indirectly related {{to the loss of}} bowel control. The <b>direct</b> (<b>primary)</b> symptom is a lack of control over bowel contents which tends to worsen without treatment. Indirect (secondary) symptoms, which are the result of leakage, include pruritus ani (an intense itching sensation from the anus), perianal dermatitis (irritation and inflammation of the skin around the anus), and urinary tract infections. Due to embarrassment, people may only mention secondary symptoms rather than acknowledge incontinence. Any major underlying cause will produce additional signs and symptoms, such as protrusion of mucosa in external rectal prolapse. Symptoms of fecal leakage (FL) are similar, and may occur after defecation. There may be loss of small amounts of brown fluid and staining of the underwear.|$|E

Crossing the aisle, he became the leader of progressive Republicans, and successfully built support for the <b>direct</b> <b>primary</b> law of 1907. As a legislator, he also backed the Lake Washington Ship Canal and helped preserve shorelines for the University of Washington and for city parks. He backed local option as a step toward the prohibition of alcohol and drafted an amendment to the state constitution that granted women the right to vote in 1910, a decade ahead of the country at large. He was also instrumental in passing the law that allowed formation of port districts. The workman's compensation law he helped to write became a national model.|$|E
