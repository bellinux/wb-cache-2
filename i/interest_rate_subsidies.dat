40|$|Government {{student loan}} schemes {{typically}} have implicit <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidies</b> which, while {{these are a}} cost to taxpayers, they {{have the benefit of}} diminishing repayment burdens for graduates. Our goal is to illustrate the extent of both <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidies</b> and repayment burdens with respect to Thailand's Student Loans Fund (SLF), using methods pioneered in measurement terms by (Ziderman, 1999) and (Ziderman, 2003). Our critical innovation is to calculate repayment burdens for graduates with widely differing earnings, and we find that these generally are relatively low because the SLF is heavily subsidized. Even so, for graduates with very low income the burdens can be high. Importantly we analyze and illustrate what the repayment streams would be if the SLF was redesigned to have no <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidies</b> and find that the burdens increase to extremely high levels for the lowest income graduates. The results are considered {{in the context of the}} analysis of income contingent loan schemes for Thailand presented in Chapman and Lounkaew (this issue).

Among the most frequently mentioned incentives are sales and property tax exemptions, tax deductions and credits, rapid amortization provisions, and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidies.</b> At the present time there is little available information regarding the ability of such incentives to advance the rate of solar energy utilization. This paper describes the derivation and use of a computer simulation model designed to estimate solar energy use for space conditioning and water heating for given economic, climatic, and technological conditions. When applied to data from the Denver, Colorado metropolitan area, the simulation model predicts that sales tax exemptions would have little impact over the next decade, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidies</b> could more than double solar energy use, and the other proposed incentives would have an intermediate impact...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> credit <b>subsidies</b> on {{economic}} development in a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents, occupational choice and financial frictions. There are two financial frictions: a cost to intermediate loans and a limited liability problem which maps into the degree of enforcement of credit contracts in the economy. Occupational choice and firm size are determined endogenously by an agent’s type (ability and net wealth) and the credit market frictions. We then add a credit program in this economy that subsidizes the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on loans. There is a fixed cost (which might be null) to apply for such loans {{in the form of}} bureaucracy and regulations. We show that for the United States, an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> credit <b>subsidy</b> does not {{have a significant effect on}} output per capita, but it can have important negative effects on wages and government finances. For Brazil, a developing country in which financial repression is high and the government subsidies heavily loans, our counter-factual exercises show that if the country cuts all interest subsidies, there will no significant quantitative effect on output per capita, wages, inequality and government finances. However, when the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> is fixed at the level observed in Brazil, but access to the credit program is increased, then output and wages might both increase, as long as the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> does not not affect directly the spread on non-subsidized loans...|$|R

40|$|Land {{speculation}} by cattle ranchers {{is considered}} a principal cause of deforestation in Latin America, in particular in combination with (previously) widely provided <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Proof for the hypothesis that land speculation leads to inflated rates of investment in land is, however, relatively limited and invariably related {{to the question of}} whether land prices tend to rise over time. Based on the Neoclassical investment theory with adjustment costs we develop a stochastic cattle ranching model in which land prices are modelled as geometric Brownian motion, to evaluate the effect of expected fluctuations in land prices on land investment decisions by cattle ranchers in Latin America. For a case study in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica, results show that the expected rate of investment is almost 35 % underestimated in case land prices are assumed constant instead of fluctuating according to the standard deviation, while abolition of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidies</b> leads to an almost 15 % decrease in the expected rate of investment. Consequently, it is shown that variability in land prices alone is a sufficient condition for land speculation, inflated rates of investment in land, larger farm sizes and, thus, higher rates of deforestation in agrarian frontier areas, while this process is further promoted by subsidized livestock credit or any other form of agricultural subsidy that increases the marginal production value of lan...|$|E

40|$|There is {{significant}} irresolution {{in many countries}} concerning the design of student loan schemes. In no country recently has there been more uncertainty as to the form that loans should take than Thailand. The Student Loans Fund (SLF), a conventional approach to financing, was introduced in 1996, discontinued {{at the end of}} 2005, and re-introduced in 2007. In its place an income contingent loan (ICL) was implemented for one year only, 2006. As part of this debate we contribute {{to an understanding of the}} repayment burdens associated with the SLF in Chapman, Lounkaew, Polsiri, Sarachitti and Sitthipongpanich (in this issue). There are important issues with all ICL, and in this paper we consider the critical matter of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidies.</b> These are calculated for four different possible ICL arrangements for Thailand: the Thai Income Contingent and Allowance Loan (TICAL), a variant of TICAL, and two alternatives. With a broad-brush approach the subsidies for TICAL-type arrangements and for current debt levels turn out to be between 25 and 40 per cent, but are about zero for our suggested alternative ICLs. Using a better, more disaggregated, approach, subsidies for TICAL-type schemes are estimated to be about 30 - 55, and 3 and 18 per cent for our alternative ICLs. But with very large debts, the subsidies of all schemes are very high, implying that ICL are likely to be expensive until Thai graduate incomes rise.
