5|$|The Seventh Amendment {{guarantees}} jury {{trials in}} federal civil cases {{that deal with}} claims of more than twenty dollars. It also prohibits judges from overruling <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> by juries in federal civil trials. In Colgrove v. Battin (1973), the Court ruled that the amendment's requirements could be fulfilled by a jury {{with a minimum of}} six members. The Seventh {{is one of the few}} parts of the Bill of Rights not to be incorporated (applied to the states).|$|E
5|$|Most {{concurrent}} use proceedings {{result in a}} legal settlement between the parties. Frequently, one party will surrender its {{concurrent use}} claim and instead receive a trademark license from the other party. In other situations, each party may agree to geographic limitations on its use of the mark at issue, which the TTAB will honor if the settlement stipulates to facts which show that no confusion is likely. A benefit of such an agreement is that the parties can agree to terms {{beyond the scope of}} the TTAB's decision, such as specific restrictions on time and place of advertising, or modifications to the appearance of either mark. However, irrespective of the agreement reached, the TTAB must still make an independent finding that no consumer confusion is likely to result from the concurrent use registration. Even if both parties assert that no confusion is likely, the TTAB may still make <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> which demonstrate that confusion is likely, and deny registration to the junior user of the mark.|$|E

5000|$|Generally, {{the state}} supreme court, like most appellate tribunals, is {{exclusively}} for hearing appeals of legal issues. It does not make any <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts,</b> and thus holds no trials. In the case where the trial court made an [...] error in its <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>facts,</b> {{the state supreme}} court will remand to the trial court for a new trial.

500|$|Not {{satisfied}} with the verdict, the Bulletin again organized a campaign to fund an appeal, which was submitted to the Supreme Court of Canada; on March1, 1937, Ives' decision was overturned. [...] Chief Justice Lyman Duff, writing for the majority, accepted the jury's <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> and, echoing Justice Clarke, concluded that {{the framers of the}} Alberta Seduction Act had not intended that damage to a seductee be required to be the same as those to her father or employer (i.e. financial) in order to be actionable. [...] The court ordered Brownlee to pay $10,000 in damages to MacMillan, plus trial costs. [...] Henry Hague Davis in dissent focussed less on the questions of law and more on the evidence in the case, and argued that the jury's <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> was perverse and that the appeal should be dismissed.|$|R
25|$|The witnesses' testimonies had the {{possible}} effect of proving {{the export of}} the goods, which would have contradicted the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{that had been made}} by the DG in his investigation.

Hence, by not investigating the claims made by the applicant, the DG could not have reasonably come to the decision made by him due to the presence of plausible contradictory evidence.|$|E

25|$|Cases are calendared {{for trial}} {{as soon as}} {{practicable}} (on a first in/first out basis) after the case becomes at issue. When a case is calendared, the parties are notified by the Court of the date, time, and place of trial. Trials are conducted before one judge, without a jury, and taxpayers are permitted to represent themselves if they desire. However, the vast majority of cases are settled by mutual agreement without the necessity of a trial. However, if a trial is conducted, in due course a report is ordinarily issued by the presiding judge setting forth <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> and an opinion. The case is then closed in accordance with the judge's opinion by entry of a decision.|$|E
50|$|Oregon v.

25|$|Following {{affirmation}} by {{the state}} courts, two same-sex couples {{filed a lawsuit against}} the initiative in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in the case Perry v. Schwarzenegger (later Hollingsworth v. Perry). In August 2010, Chief Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that the amendment was unconstitutional under both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, since it purported to re-remove rights from a disfavored class only, with no rational basis. The official proponents' justifications for the measure were analyzed in over fifty pages covering eighty <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> The state government supported the ruling and refused to defend the law. The ruling was stayed pending appeal by the proponents of the initiative. On February 7, 2012, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 decision, reached the same conclusion as the district court, but on narrower grounds. The court ruled that it was unconstitutional for California to grant marriage rights to same-sex couples, only to take them away shortly after. The ruling was stayed pending appeal to the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
500|$|Justice John W. Kittredge, {{joined by}} Justice Kaye G. Hearn, dissented. [...] Kittredge {{argued that the}} state {{standards}} for {{best interest of the}} child should trump those of the ICWA, and concluded that the trial court judge erred in her <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> [...] He noted that Brown had an income of approximately $23,000 in 2010, had paid nothing to assist with pre-birth expenses, and had indicated that he did not intend to do so. [...] In addition, Kittredge stated that the record reflected that Maldonado informed both the adoption agency and the adoption attorney of the child's Cherokee heritage, but the notification to the tribe did not have the correct identifying information for the father. [...] At the child's birth, the Capobiancos were present, and Matt Capobianco cut the umbilical cord.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Harold Hitz Burton dissented, {{joined by}} Justice Felix Frankfurter.
