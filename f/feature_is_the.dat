5|$|Built between 1093 and 1537, Chester Cathedral {{includes}} {{a set of}} medieval choir stalls dating from 1380, with exquisite figurative carving. An unusual <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> very large south transept. The Early English Lady Chapel is a harmonious composition in Lancet Gothic. It retains substantial monastic buildings including a large refectory.|$|E
5|$|Dating from 1098 to 1493, Gloucester Cathedral has a Norman nave {{with massive}} masonry piers, {{and a fine}} 15th-century Perpendicular tower, but its main <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> eastern end, reconstructed in the 14th century as an early example of Perpendicular Gothic and with the largest medieval window in the world, the area of a tennis court. The cloisters have the {{earliest}} example of fan-vaulting.|$|E
5|$|Dating from 1158 to {{the early}} 16th century, Oxford Cathedral was always a small cathedral and was made smaller by the {{destruction}} {{of much of the}} nave in the 16th century. The stone spire, from 1230, {{is one of the oldest}} in England and contributes to Oxford’s tradition as “the city of dreaming spires”. Its most unusual <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> late-15th-century pendant vault over the Norman chancel.|$|E

5|$|Dating from 1177 to 1512, Rochester Cathedral has a Norman nave and crypt, and Early English choir. Its most {{remarkable}} <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> rare, exuberantly carved Norman portal, which has, unfortunately, suffered much damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} side of Mysteries of the Sith {{was received}} positively, {{but did not}} completely escape criticism. Emil Pagliarulo of The Adrenaline Vault questioned why certain features seemed to be missing from the multiplayer mode that {{were present in the}} single-player mode. One such <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> rancor which appears prominently in a single-player level but is not in any multiplayer maps.|$|E
5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top and bottom of the digit to make it more distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E

5|$|Age of Empires III {{builds on}} and {{introduces}} new features to the Age of Mythology engine, called Bang! Engine. One new <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{inclusion of the}} Havok physics simulation middleware engine on the Windows version and the similar PhysX engine on Mac OS X. This means that many events such as building destruction and tree falls will not be pre-created animations, but will be calculated according to the physics engine, in an innovation for the series. Other graphical features of the game include bloom lighting and support for pixel shader 3.0.|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} spiritual predecessor, the {{environment}} of the game {{takes the form of a}} series of isometric flip-screen rooms (which trace the outline of a large starship). There are a total of 129 rooms and most are filled with various objects, such as moveable platforms, static hazards such as spikes and hostile aliens. As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres and jumps, the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> use of remote controlled drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.|$|E
5|$|Many {{pictures}} {{depict the}} countryside at Wiedensahl and Lüthorst. They include pollarded willows, cottages in cornfields, cowherds, autumn landscapes and meadows with streams. A particular <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> use of red jackets, found in about 280 of 1000 Busch paintings and drawings. The muted or bright red coats are worn usually {{by a small}} figure, depicted from behind. The paintings generally represent typical villages. Portraits of the Kesslers, {{and a series of}} other portraits depicting Lina Weissenborn in the mid-1870s, are exceptions. A painting of a 10-year-old girl from a Jewish family at Lüthorst portrays her as serious, and having dark, oriental features.|$|E
50|$|Important <b>features</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Sierra de Neiba {{mountain}} range and Lake Enriquillo.|$|R

5|$|Most Tales {{games have}} skits, side conversations between {{different}} characters {{that can be}} both dramatic and comedic in nature. They are commonly portrayed as character portraits or profiles, with text {{along the bottom of}} the screen. They were first introduced in Tales of Destiny, though the majority were cut from the English release. In the original English GameCube release of Symphonia, the voice track for the skits was removed, but for its HD re-release, the Japanese voice track, and consequently the skit voice tracks, were included. The first English release to include fully voiced skits was Vesperia: they had been planned for Abyss, but were cut due to space issues. Another recurring <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Cooking system, where characters learn and prepare dishes to restore health and forms of experience points.|$|E
5|$|Most organisms {{synthesize}} NAD {{from simple}} components. The {{specific set of}} reactions differs among organisms, but a common <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid—either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.|$|E
5|$|New {{gameplay}} features distinguish Shadow the Hedgehog {{from previous}} Sonic games. For example, Shadow can use guns to combat enemies, adding {{an element of}} third-person shooter gameplay. Parts of the scenery, such as traffic signs, {{can also be used}} as weapons. Another new <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ability to drive vehicles, such as motorcycles and alien aircraft. Although Shadow can outrun the game's vehicles, the latter have unique capabilities, such as crushing enemies and traversing otherwise impassible acid-covered areas.|$|E
50|$|Also <b>featured</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{ability to}} unlock sickening heads, stadiums and throwback jerseys.|$|R

5000|$|Defined by length, {{the first}} {{dramatic}} <b>feature</b> film <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Australian 70-minute film The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906). Similarly, <b>the</b> first European <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 90-minute film L'Enfant prodigue (France, 1907), although {{that was an}} unmodified record of a stage play; Europe's first feature adapted directly for the screen, Les Misérables, came from France in 1909. <b>The</b> first Russian <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> Defence of Sevastopol in 1911. [...] Early Italian <b>features</b> <b>were</b> <b>The</b> Inferno (L'Inferno) (1911), Quo Vadis? (1913), The Last Days of Pompeii (1913), and Cabiria (1914). <b>The</b> first UK <b>features</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> documentary With Our King and Queen Through India (1912), filmed in Kinemacolor and Oliver Twist (1912). <b>The</b> first American <b>features</b> <b>were</b> adaptations of Oliver Twist (1912), From the Manger to the Cross (1912), Cleopatra (1912), and Richard III (1912). The latter starring actor Frederick Warde starred {{in some of these}} movie adaptations. [...] <b>The</b> first Asian <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> Japan's <b>The</b> Life Story of Tasuke Shiobara (1912), <b>the</b> first Indian <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> Raja Harishchandra (1913), the first South American <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> Brazil's O Crime dos Banhados (1913), and <b>the</b> first African <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> South Africa's Die Voortrekkers (1916). 1913 also saw China's first feature film, Zhang Shichuan's Nan Fu Nan Qi.|$|R
5|$|The Fire Station Number 4 is architecturally {{significant}} {{as an example}} of a late 19th-century Queen Anne-style firehouse. The firehouse's distinguishing <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> corbeled cornice and terracotta trim, but also it is historically {{significant as}} an example of Pawtucket's maturation as a city. The boundary for the property is listed as Plat 7B, lot 164 and includes the surrounding area, totaling less than one acre. Fire Station Number 4 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 18, 1983.|$|E
5|$|The fight {{system has}} a four-main-attack-button configuration: punch, kick, slash and heavy slash. Players may also launch taunt attacks, with their main {{objective}} {{to reduce the}} opponent's health to zero in a predetermined time. To win a fight a player must accumulate two points, with each round won earning a point. Guilty Gear X has features common in fighting games: combos, aerial attacks and counterattacks. A new <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Roman Cancel, which allows a player to cancel their move and its aftereffects to make other attacks.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Shetland {{is complex}} with {{numerous}} faults and fold axes. These islands are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny {{and there are}} outcrops of Lewisian, Dalradian and Moine metamorphic rocks with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. Similarly, there are also Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. The most distinctive <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ultrabasic ophiolite, peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which is a remnant of the Iapetus Ocean floor. Much of the island's economy depends on the oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas. In the post-glacial epoch, , the islands experienced a tsunami up to 20metres high caused by the Storegga Slides, an immense underwater landslip {{off the coast of}} Norway.|$|E
50|$|Another new and {{important}} <b>feature</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> passenger intercom, {{which could be}} used for emergencies.|$|R

5|$|The temple is a {{focal point}} of festivals of the Chinese {{community}} in Penang. The Chinese New Year celebrations are particularly impressive. For 30 days following Chinese New Year, the temple remains open until late at night whilst thousands of lights turn the scenery into a sea of light. During the festival days, the complex is decorated with thousands of lanterns representing donations offered by devotees. Another festive <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> long marches undertaken by hundreds of monks from Thailand to the temple, once or twice in a year.|$|E
