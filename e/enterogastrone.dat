40|$|The {{inhibitory}} effect {{of fat in}} the upper small intestine was studied in dogs prepared with a Heidenhain pouch, gastric fistula, and jejunal fistula. Gastric secretion was stimulated by a constant intravenous infusion of pentagastrin, and emulsified olive oil was introduced into the jejunum. The small intestine of the dog was denervated by complete transection of the mesentery except for the superior mesenteric vessels. After intestinal denervation inhibition of the vagally innervated stomach was almost abolished while that in the Heidenhain pouch was unchanged. It is concluded that either autonomic innervation {{is important in the}} formation of <b>enterogastrone</b> or, more likely, that efferent inhibitory fibres in the vagus to the stomach act synergistically with <b>enterogastrone...</b>|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that duodenal acidification strongly inhibits gastric acid secretion, gastric emptying rate and gastrin release. These effects are at least partly mediated via hormonal pathways, {{but it is not}} known wether they are mediated by the release of one peptide named in the past <b>enterogastrone,</b> or by several peptides acting together. The effects of duodenal acidification on gastric acid secretion and gastrin release can be reproduced by infusion of small doses of secretin and plasma secretin levels increase during duodenal acidification or after a meal. This peptide is thus the most probable candidate as an <b>enterogastrone.</b> It has however never been clearly shown that administration of low doses of secretin do decrease gastric emptying rate as well as acid secretion. Experiments were performed on four dogs with gastric fistulas. A peptone solution was infused into the stomach. The experiments were repeated during infusion of synthetic secretin. Our results indicate that infusion of low doses of secretin reproduce all the effects of duodenal acidification :a significant inhibition of gastric acid secretion, gastrin release and gastric emptying rate. © 1983 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

40|$|EDITORIAL SYNOPSIS Extracts of {{duodenal}} mucosa containing cholecystokinin and pancreozymin inhibited gastric motility {{completely in}} eight subjects whereas secretin extracts produced variable results. It {{is suggested that}} cholecystokinin-pancreozymin extracts may contain <b>enterogastrone.</b> The inhibition of gastric motility induced by placing fat in the duodenum was demonstrated to be humoral by Farrell and Ivy (1926). Subsequent studies on extracts of duodenal mucosa have failed to define the substance involved, although the concept that 'enterogastrone ' is a duodenal hormone inhibiting both gastric motility and acid secretion is accepted (Grossman, 1950). In recent years, specific extracts of duodenal mucosa containing cholecystokinin, secretin, and pancreozymin activity (Jorpes and Mutt, 1959) have been prepared. One of these preparations containing secretin was found to inhibit gastric acid secretio...|$|E
40|$|Glucagon-like peptide (GLP) - 2 {{is formed}} from proglucagon in the {{intestinal}} L cells and is secreted postprandially {{in parallel with}} the insulinotropic hormone GLP- 1, the latter of which, in addition, acts to inhibit gastric secretion and motility by inhibiting central parasympathetic outflow. We now studied the effect of GLP- 2 on gastric secretion stimulated by sham feeding {{to test the hypothesis}} that also GLP- 2 acts as an <b>enterogastrone.</b> Eight healthy volunteers were studied twice on separate days. They were sham fed with and without GLP- 2 infused iv at a rate of 0. 8 pmol/kg�min. Gastric contents were aspirated continuously by a nasogastric tube for determination of acid secretion, volume, and osmolarity. Sham feeding increased gastric acid secretion nearly 5 -fold. Infusion of GLP- 2 reduced incremental GLUCAGON-LIKE peptide (GLP) - 2 is one of the proglucagon-derived peptides produced in the L cells o...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effect of neurotensin on gastric secretion and gastrointestinal motility in conscious chickens. Chickens were surgically fitted with a cannula to collect secretions from the proventriculus and strain gauge transducers sutured to the gizzard, duodenum, and ileum in order to detect contractions. Peripheral in-travenous infusion of physiological levels of neurotensin inhibited pepsin output from the proventriculus, but had no effect on the volume or pH of gastric secretions. Neurotensin also inhibited both the frequency and strength of gastrointestinal contractions when compared to motility patterns following infusion of isotonic 0. 9 % (wt/vol) saline. The frequency of occurrence of small intestinal refluxes was not affected by neurotensin. These results coupled with our earlier work, which demonstrated that neurotensin is released by the presence of oleic acid in the duodenum, indicate that neurotensin may function as an <b>enterogastrone</b> released by lipids in the gastrointestinal tract of the chicken. This overall inhibitory effect of neurotensin on the avian gut indicates that it is involved in the postprandial regula-tion of digestion, especially lipid digestion...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY This paper {{confirms}} that gastric hypersecretion {{can occur in}} man and dogs after massive intestinal resection. The assumption, made by others, that hypersecretion in the clinical situation {{is similar to that}} observed in dogs is challenged. An acute hypersecretory state occurred in eight of 19 patients after massive intestinal resection. This was apparent as an increased rate of basal secretion. It was usually transient and unrelated to the length of intestine resected. A correlation was noticed between hypersecretion and jaundice in the immediate postoperative period. Histamine release after acute hepatic injury was postulated as the cause of the hypersecretion. By contrast a chronic gastric hypersecretory state was demonstrated in dogs after massive intestinal resection. The rate of basal secretion was not significantly altered. The increased daily acid output was shown to be due to prolonged and enhanced response to food. The cause was thought to be loss of inhibitory agents, such as <b>enterogastrone,</b> normally released by the small intestine when in contact with food. The rationale of performing vagotomy and pyloroplasty {{at the same time as}} the intestinal resection is questioned. A possibly important complication of massive small bowel resection, gastric hypersecretion, has recently been described in man (Frederick, Sizer, an...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Urogastrone {{has been}} {{localised}} by immunostaining to granules {{of the cells}} of human duodenal (Brunner's) glands and their ducts and of acinar cells in the human submandibular gland. The immunoreactive peptide is present in large quantities in duodenal glands and their secretory ducts. Urogastrone or human epidermal growth factor promotes cellular proliferation in vivo {{as well as in}} vitro and inhibits gastric acid secretion and may, therefore, be one of the duodenal factors inhibiting gastric activity. Thus it may have an important regulatory and protective function for the intestinal mucosa and may possibly become a useful therapeutic agent. Forty years ago it was shown that extracts of the urine of pregnant women have a beneficial effect on peptic ulcers (Sandweiss et al., 1938). Later it was reported that extracts from pregnancy urine as well as from normal human urine cause an in-hibition of gastric secretion (Culmer et al., 1939; Gray et al., 1939). The active principle was named urogastrone because of its possible relationship to <b>enterogastrone,</b> a postulated duodenal hormone inhibiting gastric acid secretion (Gray et al., 1940). Recently, urogastrone has been isolated from normal male urine (Gregory and Willshire, 1975). Subsequently, two active components were isolated and designated as f- and y-urogastrone respectively. Amino acid sequencing revealed that both substances consist of single polypeptide chains with three internal disulphide bonds containing 53 (6) and 52 (y) amino acid residues (MW approximately 600...|$|E
40|$|Intraluminal fat {{inhibits}} gastric secretion {{through as}} yet undetermined mechanisms which involve release {{of one or}} more hormonal enterogastrones. As intraluminal fat releases Peptide YY (PYY) in amounts sufficient to inhibit meal-stimulated acid secretion, this ileo-colonic peptide exhibits the characteristics required of an <b>enterogastrone.</b> The present study seeks to determine the mechanism by which PYY inhibits acid secretion by examining the effects of PYY on gastric acid stimulated by pentagastrin, histamine, and bethanechol. In addition, effects of PYY on the acid response to sham feeding and distention of a denervated gastric pouch were examined. A dose of PYY (400 pmol X kg- 1 X h- 1) was employed that reproduced blood levels observed after intestinal perfusion with oleic acid and inhibited the acid secretory response to an intragastric meal by 35 +/- 6 %. This same dose of PYY maximally inhibited histamine- and pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion by 28 +/- 7 % (P less than 0. 05), and 17 +/- 4 % (P less than 0. 05), respectively. Although PYY had no effect on bethanechol-stimulated secretion it markedly inhibited the secretory response to sham feeding, maximally reducing secretion by 90 +/- 4 % (P less than 0. 01). We speculate that PYY acts by inhibiting acetylcholine release from vagal nerve fibers rather than by inhibiting acetylcholine's action on the parietal cell. The demonstration that PYY virtually abolishes cephalic phase acid secretion while having little if any effect on the response to exogenous secretogogues gives PYY unique characteristics among the known hormonal inhibitors of gastric secretion...|$|E
40|$|Context: Glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) 7 - 36 amide, an insulinotropic hormone {{released}} from the intestinal L cells in response to nutrient ingestion, has been extensively reviewed with respect to -cell function. However GLP- 1 receptors are abundant in many other tissues. Thus, the function of GLP- 1 {{is not limited to}} the islet cells, and it has regulatory actions on many other organs. Evidence Acquisition: A review of published, peer-reviewed medical literature (1987 to September 2008) on the extrapancreatic actions of GLP- 1 was performed. Evidence Synthesis: The extrapancreatic actions of GLP- 1 include inhibition of gastric emptying and gastric acid secretion, thereby fulfilling the definition of GLP- 1 as an <b>enterogastrone.</b> Other important extrapancreatic actions of GLP- 1 include a regulatory role in hepatic glucose production, the inhibition of pancreatic exocrine secretion, cardioprotective and cardiotropic effects, the regulation of appetite and satiety, and stimulation of afferent sensory nerves. The primary metabolite of GLP- 1, GLP- 1 (9 - 36) amide, or GLP- 1 m, is the truncated product of degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase- 4. GLP- 1 m has insulinomimetic effects on hepatic glucose production and cardiac function. Exendin- 4 present in the salivary gland of the reptile, Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum), is a high-affinity agonist for the mammalian GLP- 1 receptor. It is resistant to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase- 4, and therefore has a prolonged half-life. Conclusion: GLP- 1 and its metabolite have important extrapancreatic effects particularly with regard to the cardiovascular system and insulinomimetic effects with respect to glucose homeostasis. These effects may be particularly important in the obese state. GLP- 1, GLP- 1 m, and exendin- 4 therefore have potential therapeutic roles because of their diffuse extrapancreatic actions...|$|E
40|$|Glucose-dependent insulinotropic {{polypeptide}} (GIP), {{a physiological}} incretin and <b>enterogastrone,</b> plays {{a vital role}} in regulating glucose-dependent insulin release from the pancreas and gastric acid secretion from the stomach. By using a transgenic mouse approach, we previously reported that the distal 1. 2. kb promoter region of the human GIP (hGIP) gene (- 2545 /- 346, relative to the ATG) was able to target the transgene expression in the stomach but not in the small intestine where the majority of GIP-producing cells are located. In the present study, in order to identify the cis-acting element(s) that is/are required for intestinal expression, a 1. 6. kb (- 1580 /-) DNA fragment within the first intron of the hGIP gene was isolated and characterized in three GIP-expressing cell lines including HuTu 80 (duodenal cells), PANC- 1 (pancreatic ductal cells) and Hs 746 T (stomach cells). By 5 ' and 3 ' deletion analysis, a proximal promoter element was confined within the nucleotides - 102 /- 1. This promoter element, functions in an orientation-dependent manner, was able to drive 15. 1 and 18. 3 fold increases in promoter activities in HuTu 80 and PANC- 1 cells, respectively. Site-directed mutation analysis indicated that the region - 54 /- 23 was essential for promoter function while the region - 22 /- 1 might possess opposite effects in HuTu 80 and PANC- 1 cells. In competitive and antibody supershift assays, interactions of the progesterone receptor (PR) and some unknown protein factors from HuTu 80 and PANC- 1 with the motif(s) at - 54 /- 23 were evident. Consistent with this finding, we demonstrated the transcriptional regulation of the hGIP promoter by progesterone via the PR-B isoform and that progesterone treatment in both HuTu 80 and PANC- 1 cells resulted in an increase in hGIP transcript level. In addition, a sequence motif (ACATGT) residing - 48 /- 43 was found to be responsible for the binding of potential TFII regulator(s). Taken together, our results suggest that the proximal intronic sequences contain essential cis-acting elements for the cell-specific expression of the hGIP gene. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|The human {{stomach is}} a complex organ with {{sophisticated}} function. – The control of delivery of nutrients to the small intestine is tightly regulated, and the patterns and determinants of the associated processes are numerous, complex and interrelated. The presence of nutrients in the small intestine stimulates {{the release of a}} number of gastrointestinal hormones, including glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1). Exogenous GLP- 1 reduces fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations, and this is thought to be via a slowing of gastric emptying (GE). The effects of endogenous GLP- 1 on GE and glycaemia were evaluated using exendin(9 - 39), a GLP- 1 antagonist, in healthy subjects, in a randomised, placebo-controlled study, in Chapter 5. Exendin(9 - 39) increased postprandial glycaemia through an acceleration of GE; these findings support the putative role of GLP- 1 as an <b>enterogastrone.</b> The capacity to measure GE has greatly increased the understanding of normal and disordered gastric physiology. 30 – 50 % of patients with longstanding diabetes have delayed GE. Scintigraphy remains the ‘gold standard’ in the measurement of GE, however, it is associated with a radiation burden. Recently, three-dimensional (3 D) ultrasonography was validated against scintigraphy in healthy subjects. In Chapter 6, GE was measured concurrently by 3 D ultrasonography and scintigraphy in patients with diabetic gastroparesis, and good correlation and agreement was found between both techniques. Glycaemic control represents one of the main pathogenetic factors of diabetic gastroparesis. Hyperglycaemia slows, while hypoglycaemia accelerates, GE in healthy subjects and patients with uncomplicated type 1 diabetes. Chapter 7 reports a study investigating the effects of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia vs. euglycaemia on GE in longstanding type 1 diabetes. Hypoglycaemia accelerated GE of a mixed solid/liquid meal; the magnitude of this acceleration was greater when GE during euglycaemia was slower. In contrast to glucose, the effects of intravenous (iv) fructose (used widely in the diabetic diet) on GE are less well understood. The comparative effects of iv fructose, glucose and saline on GE and antropyloroduodenal motility in healthy males are reported in Chapter 8. Compared with saline, fructose infusion was associated with a slowing of GE and suppression of antral waves, the magnitude of which was comparable to glucose. Treatment for the management of gastroparesis is currently suboptimal and {{there is a need for}} novel prokinetic agents. Itopride has demonstrated prokinetic activity in dogs. The effects of itopride on GE, glycaemia and upper gastrointestinal symptoms were studied in patients with longstanding diabetes in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial (Chapter 9). There was a trend for itopride to accelerate both solid and liquid GE. 48 % of patients had delayed solid and/or liquid GE on placebo, and in this group, itopride accelerated liquid, but not solid, GE. Autonomic neuropathy represents another pathogenetic factor of diabetic gastroparesis, and delayed GE is more prevalent in patients with autonomic dysfunction. There is evidence that C-peptide improves autonomic nerve function (ANF) in type 1 diabetes. The effects of C-peptide on GE and ANF were studied in patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes in randomised, placebo-controlled design, in Chapter 10. C-peptide had no effect on solid or liquid GE, or ANF. Gastroparesis, particularly in patients with diabetes, represents an important clinical problem. The studies presented in this thesis have provided fundamental insights into the measurement and determinants of gastric motor function and postprandial glycaemia, and treatment of gastroparesis, however, further studies which assess the complex pathogenesis and pathophysiology of gastroparesis, and which include a larger cohort of patients, are warranted.
