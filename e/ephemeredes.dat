40|$|International audienceGeV {{measurements}} of pulsar light curves versus energy {{provide information on}} beam geometry, and spectral cut-offs give insights into the particle acceleration region(s) around the neutron star. The two together can help build a better picture of neutron star populations in the galaxy. We {{are on the verge}} of instrumental break-through that promise to increase the sample of measured objects by ~ 10. This talk describes instruments for multi-GeV pulsations for the next few years. We'll cover developments of ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov detectors, review AGILE's prospects, and then focus on the LAT (Large Area Telescope) on GLAST, including sensitivity estimations. Accurate radio <b>ephemeredes</b> can greatly enhance the gamma-ray pulsar science, and we will describe efforts to build a large <b>ephemeredes</b> database...|$|E

40|$|Static GPS {{measurements}} {{have been}} used for precise surveying over two decades. Nevertheless, consistent information about relation between accuracy, baseline length and observing time has been missing. Surveyors have been dependent on the information from various sources (vendors of the GPS equipments, ambiguous guidelines by different companies and institutions, etc) as well as on their own experiences. The outcome of this study gives a relation between the accuracy, baseline length and observing time for static GPS as an easily readable graph. The chart covers all the conventional baseline lengths and observation times as well as broadcast and precise <b>ephemeredes.</b> This study is a part of an ongoing project that studies the quality of geodetic GPS at the Finnish Geodetic Institute. We used data that covers distances between 0. 6 and 1, 069 km and observing sessions between 10 min and 24 hours. Over 10, 000 baselines were processed with broadcast and precise <b>ephemeredes.</b> The set of data used in the study is a random sample chosen from the data from several GPS campaigns. This way it was to give a realistic picture of accuracy by averaging e. g. the influence of atmosphere and satellite geometry. Th...|$|E

40|$|The {{planetary}} ephemeris is {{an essential}} tool for interplanetary spacecraft navigation, studies of solar system dynamics (including, for example, barycenter corrections for pulsar timing <b>ephemeredes),</b> the prediction of occultations, and tests of general relativity. We are carrying {{out a series of}} astrometric VLBI observations of the Cassini spacecraft currently in orbit around Saturn, using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). These observations provide positions for the center of mass of Saturn in the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) with accuracies ~ 0. 3 milli-arcsecond (1. 5 nrad), or about 2 km at the average distance of Saturn. This paper reports results from eight observing epochs between 2006 October and 2009 April. These data are combined with two VLBA observations by other investigators in 2004 and a Cassini-based gravitational deflection measurement by Fomalont et al. in 2009 to constrain a new ephemeris (DE 422). The DE 422 post-fit residuals for Saturn with respect to the VLBA data are generally 0. 2 mas, but additional observations are needed to improve the positions of all of our phase reference sources to this level. Over time we expect to be able to improve the accuracy of all three coordinates in the Saturn ephemeris (latitude, longitude, and range) by a factor of at least three. This will represent a significant improvement not just in the Saturn ephemeris but also in the link between the inner and outer solar system <b>ephemeredes</b> and in the link to the inertial ICRF.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{response}} to the accumulation of the first substantial collection of observational data from the CHARA Array, obtained during the fall of 2001, a series of Mathcad programs has been developed {{as a means for}} reducing these data to calibrated visibilities. The Mathcad tools developed to date include routines that calculate estimated visibilities for single and double stars, <b>ephemeredes</b> from binary star orbital elements, (u,v) plane and projected baseline coverage for target stars, and the analysis of an observational dataset to yield a mean value of raw visibility. This Technical Report describes the last of these programs and presents the results from a set of data obtained during the night of 6 Nov 2001 for the extrasolar planetary system upsilon Andromedae...|$|E
40|$|Improvements to the {{automated}} co-registration and change detection software package, AFIDS (Automatic Fusion of Image Data System) has recently completed development for and validation by NGA/GIAT. The improvements involve {{the integration of}} the AFIDS ultra-fine gridding technique for horizontal displacement compensation with the recently evolved use of Rational Polynomial Functions/ Coefficients (RPFs/RPCs) for image raster pixel position to Latitude/Longitude indexing. Mapping and orthorectification (correction for elevation effects) of satellite imagery defies exact projective solutions because the data are not obtained from a single point (like a camera), but as a continuous process from the orbital path. Standard image processing techniques can apply approximate solutions, but advances in the state-of-the-art had to be made for precision change-detection and time-series applications where relief offsets become a controlling factor. The earlier AFIDS procedure required the availability of a camera model and knowledge of the satellite platform <b>ephemeredes.</b> The recent design advances connect the spacecraft sensor Rational Polynomial Function, a deductively developed model, with the AFIDS ultrafine grid, an inductively developed representation of the relationship raster pixel position to latitude /longitude. As a result, RPCs can be updated by AFIDS, a situation often necessary due to the accuracy limits of spacecraft navigation systems. An example of precision change detection will be presented from Quickbird...|$|E
40|$|The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on Fermi, {{launched}} on 2008 June 11, is a space telescope {{to explore the}} high energy gamma-ray universe. The instrument covers the energy range from 20 MeV to 300 GeV with greatly improved sensitivity and ability to localize gamma-ray point sources. It detects gamma-rays through conversion to electron-positron pairs and measurement of their direction in a tracker and their energy in a calorimeter. This thesis presents the gamma-ray light curves and the phase-resolved spectral measurements of radio-loud gamma-ray pulsars detected by the LAT. The measurement of pulsar spectral parameters (i. e. integrated flux, spectral index, and energy cut-off) depends on the instrument response functions (IRFs). A method developed for the on-orbit validation of the effective area is presented using the Vela pulsar. The cut efficiencies between the real data and the simulated data are compared at each stage of the background rejection. The results are then propagated to the IRFs, allowing the systematic uncertainties of the spectral parameters to be estimated. The last part of this thesis presents the discoveries, using both the LAT observations and the radio and X <b>ephemeredes,</b> of new individual gamma-ray pulsars such as PSR J 0205 + 6449, and the Vela-like pulsars J 2229 + 6114 and J 1048 - 5832. Timing and spectral analysis are investigated in order to constrain the gamma-ray emission model. In addition, we discuss the pro perties of a large population of gamma-ray pulsars detected by the LAT, including normal pulsars, and millisecond pulsars...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{photometry}} of the intermediate polar V 647 Aur. Observations were obtained over 42 nights in 2012 and 2013. The total duration of the observations was 246 h. We clearly detected three oscillations with periods of 932. 9123 + 0. 0011, 1008. 30797 + 0. 00038 and 1096. 955 + 0. 004 s, {{which may be the}} white dwarf spin period and two orbital sidebands, accordingly. The oscillation with a period of 932. 9123 s has a quasi-sinusoidal pulse profile with a slightly changeable semi-amplitude from 10. 9 mmag in 2012 to 12. 5 mmag in 2013. The oscillation with a period of 1008. 30797 s has a slightly asymmetric pulse profile with a remarkable small hump on the ascending part. The semi-amplitude of this oscillation is highly changeable both in a time-scale of days (26 - 77 mmag) and in a time-scale of years (47 mmag in 2012 and 34 mmag in 2013). The oscillation with a period of 1096. 955 s has a highly asymmetric pulse profile with a semi-amplitude of about 6 mmag. The three detected oscillations imply an orbital period of 3. 46565 + 0. 00006 h. By comparing our data with the data of B. T. Gansicke et al., which were obtained 8 years ago, we discovered that the spin period of the white dwarf in V 647 Aur decreases with dP/dt=(- 1. 36 + 0. 08) X 10 ^- 10. This important result should be confirmed by future observations. Our oscillation <b>ephemeredes</b> and times of maxima can be useful for this confirmation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{land vehicle}} {{navigation}} using very few GPS updates is studied {{in this paper}} using a low-cost MEMS sensors assembly integrated with a conventional GPS receiver. The sensors assembly is composed of triad of accelerometers, gyrometers, magnetometers {{as well as a}} pressure sensor, and can easily be taken in or off the car. Since in most of cities, downtown areas block GPS signals, conventional receivers {{may not be able to}} compute 3 D or even 2 D fixes. Therefore, to augment the availability of the position solution in harsh environments, pseudorange and pseudorange rate measurements are fused in a Kalman Filter (KF) with the Dead Reckoning (DR) solution provided by the sensors assembly following a tight integration scheme. In the developed vehicular navigation algorithm, the MEMS sensors are used to provide reliable attitude information of the vehicle. It also propagates the position of the vehicle in three dimensions. A conventional GPS receiver gives pseudorange and pseudorange rate measurements for the tight integration. External <b>ephemeredes</b> are used to estimate the satellite Doppler contribution in the user-to-satellite Line Of Sight (LOS). Results show that as soon as two satellites are tracked, the overall accuracy of the integrated positioning system increases. Moreover, the availability of the position solutions is also augmented. Depending on the type of harsh environments, namely classical or deep urban canyons, heavy map-matching algorithms are not required with such low-cost sensors integration. However, the integration scheme is dependent on the satellite geometry with respect to the user's heading. When a bad satellite configuration is detected, the Integrated Navigation System (INS) relies exclusively on the IMU data. As a consequence, the INS may experience systematic drift for long periods (> 1 min) without any GPS updates...|$|E
