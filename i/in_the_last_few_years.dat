5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> of his life. On a personal level, Keynes's charm {{was such that}} he was generally well received wherever he went – even those who found themselves {{on the wrong side}} of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E

Wiggins had a very difficult time with his father's death in May 1990.|$|E
5|$|Through {{much of this}} portion, {{the road}} is divided, with a tree-lined median strip. Businesses, both local and national, line {{both sides of the}} road and traffic is heavy. It crosses some other major strips such as Niagara Falls Boulevard (U.S. Route62 or US62), a major {{contributor}} to traffic on Sheridan due to the proximity of the Boulevard Mall, and Millersport Highway (NY263), which feeds the Amherst campus of the University at Buffalo. In Amherst it meets the Youngmann Expressway (I-290) where NY240 (Harlem Road), reaches its northern end. Past the Youngmann development abates, green returns to the roadside and the median ends, although the road remains four-lane and high-volume. There is another pocket of development around the Wegmans supermarket north of Williamsville, which has seen some rapid growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

5|$|His legend {{had begun}} growing even during his lifetime, as {{he became a}} hero of poems and songs. Few {{negative}} rumors about him, popular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> of his life, survived after his death. During the period of Enlightenment in Poland he was written about by poets and writers such as Stanisław Potocki, Franciszek Karpiński, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Franciszek Ksawery Dmowski. A biography by Michał Krajewski cemented his legend of a hero rescuing Poland from anarchy and invasion. That legend that became even stronger during the times of the partitions of Poland in the 19th century, where the artists of the Polish romanticism period used him {{as a symbol of}} patriotism, and a reminder of military successes. He appears in the poem Przedświt of Zygmunt Krasiński, but much more significant was his portrayal in The Trilogy of Henryk Sienkiewicz, particularly the second book, The Deluge.|$|E
5|$|John Appleyard had profited {{in terms}} of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was {{nevertheless}} disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently {{on behalf of the}} Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley's innocence but thought it would be an easy matter to find out the real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming the jury had not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.|$|E
