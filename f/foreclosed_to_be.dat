50|$|In {{virtually}} all jurisdictions, specific procedures for foreclosure {{and sale of}} the mortgaged property apply, and may be tightly regulated by the relevant government. There are strict or judicial foreclosures and non-judicial foreclosures, also known as power of sale foreclosures. In some jurisdictions, foreclosure and sale can occur quite rapidly, while in others, foreclosure may take many months or even years. In many countries, the ability of lenders <b>to</b> <b>foreclose</b> <b>is</b> extremely limited, and mortgage market development has been notably slower.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{traces the}} history of {{mortgage}} law in the United States. I explore {{the history of}} foreclosure procedures, redemption periods, restrictions on deficiency judgments, and foreclosure moratoria. The historical record shows that the most enduring aspects of mortgage law stem from case law rather than statute. In particular, the ability of creditors <b>to</b> <b>foreclose</b> nonjudicially <b>is</b> determined very early in states’ histories, usually before the Civil War, and usually in case law. In contrast, the aspects of mortgage law developed through statute change more frequently. This finding calls into question whether common law is inherently more flexible than the civil-law system used in some other countries. However, case law tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less responsive <b>to</b> populist pressures than statutes. My {{findings suggest that the}} reason common law favors financial development <b>is</b> unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> its greater flexibility relative to law made by statute...|$|R

At {{the beginning of}} the century, Aaron Dare, former head of the Northeast New York chapter of the Urban League, began filing falsified mortgage applications for a variety of Albany properties, including Historic Pastures Village Apartments, through his company, Emerge Real Properties. He and his co-conspirators made it appear that they had the capital to borrow [...] from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to buy the properties. After the closing, he failed to repay the loans and they quickly went into default, forcing HUD <b>to</b> <b>foreclose.</b> He <b>was</b> eventually investigated and arrested.

50|$|A {{mortgagor}} is {{the borrower}} in a mortgage—he owes the obligation secured by the mortgage. Generally, the borrower {{must meet the}} conditions of the underlying loan or other obligation in order to redeem the mortgage. If the borrower fails to meet these conditions, the mortgagee may <b>foreclose</b> <b>to</b> recover the outstanding loan. Typically the borrowers will be the individual homeowners, landlords, or businesses who are purchasing their property by way of a loan.|$|R
5000|$|When {{mortgage}} borrowers <b>are</b> unable <b>to</b> {{meet their}} repayment terms, lenders may opt <b>to</b> <b>foreclose.</b> <b>To</b> avoid foreclosure, the lender and the borrower {{can make an}} agreement called [...] "forbearance". According to this agreement, the lender delays their right to exercise foreclosure if the borrower can catch up to their payment schedule in a certain time. This period and the payment plan depend {{on the details of}} the agreement that are accepted by both parties.|$|R
