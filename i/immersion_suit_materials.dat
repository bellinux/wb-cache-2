40|$|The ISO Thermal Manikin Working Group {{has been}} tasked {{to assess the}} {{suitability}} to include thermal manikins in the standard for the current <b>immersion</b> <b>suit</b> approval testing. Five international laboratories {{were involved in a}} round robin test to measure the thermal resistance of <b>immersion</b> <b>suits.</b> The objectives are (1) to assess the uniformity of thermal resistance of suits derived from different manikins, to attempt to quantify the errors caused by methodology, tools and calculation methods; and (2) to evaluate the difference in thermal resistance output between manikin and human for the same <b>immersion</b> <b>suit.</b> The results of the tests conducted at National Research Council Canada, Institute for Ocean Technology (NRC-IOT) are documented in this report. In air, the thermal resistance of a manikin wearing only test clothing was determined to be 1. 408 clo. The thermal resistance of a manikin wearing a non-insulated <b>immersion</b> <b>suit</b> and an insulated suit, with SOLAS RTD lifejacket over test clothing were 2. 442 clo and 2. 574 clo, respectively. In water, under uniform cooling conditions, the thermal resistance for a non-insulated <b>immersion</b> <b>suit</b> and an insulated <b>immersion</b> <b>suit</b> were 0. 532 clo and 1. 355 clo, respectively. Under non-uniform cooling conditions, the results can be up to 25 % different from those conducted in uniform cooling conditions. It is concluded that under uniform cooling conditions, the constant temperature control mode of thermal manikins and the parallel method can be used to determine thermal resistance. Further research and development are needed before thermal manikins could be used with confidence for suit evaluation under non-uniform cooling conditions. To provide the scientific evidence that manikins can be used as an evaluation tool for <b>immersion</b> <b>suits,</b> {{it is also important to}} assess the thermal resistance of humans and manikins in the same environmental conditions, concurrently, in the same laboratory.

40|$|Many {{international}} and national standards {{exist for the}} testing and certification of <b>immersion</b> <b>suits.</b> Some require the thermal protective properties of <b>immersion</b> <b>suits</b> to be tested with human volunteers in calm, circulating 2 °C water. The knowledge gap that currently exists between the benign testing conditions used in international standards and specifications, and the harsh environments that an immersed individual find themselves in following a marine accident, could result in unexpectedly poor levels of performance, with fatalities occurring sooner than expected following accidental immersion. Study 1 determined the heat loss from the skin of volunteers in <b>immersion</b> <b>suits</b> and immersed in wind and waves. Twelve healthy participants (Age: 25. 8 [5. 9] years old; Mass: 81. 7 [13. 1]kg; Height: 176. 2 [7. 7]cm) performed four, one hour immersions in the following conditions: Calm water; Wind-only; Waves-only; and Wind + Waves. Compared to Calm (67. 21 [4. 70]W·m- 2), all the other immersion conditions produced a significantly greater increase in mean skin heat flow (MSHF) (Wind: 79. 60 [6. 70]W·m- 2; Waves: 78. 8 [4. 52]W·m- 2; Wind + Waves: 92. 00 [8. 39]W·m- 2). The Wind + Waves condition produced a significantly greater increase in MSHF compared to all other conditions. Study 2 built upon {{the findings of the}} first by investigating the extent to which human thermal responses were related to the severity of weather conditions. Twelve healthy males (Age: 23. 9 [3. 3] years old; Mass: 83. 2 [4. 9]kg; Height: 181. 0 [4. 9]cm) performed three, three hour immersions in the following conditions: Calm water; Weather 1; and Weather 2. Compared to the calm water condition (62. 96 [2. 98]W·m- 2], both weather conditions produced a significantly greater increase in MSHF (Weather 1 : 76. 75 [6. 26]W·m- 2; Weather 2 : 79. 53 [6. 24]W·m- 2). There {{were no significant differences in}} the change in gastro-intestinal temperature (TGI) across immersion conditions (Calm: - 0. 10 [0. 31]°C; Weather 1 : - 0. 29 [0. 30]°C; Weather 2 : - 0. 20 [0. 28]°C]. There were no significant differences in V · O 2 across immersion conditions (Calm: 0. 325 [0. 054]L·min- 1; Weather 1 : 0. 332 [0. 108]L·min- 1; Weather 2 : 0. 365 [0. 080]L·min- 1). Study 3 investigated the effect of simulated water ingress under an <b>immersion</b> <b>suit</b> on human thermal responses during immersions in varying weather conditions. Twelve healthy males (Age: 25. 6 [5. 6] years old; Mass: 82. 7 [10. 2]kg; Height: 181. 0 [4. 7]cm) performed three, three hour immersions in the same conditions as Study 2, but with 500 mL of water underneath the <b>immersion</b> <b>suit.</b> Compared to the calm water condition (79. 45 [9. 19]W·m- 2), both weather conditions produced a significantly greater increase in MSHF (Weather 1 : 102. 06 [11. 98]W·m- 2; Weather 2 : 107. 48 [3. 63]W·m- 2). There were no significant differences in the change in TGI (Calm: - 0. 35 [0. 14]°C; Weather 1 : - 0. 38 [0. 15]°C; Weather 2 : 0. 29 [0. 25]°C) or V · O 2 (Calm: 0. 449 [0. 054]L·min- 1; Weather 1 : 0. 503 [0. 051]L·min- 1; Weather 2 : 0. 526 [0. 120]L·min- 1) across conditions. Survival times were calculated for the participants of Studies 2 and 3. There was no difference in the predicted survival times for the Study 2 participants for both the calm (> 36 hours) and wind and wave conditions (> 36 hours). The predicted survival times for the participants of Study 3 were significantly lower in the turbulent conditions (16 hours) compared to calm (27 hours). The predicted survival times of the participants in turbulent conditions were up to half those calculated for calm water immersions. The results collected in Studies 2 and 3 were used to calculate the change in total insulation in varying conditions compared to being dry. Immersions in wind and waves will reduce <b>immersion</b> <b>suit</b> insulation by 27 %; 500 mL of water leakage will reduce it by 24 %; wind, waves and 500 mL of water combined will reduce it by 43 %. The predicted amount of oxygen consumption (V · O 2 P) to produce the amount of heat required to remain in thermal balance can be estimated by rearranging the equations used to calculate metabolic heat production and insulation. If heat loss exceeds the assumed maximum heat production of 206 W·m- 2, hypothermia will eventually develop. The point at which heat loss exceeds maximum heat production has been determined in a range of conditions. It is concluded that: immersions in wind and waves causes a significant increase in heat flow from the body compared to calm conditions. Testing individuals and <b>immersion</b> <b>suits</b> in conditions not representative of the area where they are to be used may, or may not, result in an over-estimation of performance depending on the capacity of an individual’s thermoregulatory system.
