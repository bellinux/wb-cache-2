25|$|After the {{conversion}} to dial service in 1949, San Jose telephone numbers started with names including ALpine-, ANdrews-, BAldwin-, CLayburn-, and CYpress-. As the North American <b>Dialing</b> <b>Plan</b> {{evolved in the}} 1950s, these became today's 25x-, 26x-, 22x-, 258-, and 29x-numbers, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{previous}} permissive <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> included a mass calling prefix for radio station contests, introduced in the 1960s because some contests put unacceptable loads on the Bay Area's telephone switches. Until the 1980s, radio station call-in contests throughout the Bay Area used 575-numbers. Electromechanical switching equipment of the day had been engineered to accommodate large call volumes to 575-numbers. Large numbers of calls would otherwise have overloaded switching equipment causing slow dial tone and blocked long distance circuits.|$|E
25|$|When area codes were {{introduced}} in 1947 San Jose was assigned to area code 415 {{along with the rest}} of the San Francisco Bay Area and much of northern California. Area code 408 was created on January 1, 1959, and included most of Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Monterey and San Benito Counties. Until the late 1970s, there was permissive dialing between (408) and (415). At the time, the entire East Bay, peninsula, and on to Marin County was in area code (415). Phone numbers were not duplicated across (415) and (408), so subscribers could dial seven-digit San Francisco or Berkeley numbers without dialing an area code and the call would go through. Population growth, facsimile machines, and pagers caused demands for numbers to outrun the capacity of this permissive <b>dialing</b> <b>plan.</b> The additional demands for PCS and cellular phone numbers helped necessitate the (831)/(408) area code split, the (650)/(415) split, and the earlier (510)/(415) split.|$|E
40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} on {{the impacts of}} closing a national <b>dialling</b> <b>plan.</b> It clarifies the differences between numbering <b>plans</b> and <b>dialling</b> <b>plans,</b> and shows that the closure of a <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> fosters a more efficient use of a numbering plan. The report draws the following conclusions: Closing the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> facilitates more efficient use of the numbering plan as it releases additional numbers for use for operators, subscribers and services. Geographic significance in numbers is not automatically removed when closing the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan.</b> Removing the geographic significance in numbers fosters an even more efficient use of numbering capacity within a numbering <b>plan.</b> Closing the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> may be a prerequisite for further possible evolution of a national numbering plan, {{but there is no}} link between a <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> and geographic numbering significance, i. e. a country may choose to close its <b>dialling</b> <b>plan,</b> but still keep the geographic significance of numbers. Although in many countries location portability is considered as a voluntary service aspect, closing the <b>dialling</b> <b>plan</b> and removal of geographic significance of numbers will widen the scope of location number portability to the whole country. This means that the geographic information of a number will graduall...|$|R

Neighboring facilitates the use of <b>dial</b> <b>plans</b> such as the Global <b>Dialing</b> Scheme. <b>Dial</b> <b>plans</b> facilitate “inter-zone” <b>dialing</b> so that two endpoints in separate zones can still communicate with each other.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> in {{some areas}} permits dialing numbers in the local calling area without using area code or city code prefixes. [...] For example, a {{telephone}} number in North America consists of a three-digit area code, a three-digit central office code, and four digits for the line number. If the area has no area code overlays, seven-digit dialing may be permissible for calls within the area, but some areas have implemented mandatory ten-digit dialing.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> {{establishes}} the permitted sequences of digits dialed on subscriber or station lines with subscriber premises equipment, such as telephones and {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) systems. [...] Dialing plans in the public switch telephone network (PSTN) have traditionally been more {{commonly referred to as}} dialing procedures. The <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> of a private telephone system or a customer premise equipment, such as an analog telephone adapter (ATA) or an IP phone, is sometimes also called dial plan. The digit sequences (numbers) permissible in a <b>dialing</b> <b>plan</b> may be as short as a single digit, e.g. for reaching an operator, or as long as a complete international telephone number, including trunk prefixes and international prefixes.|$|E

50|$|Voice over IP {{adapters}} can be networked and configured {{to provide}} automatic ringdown by selecting a <b>dial</b> <b>plan</b> which replaces the empty string with a predefined number or SIP address, dialed immediately.
