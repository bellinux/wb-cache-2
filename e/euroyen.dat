50|$|More generally, the euro- prefix {{can be used}} to {{indicate}} any currency held in a country where it is not the official currency: for example, <b>Euroyen</b> or even Euroeuro.|$|E
50|$|TIBOR is {{calculated}} {{based on the}} quotes for different maturities provided by reference banks at about 11.00 a.m. each business day. There are two forms of TIBOR rates: Japanese Yen TIBOR rate (introduced in November 1995, it reflects rates in unsecured call market) and <b>Euroyen</b> TIBOR rate (introduced in March 1998, it reflects rates in offshore market).|$|E
50|$|Eurobonds {{are named}} after the {{currency}} they are denominated in. For example, <b>Euroyen</b> and Eurodollar bonds are denominated in Japanese yen and American dollars respectively. Eurobonds were originally in bearer bond form, payable to the bearer and were also free of withholding tax. The bank paid the holder of the coupon the interest payment due. Usually, no official records were kept. The word Eurobond was originally created by Julius Strauss.|$|E
5000|$|A {{short-term}} interest rate (STIR) future is a futures contract that derives its value from the interest rate at maturation. Common {{short-term interest}} rate futures are Eurodollar, Euribor, <b>Euroyen,</b> Short Sterling and Euroswiss, which are calculated on LIBOR at settlement, {{with the exception of}} Euribor which is based on Euribor. This value is calculated as 100 minus the interest rate. Contracts vary, but are often defined on an interest rate index such as 3-month sterling or US dollar LIBOR.|$|E

40|$|Using the {{spectral}} regression and Gaussian semiparametric methods of estimating the long-memory parameter, we test for fractional dynamic {{behavior in a}} number of important Japanese financial time series: spot exchange rates, forward exchange rates, stock prices, currency forward premia, <b>Euroyen</b> deposit rates, and the <b>Euroyen</b> term premium. Stochastic long memory is established as a feature of the currency forward premia, <b>Euroyen</b> deposit rates, and <b>Euroyen</b> term premium series. The martingale model cannot be rejected for the spot, forward, and stock price series. Time series, long memory, spectral regression, Gaussian semiparametric method...|$|E

The conflicting evidence {{obtained from the}} application of tests against a unit root as well as tests against stationarity provides the motivation for testing for fractional roots. Significant evidence of positive long-range dependence {{is found in the}} <b>Euroyen</b> returns series. The estimated fractional models result in dramatic out-of-sample forecasting improvements over longer horizons compared to benchmark linear models, thus providing strong evidence against the martingale model.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the empirical investigation of monetary policy independence as this is manifested in the inter–relationships between domestic and foreign money market interest rates. Instead of following an ad–hoc econometric approach, we have imposed a specific economic structure on the proposed model by establishing a link of the yield curves of two different countries through the Uncovered Interest Rate Parity, UIP. The expectations hypothesis of the term structure and the UIP imply certain overidentifying restrictions on the cointegrating space of a vector autoregressive process consisting of the interest rates of the two markets. The model has been tested on data from the domestic US money market and the euromark and <b>euroyen</b> markets. The main finding of our analysis is that we reject the overidentifying restrictions of the models for the USD/DEM case but we are unable to reject them for the USD/JPY case, at the one percent significance level and this implies that the term spreads of the <b>euroyen</b> market are being affected, in the long run, by changes of the US short Fed funds rate. cointegration, expectations theory, uncovered interest parity, eurocurrency markets, Granger causality...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether Japan's financial deregulation {{weakened the}} linkage between the <b>Euroyen</b> and Gensaki markets. It defines and analyzes the linkage of the two markets {{in terms of the}} persistence and predictability of yield spreads, as well as cross-market causality. By using Johansen tests and an error correction model, this paper shows first, cross-market causality before and after deregulation; and second, one common trend in interest rates, substantial Gensaki-Euroyen yield spreads, and a slower response of the one-month Gensaki-Euroyen yield spread to a shock after deregulation.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} nature of the {{relationship}} between the daily offer rates for 90 day <b>Euroyen</b> quoted in two markets Tokyo (TIBOR) and London (LIBOR). We investigate the dynamics of the two series, and the spread between the two series, before and after February 1995. This later period coincides with deterioration in the credit quality of Japanese rate setting banks. The lack of cointegration in the two series and the non-stationarity of the spread after February 1995 prevented traders from profiting from the spread reversal, which characterized the pre- 1995 series...|$|E

40|$|Pricing in the <b>Euroyen</b> {{market is}} based on LIBOR, the London Interbank Offer Rate, set at 11 am London time or TIBOR, the Tokyo Interbank Offer Rate, set at 11 am Tokyo time. Since the TIBOR panel is {{dominated}} by Tokyo city banks while the LIBOR panel is dominated by non-Japanese banks, the changing TIBOR-LIBOR spread reflects the credit risk associated with Japanese banks or the 'Japan premium. ' In this paper, we investigate the determinants of this 'Japan premium. ' The spread is modeled {{as a function of}} determinants of bank default and firm value suggested by a theory of credit spreads. Our results suggest that systematic variation in the spread can be explained by interest rate and stock price effects along with public information flows of good and bad news regarding Japanese banking, with a separate individual role for Japanese bank credit downgrades and upgrades. ...|$|E
40|$|This study gives a high {{frequency}} one- minute tick data {{analysis of the}} Japanese 3 month <b>Euroyen</b> LIBOR interest rate futures and 10 year Japanese Government Bond futures markets in response to scheduled macroeconomic announcements for a 9 year period encompassing January 2005 to December 2013. Following Ederington and Lee (1993), four announcements significantly affect the interest rate futures return volatility, and five significantly affect that of the government bond futures_ Two components of market efficiency, namely serial correlation of returns and volatility persistence are investigated. Japanese futures markets are seen as efficient, {{with most of the}} significant price reaction occurring within the first minute. Sharp peaking of volatility in excess of five times than that obtained during non- announcement days confirm that it is caused by the announcements. Volatility persisted at much higher values for the first twenty minutes, and remained slightly elevated even after one hour_ This study also finds no evidence that the impacts on the futures markets are driven by the news component of the macroeconomic announcement release...|$|E
40|$|This paper takes {{stock of}} the state of {{financial}} integration in East Asia. It contrasts the international integration of equity markets, the regional integration of the markets for bonds and syndicated loans denominated in US dollars, and the insularity of most local currency bond markets. In the last, it finds that the regional issuance in the Japanese foreign bond ('Samurai') and <b>euroyen</b> markets did not recover from the shocks during and after the Asian financial crisis. However, it finds a strong element of regional integration in the 'Uridashi' market in which Japanese investors have bought relatively large sums of Australian and New Zealand dollar bonds. Regional central banks have sought to jump-start development of domestic bond markets by investing limited amounts of their official foreign exchange reserves in each other's domestic bond markets. The willingness of Japanese investors to take on the currency risk of the Australian and New Zealand dollars offers hope that capital can flow within the region without the vehicle of an extra-regional currency. The largely global integration of East Asian equity markets highlights the risk of opening bond markets to global investors if institutional investors in the region remain sidelined in domestic assets. Without a substantial regional bid for equities, investors in individual economies can end up bearing the brunt of heavy selling by global investors. If institutional investors in the region were able to invest more abroad, they could help lend stability to local bond markets...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the well established empirical fact that conditional correlations among cross-country interest rates switch signs. Switching implies an alternation of coupling and decoupling of global bond markets over time. This evidence is robust to alternative estimation schemes. Here {{we use a}} seminonparametric (SNP) model with a BEKK-GARCH variance function to estimate conditional second moments both to confirm these results and to provide auxiliary models for structural estimation of term structure models. Using an extensive historical analysis, we find that major driving forces behind the sign-switching behavior of conditional correlations between the Eurodollar rate and the <b>Euroyen</b> rate are synchronization and dis-synchronization of business cycles and coordination and discoordination of monetary policies triggered by international policies and financial market crashes. Especially, {{we find that the}} two interest rates are more likely to couple when both the U. S. and Japan slip into a recesion while the likelihood of decoupling is highest when both economies are in expansion. We also explore whether proposed International Affine Term Structure Models (IATSMs) and International Quadratic Term Structure Models (IQTSMs) are able to reproduce the sign-switching behavior of conditional correlations among crosscountry interest rates. We find that a small subset of the IATSMs can generate sign-switching behavior but only by forgoing their ability to describe other features such as the positivity of nominal interest rates, heteroskedasticity in volatility, and correlations among underlying state variables. In contrast, the IQTSMs are able to generate it without limiting their ability to describe other dynamic features. Using the MCMC-Efficient Method of Moments (EMM), we test the empirical performance of the models in reproducing the sign-switching behavior of conditional correlations. The result suggests that the IATSMs conclusively fail to capture it while the IQTSMs are relatively successful but fail to reproduce ephemeral ones. ...|$|E
