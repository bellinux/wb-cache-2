25|$|During the Falklands War, the Gazelle {{played a}} {{valuable}} role operating from the flight decks of Royal Navy ships. Under a rapidly performed crash programme {{specifically for the}} Falklands conflict, Gazelles were fitted with 68mm SNEB rocket pods and various other optional equipment such as armour plating, <b>flotation</b> <b>gear</b> and folding blade mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|The first IAR 330 NAVAL {{helicopter}} was officially unveiled at Ghimbav on 30 January 2007. The Romanian Naval Forces ordered three of this variant. The helicopter is {{in a similar}} configuration to the Romanian Air Force variant, including the SOCAT upgrade package; the Navy aircraft also have <b>flotation</b> <b>gear</b> fitted under the nose and main undercarriage fairings. They are operated from Navy frigates for search and rescue, medevac and maritime surveillance missions.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{aftermarket}} modifications and upgrades {{are available}} for 200 and 300 Series King Airs. One company offers a Wing Front Spar Reinforcement Kit for 200 Series aircraft and a modification to replace the electro-mechanical landing gear retraction system of early-build aircraft with an electro-hydraulic system. Raisbeck Engineering out of Seattle, WA offers Enhanced Performance Leading Edges, Nacelle Wing Lockers, Ram Air Recovery System, Quiet Turbofan Propellers, High <b>Flotation</b> <b>Gear</b> Doors and Dual Aft Body Strakes.|$|E
25|$|Viking Air production, first {{delivered}} in July 2010, powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-34 engines, and available on standard landing gear, straight floats, amphibious floats, skis, wheel skis, or intermediate <b>flotation</b> landing <b>gear.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Takeoff {{and landing}} {{distance}} {{requirements for the}} plane at maximum-load gross weight are [...] and , respectively. Its high <b>flotation</b> main landing <b>gear</b> provides 28 wheels to distribute gross weight on paved or earth surfaces. The rear main landing gear {{can be made to}} caster to make a smaller turning radius, and rotates 90 degrees after takeoff before being retracted. [...] "Kneeling" [...] landing gear permits lowering the aircraft when parked, thereby presenting the cargo deck at truck-bed height to facilitate loading and unloading operations.|$|R
25|$|The Gazelle {{is capable}} of {{transporting}} up to five passengers and up to 1,320 pounds of cargo on the underside cargo hook, or alternatively up to 1,100 pounds of freight in 80 cubic feet of internal space {{in the rear of}} the cabin. Armed variants would carry up to four HOT (Haut subsonique Optiquement Téléguidé Tiré d'un Tube) wire-guided anti-tank missiles, or a forward firing 20mm cannon mounted to the fuselage sides with its ammunition supply placed in the cabin. Various optional equipment can be installed upon the Gazelle, such as fittings for engine noise suppression, 53 gallon ferry tanks, a rescue winch capable of lifting up to 390 pounds, emergency <b>flotation</b> <b>gear,</b> particle filter, high landing skids, cabin heater, adjustable landing lights, and engine anti-icing systems. While the Gazelle had been developed under a military-orientated design programme, following the type's entry to service increasing attention to the commercial market was paid as well. The type was marketed to civil customers; notably, civilian operator Vought Helicopters at one point had a fleet of at least 70 Gazelles. Civil-orientated Gazelles often included an external baggage access door mounted beneath the main cabin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main rotor}} hub has a single piece {{aluminum}} hub with elastomeric bearings designed not to require lubrication or {{any other kind of}} maintenance throughout its design life. The main rotor blades have titanium spars and incorporate a ten degree twist to give an even loading when hovering, while they use a non-symmetrical airfoil section with a drooped leading edge. The rotor tips are tapered and swept back. Flight controls are servo-assisted, with a Stability Augmentation System fitted. A retractable nosewheel undercarriage is fitted, which gives the S-76A a [...] increase in cruising speed; emergency <b>flotation</b> <b>gear</b> can be fitted using helium-filled bags to increase buoyancy {{in the event of a}} forced landing on water.|$|E
50|$|During the Cold War, the Swedish Stridsvagn 103 main {{battle tank}} carried <b>flotation</b> <b>gear</b> {{all the time}} and was therefore, theoretically, always amphibious.|$|E
50|$|Most Oryx are {{equipped}} with a 50m hydraulic hoist, rated for up to 2 personnel, for use in rescue operations. Additionally a large metal A-frame structure can be fitted in the cargo bay which allows up to 4 personnel to rappel or abseil from the aircraft simultaneously. Oryx operating from coastal squadrons are fitted with emergency <b>flotation</b> <b>gear</b> on the sponsons and nose.|$|E
50|$|The Romanian Naval Forces ordered three IAR 330 Puma Naval helicopters, {{with the}} last one being {{commissioned}} in December 2008. The helicopters are in a similar configuration {{to those of the}} Romanian Air Force, including the SOCAT upgrade package; the Navy Pumas also have <b>flotation</b> <b>gear</b> fitted under the nose and main undercarriage fairings. They are currently operated from Navy frigates for search and rescue, medevac and maritime surveillance missions.|$|E

50|$|The turbine powered S-62 {{could carry}} more weight and fly {{faster than the}} H-19 (S-55). The {{aircraft}} was first conceived and designed to be amphibious so that <b>flotation</b> <b>gear</b> would not be required for over water flights, and rescues could be made by landing on the water. The fuselage is watertight for landings on water or snow. Two outrigger floats resist pitching and rolling on the water. Although the HH-52A looks {{very different from the}} Sikorsky H-19, it used many of the same components.|$|E

Under a rapidly performed crash programme {{specifically for the}} Falklands conflict, Gazelles were fitted with 68mm SNEB rocket pods and various other optional equipment such as armour plating, <b>flotation</b> <b>gear</b> and folding blade mechanisms.Two Royal Marines Gazelles were shot down {{on the first day}} of the landings at San Carlos Water. In a high-profile incident of friendly fire on 6 June 1982, an Army Air Corps Gazelle was mistaken for a low-flying Argentine C-130 Hercules and was shot down by HMS Cardiff, a British Type 42 Destroyer.|$|E
50|$|The Scout AH Mk 1 was {{operated}} by the Army Air Corps on general light work, including observation and liaison. Like the Wasp, the Scout could be fitted out with different role equipment including <b>flotation</b> <b>gear</b> and a Lucas, air-driven hoist which had a lift capacity of 600 lb. In the light attack role, it was capable of carrying one pintle machine gun in the rear cabin (it is possible to carry two pintle-mounted GPMGs in the cabin, although this would, unsurprisingly, be somewhat cramped) or two forward-firing 7.62mm L7 General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs) fixed to the undercarriage skid. These GPMG combinations were sometimes used in unison to great effect.|$|E
50|$|Various {{optional}} equipment can be installed, such as removable co-pilot flight controls, wire-string protection, a forward looking infrared (FLIR) sensor system, instrument flight rules (IFR) training fittings, radio altimeter, emergency medical system, moving map, external loudspeakers and/or search light, <b>flotation</b> <b>gear,</b> and an external cargo sling. Much {{of the external}} equipment {{is designed to be}} held on external extension arms; overall, the SW-4 can mount/carry a useful payload of up to nearly 600 kilograms. Both basic and advanced trainer variants of the SW-4 have been developed to conform with NATO standards and military pilot training regulations, it is promoted as possessing a high level of inherent flight stability and safety; the advanced model is compatible with night vision goggles (NVG) and is equipped with an emergency simulation unit.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{fuselage}} and <b>flotation</b> <b>gear</b> of the He 114 were completely conventional, its wing arrangement was highly unusual. The upper set of wings {{was attached to}} {{the fuselage}} with a set of cabane struts, as in a parasol wing monoplane, whereas the lower set was of much lesser span while having approximately the same chord. (Note that this general layout isn't especially unusual, and is known as a [...] "Sesquiplane", or a biplane which has a smaller lower wing. Typically, the lower wing is about 3/4 of the span of the upper wing, and has a smaller chord as well. The He 114 has a much shorter lower wing than usual, but has the same chord as the upper wing, which keeps the wing area ratio similar.) ...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to various civil roles, the EC120 {{has also been}} used by several military operators to conduct training, observation and light utility missions. Airbus Helicopter has promoted the type in a training capacity due to features such as positive control response, performance computation systems, modern instrumentation for ease of use, overall compact size, and {{a high level of}} cabin visibility. A wide range of optional equipment can be installed upon the EC120 B, this includes a wire strike protection system, air conditioning, sand filter, skis, windshield wipers, electrical external mirrors, a cargo sling, emergency <b>flotation</b> <b>gear,</b> forward looking infrared (FLIR) cameras, and external spotlights. For corporate customers, the EC120 can be equipped with a Stylence interior, offering a luxurious interior with leather upholstery, in-flight office and telecommunications facilities, along with reduced noise and vibration levels via additional insulation.|$|E
5000|$|Following the war Dagnall founded his own company, {{which has}} since become famous for {{pneumatic}} dinghies and barrage balloons. The RFD name is now synonymous with [...] "Rapid Floatation Device" [...] and the supply of marine and aviation safety equipment. He had researched <b>flotation</b> <b>gear</b> of various sorts, and in 1918 he built {{some of the earliest}} rubber dinghies. RFD moved to Guildford in 1926 and expanded to Catteshall Lane, Godalming, in 1936 the Godalming factory burnt down and was rebuilt in 1954. In 1959 RFD merged with Perseverance Mill. In 1963 it took over Elliot Equipment and acquired GQ Parachute Company Ltd. It purchased Mills Equipment Company in 1968. In 1970 the three companies merged to form RFD-GQ In 1975 RFD-GQ divided into: - RFD Inflatables Ltd - GQ Parachutes Ltd - RFD Systems Engineering Ltd - RFD Mills Equipment Ltd.|$|E
5000|$|A later variant, the F2A-2, {{of which}} 43 were {{ordered by the}} U.S. Navy, {{included}} a more powerful R-1820-40 engine, a better propeller, and integral <b>flotation</b> <b>gear,</b> but still lacked pilot armor and self-sealing tanks. The increase in engine power was welcomed, but to some extent offset by the increased loaded weight (5,942 lb/2,701 kg) of the aircraft; while top speed was increased to a respectable 323 mph (520 km/h) at 16,500 ft (5,029 m), initial climb rate dropped to 2,500 ft/min. Both the F2A-1 and the F2A-2 variants of the Brewster were liked by early Navy and Marine pilots, including Pappy Boyington, who praised the good turning and maneuvering abilities of the aircraft. Boyington {{is alleged to have}} opined [...] "...the early models, before they weighed it all down with armor plate, radios, and other equipment, they were pretty sweet little ships. Not real fast, but the little aircraft could turn and roll in a phone booth." [...] This might be expected from the low wing loading, in earlier versions comparable with the Mitsubishi A6M Zero's 22 pounds per square foot.|$|E

The fuselage of the aircraft is of mixed metal and composites construction; the nose is composed of fiberglass while the cabin primarily employs a light alloy honeycomb structure, the semi-monocoque tailboom is also constructed of light alloy. [...] Two pilots (or a pilot and a passenger) sit side by side in the cockpit, situated ahead of the cabin, which can accommodate a further 12 passengers in three rows of four, or four to eight passengers in more luxurious executive seating.|$|E
50|$|Morris {{notices that}} the {{concrete}} around the grille {{in his cell}} is weak and can be chipped away, which evolves into an escape plan. Over {{the next few months}} Morris, the Anglins and Butts dig through the walls of their cells with spoons (which have been soldered into makeshift shovels), make papier-mâché dummies to act as decoys, and construct a raft out of raincoats. On June 11, 1962, the inmates decide to leave. Wolf has been released from solitary confinement and prepares to stab Morris with a knife, but English is able to intercept him. That night, Morris, the Anglins and Butts plan to meet in the passageway and escape. Butts panics and fails to rendezvous with them. Carrying the <b>flotation</b> <b>gear,</b> Morris and the Anglins access the roof and avoid the searchlights. From there, they scramble {{down the side of the}} building into the prison yard, climb over a barbed-wire fence and make their way to the shoreline of the island where they inflate the raft. The three men enter the water; partially submerged, they cling to the raft and use their legs as the primary propelling force and kicking. When their escape is discovered the following morning, a massive manhunt ensues. The warden does not want to blemish his perfect record and insists that the men drowned, despite no bodies being found. On a rock on the shore of Angel Island, he finds a chrysanthemum and throws it in the water after being told that they do not grow there.|$|E
40|$|The present {{configuration}} of the Hydrowing 80 has been developed {{on the basis of}} a product specification and a requirements specification prepared accordingly. The basic {{configuration of}} the Hydrowing 80 consists of the following main components: fuselage and <b>flotation</b> <b>gear,</b> wing and control surfaces, hydrofoil. To secure the crucial functions of the Hydrowing 80 in this project phase one has initially used trial-and-error results and coarse approximations with regard to stresses, shapes and structures. All project partners then used the so determined configuration for their special investigations without any modifications. First configuration modifications resulting from the Hydrowing 80 investigations are taken into account as early as during Phase 1 of the TEBEF project, while the general further development of the configuration falls under Phase 2.
