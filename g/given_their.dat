5|$|Amazon {{lost three}} in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded. The discrepancy in losses during the action is likely due to the extreme difficulty the French crew had in aiming their guns <b>given</b> <b>their</b> ship's instability in heavy seas.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power <b>given</b> <b>their</b> tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|After the engagement, the Allies {{received}} news of {{the defeat}} of the Allied army at Thermopylae. Since their strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, and <b>given</b> <b>their</b> losses, the Allies decided to withdraw to Salamis. The Persians overran Boeotia and captured the now-evacuated Athens. However, seeking a decisive victory over the Allied fleet, the Persians were later defeated at the Battle of Salamis in late 480 BC. Fearing being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia, leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece. The following year, however, saw an Allied army decisively defeat the Persians at the Battle of Plataea, thereby ending the Persian invasion.|$|E

Edmontosaurus was also reported from the Javelina Formation of Big Bend National Park, western Texas based on TMM 41442-1, but was later referred to Kritosaurus cf. navajovius by Wagner (2001), before being assigned to Kritosaurus sp. by Lehman et al.
