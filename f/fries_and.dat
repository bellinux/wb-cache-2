5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french <b>fries</b> <b>and</b> mashed potato) {{also make}} {{up part of}} Zimbabwean cuisine.

5|$|The {{baguette}} sandwiches {{were introduced}} to Europe starting in the UK in 2003, with several new varieties designed to cater to the population mix of the country. While the baguette sandwiches were well received {{and continue to be}} sold, several red flags have been raised by the British government and private groups in regards the healthiness of these and other products sold by the fast food industry. In 2005, British Food Standards Agency (FSA) cited large levels of fats and salt in the company's beef-based Monterey Melt baguette and chided BK for backing out of an agreement to help make the company's products healthier. In 2007 the private public interest group Consensus Action on Salt and Health, abbreviated to CASH, cited Burger King and other fast food chains over the continued levels of sodium contained in these types of foods. The group specifically claimed that the Chicken BLT Baguette sandwich, when paired with <b>fries</b> <b>and</b> a Coca-Cola, was one of the three saltiest fast food products in the UK.|$|E

40|$|A {{study on}} shallow and parfrying in soybean oil as {{alternatives}} to deep <b>frying</b> <b>and</b> evaluation of stability of a formulated antioxidant {{administered to the}} oil was conducted.
