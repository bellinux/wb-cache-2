Almost all indicators are found to improve short-run <b>growth</b> <b>forecasts</b> whereas the results for four-quarter-ahead <b>growth</b> <b>forecasts</b> and the prediction of recession probabilities in general are mixed.

A quarterly series of current and one-year-ahead <b>growth</b> <b>forecasts</b> is constructed as the average of forecasts published by Belgian institutions.

The consensus <b>growth</b> <b>forecasts</b> will be evaluated graphically, statistically and econometrically. The conclusion is that the Belgian consensus forecast is rather good, although some efficiency tests are not passed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
