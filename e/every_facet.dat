Through combination of the qualitative (interview, observation) and quantitative (self-completed questionnaire) some meaningful insights on the issues investigated were obtained. Similar to urban, modernization slightly altered the Malay wedding foodways in the rural parallel with socio-economics, life styles and emergence of the modern equipments.

50|$|Though {{almost all}} {{crystals}} of cuprite {{are far too}} small to yield faceted gemstones, one unique deposit from Onganja in Seeis, Namibia, which was discovered in the 1970s, has produced crystals which were both large and gem quality. Virtually <b>every</b> <b>faceted</b> stone over one carat (0.2 gm) in weight is from this single deposit, which has long been mined out. The number of faceted gems over two carats (0.4 gm) is difficult to estimate, but according to Joel Arem, one-time curator for the Smithsonian National Gem and Mineral Collection in Washington DC, faceted cuprite of any size {{is considered one of}} the most collectible and spectacular gems in existence, with its deep garnet coloring and higher brilliance than a diamond. Only the gem's soft nature prevents it from being among the most valuable jewelry stones.|$|R

25|$|The {{distinctive}} Mayan calendar {{used two}} main systems, one plotting the solar year of 360 days, which governed the planting of crops and other domestic matters; the other called the Tzolkin of 260 days, which governed ritual use. Each {{was linked to}} an elaborate astrological system to cover <b>every</b> <b>facet</b> of life. On the fifth day {{after the birth of}} a boy, the Mayan astrologer-priests would cast his horoscope to see what his profession was to be: soldier, priest, civil servant or sacrificial victim. A 584-day Venus cycle was also maintained, which tracked the appearance and conjunctions of Venus. Venus was seen as a generally inauspicious and baleful influence, and Mayan rulers often planned the beginning of warfare to coincide with when Venus rose. There is evidence that the Maya also tracked the movements of Mercury, Mars and Jupiter, and possessed a zodiac of some kind. The Mayan name for the constellation Scorpio was also 'scorpion', while the name of the constellation Gemini was 'peccary'. There is some evidence for other constellations being named after various beasts. The most famous Mayan astrological observatory still intact is the Caracol observatory in the ancient Mayan city of Chichen Itza in modern-day Mexico.|$|E

Using triangulation approach of interview and self completed questionnaire this study empirically examine the level of alteration of Malays wedding foodways which relate to the preparation and consumption of it {{and its impact on the}} community social bonding. Some meaningful insights were obtained whereby modernization through technology (modern equipments) and social factors (education, migration, and high disposal income) significantly contribute to the alteration of wedding foodways from preparation up to consumption stages. The domino effect of this alteration consequently leads to the fragility of social kinship or somehow reduced cohesiveness and interaction among the individual of Malay society in the rural area...|$|R
