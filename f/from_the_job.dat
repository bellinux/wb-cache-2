O'Donnell talked to his friend Michael Salvatori, who had his own recording studio, and offered to split the profits <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> with him; the two became constant partners.|$|E

The Weinbergs subsequently moved to Flatbush, where in 1924 Pincus became the first president of the East Midwood Jewish Center.|$|E
5|$|Hutton captained the England Test team between 1952 and 1955, {{although}} his leadership was at times controversial. He pursued a cautious approach and faced criticism for negativity. Never {{comfortable in the}} role, Hutton felt that the former amateur players who administered and governed English cricket did not trust him. In 23 Tests as captain, he won eight Tests and lost four with the others drawn. Worn out by the mental and physical demands of his role, Hutton retired from regular first-class cricket during the 1955 season. Knighted for his contributions to cricket in 1956, {{he went on to}} be a Test selector, a journalist and broadcaster. He also worked as a representative for an engineering firm until retiring <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> in 1984. Hutton remained involved in cricket, and became president of Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1990. He died a few months afterwards in September 1990, aged 74.|$|E
5|$|The team {{nickname}} is The Lions, previously The Dockers. The original Dockers name arose <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> {{of many of}} the club's {{supporters in}} the early 1900s. The club did not like the moniker and changed the nickname after press headlined Millwall as 'Lions of the South', after knocking Football League leaders Aston Villa out of the 1899–1900 FA Cup. Millwall, then a Southern League side, went on to reach the semi-final. The club adopted the motto: We Fear No Foe Where E'er We Go. In the 2000s the club started to recognise its unique link with London's docks by introducing Dockers' Days, and archiving the club's dock roots in the Millwall FC Museum. Dockers' Days bring together past successful Millwall teams who parade on the pitch at half-time. Supporters who were dockers are allowed to attend the game for free. In 2011, Millwall officially named the east stand of The Den as the 'Dockers Stand' in honour of the club's former nickname.|$|E
30|$|The {{main steps}} of the {{simulation}} are: (1) build a membrane system from an specification file; (2) using the generated membrane system, construct and execute a grid job: (i) Map: create a job for each membrane; (ii) reduce: gather all <b>the</b> responses <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> and create <b>the</b> resulting membrane system. The simulation repeats step 2 {{as long as a}} rule is applied. Each generated job contains an object that describes a membrane <b>from</b> <b>the</b> system. <b>The</b> <b>job</b> is responsible for the correct simulation of the evolution of the membrane. Thus, it needs to synchronize with other membranes, and also to apply different rules. The result of <b>the</b> <b>job</b> consists of <b>the</b> final state of the simulated membrane.|$|R

Her part was that of Reet, a schoolgirl who helps her classmates fight against a sinister man distributing free computers to her school. She did not earn much <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> and at age 16, a lack of funds forced Winslet to leave Redroofs. To support herself, she worked at a delicatessen. In 1992, she had a small part in the television film Anglo-Saxon Attitudes, an adaptation of Angus Wilson's satirical novel of the same name. Winslet, who weighed 185 pounds at the time, played the daughter of an obese woman in it. While filming, an off-hand comment from the director Diarmuid Lawrence about the likeness between her and the actress who played her mother prompted Winslet to lose weight. She next took {{on the role of the}} young daughter of a bankrupt middle-aged man (played by Ray Winstone) in the television sitcom Get Back (1992–93). She also had a guest role in a 1993 episode of the medical drama series Casualty.|$|E

The judge criticised both sides for allowing the case to reach court, pointing out that total costs were £22million, including £1million for photocopying. Multiplex's ultimate bill is estimated to be over £10million. In 2007, Multiplex also contested a claim from its concrete contractor, PC Harrington, that Multiplex owes £13.4million to PC Harrington.|$|E

Mount's primary dislike <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> arose from the constant lobbying of individuals for patronage jobs and party leaders' demands. Several progressive agenda items were enacted during his term, including compulsive school attendance laws, requiring all children between age eight and fourteen attend school. Anti-trust laws, a number of industry regulations on worker health and safety, and food and drug quality were also passed during his term.|$|E
