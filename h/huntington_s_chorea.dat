40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that not only mesostriatal but also mesolimbic pathways are involved in the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease. Using quantitative ligand autoradiography we have investigated dopamine transporter sites in basal ganglia of patients affected by Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>chorea,</b> Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. [3 H]Mazindol, a ligand for catecholamine uptake, was used in the presence of desipramine to block the binding to norepinephrine uptake sites. Schizophrenic cases were entered in the study {{to take into account the}} effects of neuroleptics, commonly administered also to Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s disease patients, on dopamine uptake sites. In control cases high densities of [3 H]mazindol binding sites were found in the caudate nucleus, putamen and nucleus accumbens, whereas very low densities were present in substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. In Huntington 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>chorea</b> the density of [3 H]mazindol binding sites was slightly decreased in the caudate nucleus, an area severely affected by the neurodegenerative process. In schizophrenic patients the density of dopamine uptake sites in the basal ganglia was slightly reduced, mainly in the middle third of putamen. Both Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy populations were characterized by a marked loss of [3 H]mazindol binding sites in the neostriatum (about 75...|$|R

40|$|Chorea is an {{involuntary}} movement disorder characterized by brief, abrupt, non-repetitive, non-rhythmic movements with dance-like appearance, {{moving from one}} body part to another. When chorea involves half of the body then the term hemi-chorea is used, which usually signify structural pathology in the contralateral Basal ganglia. Use of Oral contraceptive pills, is a well-established but a rare cause of hemi-chorea. Mechanism includes either re-activation of Sydenham 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>chorea</b> or drug induced lupus erythematosus.

40|$|Respect for {{the rights}} and freedoms of Russian {{citizens}} belonging to LGBT (gay, bisexual and transgender people), is an important problem in modern Russia. According to human rights activists, the adoption of laws against the "promotion of homosexuality" {{has been the most}} disturbing development in recent years regarding the rights of LGBT people in Russia. Russian politicians explain the necessity of such laws with reference to the fight against debauchery and the desire to protect the health and morals of children. They evoke family values. The UN Committee on Human Rights has found that such laws violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. According to human rights treaties, the law banning "propaganda of homosexuality" violates the right to freedom of assembly, the right to freedom of expression and other rights. Moreover, the treatment of LGBT people in Russia has caused tension and foreign policy clashes in Russia s relations with other countries. This thesis asks whether the foreign policy clash over the treatment of LGBT people makes sense in the context of Samuel <b>Huntington</b> <b>s</b> theory of the clash of civilizations, Does <b>Huntington</b> <b>s</b> theory work here? I will thus examine whether the narratives of Russian politicians discussing the treatment of the LGBT community in Russia can be treated as instances of civilizational identity building. As the narratives are not homogeneous it argued that this is not only confrontation between purely Western values and values unique to Russia but also a confrontation within the state, where citizens or mostly policy makers consider this issue from the different points of view. The key primary sources of this thesis are Foreign Affairs documentations, comments and interviews by a set of Russian politicians. As a research method, the thesis uses narrative method. Several documents are compared with each other to find points of contact and separation, and the main task is to find whether a civilizational difference underlies this debate...|$|R

The results effectively discriminate between affected and non-affected individuals, while also quantifying the temporal progression of neurodegenerative disease phenotypes. Measures may be analyzed individually or combined into a composite phenotype score for greater statistical power. The ideal combination of the four described measures will depend upon the disorder in question.

40|$|Background Recent {{quantitative}} neuroimaging {{studies have}} been successful in capturing phenotype and genotype-speci fi c changes in dementia syndromes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson ? s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. However, the majority of imaging studies are cross-sectional, despite the obvious superiority of longitudinal study designs in characterising disease trajectories, response to therapy, progression rates and evaluating the presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative conditions. Objectives The aim of this work is to perform a systematic review of longitudinal imaging initiatives in neurodegeneration focusing on methodology, optimal statistical models, follow-up intervals, attrition rates, primary study outcomes and presymptomatic studies. Methods Longitudinal imaging studies were identi fi ed from ? PubMed ? and reviewed from 1990 to 2014. The search terms ? longitudinal ?, ? MRI ?, ? presymptomatic ? and ? imaging ? were utilised in combination with one of the following degenerative conditions; Alzheimer ? s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease, frontotemporal dementia, <b>Huntington</b> ? <b>s</b> disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson ? s disease, ataxia, HIV, alcohol abuse/ dependence. Results A total of 423 longitudinal imaging papers and 103 genotype-based presymptomatic studies were identi fi ed and systematically reviewed. Imaging techniques, follow-up intervals and attrition rates showed signi fi cant variation depending on the primary diagnosis. Commonly used statistical models included analysis of annualised percentage change, mixed and random effect models, and non-linear cumulative models with acceleration ? deceleration components. Discussion and conclusions Although longitudinal imaging studies have the potential to provide crucial insights into the presymptomatic phase and natural trajectory of neurodegenerative processes a standardised design is required to enable meaningful data interpretatio...|$|R

40|$|Ultimo January and primo February 2006 Norway (and Denmark) {{experienced}} {{burning of}} their national flags in Palestine, burning of embassies and consulates in Syria, Lebanon, Iran, and Norway s ISAF-forces in Afghanistan were attacked. This thesis will focus on how some leading Norwegian newspapers, Aften, Aftenposten, Dagbladet, Dagens Næringsliv, Dagsavisen and VG handled and covered an unexpected controversy, the Mohammed cartoons crisis. The conflict with origin in Denmark had surprising impact on Norwegian domestic and foreign policy, on the domestic discourses of Freedom of speech, on media discourse and on Norway as a heterogeneous society. The events in Norway are of particular importance, since the reprinting of the Muhammed cartoons here 10 th January 2006 triggered a global escalation of the cartoons conflict. The media discourse was influenced by Samuel <b>Huntington</b> <b>s</b> clash of civilizations -theories, directly or indirectly, us versus them - the Muslims in general, as minority in Norway and raging men in the Middle East - worthy an unworthy victim-hood, {{as well as the}} media s distinction between the internal and external other, creating heroes, demons and villains. Freedom of speech became a substantial part of the media discourses, in the shape of fundamentalism as well as tolerance, and the reconciliation meeting, the peace solution 10 th February, was characterised by both these approaches and attitudes. The analysis of the newspaper coverage that I present, has the overall perspective of War- versus Peace- or nuanced journalism, showing how the media contributed to escalate the conflict domestically and abroad, but also the media s attempts to encourage dialogue and reconciliation; disclosing some surprising aspects of how conflicts like these are handled in the Norwegian newsrooms. <SUMMARY...|$|R

40|$|Póster presentado en la European C. elegans Meeting, celebrada en Berlín del 14 al 17 de mayo de 2014. Protein {{aggregation}} {{is a major}} {{hallmark of}} many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington Diseases. However, the signaling events and molecular pathways governing this aggregation process are not completely understood. Huntington Disease and other polyQ diseases are characterized by an abnormal CAG codon expansion (that encodes the amino acid glutamine) inspecific genes. When these CAG expansions increase above a threshold of 35 to 40 glutamine residues, the resulting protein shows toxic gain-of-function features, associated to protein misfolding and aggregation. Using Caenorhabditis elegans models of polyQ diseases we have identified a novel protective role of glutathione reductase (GSR- 1) against polyQ aggregation and toxicity. First, we found that gsr- 1 RNAi downregulation inworms expressing the fusion protein Q 40 ::YFP caused a strong developmental arrest while Q 35 ::YFP animals developed normally. This phenotype was phenocopied by treatment with buthionine sulphoximine (an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis) and diethyl maleate (a glutathione depletory), confirming that 40 glutamine residues set the pathological threshold of polyQ proteins alsoinworms. Consistently, Q 40 ::YFP animals carrying a gsr- 1 loss of function mutation showed a remarkable increase of polyQ aggregation in muscle cells. Interestingly, embryos from Q 40 ::YFP worms lacking gsr- 1 display a striking phenotype consisting incell membrane blebbing and explosion, a phenotype that is much milder inQ 35 ::YFP; gsr- 1 embryos. Finally, our results demonstrate that, inC. elegans, the gsr- 1 gene encodes two isoforms that localize to cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively. Importantly, the cytoplasmic variant is shown to be essential for C. elegans viability while animals devoid of the mitochondrial isoform have no phenotype. Our future plans will focus on validating the results obtained with C. elegans in mammalian cell culture and mice models of <b>Huntington</b> <b>s</b> Disease and other polyQ Diseases. In addition, we will explore the role of glutaredoxins and other glutathione-dependent enzymes in worm models of polyQ and other aggregation-dependent neurodegenerative diseases. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
