5|$|The Eurymedon was {{a highly}} {{significant}} victory for the Delian League, which probably ended {{once and for all}} the threat of another Persian invasion of Greece. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to have prevented any Persian attempt to reconquer the Asiatic Greeks until at least 451 BC. The accession of further cities of Asia Minor to the Delian league, particularly from Caria, probably followed Cimon's campaign there.|$|E
5|$|Yet <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to {{many that}} science will {{eventually}} have to explain such experiences. This follows from an assumption {{about the possibility of}} reductive explanations. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency). In the case of mental states, this means {{that there needs to be}} an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivations of}} the three in the infighting are not {{completely}} clear. According to Friedrich Katz, Madero, in refusing to let Navarro be killed, was motivated not only by his personal humanism but also by a need to assert his civilian authority over military leaders. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> that Villa was mostly concerned with {{taking care of his}} soldiers and his personal hatred for Navarro, since it was his soldiers—known as Villistas—who Navarro had earlier ordered to be bayoneted. Years later, after he fell out with Orozco, Villa wrote in his memoirs that the whole episode was a set-up by Orozco, who had been paid 50,000 pesos by Díaz's agents to get him to kill Madero. While Katz and other scholars consider this assessment extreme, it is possible that Orozco, who believed he should be the rightful leader of the revolution, was trying to provoke Villa into killing Madero. That way Madero would be out of the way, Villa would be discredited among the intellectual revolutionary circles as a common bandit and Orozco could claim the mantle of leadership. In the end, however, Villa kept his cool, Madero convinced common soldiers to support him and Orozco did not have the nerve to go through with it.|$|E
50|$|Royana was euthanized {{after the}} {{abdominal}} pain was traced to its liver, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> that Royana suffered premature death syndrome. Royana, {{died at the}} age of three.|$|R

60|$|He stopped, {{and stood}} {{for a moment or two}} {{regarding}} her gravely, and the girl noticed that he was one who could be silent without awkwardness. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> to her that he had made the opening moves rather gracefully.|$|R
25|$|The {{reasons the}} subimago still exists in this order {{could be that}} there hasn't been enough {{selection}} pressure {{to get rid of}} it; <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> specially adapted to do the transition from water to air.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> {{that the}} {{prestige}} of Padre Martini, who was considered the most knowledgeable European expert {{on the art of}} music, was so great that it was important for a musician of that time to have their portrait in his gallery. This served as a recognition of the musician's merit.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{and modern}} writers {{consider}} spodomancy {{one of the}} least-familiar methods of divination. Nonetheless, it was common enough in Spain in the late 16th century so that Archbishop of Seville and Grand Inquisitor Alonso Manrique de Lara had to openly ban the practice. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to have been widely practiced in northwestern Germany around the same time.|$|E
50|$|By the 13th century, the {{wheelbarrow}} proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. However, going by surviving documents and illustrations {{the wheelbarrow}} remained a relative rarity until the 15th century. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to be limited}} to England, France, and the Low Countries.|$|R
5000|$|The Burmese {{opposition}} leader and Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi stated, [...] "This poem had inspired my father, Aung San, and his contemporaries during the independence struggle, as <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> to have inspired freedom fighters {{in other places}} at other times." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The idea of {{creating}} a Beatles Concerto for two pianos and orchestra occurred to me during a sleepless night early in 1977. This was partly because I loved the Beatles' music, and along with my piano duo partner, Paul Schaefer, we often included our own arrangements of their songs in our two-piano recitals anyway. However, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> to me {{that several of the}} tunes were not simply beautiful melodies, but several (eg Eleanor Rigby, Can't Buy Me Love, etc) incorporated motifs that had the potential to be developed within the structure of a large-scale classical concerto. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> natural that certain songs, such as The Long and Winding Road and Something, could sound wonderful in the grand romantic concerto style of Rachmaninov or Tchaikovsky.|$|R
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> {{that people}} who are more {{creative}} {{are also more likely to}} show a similar pattern of brain activation. Some researchers have been quick to point out that this in no way suggests that paranormal, mystical or creative experiences are in any way by themselves a symptom of mental illness, as it is still not clear what makes some such experiences beneficial and others distressing.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> {{that from}} the {{earliest}} times the Bloodhound was used to track people. There are stories written in Medieval Scotland of Robert the Bruce (in 1307), and William Wallace (1270–1305) being followed by 'sleuth hounds’. Whether true or not, these stories show that the sleuth hound was already known as a man-trailer, and it later becomes clear that the sleuth hound and the Bloodhound were the same animal.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether or not salsa is anything more than Cuban music has been argued over for more than thirty years. Initially, not much difference could be seen. Later it became clear that not only was New York salsa different from popular music in Cuba, but salsa in Venezuela, Colombia and other countries could also be distinguished. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> clear that salsa has receded from the great position it achieved in the late 1970s. The reasons for this are also much disputed.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile in New York, Tory Governor Cornbury {{had become}} another {{casualty}} of the Whig revolution (he was recalled in June 1708).

40|$|An {{inducible}} bacteriocin clostocin 0 from Clostridium saccharoperbutylacefonicum (ATCC 13564) inhibited {{the both}} biosyntheses of DNA and RNA in sensitive organism. Especially, the biosynthesis of messenger RNA was most strongly affected and the hiosynthesis of 23 s ribosomal RNA was also affected by clostocin 0 infection. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> that {{the release of}} 23 S and 16 S ribosomal RNA from the cellular membrane system easily occurred in clostocin O-infected organism...|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> that, China {{had hardly}} known high {{security}} forensic institutions until 1989. However, since then, the Chinese authorities have constructed the entire network of special forensic mental hospitals called Ankang which in Chinese is for 'Peace and Health'. By that time, China had had 20 Ankang institutions {{with the staff}} employed by the Ministry of State Security. The psychiatrists who worked there were wearing uniforms under their white coats.|$|R
25|$|It appears {{likely that}} at a fairly young age {{he and his father}} moved to England during the reign of Charles II of England, {{possibly}} in 1664. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> likely that they were in London {{at the time of the}} Great Fire of London, as his father created one of the last sketches of Old St Paul's Cathedral in its ruined state before it was knocked down to create the new St Paul's Cathedral, as well as night scenes of the fire itself.|$|E
25|$|While on the {{one hand}} this tale tells a tribal family-relations story, and family/tribal history as well, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to be a parable of a typical weather pattern of a southwesterly wind at first {{bringing}} snow, then rain, and also of the melting of a glacier, namely the Place Glacier near Gates Lake at Birken. Thus, it also tells of a migration of people to the area – or a war, depending on how the details of the legend might be read, with Chinook-Wind taking the part of Helen in a First Nations parallel to the Trojan War.|$|E
25|$|A second {{marriage}} again passes unmentioned in her memoirs, {{this time to}} Charles Dovalle, a former cavalryman in the 9th Dragoons who had become the sergeant of the grenadier company at Burgos in 1810, and <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> that Marie-Thérèse came to be relegated to the non-combat rôle of cantinière by 1812: Hennet suggested (perhaps on scanty evidence) that this marriage predated and precipitated her decision to join the Burgos garrison, which he dates to 1812, and that rather than being captured by the Spanish partisans, she volunteered to join Dovalle, who had been seized while on guard duty.|$|E
50|$|Interest was however already aroused at the {{prospect}} of the United Empire Party of Viscount Rothermere contesting the byelection. One constituent wrote to The Times to report that he had been canvassed by the party. On 15 September, the party announced that Mrs Nell Stewart-Richardson would be its candidate. At this stage <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> likely {{that there would be a}} Liberal candidate, although the local association quickly announced that it did not intend to sponsor anyone.|$|R
60|$|I made no sceptical remarks, and did {{not even}} shake my head. The {{circumstances}} of the encounter were described by Mariano with such graphic power and minuteness {{that it was impossible}} not to believe his story. Yet some things in it afterwards struck me as somewhat absurd; that straw hat, for instance, and <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> strange that a person of Mula's disposition should have been so much improved in temper by his sojourn in a warmer place.|$|R
25|$|In 1966 Frank Zappa's song Who Are The Brain Police? is {{according}} to Zappa {{is a song}} of religious theme. However <b>it</b> may <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> to be inspired by Orwell's 1984 Thought Police.|$|R
25|$|Two {{other major}} subfields of {{psycholinguistics}} investigate first language acquisition, {{the process by}} which infants acquire language, and second language acquisition. In addition, it is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language (bilingual infants are able to learn both of their native languages easily). Thus, sensitive periods may exist during which language can be learned readily. A great deal of research in psycholinguistics focuses on how this ability develops and diminishes over time. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to be the case that the more languages one knows, the easier it is to learn more.|$|E
25|$|It seems that, in {{response}} to this new submarine threat, some alterations were made to Lusitania and her operation. She was ordered not to fly any flags in the War Zone, a number of warnings, plus advice, were sent to the ship's commander to help him decide how to best protect his ship against the new threat, and <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> that her funnels were most likely painted a dark grey to help make her less visible to enemy submarines. Clearly, there was no hope of disguising her actual identity, since her profile was so well known, and no attempt was made to paint out the ship's name at the prow.|$|E
25|$|Several {{certified}} historical copies {{are displayed}} {{in the library of}} St Catherine, some of which are witnessed by the judges of Islam to affirm historical authenticity. The monks claims that during the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in the Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17), the original document was seized from the monastery by Ottoman soldiers and taken to Sultan Selim I's palace in Istanbul for safekeeping. A copy was then made to compensate for its loss at the monastery. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> that the charter was renewed under the new rulers, as other documents in the archive suggest. Traditions about the tolerance shown towards the monastery were reported in governmental documents issued in Cairo and during the period of Ottoman rule (1517–1798), the Pasha of Egypt annually reaffirmed its protections.|$|E
50|$|Referring to {{predator}} finds, {{who lived}} {{at the time of}} the Australopithecus in Africa, Clarke joined the view of Jordi Sabater who in 1997 had argued sleeping on the ground at night was too dangerous for Australopithecus. It seemed more likely that Australopithecus slept in the trees, similar to today’s living chimpanzees and gorillas that make sleeping nests. Due to the features of the fossil, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> likely that Australopithecus searched for food in the trees during the day.|$|R
5000|$|But <b>it</b> may <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> {{unfair to}} ignore {{the intent of the}} legislators, or the system of the statutes. So for {{instance}} in Dutch law, no general priority sequence for the above methods is recognized.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was only}} {{a short period of}} time before a Wingz 1.1 release fixed many of these issues, but it was long enough that the product was never able to regain its momentum. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> that Informix never really {{understood}} how to market the product, and it is likely 'Not Invented Here' played a major part in the problems as well [...] - [...] the purchase of Wingz and Smartware prompted Roger Sippl, one of the founders of Informix, to leave the company.|$|R
25|$|Uruk {{went through}} several phases of growth, from the Early Uruk period (4000–3500BC) to the Late Uruk period (3500–3100BC). The city was formed when two smaller Ubaid {{settlements}} merged. The temple complexes at their cores became the Eanna District and the Anu District dedicated to Inanna and Anu, respectively. The Anu District was originally called 'Kullaba' (Kulab or Unug-Kulaba) prior to merging with the Eanna District. Kullaba {{dates to the}} Eridu period when {{it was one of}} the oldest and most important cities of Sumer. There are different interpretations about the purposes of the temples. However, it is generally believed they were a unifying feature of the city. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> clear that temples served both an important religious function and state function. The surviving temple archive of the Neo-Babylonian period documents the social function of the temple as a redistribution center.|$|E
25|$|Details of Timesitheus' {{policies}} and achievements as the (probable) de facto {{ruler of the}} Empire {{during the reign of}} his son-in-law are sparse. There is evidence of substantial road repairs undertaken {{in many parts of the}} Roman World which would have been of economic and strategic significance. Monuments were restored in major cities which might have lifted civilian morale as well as providing employment for sculptors, stonemasons etc. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> that there was a thoroughgoing adjustment of the African frontier. It is not possible to tell how far such measures reflected policy guidelines issued by Timesitheus' office to provincial authorities, still less what detailed planning was carried out there. The most that can be said with any confidence is that he does not seem to have stood in the way of functionaries, such as the procurator of Mauretania, who conceived and drove forward such works.|$|E
25|$|On 9 December 1621, the Fortune {{burned to}} the ground, taking with it the company's stock of plays and properties. To meet the £1000 cost of rebuilding, Alleyn formed a {{partnership}} of twelve sharers, each paying an initial amount of £83 6s. 8d. By then aged and busy with Dulwich College, he took only one share for himself, and leased the property to the company's sharers for £128 per year. (The shareholders paid Alleyn £10 13s. 10d. each annually, and in return split the profits of the theatre, and the expenses of running it, twelve ways.) The theatre re-opened in March 1623. When Alleyn died in 1626, the College assumed control of the lease; the actor Richard Gunnell became its manager. Yet this change {{does not appear to}} have changed operations at the theatre. The new theatre appears to have been made of brick, with a lead and tile roof as fire-proofing measure. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seems</b> to have been round, abandoning its unconventional square shape.|$|E
6000|$|The {{letter was}} for Mr Croft and from Miss March. Very much {{surprised}} at receiving such a missive, Lawrence opened the envelope. His letter to Miss March {{had not yet}} been sent, for the new state of affairs had not only very much occupied his mind, but <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> to render unnecessary any haste in the matter, and he had concluded to mail the letter the next day. This, therefore, was not in answer to anything from him; and why should she have written? ...|$|R
60|$|Coming {{at last to}} an {{open space}} where the stream widened into {{something}} like a little pond, they observed an erection of timber on the bank which aroused their curiosity. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>seemed</b> to arouse the Cub's interest, for he made somewhat excited signs that he wished to land there. Willing to humour him, they ran the canoe on the beach. Leetle Cub jumped out at once, and, taking up the anchor-like piece of wood before mentioned, went with it towards the timber erection.|$|R
50|$|Clearly the Admiral {{thought there}} was a {{possibility}} that the General had not paid Phillips for the portrait {{at the time of his}} death, and <b>it</b> would <b>also</b> <b>seem</b> likely that Asgill had not actually taken delivery of same.|$|R
