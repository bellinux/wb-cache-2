40|$|The BA constructions ("SNO-subject +BA + SN 1 -object + SV" {{in medieval}} and modern Chinese (8 th- 16 th centuries) are not {{subjected}} {{to any of}} the fundamental constraints which regulate the same constructions in contemporary Chinese. Particularly, there is no constraint according to which the verb cannot be at the final position and must be followed by another constituent. The earliest BA forms are final verb forms, and several of these verbs are even monosyllabic, not being preceded by adverbials. It is therefore impossible that the surface structure condition of Huang Shuan-fan (1984) could explain the origin and the development of accusative markers BA. The BA constructions come from serial verbs constructions "V 1 BA + O + V 2 ", where the object (O) {{is at the same time}} object of V 1 and V 2. This structure itself comes synchronically from "V 1 BA + 01 + V 2 + 02 " by deleting the second object (02), when this latter is identical to the first (01). The verb BA's full meaning has been then taken away, and, through a grammaticalization process, a preposition has taken place to introduce pre-verbal objects. This diachronic derivation ("V 1 BA + 0 + V 2 " > "PREP BA + 0 + V") occurred between the 7 th and the 8 th centuries. Peyraube Alain.

40|$|The {{disposal}} form {{is probably}} the most studied construction so far, either in synchrony or in diachrony. However, the problem of the origin of this form is still debated. The classical hypothesis on the origin of the disposal form is the following: В A (mainly jiang and ba) were verbs in Archaic Chinese; used in V 1 position in serial verb constructions of the type "VI + О + V 2 " since early medieval, they were grammaticalized and became prepositions some time between the 7 th and 9 th centuries. This classical analysis has been challenged recently in several ways. First of ally jiang and ba could come directly from yi - through an analogous process - by a single lexical replacement, without it being necessary to speak of any grammaticalization. The disposal forms could also come from subject-patient sentences to which one could add jiang or ba. This paper discusses these new hypotheses and concludes: 1) that the hypothesis of an analogous phenomenon with yi, which might have served as a model to jiang and ba, is worth maintaining; 2) that the hypothesis whereby the disposal sentences could have come from patient-subject sentences to which a jiang or ba word has been added is not motivated; 3) that one can reasonably suppose that the two joint processes of analogy (with yi forms) and grammaticalization (V > Prep.) did {{play a role in the}} appearance and development of disposal forms.

40|$|Se calcularon las tasas de mortalidad y reclutamiento de árboles en una parcela permanente de investigación de un bosque pluvial tropical. El estudio se basó en dos mediciones, una realizada en el año 1998 y la otra en el 2005, en las cuales se midió el diámetro (DAP) a todos los árboles con DAP> 10 cm y se censaron los individuos muertos y reclutados. Se determinaron los tipos de mortalidad y se calculó el coeficiente de mortalidad, el coeficiente de reclutamiento exponencial, la biomasa aérea (BA) y la vida media del bosque. En el primer censo se registraron 709 individuos y en el segundo se encontraron 710. La tasa media anual de mortalidad de árboles fue 1, 39 % y el coeficiente de mortalidad exponencial fue 1, 41 %; los tipos de mortalidad más comunes fueron: volcamiento de raíz y muerte en pie. La tasa de reclutamiento anual fue 1, 2 % y el coeficiente de reclutamiento exponencial registró 1, 19 %. La vida media estimada de la parcela fue 58, 6 años. La BA fue de 237, 31 t ha- 1 en el año 1998, y en el 2005 fue 259, 9 t ha- 1. Los individuos reclutados presentaron BA de 5, 08 t ha- 1, y los muertos de 17, 72 t ha- 1; el incremento <b>en</b> <b>BA</b> de sobrevivientes fue 30, 97 t ha- 1 promedio. La similitud en el número de individuos entre mediciones, así como en los demás parámetros evaluados, sugieren un posible equilibrio entre mortalidad y reclutamiento del bosque. Con base en estos resultados, {{no se puede}} rechazar la hipótesis de equilibrio dinámico. Rates of {{mortality}} and recruitment of trees were calculated in a permanent research plot established in the tropical wet forest. The study was based on two measurements, one was done in 1998 {{and the other in}} 2005, in which were measured the diameter (DBH) of trees with DBH> 10 cm and surveyed dead and recruited trees. We also determined the type {{of mortality}}, the mortality and exponential recruitment coefficient, the aboveground biomass (AB) and the mean life of the forest. In the first census 709 individuals were recorded and 710 in the second one. The mean annual mortality rate of trees was 1. 39 % and the exponential mortality coefficient was 1. 41 %; the most common types of mortality were uprooting and snags. Annual recruitment rate was 1. 2 % and the exponential rate of recruitment was 1. 19 %. Mean life of this forest was estimated in 58. 6 years. The AB was of 237. 31 t ha- 1 in the year 1998, and in the 2005 was of 259. 9 t ha- 1. The recruited individuals presented AB of 5. 08 t ha- 1, and the deads of 17. 72 t ha- 1; the increment of AB in survivors was 30. 97 t ha- 1 average. Similarity of number of individuals between measurements, {{as well as in the}} other parameters evaluated, suggest a possible balance between mortality and recruitment of this forest. Based on the results of this study, we could no reject the hypothesis of dynamic equilibrium of this tropical wet forest...|$|E
