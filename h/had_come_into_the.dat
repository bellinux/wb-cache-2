5|$|The Cavendish family {{sold the}} abbey in 1733, at which point, with Cavendish House in ruins, the precinct {{was being used}} as {{agricultural}} land. By the 19th century the abbey <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> possession of the Earls of Dysart. Lionel Tollemache, 8th Earl of Dysart, sold the land east of the River Soar (known as Abbey Meadows) in 1876; this was to allow Leicester Town Council to undertake flood prevention work. The part of this land between {{the river and the}} Grand Union Canal was developed by the Town Council into a public space known as Abbey Park, which was opened by King Edward VII (then Prince of Wales) in 1882.|$|E
5|$|In April 1337, Montagu was {{appointed}} to a diplomatic commission to Valenciennes, to establish alliances with Flanders and the German princes. In July 1338, he accompanied the king on another mission to the continent, again providing {{the greatest number of}} soldiers, with 123 men-at-arms and 50 archers. In September of that year he was made Marshal of England. After the death of Thomas of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk, this office <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hands of Norfolk's daughter Margaret. The king did not trust the office with her husband, so he decided instead to bestow it on his trusted companion, Montagu. Edward's policy of building alliances put him in great debt, and when he left the Low Countries to return to England late in 1338, Salisbury had to stay behind as surety to the king's debtors, along with the king's family and the Earl of Derby. The earl had earlier voiced concerns about the costly alliances, but he nevertheless remained loyal to the king's strategy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race on Sunday, Hamilton got away slowly but was able to keep both Pérez and Räikkönen behind him while Rosberg {{retained}} the lead. Further back, Fernando Alonso made contact with Felipe Nasr and then crashed into Pastor Maldonado, who was forced to retire. Alonso needed to pit for a new front wing and was later given a drive-through penalty, dropping him {{to the end of the}} field. Meanwhile, Nico Hülkenberg and Sebastian Vettel made up places, sitting in fifth and twelfth respectively after the first lap. Valtteri Bottas on the other hand lost positions, finding himself in tenth. Rosberg soon built a lead of over one second, giving Hamilton no chance to deploy DRS for an overtake manoeuvre. By lap 5, both Kvyat and Nasr <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pits for the harder compound tyre, followed by Ricciardo, Massa and Pérez one lap later. On lap seven, both Hülkenberg and Sainz Jr. made pit stops. While Hülkenberg was able to stay ahead of Massa, Sainz's stop was unfortunate and he lost time due to a problem with the tyre change. Another two laps later, Valtteri Bottas pitted and was sent out into the path of Button, damaging his front wing, which he needed to replace the following lap. He also received a five-second penalty to be served at his next scheduled stop. The leaders pitted for new tyres around laps ten and eleven, with the order now being Rosberg ahead of Vettel, who was yet to stop, Hamilton, and Räikkönen. Romain Grosjean, who started on the harder tyres just as Vettel, was up to sixth.|$|E

Afridi rose to the challenge, earning Man of the Match first with the bat thanks to 51 off 34 as Pakistan reached 149/4 during their 20 overs and then with the ball as he took 2–16 in his four overs after bowling both Herschelle Gibbs and AB De Villiers playing on. Supported by clutch death bowling from Gul and off-spinner Saeed Ajmal, Pakistan held on to secure an upset, winning by 7 runs.|$|E
25|$|Following the war, {{no reason}} {{could be found}} not to unite the two earlier railway {{stations}} into a single building. In particular, both railways <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ownership of the same company, the ÖBB (Austrian federal railways). The modern Südbahnhof was built between 1955 and 1961 to plans by Heinrich Hrdlicka, in which the twin stations were united in a single building. Two underground platforms serve the S-Bahn network (lines S1, S2 and S3). At about the same time, the line between Vienna and Gloggnitz was electrified. During the re-building, the Südbahnhof was extended towards the Schweizergarten, while the constituent parts of the old main hall were numbered and taken away to be used at a depot in Floridsdorf.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{researchers}} at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio, Ben Zion Wacholder and Martin Abegg, announced {{the creation of}} a computer program that used previously published scrolls to reconstruct the unpublished texts. Officials at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, led by Head Librarian William Andrew Moffett, announced that they would allow researchers unrestricted access to the library's complete set of photographs of the scrolls. In the fall of that year, Wacholder published 17 documents that had been reconstructed in 1988 from a concordance and <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hands of scholars outside of the International Team; in the same month, there occurred the discovery and publication of a complete set of facsimiles of the Cave 4 materials at the Huntington Library. Thereafter, the officials of the Israel Antiquities Authority agreed to lift their long-standing restrictions {{on the use of the}} scrolls.|$|E

25|$|At 8:00p.m., Mohamed became {{involved}} in an altercation with another man at 200 South Rio Grande Street in downtown Salt Lake City when officers were called to the scene. According to Salt Lake County prosecutors, Mohamed {{was involved in a}} fight after a failed drug deal and dispute over $1.10 near a homeless shelter. A man <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> homeless shelter to obtain food, and asked Mohamed for marijuana, but he only had methamphetamine. Mohamed then demanded the man's money. Mohamed was holding a metal broomstick at the time, and had used it to hit the other man at least once. Responding officers asked Mohamed to drop the broomstick at least ten times. When he did not drop the broomstick and appeared to try to hit the man again, he was shot four times by officers Kory Checketts and Jordan Winegar. Mohamed's family disputed the claim, and his cousin, Muslima Weledi, said that witnesses told her Mohamed was armed with a wooden broomstick. The man battered with the broomstick received welts and bruises. Abdullahi was left in critical condition.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the bout, {{there was}} {{the belief that the}} fight was largely personal, with Royce looking to avenge his brother and Sakuraba looking to atone for his stablemate's defeats and vindicate {{professional}} wrestling and the UWFi once and for all. However, following the stoppage, Sakuraba embraced Royce in the ring, albeit having a brief and friendly verbal confrontation with Hélio Gracie, who was at ringside. Exhausted from his battle with Royce, Sakuraba surprised many when he emerged from the locker room for the tournament semi-finals. His opponent, Igor Vovchanchyn, outweighed him by close to sixty pounds (Sakuraba <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bout with Royce lighter than usual, at 176 pounds) and was considered to be the top heavyweight striker of the day. Sakuraba surprised many by taking Vovchanchyn down and nearly finishing him with an armbar. Sakuraba was actually leading the fight past the 10-minute mark, but near the end Igor was able to reverse a takedown and draw the first round even with ground strikes. After the first round was declared a draw Sakuraba's corner threw in the towel before the beginning of overtime, primilary due to fatigue.|$|E

25|$|England won the toss {{and decided}} to bat first. Lawson gave the {{tourists}} an early breakthrough by clean-bowling Graham Gooch for 11. Tim Robinson, who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> side at number three, was out LBW bowled Lawson a few overs later, with England not having added to the score. Curtis again fell cheaply, clean bowled by Lawson for 22 and leaving England struggling at 57 for 3. Captain David Gower and the returning South African born Robin Smith worked to restore the innings with a diligent partnership of 75 for fourth wicket, but Gower was undone by the arm ball of off-spinner Trevor Hohns which struck him in front, and he was given out LBW for a well made 35. That bought champion batsman Ian Botham to the wicket, but he was out for a duck two overs later, bowled by Hohns. Jack Russell was trapped in front for 1 by Lawson a few overs later, and England's innings was disintegrating at 147 for 6. Emburey batted defensively to support Robin Smith, taking 34 balls to make his 5, but he too was eventually deceived by Hohns, out LBW. Some stubborn resistance by Neil Foster {{late in the day}} allowed Smith to bring up his century, and saw England finish the day on 224 for 7, Foster not out on 35 and Smith on 112.|$|E
500|$|In {{the book}} proper, Briscoe and Stannard quote Ball's most notable opponent, Manfred von Richthofen.

Elsewhere in the book, an unidentified Royal Flying Corps pilot who flew with Ball in his last engagement was quoted as saying, [...] "I see they have given him the V.C.

500|$|Three years later, in South Africa {{during the}} Second Boer War, Baden-Powell was besieged {{in the small}} town of Mafeking by a much larger Boer army (the Siege of Mafeking). The Mafeking Cadet Corps was a group of youths that {{supported}} the troops by carrying messages, which freed the men for military duties and kept the boys occupied during the long siege. The Cadet Corps performed well, helping in the defense of the town (1899–1900), and were one of the many factors that inspired Baden-Powell to form the Scouting movement. Each member received a badge that illustrated a combined compass point and spearhead. The badge's logo was similar to the fleur-de-lis shaped arrowhead that Scouting later adopted as its international symbol. The Siege of Mafeking was the first time since his own childhood that Baden-Powell, a regular serving soldier, <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> same orbit as [...] "civilians"—women and children—and discovered for himself the usefulness of well-trained boys.|$|E
500|$|Maylam also interviewed those {{involved}} in the hoodening tradition at Deal, whom he encountered in the summer of 1909.

For many years they had included a man dressed in woman's clothing, who was known as a [...] "Daisy" [...] rather than a [...] "Mollie", but that this had been discontinued. Skardon had given up the tradition many years previously, and the hooden horse itself <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> possession of Elbridge Bowles of Great Mongeham, who continued to lead a hoodening troupe after Christmas each year, visiting Deal as well as the neighbouring villages of Finglesham, Ripple, Tilmanstone, Eastry, and Betteshanger. Maylam was also informed {{that at the time of}} Britain's involvement in the Second Boer War, the horse had been decorated with military equipment. The fourth hooden horse that Maylam encountered was owned by the men who worked at George Goodson's farm in Fenland, Word, near Sandwich. They informed him that it had been made by a farm hand in Cleve, Monkton, before being brought to Word when one of the Cleve farm workers relocated there.|$|E
