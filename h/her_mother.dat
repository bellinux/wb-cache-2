Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E

That marriage for which she was now to ask <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> sanction would of course be sanctioned. She had no favour to beg; nothing for which to be grateful. With a slight motion, unconsciously, unwillingly, but not the less positively, she repulsed <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> caress as she answered her question.|$|R
