40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{models that}} were designed and implemented to simulate slotted ALOHA multiple access computer network protocol. The models are spreadsheet-based simulating <b>e-forms</b> {{that were designed}} for students use in college level data communication and networking courses. Specifically, three models for simulating this protocol are fully implemented using spreadsheets. The features of these models are simplicity and quickness of implementation compared with other implementation techniques. These models assisted instructors to develop educational objects that in turn will help students for better understanding and exploring of the scientific concepts related to computer protocols by the aid of visual and interactive spreadsheet-based <b>e-forms.</b> Moreover, advanced spreadsheet techniques such as imagery integration, hyperlinks, conditional structures, conditional formats, and charts insetting, to simulate scientific notions that are taught to undergraduate students were exploited in these models. The models designing technique is characterized by simplicity, flexibility, and affordability. The technique can be applied and used in many disciplines of education, business, science, and technology. Generally, the developed computational <b>e-forms</b> {{can be used by}} instructors to illustrate topics in attractive fashions. In addition, students and learners can use the developed educational objects without instructor supervision in self-education or e-learning environments...|$|R
50|$|Practically, the twofold pattern (also {{referred}} to as the e-type vowel harmony) means that in the environment where the vowel in the word stem is formed {{in the front of the}} mouth, the suffix will take the <b>e-form,</b> while if it is formed in the back it will take the a-form. The fourfold pattern (also called the i-type) accounts for rounding as well as for front/back. The following examples, based on the copula -dir4 ("it is"), illustrate the principles of i-type vowel harmony in practice: Türkiyedir ("it is Turkey"), kapıdır ("it is the door"), but gündür ("it is the day"), paltodur ("it is the coat").|$|E

40|$|One of {{the basic}} pillars in Model-Driven Software Development (MDSD) is defined by model transformations and {{likewise}} several useful approaches have been proposed in this context. In parallel, domain modeling plays {{an essential role in}} MDSD to support the definition of concepts in the domain, and support the model transformation process. In this paper, we will discuss the results of an e-government project for the generation of <b>e-forms</b> from feature models. Very often existing model transformation practices seem to largely adopt a closed world assumption whereby the transformation definitions of models are defined beforehand and interaction with the user at run-time is largely omitted. Our study shows the need for a more interactive approach in model transformations in which <b>e-forms</b> are generated after interaction with the end-user. To show the case we illustrate three different approaches for generation in increasing complexity: (1) offline model transformation without interaction (2) model transformation with initial interaction (3) model-transformation with run-time interaction.

We conduct a theoretical synthesis of three existing approaches for designing information systems. The result is a combined theory on key features of an <b>e-form</b> that make the establishment of communication quality more likely. The result consists of four key concepts, each of which give rise to one set of design principles for communication from the issuer of the <b>e-form</b> to the user (citizen), and one set of design principles for communication from the user (citizen) to the recipient of the <b>e-form...</b>|$|E
