40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{comparison}} between Cobb angle and <b>hump</b> <b>height</b> measured using a humpmeter in idiopathic scoliosis have produced contradictory findings concerning {{the association between}} the two variables in growing subjects. AIM: To analyze {{the relationship between the}} <b>hump</b> <b>height</b> and the Cobb angle and the effect of age on the first. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive analytical study. SETTING: A tertiary university hospital. POPULATION: One thousand two-hundred forty-five subjects with diagnosed idiopathic scoliosis or with a hump without spine deformity, aged between 3 - 21. METHODS: The hump was measured with subjects in a forward-bending position using a pocket humpmeter; the Cobb angle was determined on a traditional radiograph. A linear regression estimated the Cobb angle in relation to the <b>hump</b> <b>height,</b> and a multiple regression based on standardized regression coefficients (ß) and coefficients of determination (R 2) assessed the contribution of age and the Cobb angle to hump variations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The <b>hump</b> <b>height</b> was between 0 - 50 mm and the Cobb angle was between 0 - 78 °. Based on regression coefficients, every unit (1 mm) increase in the thoracic/thoracolumbar and lumbar humps corresponded to an average increase in the Cobb angle of 1. 542 ° (SE 0. 037 °; P= 0. 000) and 1. 857 ° (SE 0. 095 °; P= 0. 000), respectively.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{excitation}} of inviscid stationary cross ow instabilities near an isolated surface hump (or indentation) underneath a three-dimensional boundary layer. As the <b>hump</b> <b>height</b> (or indentation depth) is increased from zero, the receptivity process becomes nonlinear {{even before the}} stabilitycharacteristics of the boundary layer are modi ed to a signi cant extent. This behavior contrasts sharply with earlier ndings on the excitation of the lower branch Tollmien-Schlichting modes and is attributed to the inviscid nature of the cross ow modes, {{which leads to a}} decoupling between the regions of receptivity and stability. As a result of this decoupling, similarity transformations exist that allow the nonlinear receptivity of a general three-dimensional boundary layer to be studied with a set of canonical solutions to the viscous sublayer equations. The parametric study suggests that the receptivity is likely to become nonlinear even before the <b>hump</b> <b>height</b> becomes large enough for ow reversal to occur in the canonical solution. We also nd that the receptivity to surface humps increases more rapidly as the <b>hump</b> <b>height</b> increases than is predicted by linear theory.

Forty cows of the Gir, Girolando, Nelore, Sindhi and Indubrasil breeds (eight cows each), approximately three years of age, were evaluated. Body weight, withers and <b>hump</b> <b>heights</b> as well as thoracic circumference were recorded. The density and length of the hair was obtained by collecting one square centimeter in the rump region and skin color using the CIELAB system. Rectal temperature, heart and respiratory rates were evaluated during the morning at 4 : 30 h, and in the afternoon, at 14 : 30 h, with six repetitions. Blood samples were collected for hematological evaluation. The surface temperature was obtained using an infrared camera FLIR® T 400. Two images were taken from each animal, one laterally of the whole body and the other of the head region. Air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity were obtained from a mobile weather station. The statistics analysis included an analyzes of variance, principal factors, as well as cluster, discriminant and canonical analyzes, logistic regression and calculation of odds ratio. There were significant differences in the rectal temperature, heart and respiratory rates between breeds. Gir and Indubrasil breeds had the highest rectal temperatures. Breed was significant for surface temperatures and showed that physical and physiological factors affected breeds in different ways. Eye and brain surface temperatures were the most affected by environmental parameters. Also, environmental parameters affected packed cell volume and red cell number. Odds ratio test showed that the Gir breed was three times more likely to have higher rectal temperature compared with Sindhi as confirmed by the logistic regression. When the black globe temperature approached 35 °C, the probability of the Gir animals having rectal temperatures above normal was approximately 70 %.

Over the years, numerous add-on devices have been invented to help reduce drag and fuel consumption. The current research extends our previous idea of add-on humps and investigates their effect in conjuction with curved boat-tail flaps. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in the form of unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) and detached-eddy (DES) simulations were used to determine viable design strategies. Design optimization was applied on the new add-on devices. A 3 D baseline computational model was constructed using an Ahmed body. The predicted drag coefficient of the baseline configuration showed good agreement with experimental data. The results from the optimized design with add-on humps and curved boat-tail flaps are shown to have a 50. 9 % reduction in drag coefficient. The predicted results using three different turbulent models, including standard k-ε, RNG k-ε, and DES, were compared with each other.

40|$|In {{selective}} withdrawal, {{the interface}} between two liquid layers is deformed by an imposed withdrawal flow. A shape transition occurs at a threshold flow rate that changes the topology of the interface from a steady-state hump to an entrained spout. Near the transition a very sharp hump tip occurs, with the minimum tip radius far smaller than the characteristic lateral length-scale. Previous measurements [1] suggest the sharp hump is created via an approach towards a singular steady-state shape which is cut off at a small lengthscale. To help unfold the mechanism underlying the shape transition and to determine {{the origin of the}} cutoff lengthscale, we construct a numerical model and compare its results against experimental measurements. The increased resolution in the simulation enables us to identify the shape transition both in the experiment and the numerics as a saddle-node bifurcation. The transition does not involve an approach towards a singular shape as the hump radius never becomes much smaller than the <b>hump</b> <b>height.</b> Results from different boundary conditions collapse when appropriately rescaled. The collapsed curves show that the tip curvature remains coupled to the tip height, showing an approximately exponential dependence. ...|$|E

When we are creating such maps we normally use different mathematical models that help us simulate different flood scenarios. When shaping flooded areas we {{need to pay attention}} to the spots where water starts flooding. Often we can define this kind of spots as a lateral flow. If we want to take this fact into account, it is necessary to model such spots as a lateral flow. In this work we analyzed hydraulic conditions around lateral weirs. For this purpose we transformed the existing physical model in which we implemented measurements for different hydraulic conditions. Measurements were made for five different scenarios where we explored the impact of Froude number on the discharge coefficient Cd for different shapes of lateral weirs.

40|$|The {{flow pattern}} in the uphill teeming process {{has been found to}} be closely related to the quality of ingots and further to affect the yield of ingot production, which is crucial for the steel making process. The {{formation}} of non-metallic inclusion and entrapment of mold flux has been considered to be affected by the flow {{pattern in the}} gating system and molds by many previous researchers. The aim of this study is to investigate the flow pattern of steel in the gating system and molds during the initial filling stage. In addition, to study the utilization of swirl blade implemented at the bottom of the vertical runner on the improvement of initial filling condition in the mold. A three dimensional model of two molds gating system for 6. 2 ton ingots from Scana Steel was adopted in the present work. A reduced geometry model including one mold and a runner, based on the method from previous researchers, was also used for comparison with the current more extensive model. Moreover, a reduced geometry model including one swirl blade and a runner was simulated to find effects of an increased-length vertical runner on the flow pattern improvement at the vertical runner outlet. Flow pattern, <b>hump</b> <b>height</b> and wall shear stress were respectively studied. A reduced geometry with homogenous inlet conditions fails to describe the fluctuating conditions present as the steel enters the mold. However, the trends are very similar when comparing the (hump height-surface height) evolution over time. The implementation of swirl blades gives a chaotic initial filling condition with a considerable amount of droplets being created when steel enters the molds during the first couple of seconds. However, a more calm filling condition with less fluctuation is achieved at the molds after a short while. Moreover, the orientation of the swirl blades affects he flow pattern of the steel. A proper placement of a swirl blade improves the initial filling conditions. The utilization of swirl blades might initially result in larger <b>hump</b> <b>height.</b> However, it gives fewer fluctuations as the casting proceeds. In the model without swirl blades, the maximum wall shear stress fluctuates with a descending trend as the filling proceeds. An implementation of swirl blades can decrease and stabilize the wall shear stress in the gating system. A special attention should be made in choosing refractory at the center stone, the horizontal runner near center stone and the vertical runner at the elbow. This is where the wall shear stress values are highest or where the exposure times are long. QC 2012020...|$|E

Increasing the beam power, we observe an instability of the interface leading {{to the formation of}} a long jet when the laser propagates from the more refringent phase to the less refringent one. We propose that the total internal reflection of the incident light on the highly deformed interface could be at the origin of this instability. Using a nonlinear model of static equilibrium of the interface taking account of the angular dependance of radiation pressure, we explain the observed beam power threshold of the instability as well as the shape of the interface deformations observed at large waists just below the instability onset. According to this model, the instability should occur when the interface slope reaches the angle of total reflection teta TR. We find that the maximum incidence angle along the interface teta i max just below the instability threshold is significantly smaller than teta TR, and that our nonlinear model does not present any instability up to teta i max = teta TR, making the proposed instability mechanism qualitatively rough although quantitatively accurate.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the suitable site to examine the liver by transcutaenous ultrasonography and to describe the echo pattern of the hepatic parenchyma and hepatic vessels in apparently healthy dromedary camels. The study was conducted on two groups of camels; Group I consisted of forty-one camels from Sudan and Egypt with the weight range of 350 - 550 kg. Camels in Group II (four camels) were studied in Germany their body weight ranged 400 - 600 kg. Body temperature, pulse, heart and respiratory rates, blood haematology and biochemistry, <b>hump</b> <b>height</b> and circumference were determined. Sternal recumbancy was found to be the most suitable and safer position to perform all the above mentioned examinations. Mean and standard deviation of the <b>hump</b> <b>height</b> and circumference in Group I were 23. 1 ± 6. 1 cm and 87. 6 ± 35. 9 cm respectively, and 38. 3 ± 9. 9 cm and 139. 0 ± 21. 7 cm, respectively in Group II. Body temperature ranged 35. 8 °C to 40 °C (Group I) and 34. 5 °C to 36. 4 °C (Group II); pulse rate ranged 35 to 55 beats/min (Group I) and from 30 to 45 (Group II) beats/min; respiratory rate was 10 to 22 breaths/ min (Group I) and 9 to 4 (Group II) breaths/ min. Blood parameters including total and differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monophiles and eosinophils) white blood cell count as well as Hb, PCV, MCV, MCH and MCHC were measured in both groups. There was no significant difference in these values in animals in both groups. Blood biochemistry including AST, ALT, ALB, BIL, TG, ALP, GGT and GLDH was also measured in both groups. There were no significant differences between these values in Group I and Group II. The liver could be ultrasonographically visualized in the area extending from the 11 th to the 6 th intercostal space (ICS) on the right side of the animal. The transverse process of the 2 nd lumbar vertebrum was considered as a reference point. The mean distance between the RP and the dorsal and ventral liver margins was measured in both groups. The difference between these values in both groups was not significant. The parenchymal pattern of the normal camel liver consisted of numerous medium echoes homogenously distributed all over the area of the liver. Fissures were observed in the visceral liver surface in the 10 th to the 7 th ICS. Hepatic and portal veins could be visualized within the normal liver textures. The caudal vena cava was characterized by an oval shape in cross section and visualized in the 11 th and 10 th ICS. Porta hepatis was found at the same level of the point of the shoulder joint at a distance of 70. 3 ± 6. 3 cm and 73. 2 ± 4. 4 cm from it in Group I and Group II, respectively. The portal vein was best visualized in the 10 th ICS with diameter and depth of 33. 4 ± 7. 1 mm (Group I) and 35. 0 ± 5. 1 mm (Group II) and 42. 0 ± 1. 8 mm (Group I) and 72. 7 ± 4. 7 mm (Group II), respectively. The thickness of the dorsal and ventral liver margins at the 10 th ICS was thinner as it progressed cranially. The dorsal margin was usually thinner than the ventral margin in all intercostal spaces in both groups of camels. The whole liver length which could be ultrasonographically examined in the area from the 11 th to the 6 th intercostal spaces in Group I and Group II were (53. 0 ± 7. 1 cm) and (60. 5 ± 5. 7 cm), respectively. This work represents the first study on ultrasonographical examination of the liver in the one humped camel. The presented data can form base line values for future use of ultrasound in diagnosis of liver diseases in the dromedary camel. The technique is non-invasive and has the advantage that it can be applied in sitting non-tranquilized animals...|$|E
40|$|Sympatric speciation, the {{divergence}} of one lineage {{into two}} or more lineages within one geographic range, is often driven by disruptive selection on niche utilization. While niche specialization is found in sympatrically speciated groups, it is often reinforced by other strong selective pressure. This dissertation examines the role of predation, morphology, mate choice, and parasite load in maintaining reproductive isolation in two sympatrically speciated species flocks of pupfish (Cyprinodon). The role that predation, morphology and male and female mate choice play in reproductive isolation is examined in the Bahamian species flock. To examine the role of predation, we focus on two species, a generalist detritivore and a predator/scale-eater. We show that premating isolation is based primarily on visual cues and is asymmetrical. It is well developed in the less abundant scale-eater but is much less well developed in the more abundant detritivore. Responses of detritivore females from three lakes to conspecific and scale-eater males suggest that abundance of the predator also affects development of premating isolating mechanisms in the prey species. These results highlight the importance of frequency-dependent selection and predators {{in the evolution of}} premating isolating mechanisms. The three species, a detritivore, an ostracod-eater, and a scale-eater which preys upon the other two, inhabit distinct trophic niches. We use geometric morphometrics to examine variation in body shape among these three species. Results show that there are significant differences in male, but not female body shape. These results suggest that male body shape, specifically nuchal <b>hump</b> <b>height,</b> is under sexual selection and may contribute to reproductive isolation between species. Female mate choice reinforces reproductive isolation in sympatrically speciated species. Male mate choice, while not as strong a selective pressure as female mate choice, could also act as a reproductive isolation mechanism in sympatric species. Using a binary choice design, we examine the importance of visual and olfactory cues in female mate choice and focus on the ostracod-eater, the least abundant of the three sympatric species of pupfish. We also examine male mate choice in the scale-eater and the detritivore. Females use visual and not olfactory cues and prefer conspecific males. Males also preferentially associate and court conspecific females. Thus, mutual mate choice acts a strong premating isolation mechanism in these sympatrically speciated pupfish. Recognition and behavioral avoidance of parasitized conspecifics or individuals with slightly different immunities, either due to differences in genotype and/or regional parasite load, would be favored by natural selection to maintain a healthy phenotype. This avoidance of parasitized conspecifics {{may play a role in}} species differentiation in two ways: 1) rapidly changing genes that encode for immune function, such as the Major Histocompatibility Complex may lead to small, localized differences in immune function. If small differences in immune function and parasite load drive behavioral avoidance of conspecifics, then reproductive barriers within a population are effectively formed through non-random mating. If such nonrandom mating barriers persist, they may lead to isolation of gene pools and subsequently, sympatric speciation; 2) Changes in parasite resistance may be tightly coupled with trophic differentiation as parasitic infection often occurs when organisms are foraging. To address this question, we performed two experiments to examine how parasites affect female choice in sympatrically speciated pupfish (Cyprinodon spp.) from the Yucatan, Mexico. We infected and sham infected male C. labiosus and C. maya with Ichthyophonus hoferi. In a series of binary choice trials, we presented female C. labiosus and C. maya with olfactory cues from infected and non-infected conspecific males. Then we presented the females with odors from infected conspecific males and non-infected heterospecific males. Results indicate that infection was successful in both species but varied in infectivity. Our findings show that females preferred non-infected conspecific males and suggest that reproductive barriers may be formed by female preference for healthy male conspecifics. Additionally, reproductive barriers between species are strong and prevent mating with heterospecific males. Overall this dissertation shows that multiple selective pressures contribute to and reinforce reproductive isolation. Future studies should take care to examine the roles of sexual selection, frequency dependence, ecological pressures beyond trophic niche usage, mate choice, morphology and other common methodologies such as genetic inference. Realistic models of sympatric speciation likely include a non-random collection of these and similar variables.
