5|$|During his ten {{seasons as}} head coach in Winnipeg, he led the team to six Grey Cup appearances, winning the {{championship}} four times in 1958, 1959, 1961, and 1962. He finished <b>his</b> <b>Blue</b> Bombers coaching career with a regular season record of 105 wins, 53 losses, and two ties and an overall record of 122 wins, 66 losses, and 3 ties. Grant was the CFL Coach of the Year in 1965. Grant took on additional responsibilities as a club manager between 1964 and 1966. Max Winter, the Minnesota Vikings founder, contacted Grant in 1961 {{and asked him to}} coach the new NFL expansion team. Grant declined the offer and remained in Winnipeg until 1967 when Winter and General Manager Jim Finks were successful in luring Grant to Minnesota.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} debut in {{first-class}} cricket for Cambridge University, {{where he was}} awarded <b>his</b> <b>Blue.</b> He then spent nine seasons playing for Somerset, and captained the side {{for the last five}} of those seasons. Working as a schoolmaster at Highgate School in London from 1876–1884, his playing opportunities for the south-western county were limited, and from 1885 he only played first-class cricket at Lord's, representing Middlesex in three matches that season, and appearing for the MCC on nine occasions over six years. He returned to play for Somerset in 1887 and 1890 when they had lost their first-class status. He worked as headmaster of Loudon House School in London for some years from 1888, and died following an operation in 1916 in Ipswich.|$|E
5|$|In {{his four}} years at Oxford, Palairet {{appeared}} for the university 31 times in first-class cricket and accrued 1,291 runs {{at an average of}} 23.05. He scored nine half-centuries, with a top-score of 75 not out. He claimed 52 wickets at 25.03—significantly lower than his career average—and took the only five-wicket hauls of his career. While at Oxford, he also gained a Blue in athletics, running in the three-mile race against Cambridge in 1892. The same year, he played association football for Corinthians, and there were also appearances for Combined Universities and London. An injury prevented Palairet from playing against Cambridge, and thus earning <b>his</b> <b>Blue</b> in football.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920 season, Jardine {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut, played eight first-class matches and scored two fifties. Playing mainly as an opening batsman, he won <b>his</b> <b>Blue,</b> {{appearing in the}} University Match against Cambridge but fell short of expectations, and continued to be criticised for over-caution with the bat. In all, he scored 217 runs {{at an average of}} 22.64. In the match for Oxford against Essex, he took six wickets for six runs in a bowling spell of 45 balls, bowling leg breaks, to have bowling figures of six for 28. It was the only occasion in his career where he took five or more wickets in an innings.|$|E

Ernest did not know that Parsons was a fugitive. At about 3 a.m. on August 31, Ernest was too tired to drive and stopped at the Lunt Park rest area near Cedar City, Utah to get some sleep.

5|$|Allen {{played for}} Cambridge in 1922. He was {{left out of}} the team's first game; as the University was playing Middlesex, he played for the {{opposition}} instead and took six for 13. Around this time, he began to bowl fast for the first time. After success in the following games—including ten wickets in the game against Sussex—Allen was awarded <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> by being selected for the University Match against Oxford at Lord's. In that game, he had match figures of nine for 78 in a comfortable Cambridge victory. This was Cambridge's last game of the season—Allen had taken 49 first-class wickets at an average of 15. There were suggestions in the press at the time that Allen illegally threw, rather than bowled, the ball. In his biography of Allen, E. W. Swanton writes that these rumours were neither widespread nor repeated later in Allen's career, and that they may have resulted from a one-off lapse. Towards the end of the season, Allen returned to the Middlesex team and his 15 wickets placed him {{at the top of the}} county's bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|Gilligan played cricket for Dulwich College {{before the}} First World War, then for Cambridge, twice winning <b>his</b> <b>blue.</b> He briefly played county cricket for Surrey but moved to Sussex in 1920. Following {{a slow start}} to his county career, he rapidly {{improved}} and in partnership with Maurice Tate established a formidable bowling reputation. First playing for England in 1922, he was appointed Test captain in 1924. In the latter year, Gilligan was {{at the height of}} his form when he suffered a blow to his heart while batting. The strain affected his bowling, which was never again as effective, but he still captained England in Australia during the 1924–25 season. The series was lost, but both he and his team were popular and respected. In following years, he played less frequently; he resigned as Sussex captain in 1929 and retired three years later. He subsequently became a writer, journalist and cricket commentator while maintaining his connections with Sussex.|$|E

5|$|Jardine entered New College, Oxford, in September 1919 at a {{time when}} the {{university}} was more crowded than usual due to the arrival of men whose entrance had been delayed due to the war. He took part in several sports, representing New College as goalkeeper in matches between the colleges, and being given a trial for the University football team, although he was not chosen. He continued to play rackets and began to play real tennis, making such progress and showing such promise that he went on to represent the University successfully and won <b>his</b> <b>Blue.</b> In cricket, Jardine came under the coaching of Tom Hayward who influenced his footwork and defence. Wisden commented in 1928 that Jardine had come with an excellent reputation, but did not quite achieve the success which was expected. His batting ability, particularly defensively, remained unquestioned.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{either had}} no live {{models for the}} eastern {{chipmunk}} characters, or borrowed a pet chipmunk from a cousin. Initially, {{she may have been}} unsure of how to draw the chipmunks and chose to clothe them, then was forced to follow suit and clothe the two main players as well, while leaving the other squirrels in their natural state. Or, she may have clothed Timmy and Goody because they collect their nuts in sacks (an unnatural way for squirrels to behave) in imitation of a ruse she employed in Peter Rabbit when Peter only walks on his hind legs while wearing <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> jacket. When he loses his jacket, he reverts to being an animal and moves about on all fours. Because Timmy and Chippy were not drawn from nature, the two suggest stuffed animals in their lack of engaging facial expressions.|$|E
5|$|The Veterans Administration (VA), {{charged with}} {{implementing}} {{the provisions of}} the G.I. Bill, denied benefits to blue-discharge veterans, despite the Bill's explicit language that made only a dishonorable discharge grounds for denying benefits to a veteran. In 1945, the VA issued a directive that all blue-discharges for homosexuality would be denied benefits. On December 22, 1955, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an appeal from Raymond W. Longernecker, who had been denied his G.I. Bill benefits by the VA because of <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> discharge. The Court found that the VA had discretion in awarding benefits and that Congress had specifically foreclosed the courts from overruling it. Nevertheless, the Court noted that the denial of benefits should only have occurred if Longernecker had been dishonorably discharged and that the VA Administrator was acting without authority in treating a blue discharge as if it were dishonorable.|$|E

5|$|The {{worship of}} the lingam {{originated}} from the famous hymn in the Atharva-Veda Samhitâ sung in praise of the Yupa-Stambha, the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless and endless Stambha or Skambha, and it is shown that the said Skambha is put {{in place of the}} eternal Brahman. Just as the Yajna (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the Soma plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the Vedic sacrifice gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva's body, his tawny matted hair, <b>his</b> <b>blue</b> throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the Yupa-Skambha gave place in time to the Shiva-Linga. In the text Linga Purana, the same hymn is expanded in the shape of stories, meant to establish the glory of the great Stambha and the superiority of Shiva as Mahadeva.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Jardine went to Balliol College, Oxford. He {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Oxford University against the Gentlemen of England. In his third match, against Lancashire, he passed fifty {{for the first}} time. Although his next highest score in fifteen innings was just 33, and he failed to reach double figures eight times, he was awarded <b>his</b> <b>Blue.</b> He had some success with his bowling, taking five wickets for 78 in a Surrey total of 614. He played in the University Match but failed to score in either innings and Oxford lost heavily. In total, he scored 198 runs {{at an average of}} 13.20. The following season, Jardine scored more runs at a higher average, but failed to pass fifty in an innings. He scored 218 runs at an average of 14.53 and did not bowl. Although he was more successful in the University Match, scoring 3 and 24, Oxford lost again after being bowled out for 42 in their first innings. In 1891, Jardine was appointed captain of the University. He further improved his aggregate and average with 255 runs at an average of 18.21, and took two wickets for five runs in the only innings in which he bowled. In the second and third matches, he scored 62 not out and 70 in consecutive innings against the Gentlemen of England and H Phillipson's XI, but did not pass fifty again. Playing in the University Match, he scored a duck in the first innings and 15 in the second, and Oxford lost their third successive match, although they took eight wickets before Cambridge reached their target of 93.|$|E
25|$|At Cambridge University, he {{received}} <b>his</b> <b>Blue</b> in 1932, {{making his first}} class debut against Yorkshire on 11 May 1932. Over three seasons with Cambridge, he made 30 appearances scoring 1938 runs {{at an average of}} 43.06.|$|E
