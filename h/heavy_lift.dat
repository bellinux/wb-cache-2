5|$|During late 1944 {{and early}} 1945 the Australian Army {{suffered}} from a shortage of shipping, leading to delays in moving heavy equipment and small watercraft from Australia to operational areas in the South West Pacific. While several British and United States vessels were eventually made available in mid-1945, the Australian Army's chief engineer, Major General Clive Steele, chose to design and build a <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> ship for the Army. Steele personally designed the ship, which was intended to support amphibious operations and transport supplies. He deliberately underestimated the project's cost {{in order to gain}} approval for the ship's design and construction.|$|E

5|$|Following several {{design changes}} to the Ares I and Ares V rockets, the RS-25 was to be {{replaced}} with a single J-2X engine for the Ares I second stage and six modified RS-68 engines (which was based on both the SSME and Apollo-era J-2 engine) on the Ares V core stage; {{this meant that the}} RS-25 would be retired along with the space shuttle fleet. In 2010, however, NASA was directed to halt the Constellation program, and with it development of the Ares I and Ares V, instead focusing on building a new <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> launcher.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF began {{considering}} {{options for}} heavy transport aircraft {{to provide a}} strategic airlift capability during the early 2000s. This investigation was initiated after the ADF deployment to East Timor in 1999 and operations in the Middle East from 2001 revealed shortcomings in the RAAF's ability to transport the increasingly large and heavy vehicles and other items of equipment used by the Australian Army. To support these operations, the ADF found that it needed long-range aircraft capable of carrying larger loads than could be accommodated in the RAAF's force of Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports. As {{a result of this}} capability gap, the ADF needed to use USAF transports and chartered Russian-built commercial <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> aircraft to move supplies and equipment from Australia to its forces in Afghanistan and the Middle East. This experience proved frustrating, as both categories of aircraft were often not available and the commercial transports were expensive to lease. The crash of a civil-chartered Ilyushin Il-76 in East Timor in 2003 also raised concerns within the ADF about the safety of the Russian transport aircraft. Following advocacy from the military, the Australian Government announced as part of an update to its national security strategy in December 2005 that it would consider acquiring <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> aircraft to supplement the RAAF's Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules transports. This initiative was one of several measures announced in the government's Defence Update 2005 paper, which sought to better prepare the ADF to operate in locations distant from Australia.|$|E
5|$|Big Gemini, or Big G, {{grew out}} of a 1963 {{proposal}} called Gemini Transport, to develop an enlarged Gemini spacecraft with docking capability, which would take advantage of the increased capacity offered by the Saturn IB and Titan IIIM rockets. It was designed to transport between nine and twelve astronauts into space, {{and to be able to}} dock with space stations, in support of Apollo Applications and MOL missions. It would have been launched by a <b>Heavy</b> <b>lift</b> launch vehicle; either a Titan IIIG or Saturn INT-20, the former being intended for use on US Air Force missions and the latter being intended for NASA missions. The Titan IIIM was also considered, which would have launched a smaller version of the spacecraft due to its lower capacity, to resupply MOL space stations later in the program. NASA also proposed several Saturn IB derivatives with solid first stages as alternatives to the INT-20, offering similar payload capacity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Occupational <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> {{is known}} to impose a high {{cardiovascular}} strain, but the risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) from occupational <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> is unknown. The objective {{was to investigate the}} association between occupational <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> and risk of IHD and all-cause mortality, and the influence of occupational and leisure time physical activity on this association. Methods Data were analyzed from 1987, 1994, and 2000 from the Danish National Health Interview Surveys providing a sample of 6, 692 working men and 5, 921 working women aged 16 â€“ 85 [*]years without cardiovascular disease at baseline. Conventional risk factors for the outcomes IHD and all-cause mortality were controlled for in Cox analyses. Results Among men, <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> was associated with increased risk for IHD (hazard ratio (HR) : 1. 52, 95 % Confidence interval (95 % CI) : 1. 15, 2. 02), while a decreased risk was associated with occupational (HR: 0. 50, 95 % CI: 0. 37, 0. 68) and leisure time (HR: 0. 73, 95 % CI: 0. 56, 0. 95) physical activity. Referencing men with high occupational physical activity and no <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting,</b> men with high occupational physical activity and <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> did not have an increased risk (HR: 1. 11, 95 % CI: 0. 68, 1. 82), while men with low occupational physical activity and <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> had a substantial increased risk (HR: 2. 56, 95 % CI: 1. 52, 4. 32). No significant associations were found for all-cause mortality or for females. Conclusion These findings indicate an excessive risk for IHD from occupational <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> among men, particularly among those with low occupational and leisure time physical activity. </p...|$|R

5|$|On December 9, 2003, the Stellamare, a Dutch-owned ship, capsized at the port, killing three Russian crewmembers. The {{ship was}} hauling General Electric {{generators}} when it overturned. The United States Coast Guard determined that poor communication {{resulting from the}} supervisors speaking Dutch while the crew spoke Russian, with English {{being used as a}} relay, was a contributing factor to mismanagement of ballast tanks. In the early spring of 2008 a port employee was arrested for stealing copper. This in turn led to investigations of employee theft which resulted in the arrest of an operations manager and a maintenance foreman for larceny. In 2008 the port received two awards from the Railway Industrial Clearance Association. One award was for customer satisfaction and the other for being the most improved port in the United States for handling <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> cargo.|$|E
5|$|In early 2006 {{a project}} office was {{established}} within the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) {{to evaluate the}} options for acquiring <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> aircraft. The office considered the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, which was in service with the USAF at the time, {{as well as the}} Airbus A400M Atlas, which was yet to make its first flight. Boeing aggressively marketed the C-17 to the Australian Government during this period. Though unstated, commonality with the USAF and the United Kingdom's RAF was also considered advantageous. In March 2006, Minister for Defence Brendan Nelson announced that the government had decided to purchase three C-17s and take out an option for a fourth. Nelson also announced that the C-17s would be operated by No. 36 Squadron RAAF, which was to transfer its C-130H Hercules to No. 37 Squadron and relocate from RAAF Base Richmond in New South Wales to RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland. Amberley was selected over Richmond as the base for the Globemasters as its runways and engineering facilities were better able to support large aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Australia, Raw was {{appointed}} Director of Operational Requirements at the Department of Air. In 1969 he headed an evaluation team tasked with selecting a <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> helicopter for the RAAF. The team {{was faced with a}} choice between the Boeing CH-47 Chinook and Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion, and Raw's final report recommended acquiring CH-53s. The RAAF's governing Air Board and senior Army officers rejected this recommendation, and CH-47s were purchased instead after Air Vice Marshal Charles Read also reviewed the performance of the two helicopters and concluded that the Chinook better met Australia's needs. Raw remained the Director of Operational Requirements until 1970 when he became the commandant of the RAAF Staff College. In 1972 he was promoted to air commodore and assumed command of RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaysia. Raw held this position until 1976 when he returned to Australia and became the senior training and staff officer in the headquarters of RAAF Support Command. This was his final military posting; he retired from the Air Force on 28 February 1978.|$|E
