40|$|Istanbul and its 12 million {{inhabitants}} borders the Marmara Sea, a submarine pull-apart basin {{related to the}} North Anatolian Fault (NAF), a major strike slip fault that ruptures in M> 7 earthquakes. Constraining the recurrence rate of M> 7 earthquakes that threaten the megacity is problematic because the active faults are submarine. For assessing past submarine earthquake ruptures of the Cinarcik Fault Segment located just south of Istanbul, we studied two sedimentary cores and identified seismoturbidites related to historical ruptures. Earthquake related turbidites are identified in both cores, based on their distinctive sedimentological and geochemical signatures. The seismoturbidites recorded {{in one of the}} core named Klg 04 are inferred to record only mass wasting events related to the rupture on the Cinarcik Segment because of its specific geomorphological location. To constrain the seismoturbidites chronology, we combine short-lived radionuclide, radiocarbon and paleoinclination data. The first four seismoturbidites recorded match the 1894, 1509, 14 th century and 989 historical earthquakes. The obtained age model allows us to discuss past <b>historical</b> <b>rupture</b> scenario across the Marmara Sea.

40|$|The North Anatolian Fault is a ~ 1200 km long right-lateral strike-slip {{fault that}} forms the {{northern}} boundary of the Anatolian plate. A damaging sequence of earthquakes ruptured almost the entire fault in the twentieth century. This study adds to {{the growing number of}} paleoseismic investigations on the 350 km long 1939 Erzincan earthquake rupture segment, which is toward the eastern end of the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey. Using three paleoseismic trenches located along about 2 km of the principal fault strand, this study determines the timing of five earthquakes prior to the 1939 earthquake. The first three earthquakes are correlated to historical earthquakes in A. D. 1668, 1254, 499 and two further events were identified at 881 – 673 B. C. and 1406 – 1291 B. C. (2 σ age ranges).

30|$|Descriptions of {{individual}} fault segments are also important: Although the Coulomb stress on faults is released by earthquakes, the stress at segment boundaries increases both interseismically and coseismically, and fault ruptures tend to initiate there (Nakano et al. 2010). Detailed investigations of coseismic rupture during the 1999 İzmit earthquake revealed that rupture initiated at {{the boundary between}} the Sapanca and Gölcük segments of the NAF (Yagi and Kikuchi 2000; Delouis et al. 2002; Sekiguchi and Iwata 2002). It then propagated along both fault segments, resulting in a single large event. The epicenters of <b>historical</b> <b>ruptures</b> along the NAF are also located mainly at segment boundaries (Dewey 1976; Barka 1996). Initiation of earthquake ruptures at segment boundaries is also supported by numerical simulations (e.g., Duan and Oglesby 2006; Nakano et al. 2010). Therefore, the development of scenarios of future disastrous earthquakes requires detailed descriptions of fault segment boundaries along the NAF.|$|R
40|$|During the First World War, New Zealand {{society was}} {{dominated}} by messages stressing the paramount importance of the war effort to which the country was so heavily committed. Reflecting the total nature of the conflict, these exhortations regularly linked individual duties {{to the war effort}} and associated that effort with larger, or higher, purposes. It is often perceived, or presumed, that the dominance of this material arose from general wartime hysteria or was the result of imposed propaganda - with all the manipulative trickery that term connotes. Either way, such perceptions dovetail with notions that the war represents a <b>historical</b> <b>rupture</b> and that wartime discourse might be characterised as insincere, inauthentic and abnormal. Challenging this interpretation, this thesis considers wartime messages as emblematic of deeper cultural sentiments and wider social forces. Specifically, it argues that they represented the results of a cultural mobilisation; a phenomenon whereby cultural resources were mobilised alongside material resources. Consequently many pre-existing social dynamics, debates, orientations, mythologies, values, stereotypes and motifs were retained, but repurposed, in response to the war. A range of subjects illustrating this phenomenon are surveyed, including collective identity, anti-Germanism, gender archetypes, gender antitypes and social cohesion. This study highlights two major dimensions of the phenomenon: firstly, the relationship between the pre-war social/cultural landscape and the mobilised results; and, secondly, how the ideological war effort operated by layering meanings upon wartime developments. Analysing these aspects of cultural mobilisation sets New Zealand‘s military involvement in a broader context and enriches our historical understanding of the society which entered and fought the Great War...|$|E
40|$|The green {{revolution}} and the global integration of food markets were supposed to relegate scarcity to the annals of history. So why did {{thousands of people in}} dozens of countries take to the streets when world food prices spiked in 2008 and 2011 ? Are food riots the surest route to securing the right to food in the twenty-first century? We know that historically, food riots marked moments of crisis in the adjustment to more market-oriented or capitalist food and economic systems. Food riots featured as part of a politics of provisions that helped hold public authorities to account for protecting people during price spikes or shortages. This research project interrogated this contemporary moment of <b>historical</b> <b>rupture</b> in the global food system through comparative analysis of Bangladesh, India, Kenya and Mozambique in the period 2007 – 12. This was a period of intensely volatile food prices as well as unusual levels of food-related popular mobilisation – unruly political events like riots but also more organised action like the Right to Food movement in India. During the global food crisis of 2007 – 8 alone, food riots (or subsistence protests) were reported in 30 countries. In many, including the four in our study, the food crisis triggered changes in domestic food security arrangements. Working with multiple methods and at different levels with media content, with activists and protesters, and with policy and political elites, this research asked: What motivated people to mobilise around food? And did popular mobilisation effect or influence such changes...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{technological}} imaginary, developments in communication systems are often {{represented as a}} series of decisive shifts and abrupt breaks. The new technology emerges, it seems, out of nowhere, escaping the tentacles of historical materiality. Devoid of a past and promising a future perfect, this narrative of progress helps serve global commodity relations in its uncritical celebration of the new. As a response to these socio-technological representations, this paper argues that the relation between old and new media is more complex than is often assumed by contemporary media theory. Narratives of change are dramatically complicated by the striking continuities between different communication systems. What follows teases out some of these continuities by exploring how geographically distributed postal networks produce affective and aesthetic relations of intimacy. This is not, however, to deny the problematics encountered by critical historiography. The historical approaches of poststructuralism, for example, have offered a rejoinder to a certain universalising version of history that wants to erase difference. In its effort to see difference where hitherto there had existed the smoothness and functionality of structuralism, poststructuralist media theory celebrates rupture and aporia to reveal the disjunction of history and its representation. Yet even as 'discontinuity' has been a useful conceptual framework though which to understand activist poetics and avant-gardism, it is quite remarkable that some of these rhetorical strategies can end up confirming that very methodology and ideology they wish to confound. That is, while arguing for <b>historical</b> <b>rupture</b> against the totalising view of historical seamlessness, these kinds of studies may be seen actually to rejoice in the unbroken narrative of history...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} the public discourse of Vietnam's periods of modernity [...] the late French colonial era (1930 - 1940) {{and that of the}} post-socialist decades (1986 - 2005) [...] produced interlocking notions of what I call queer subjects, subjects who oppose or exceed a normative understanding of heterosexual reproduction. The dissertation posits, however, a diachronic rupture in the dominant meaning of queer between these two periods. Whereas the former exhibited a capacious vision of gender and sexuality, one that pushed the imagined frontiers of the human body, the post-socialist decades marked a retreat to a static notion of mythic tradition that pathologized and purged queer bodies through recourse to a late nineteenth-century European discourse of gender-inversion, the notion of a man "trapped" in a women's body or vice versa. To demonstrate this change, the first chapter {{argues that the}} normative meaning of gender and sexuality in late colonial Vietnam was far more dynamic and expansive than the contemporary scholarship has acknowledged. The second chapter maintains that the sexual regime that Foucault and others scholars have identified in Europe reaches its limit in the Vietnamese colony. The third and final chapter demonstrates the emergence of this sexual regime, albeit in transmuted form, during Vietnam's post-socialist decades (1986 - 2005). Together these chapters support the overall argument of a <b>historical</b> <b>rupture</b> in the cultural meaning of queer genders and sexualities between the period of late French colonialism and post-socialism. In reconstructing this rupture, the dissertation aims to de-familiarize contemporary practices and commitments and, by so doing, illuminate viable alternative forms of gendered and sexual life in twentieth-century Vietnam...|$|E
40|$|In its {{etymology}} and {{in popular}} discourse, the term ‘avant-garde’ is {{commonly associated with}} a future temporality, while in art-historical discourse, it represents a tradition of modernist innovation, periodised as ‘historical avant-garde’ and ‘neo-avant-garde’. Since this historical periodisation was first established in the 1950 s, the avant-garde’s futurity has been repeatedly disputed, bringing {{the very notion of}} an avant-garde into question. This thesis takes as its starting point the predicament of ‘an avant-garde after the avant-garde’ as a means to investigate the philosophico-political implications of a historical temporality marked by ‘afterness’. Writing in critical dialogue with scholarship that has articulated the avant-garde as a notion of historical time, the thesis modifies the parameters of this scholarship by foregrounding the category of historicism, and by reformulating the avant-garde as a notion that both resists and inhabits historical periodisation. As a study at the disciplinary intersection of comparative literature and critical theory, 'Ahead of its Time' proceeds via close readings of selected theories of the avant-garde (German literary scholar Peter Bürger’s foundational Theory of the Avant-Garde in the 1970 s; British art theorist John Roberts’ formulation of a ‘suspensive avant-garde’ in the twenty-first century; and the intellectual debates of the Italian circle Neoavanguardia in the 1960 s), while also mobilising the critical resources available in the thought of Walter Benjamin. Through a non-linear, comparativist critical analysis that discusses these theories in, and as, a Benjaminian constellation, the thesis proposes the avant-garde as a relational, indexical category that is constitutively split between historical continuity and <b>historical</b> <b>rupture.</b> In this manner, 'Ahead of its Time' revisits the broader question of mediation between universality and particularity, and by recasting it in temporal terms, it advocates a chronopolitics of singularity, whereby the avant-garde’s split between continuity and rupture also reveals the ethically-necessary relationship between self-determination and contingency...|$|E
40|$|In my {{dissertation}} I {{investigate a}} claim of cultural autonomy {{at the heart of}} Latin American discourses of identity, and its relation to the concept of nature. When transitioning to the modern political nomos of the nation-state, once political independence had already been attained, Latin American Creoles asserted their cultural autonomy from Spain, elaborating it as a total rupture with the past. The originality of their new national cultures was supposed to derive from America’s status as a romantic state of nature: a landscape set outside the flow of history, a tabula rasa onto which an entirely new history could be written. I argue that rather than being the true basis of <b>historical</b> <b>rupture,</b> the concept of nature acted as an ideology that veiled, and thus perpetuated the imperial logic that Creoles claimed to overcome. In this way, nature became a central tenet of modern Latin American political theology, a territorialized concept of divinity (for romantics) and truth (for scientific-positivism), which, during different periods and under various guises, has served as an ideological ground of the independent nation. From independence onward, Latin American identity would be asserted time and again through depictions of America as a state of nature, consecrating a desire to destroy and displace the past as an a cornerstone of its culture, and thus perpetuating its founding myths. My dissertation investigates the origins of this claim of natural cultural autonomy, its repetition throughout the history of Latin American discourse, {{and the way in which}} it has been critiqued. First I investigate the post-independence period by reading the work of José María Heredia, Andrés Bello, Esteban Echevarría, and Domingo F. Sarmiento, and showing how José Martí adopted their vision of American nature for his thinking of Pan-Latin Americanism and Cuban Independence at the turn of the century. In subsequent chapters I describing how the question of cultural autonomy and nature continues to evolve and investigate the legacy of independence thinking through readings of Latin American literary thinkers such as Jorge Luis Borges, José Eustasio Rivera, Alejo Carpentier, and Augusto Roa Bastos...|$|E

This book seeks to address contemporary paradigms of education and learning in Latin America. Although the production of knowledge in the region has long been subject to imperial designs and disseminated through educational systems, recent interventions – from liberation theology, popular education, and critical literacy to postcolonial critique and decolonial options – have sought to shift the geography of reason. Over the last decades, several Latin American communities have countered this movement by forming {{some of the most}} dynamic and organised forms of resistance: from the landless movements in Brazil to the Zapatistas in the Chiapas region of Mexico, from the indigenous social movements in Bolivia to Venezuela’s Chavistas, to mention but a few. The central question to be addressed is how, in times of <b>historical</b> <b>ruptures,</b> political reconstructions, and epistemic formations, the production of paradigms rooted in ‘other’ logics, cosmologies, and realities may renegotiate and redefine concepts of education, learning, and knowledge. Consequently, this book transcends disciplinary, epistemological, and methodological boundaries in education and learning by engagement with ‘other’ paradigms.

40|$|Which {{significant}} expressive singularities can {{be pointed}} out in the poetic expression of apocalyptic issues in Southern Cone Spanish American poetry? This paper focuses on the poetics of four authors who produced part of their work in exile, as a result of apocalyptic XXth Century dictatorships in the Latin-American Southern Cone: Mario Benedetti (Uruguay), Juan Gelman (Argentina),Oscar Hahn (Chile) and Elvio Romero (Paraguay). Our thematic approach does not concentrate on the Biblical Apocalypse or St John´s myths in literature, but, rather, on the poetic expressions of <b>historical</b> <b>ruptures</b> or extraordinary disasters. The paper takes into account the notion of (poetic) constellation (Monteleone, 2003 & 2010) to explain the non-exhaustivity of the group of poetics and the relevance of considering these four formally dissimilar poetics together. A synthetic characterization of each of the poetics is presented, based on well-known critical studies, discussing and exemplifying: neo-manierism and elements of fantasy literature in Hahn´s poetry; torrential wordiness and symbolism in Gelman´s poetry; “realism” and songs of heroic deeds in Romero´s poetry and “humorous” colloquialism in Benedetti´s poetry. Finally, using Discourse Studies, mainly, the interdiscourse concept (Foucault, [1969] 2012; Pêcheux, [1990] 2009), we show that, despite the underlying differences between the four poetics, two points of convergence can {{be pointed out}}: non-catastrophism and the universal approach of (even local) issues pervading the constellation composed by those four poetic expressions...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{proliferation}} of special effects in Hollywood film has ushered {{in an era}} of digital transformation. Among scholars, digital technology is hailed as a revolutionary moment in the history of communication and representation. Nevertheless, media scholars and cultural historians have difficulty finding a language adequate to theorizing digital artifacts because they are not just texts to be deciphered. Rather, digital media artifacts also invite critiques about the status of reality because they resurrect ancient problems of embodiment and transcendence. In contrast to scholarly approaches to digital technology, computer engineers, interface designers, and special effects producers have invented a robust set of terms and phrases to describe the practice of digital animation. In order to address this disconnect between producers of new media and scholars of new media, I argue that the process of digital animation borrows extensively from a set of preexisting terms describing materiality that were prominent for centuries prior to the scientific revolution. Specifically, digital animators and interface designers make use of the ancient science, art, and technological craft of alchemy. Both alchemy and digital animation share several fundamental elements: both boast the power of being able to transform one material, substance, or thing into a different material, substance, or thing. Both seek to transcend the body and materiality but in the process, find that this elusive goal (realism and gold) is forever receding onto the horizon. The introduction begins with a literature review of the field of digital media studies. It identifies a gap in the field concerning disparate arguments about new media technology. On the one hand, scholars argue that new technologies like cyberspace and digital technology enable radical new forms of engagement with media on individual, social, and economic levels. At the same time that media scholars assert that our current epoch is marked by a <b>historical</b> <b>rupture,</b> many other researchers claim that new media are increasingly characterized by ancient metaphysical problems like embodiment and transcendence. In subsequent chapters I investigate this disparity...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} combines archaeological, ethnohistorical, and iconographic data {{to examine}} how indigenous peoples of Mexico negotiated Spanish colonial rule during {{the early decades of}} contact with Europeans, by means of a focused case study. Specifically, this research is based at the site of Achiutla, located in Mixtec region of the state of Oaxaca, where I carried out archaeological excavations of indigenous households dating to the Late Postclassic (AD 1100 - 1523) Early Colonial (AD 1523 - 1650) periods. Pre-Hispanic codices and colonial chronicles indicate Achiutla was an important native religious center {{at the time of the}} Conquest, and legal records document numerous instances of conflict between indigenous residents and Spanish authorities during the ensuing decades. In focusing on households and material evidence, I explore how this rather traumatic <b>historical</b> <b>rupture</b> affected daily life in ways not accounted for in the historical record. Results of the excavations paint a more complex picture than traditional models of colonial encounters in showing neither wholesale adoption of Spanish customs, nor dogged resistance. For example, native traditions of decorated ceramics flourished after the arrival of the Spanish, while at the same time European-influenced glazed and wheel-thrown pottery was adopted in more limited fashion. Carved stones with Catholic religious imagery were kept within households, yet in ways that were consistent with pre-Hispanic logics concerning the treatment of images. Pre-Hispanic networks of economic exchange were maintained while native peoples simultaneously adopted new technologies such as European forms of metallurgy. The discussion of the data examines how domestic material culture practices were embroiled in social discourses surrounding identity and social negotiation. In focusing on native elites, these dynamics were likely especially complex, as elites relied on both Spanish authorities and their native subjects for their positions of power, and had to strike a delicate balance in negotiating the demands of both of these constituencies simultaneously. In sum, I argue that on the margins of New Spain, where colonial hegemony was more limited than scholars often assume, native peoples were more active participants in processes driving social change and continuity...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{ruptures}} sometimes {{create new}} ruptures, {{not least because}} they are, {{in the language of}} Thomas Kuhn’s influential work on the structure of scientific revolutions (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 1962), susceptible of creating a paradigm shift in an academic context. As a rupture caused by a study of a <b>historical</b> <b>rupture,</b> such a paradigm shift is no less and no more than a change in the basic assumptions about the studied phenomenon. Wael B. Hallaq’s work on the modern-nation state, much like his other influential theses, bears all the hallmarks of a potential view- shifter: it is Saidian or, perhaps, post-Saidian in its critique of European modernity and Orientalism, especially of their intrinsic epistemic violence against Muslim pre-colonial legality; it produces a coherent if somewhat overstated narrative about classical Islamic law and its jurists; and it forcefully denies any possibility of a revival of the pre-modern sharī‘a in contemporary Muslim societies, given the omnipresent onslaught of modernity on every aspect of Muslim legal and social life. Undoubtedly, then, this thesis has and will continue to cause ruptures, to intrigue and irritate; but I doubt it is a paradigm shift. In this address, I try to explain why I think so by means of several very short interventions, which follow three of Hallaq’s foundational assumptions. The first is Hallaq’s insistence on the demise of the sharī‘a as ‘a tenable reality’, occurring in his narrative {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century CE. The second of Hallaq’s fundamental assumptions is that the ‘traditional rulers’, as he calls them, considered themselves subjects to the Islamic law and ‘left the judicial and legislative functions and authority’ to the ‘ulāmā’, while ‘the modern state reversed this principle’. The third, and last, is Hallaq’s grievance about the nation-state’s model of codification of Islamic law, which he describes elsewhere as forceful ‘entextation’ of the selective fiqh qua the sharī‘a, ‘a means by which a conscious restriction is placed on the interpretative freedoms of jurists, judges and lawyers’...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} German historical thought and the travel cultures of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and it investigates how mobile forms of visuality (art tours, sightseeing, urban experience) conditioned the reception of historical traces and historically resonant spaces. Organized around the work and travel of Jacob Burckhardt, Aby Warburg, Sigmund Freud and Walter Benjamin, the dissertation focuses on mobile and visual receptions of the Italian past, at popular and elite levels, and how these challenged and complicated the landscapes of historical consciousness that had been shaped by nineteenth-century German historicism. By examining Burckhardt’s Cicerone and his journeys to Rome, Warburg’s reconstructions of the Italian Renaissance, Freud’s Pompeian “archive”, and Benjamin’s Neapolitan Denkbild, this study reveals how Italian travel became an opportunity for exploration of alternative set of historical reconstructions. Furthermore, by simultaneously reading these phenomena alongside popular accounts of travel and visual culture – such as Baedeker guidebooks and literary magazines – the dissertation brings into relief an experience of history emerging through encounters with material culture, through visual experience and various forms of mobility and displacement. Thus, where conventional approaches of the German historicist tradition – extending from Leopold von Ranke to Friedrich Meinecke - tended to produce historical landscapes organized around linear narrative forms and national geographies, the study reveals forms of historical representation that emerged {{at the margins of}} these historicist practices/territories. In terms of theory, the dissertation borrows the concept of “nomadism” from Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, a concept that captures a form of mobile alterity in both conceptual and physical spaces, and shows how the work of Burckhardt, Warburg Freud and Benjamin represented “nomadic” detours from the historiographical territories defined by German historicism. Furthermore, the dissertation shows how these mobile, visually-oriented and historical “nomadisms” manifested what Gilles Deleuze and Christine Buci-Glucksmann have described as baroque representational forms. Ultimately, the dissertation describes approaches that pursued historical experience not from within the methodological and conceptual territories of classical German historicism, but instead embraced modes of baroque historical experience whose representations were characterized by categories like theatricality, visuality, allegory, simultaneity, and <b>historical</b> <b>rupture...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to study the literary discourse in the narrative texts of Miguel Mendez, contextualizing them within the specific historical time and space of the U. S. -Mexican border during the contemporary period. It is our specific aim to demonstrate that his literary texts are structured upon base that lends them coherence and gives them continuity. A symbolization of an <b>historical</b> <b>rupture</b> or break has meaning on a personal, internal level because it represents the author's irrevocable loss of the cultural milieu of childhood, a history of affective-spiritual disintegration due to specific events in his life. As a literary structural technique found in the narrative world of Miguel Mendez's fictional works, this symbolization presents the characteristics of an ambivalent poetics of rupture that questions the unity of historical reality. The image in his work of polysymmetrical reality has two faces, two perspectives: on one hand, a tragic, pessimistic view of the contemporary world; and on the other, a hopeful, ironic, and optimistic view of life. This bipolar stance {{is a consequence of}} a real break, of a concrete separation, of an historical barrier: the geopolitical and cultural border that is viewed as a powerful obstacle that impedes and makes difficult a collective conviviality between cultures, and ultimately the possibility of a better world. In this sense, Mendez's poetics reflects an external social division. That is, Mendez's view of an imaginary world recreates and is a manifestation, a representation of a border society profoundly and intentionally divided. This division, which occurred ostensibly to establish racial and ethnic order, is reproduced aesthetically and at the effective level in his works as an overall image of disenchantment, disillusionment, and deceit. His is a poetics that symbolizes the dichotomy of separation, barriers, and disintegration. At the same time, it is a poetics that holds out the hope of a new integration of limits and borders. This basic signification that gives coherence to Miguel Mendez's narrative fiction services as a thread that can be traced throughout his works, and it is one that gives them unity. This thread of meaning allows us, on a literary interpretative level, to establish relationships between the various themes found in his most important fictional works. The web of relationships comprise the cultural system whose underlying aspect is the border...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNo major {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} North Chile since the 1877 M w 8. 6 subduction earthquake {{that produced a}} huge tsunami. However, geodetic measurements conducted {{over the last decade}} in this area show that the upper plate is actually deforming, which reveals some degree of locking on the subduction interface. This accumulation of elastic deformation is likely to be released in a future earthquake. Because of the long elapsed time since 1877 and the rapid accumulation of deformation (thought to be 6 – 7 cm/yr), many consider this area is a mature seismic gap where a major earthquake is due and seismic hazard is high. We present a new Global Positioning System (GPS) velocity field, acquired between 2008 and 2012, that describes in some detail the interseismic deformation between 18 °S and 24 °S. We invert for coupling distribution on the Nazca-South America subduction interface using elastic modelling. Our measurements require that, at these latitudes, 10 to 12 mm yr− 1 (i. e. 15 per cent of the whole convergence rate) are accommodated by the clockwise rotation of an Andean block bounded to the East by the subandean fold-and-thrust belt. This reduces the accumulation rate on the subduction interface to 56 mm yr− 1 in this area. Coupling variations on the subduction interface both along-strike and along-dip are described. We find that the North Chile seismic gap is segmented in at least two highly locked segments bounded by narrow areas of weak coupling. This coupling segmentation is consistent with our knowledge of the <b>historical</b> <b>ruptures</b> and of the instrumental seismicity of the region. Intersegment zones (Iquique, Mejillones) correlate with high background seismic rate and local tectonic complexities on the upper or downgoing plates. The rupture of either the Paranal or the Loa segment alone could easily produce a Mw 8. 0 – 8. 3 rupture, and we propose that the Loa segment (from 22. 5 ◦S to 20. 8 ◦S) may be the one that ruptured in 1877...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{does not}} hope to give a finalized portrait of Ireland and its vast and diverse people. Instead, it hopes to add one more piece to the complicated mosaic that is an honest depiction of Irish personal and national identity. Several plays by authors considered to be quintessential Irish nationalists have been {{read in conjunction with}} those authors?? biographies and the historical moments in which those plays were created, to offer a multi-faceted perspective to the intersection between art, politics and individual senses of personhood and nation. The final conclusion is that the growth and development of a nation requires that the definition of national identity be {{in a constant state of}} performance and revision. Several key conclusions can be drawn from the findings here. First, Irish identity is slippery and elusive. To try to finalize a definition is to stunt the growth of a constantly evolving nation. Secondly, personal and national identity formation cannot be separated into two distinct processes. Due to the unique political situation leading up to Irish independence and the subjugated state of all Irish people, regardless of their class or economic distinction, an individual always exists in relationship to those other members of his or her class, as well as those who define him or her by their differences. Finally, because of this constantly evolving state and this complicated interrelationship between the personal and the public, Irish stage drama bears a unique relationship to Ireland, and to critics seeking to analyze that literature. The multiplicity of the Irish experience demonstrates itself most clearly in the consistent newness of repeated performances of its classic texts. By examining the <b>historical</b> <b>ruptures</b> that resulted from the initial performances of those texts and comparing them to the texts themselves, documents that live outside of history until they are drawn back in by those who seek to reinterpret and re-perform them, researchers can witness the evolution of key ideas of Irish nationalism from their roots in personal experience, through the interpretive machine of the early Abbey audiences, and as they continue to transform in modern presentations...|$|R
