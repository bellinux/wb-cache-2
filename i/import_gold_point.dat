In the exchanges rates between gold-standard countries, these limits were known as the <b>gold</b> <b>points,</b> for the reason that, if the price of foreign bills rose above the upper limits determined by the exchange rate, countries would find it cheaper to export gold than to export bills for the purpose of settling international accounts. Conversely, if the exchange rate fell below the lower limit of the determined rate, countries would find it cheaper to <b>import</b> <b>gold</b> than to sell bills to foreign creditors.|$|R

40|$|A major {{question}} {{in the literature on}} the classical gold standard concerns the efficiency of international arbitrage. Authors have examined efficiency by looking at the spread of the <b>gold</b> <b>points,</b> <b>gold</b> <b>point</b> violations, or the flow of gold, or by tests of various asset market criteria, including speculative efficiency and interest arbitrage. These studies have suffered from many limitations, both methodological and empirical. We offer a new methodology for measuring market integration based on nonlinear theoretical models and threshold autoregressions. We also compile a new, high-frequency series of continuous daily data from 1879 to 1913. We can derive reasonable econometric estimates of the implied <b>gold</b> <b>points</b> and price dynamics. The changes in these measures over time provide an insight into the evolution of market integration. © 2004 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>gold</b> <b>imports</b> {{are also}} serving to channelise {{undeclared}} earnings by exporters and importers of India. Invariably, exporters under invoice their exports whereas importers over invoice their imports to stash black money in tax haven countries. This stashed money abroad is routed to India by <b>importing</b> <b>gold</b> (official channel or smuggled) {{which can be}} disposed off in to Indian rupees as gold commands insatiable demand from rural India. This multiple malpractices by importers and exporters artificially widen the official trade deficit by three folds of the actual trade deficit subjecting Indian currency constantly {{at the risk of}} devaluation and de-rating of India by international rating agencies. It is estimated that unnecessary <b>gold</b> <b>imports</b> are retarding growth of Indian economy by at least 3% points.

30|$|During the {{classical}} gold standard, aggravated levels of {{political or economic}} uncertainty manifested themselves in large deviations of the sight-rate from the mint-par (Clare 1902, p. 98). To uncover how the investment demand for bills of exchange reacted to such events, Table  3 splits the sample into observations within and outside (or on) the <b>gold</b> <b>points.</b> Of note, the vagaries to determine the <b>gold</b> <b>points</b> introduce an important caveat to this approach. Still, for observations laying outside the <b>gold</b> <b>points</b> according to the values reported in the “Exchange rates during the gold standard” section, the top panel suggests that the interest-parity condition as regards the London investment demand for continental bills of exchange {{can no longer be}} rejected for the case of Paris (whereas there is only a rejection at the 10 % level for the case of Amsterdam) 9. Although the London banker was, reportedly, “content with a safe and steady rate of interest” (Thomas 1921, p. 78), sufficiently large opportunities to make a chance profit did, perhaps, give rise to more active short-term investment activity in higher yielding bills of exchange on established financial centres such as Paris. Conversely, according to the bottom panel, the results of (3) differ hardly when distinguishing between observations within and outside the <b>gold</b> <b>points.</b> For the continental investment demand for London bills of exchange, where exchange rate risk was hedged, this distinction should indeed be less relevant.|$|R

50|$|India imports {{in excess}} of 1000 tons {{annually}} (including unofficially smuggled gold) with negligible local production. The annual <b>gold</b> <b>imports</b> are around 50 billion US$ next only to crude oil imports widening the trade deficit. In the years since 2001 to 2015, the official net <b>gold</b> <b>imports</b> are 269 billion US$ whereas the Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) invested only 157 billion US$ in Indian equities. <b>Gold</b> <b>imports</b> cost is nearly 3% of the GDP. Alarmed by the huge trade deficit in the year 2012, GoI introduced moderate customs duty (below 10%) on <b>gold</b> <b>imports.</b> Though the policy is fetching good customs income, the imports demand is not drastically coming down. It {{is due to the}} reason that world gold demand is mainly driven by Indians and its price is fixed by Indians in Indian rupees. Imposing customs tax on <b>gold</b> <b>imports</b> in India or devaluation of Indian currency, led to the softening of its international price but remained range bound in rupee terms. Customs duty imposition also led to increase in gold smuggling but narrowed the trade deficit to permissible limit as the smuggled gold would not get accounted as imports in trade deficit calculations.|$|R
