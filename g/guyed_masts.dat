25|$|Ultimately, {{the site}} chosen {{for both the}} {{transmitter}} and the studio was Black Mountain, approximately 5km west of the city centre at 812 m above sea level. Extensive tests from the site proved {{that it was the}} ideal location for the transmitter, with signals adequately covering the Canberra area. The ABC also decided to place their transmitter atop Black Mountain— both would be perched atop <b>guyed</b> <b>masts</b> (as opposed to towers) with each rising to 126 metres and 152 metres, respectively. ABC's studio would be located in Canberra city proper. In order to access the transmitters and studio, a road needed to be built up to the summit— construction commenced in July 1961. CTL were granted the lease to the Black Mountain site on 26 September 1961.|$|E

50|$|<b>Guyed</b> <b>masts</b> are {{sometimes}} also constructed out of steel tubes. This construction type {{has the advantage}} that cables and other components can be protected from weather inside the tube and consequently the structure may look cleaner.These masts are mainly used for FM-/TV-broadcasting, but sometimes also as mast radiator. The big mast of Mühlacker transmitting station {{is a good example}} of this. A disadvantage of this mast type is that it is much more affected by winds than masts with open bodies. Several tubular <b>guyed</b> <b>masts</b> have collapsed. In the UK, the Emley Moor and Waltham TV stations masts collapsed in the 1960s. In Germany the Bielstein transmitter collapsed in 1985.Tubular masts were not built in all countries.
