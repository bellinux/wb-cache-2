There are also invasive plants such as multiflora rose, Japanese knotweed, and <b>garlic</b> <b>mustard</b> in the area.|$|E
5|$|The Tualatin Riverkeepers, {{a nonprofit}} {{watershed}} council based in Tigard; Clean Water Services, a public utility that protects water {{resources in the}} Tualatin River watershed, and the Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District (THPRD) have formed the Tualatin Basin Invasive Species Working Group to identify and eradicate invasive plants that displace native plants, cause erosion, and diminish water quality. The five plants considered most threatening are Japanese knotweed, meadow knapweed, giant hogweed, <b>garlic</b> <b>mustard</b> and purple loosestrife. The Oregon Department of Agriculture {{and the city of}} Tigard are working to eradicate giant hogweed from lower Fanno Creek.|$|E
25|$|However, the American {{butterflies}} cannot successfully reproduce {{by laying}} eggs on the invasive weed <b>garlic</b> <b>mustard,</b> Alliaria petiolata, {{a fact that}} threatens their survival as <b>garlic</b> <b>mustard</b> out-competes native mustard plants due to having no biological control species present in North America.

25|$|Dominant {{native plants}} {{are capable of}} {{inhibition}} of EcM fungi on the roots of neighboring plants through the release of chemical compounds or through competitive interactions. Some invasive plants are capable of inhibiting the growth of native ectomycorrhizal fungi through similar mechanisms, especially if they become established and dominant. Invasive <b>garlic</b> <b>mustard,</b> Alliaria petiolata, and its allelochemical benzyl isothiocyanate were shown to inhibit the growth of three species of EcM fungi grown on white pine (Pinus strobus) seedlings. Changes in EcM communities can have drastic effects on nutrient uptake and community composition of native trees, which can in turn have far-reaching ecological ramifications.|$|E
25|$|The pools {{provide a}} habitat {{for a wide}} range of {{emergent}} plants, of which the rarest is bog St John's-wort (Hypericum elodes), previously believed to have died out in Cheshire. The locally rare floating club rush (Eleogiton fluitans) has been recorded at the site. Other wetland species observed here include bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata), <b>garlic</b> <b>mustard</b> (Alliaria petiolata), greater spearwort (Ranunculus lingua), lesser celandine (Ranunculus ficaria), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre), marsh violet (Viola palustris), reedmace (Typha), water violet (Hottonia palustris) and wavy bittercress (Cardamine flexuosa).|$|E

50|$|Forty {{species of}} birds reside in Kings Pond Park, {{including}} many common species of ducks and Canada geese. In the forest, bracken fern is a prominent ground plant. Another plant commonly seen growing along the railroad bed is pinxter flower, or pink azalea (Rhododendron periclymenoides). Herbs such as wild <b>garlic</b> and <b>mustard</b> also grow throughout the park.|$|R
25|$|The {{eggs are}} laid singly {{on a wide}} range of food plants {{including}} hedge mustard (Sisybrium officinale), <b>garlic</b> <b>mustard</b> (Alliaria petiolata), cuckooflower (Cardamine pratense), water-cress (Rorippa nastutium-aquaticum), charlock (Sinapis arvensis), large bitter-cress (Cardamine amara), wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum), and so it is rarely a pest in gardens or field crops. The caterpillar is green and well camouflaged. When full grown it is green above with black warts, from which arise whitish and blackish hairs. There is a darker line along the back and a yellow line low down on the sides. Underneath the colour is whitish-grey. The spiracular line is dusky but not conspicuous, and the spiracles are blackish surrounded with yellow. There is extensive overlap with other leaf-feeding larvae of large and small whites in some wild populations (e.g. in Morocco). It is often found feeding on the same plant as the orange tip but rarely competes for food because it usually feeds on the leaves whereas the orange tip caterpillar feeds on the flowers and developing seed pods. Like other Pieris species it overwinters as a pupa. This is green in colour, and the raised parts are yellowish and brown. This is the most frequent form, but it varies through yellowish to buff or greyish, and is sometimes without markings.|$|E
500|$|About 37percent of the {{watershed}} is wooded. Dominant trees are red alder, bigleaf maple, Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock. The forest understory in the Tryon Creek State Natural Area includes many trilliums; they are celebrated each spring during the park's Trillium Festival. More than 90species of wildflower such as fringecup {{are found in}} the park as well as plants such as sword fern. Invasive species found in many parts of {{the watershed}} include English ivy, Himalayan blackberry, English holly, <b>garlic</b> <b>mustard,</b> and western clematis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{result of}} this {{overgrazing}} on the native plant ecology and grassland was catastrophic. [...] Animals selectively graze on plant species they co-evolved to consume. [...] If an invasive, non-native plant species is introduced into an environment {{where there is no}} competition from animals, it will grow unchecked. [...] This happened on a dramatic scale within the overgrazed preserve boundaries. [...] With no natural competition, autumn-olive, stilt grass, <b>garlic</b> <b>mustard,</b> ailanthus, Japanese barberry, and oriental bittersweet grew without control.|$|E

2500|$|Some authors {{consider}} the mustard white and West Virginia white of North America to be conspecific with P. napi [...] or consider P. napi to be a superspecies.

Females will lay eggs on it, mistaking this non-native species for a compatible native mustard, {{resulting in the}} death of the offspring. Classification is also an issue concerning the European dark-veined white.|$|E
2500|$|Invasive species {{continue}} to be a problem in the Kishwaukee River Basin. 21% of the area's plants have been introduced as foreign species to the area and have since become [...] "naturalized." [...] Some of these plants include <b>garlic</b> <b>mustard,</b> purple loosestrife and Canada thistle. Canada thistle has persisted in the region since as early as 1922 when McHenry County started showing concern. [...] "The county has its regular thistle commissioners and they in turn have been authorized to engage scores of assistants to aid in doing away with these pests ... If the land owner refuses to cut them down at the lawful time, the commissioner simply hires a man [...] to do the work and reports the transaction and makes a bill which is placed against the land at the coming tax paying season", McHenry County officials were recorded as saying at the time.|$|E

The meat is then smoked in a smoking oven and steamed to completion. Peter Varvaro, the owner and maker of the smoked meat at the Main Deli indicates that while the spice mixture is important, it's the method of smoking and cooking the meat that contributes to its flavours and textures.|$|R
