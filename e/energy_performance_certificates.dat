40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Certificate</b> for {{buildings}} is an European instrument for promotion of energy efficiency. Present work {{deals with the}} <b>Energy</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Certificate</b> in Slovenia, as provided by current legislation. The first part deals with the methodology of calculation of energy indicators {{in the case of}} apartment building in Ljubljana. By comparing the calculated values with the measured ones the thesis tries to find the causes of deviations and offer solutions for improvement of certification protocol. Furthermore a comparison of results from different assessors is done, in terms of repeatability of the results, and some proposals for improvement are made. In {{the second part of the}} study possible improvement measures for more efficient energy use in buildings are investigated on the case of existing old apartment building. A simple life cycle cost analysis is performed and comparison between different renovation scenarios is done. It provides a proposal for the integration of the above recommendations in <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> <b>certificate</b> of buildings...|$|R

40|$|V diplomski nalogi bom izdelal tako merjeno, kot tudi računsko energetsko izkaznico objekta. Cilj te diplomske naloge je, da najprej izdelam energetsko izkaznico in nato dobljene rezultate primerjam. Na podlagi dobljenih rezultatov bom ugotovil, katera metoda je učinkovitejša. Računsko energetsko izkaznico bom preračunal ročno s pomočjo enačb in postopkov, predpisanih za ta namen, merjeno izkaznico bom pa izdelal s pomočjo programa URSA. Upoštevati bom moral Evropske direktive o učinkoviti rabi energije in Slovenske direktive PURES 2010. In this BA thesis I {{am going}} to make a {{measured}} as well as calculated <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> <b>certificate</b> of the building. The aim of the thesis is first to create an <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> <b>certificate</b> and then compare the results obtained. On the basis of the acquired results I {{am going to}} determine which method {{turns out to be the}} most effective. The calculated <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> <b>certificate</b> will be worked out manually using the equations and procedures for that purpose, whereas the measured card will be made up with the help of the URSA programme. Conventionally, I am obliged to follow The European Energy Efficiency Directive along with the Slovenian Directive PURES 2010 (Rules on efficient use of energy in buildings 2010) ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the production of}} the measured and the calculated <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> <b>certificate,</b> which is as of late mandatory when selling or renting buildings, as well as with building {{as a part of the}} project of Works executed. The <b>performance</b> <b>certificate</b> has been executed for the two buildings which were built as parts of the development control centre of the company Krka, d. d., Novo mesto. The buildings show similarities in design and purpose. The first part of the thesis {{presents the}} relevance of the <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> <b>certificate</b> and the legislation, which provides a detailed definition of {{the production of the}} <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> <b>certificate.</b> The following part is the presentation of the buildings in reference to their architectural building construction and geographical location. The first part of the analysis presents the production of the measured certificate, which is executed according to the acquired measured data about the monthly energy consumption. The second part of the analysis offers insight into the methodology for the calculation of the energy features and the production of the <b>energy</b> <b>performance</b> <b>certificate</b> using the TOST program. As part of the analysis, the calculation of the energy needed for the functioning of the building and yearly emission of the CO 2 is executed. The comparison of the measured and the calculated values, dealt with next, poses the question whether it is relevant to compare of the two certificates. The factors causing the discrepancy are hereby discussed. Recommendations for the energy renovation are presented in the final part of the analysis. The restoration measures which would result in the reduction of energy consumption are substantiated by calculated simulations in the TOST program. The thesis finishes with findings and conclusions arrived at throughout the entire research...|$|R
