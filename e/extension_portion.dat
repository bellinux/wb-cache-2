5000|$|The term {{extension}} was supported for two key reasons. First, [...] "copyright industries give us United States) {{one of our}} most significant trade surpluses." [...] Second, the recently enacted legislation in the European Union had extended copyright there for 20 years, and so EU works would be protected for 20 years longer than US works if the US did not enact similar {{term extension}}s. Howard Coble also stated that it was good for consumers since [...] "When works are protected by copyright, they attract investors who can exploit the work for profit."

40|$|The {{kinematics}} of wiping {{movements to}} the back were examined in spinal adult Rana Catesbeiana. The aim was to identify {{the elements of the}} back wipe and their functional role. The data show that there are three essential phases of the wiping movement: a placing phase; a flexion of the hip and knee; and a whisk/extension phase. The first phase is the only one which is dependent upon stimulus location. The spinal frog adjusts the hindlimb to account for stimulus location in the rostro-caudal direction. There is no adjustment for stimulus position along the medial-lateral axis of the body. It is proposed that the second phase serves as a preparatory movement for the <b>extension</b> <b>portion</b> of the wipe.

Besides the “traditional” operation of subclassing, classboxes also support the local refinement of imported classes by adding or modifying their features without affecting the originating classbox. Consequently, the classbox concept provides an attractive and powerful framework to develop, maintain, and evolve largescale software systems and can significantly reduce the risk for introducing design and implementation anomalies in software systems [1]. The key attributes of the classbox concept can be summarized as follows: • A classbox defines an explicitly named scope within which classes, methods, and variables are defined...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Classboxes {{are a new}} module {{system for}} {{object-oriented}} languages defining a packaging and scoping mechanism for controlling the visibility of isolated <b>extensions</b> to <b>portions</b> of class-based systems. Unlike object-oriented specialization, the class extension mechanisms supported by classboxes preserve the identity of extended classes and, therefore, all clients of extended classes can benefit from the applied extensions. In this paper, we present a language design and a corresponding implementation strategy for classboxes in C#. A particular challenge in incorporating classboxes into C # is to preserve the identity of extended classes as the. NET framework represents classes as metadata type declarations and access to classes by static links into metadata of the host assembly. However, the local refinement of an imported class results in a new metadata type declaration. In order to guarantee the identity of extended classes, new metadata type declarations have to {{be incorporated into the}} original metadata of imported classes. But this “re-wiring ” has to occur {{in a manner that is}} consistent with the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). ...|$|R
40|$|The insect-parasitic female of Sphaerularia bombi everts its uterus and {{associated}} reproductive structures {{into the body}} cavity of its bumblebee host. This uterine sac then takes over the normal functions of the parasite and leads an independent existence. An examination of this sac shows that {{the surface of the}} uterine cells are differentiated into a network of saccular indentations separating off fine cytoplasmic extensions. The folding of adjacent cytoplasmic <b>extensions</b> around <b>portions</b> of the host's hemolymph results in the formation of pinocytotic vacuoles. Intracellular vacuoles are also formed {{at the base of the}} saccular indentations. It appears that the first stage of intracellular digestion in S. bombi initially occurs by pinocytosis in the outer surface of the uterine cells. The inner and outer surfaces of the ovary and oviduct are modified into lobelike projections to increase the absorptive surface area, and electron-dense droplets originating in this tissue were also observed in the developing eggs. The hypothesis is presented that soluble nutrients are passed into the ovary-oviduct tissue where, after being reconstituted into droplets, they enter the developing eggs...|$|R

The study examined 18 patients monitored at the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology of "La Sapienza" University of Rome between January and December 1995 in whom it was possible to make a correct definition of the lesion to be treated (number, site, size, etc.) using 3 different diagnostic methods: hysteroscopy (HS), transvaginal scan (TSV) and transvaginal echohysterography (TVHS) The authors focused attention on three different parameters: leiomyoma size, <b>extension</b> (intracavity/intramural <b>portion)</b> and evaluation of the residual leiomyoma, which are essential for optimal endoscopic resection. HS enabled the number, size, site, origin, base, submucous portion and relations with tube operings to be evaluated, but did not allow the myometrial part of the lesion to be examined. Integration with TSV, even if this does not allow a precise definition of the extension, highlights the size, site, involvement of myometrial structure and relations with the perimetrium, thus allowing the possibility of evaluating the residual myometrium.
