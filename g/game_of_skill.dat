5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill,</b> as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players. Local laws have varying definitions of gambling games, such as whether a game's elements of chance are predominant over those or skill, or how much control the player has over the outcome of the game.|$|E
5|$|Sulu-type {{compositions}} on the kulintangan {{are found}} among the Tausug, Samal, Yakan, Sama/Badjao, Iranun and Kadazan-Dusun. Though there exist no identifiable rhythmic or melodic differences between patterns with names such as the Maguindanao, each group has their own music compositions. For instance, the Tausug have three identifiable compositions—Kuriri, Sinug, and Lubak-Lubak—the Yakan have two—Tini-id and Kuriri—and the Dusun have three—Ayas, Kudidi and Tidung. Though these melodies vary even within groups like the Maguindanao and Maranao, one theme which characterizes the Sulu-type is the exchange of short melodic phrases between the kulintangan and the Agungs, where both instruments imitate and duplicate each other's rhythms very quickly. This is clearly seen in the Tausug Sinug and Yakan Tini-id and Kuriri compositions where this sort of jousting becomes a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> and virtuoso playing.|$|E
25|$|After {{the closing}} arguments, Judge Stephen S. Walker {{concluded}} that backgammon is a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill,</b> {{not a game}} of chance, and found the defendant, backgammon tournament director Ted Barr, not guilty of promoting gambling.|$|E
50|$|However, most <b>games</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> also {{involve a}} degree of chance, due to natural aspects of the environment, a {{randomizing}} device (such as dice, playing cards or a coin flip) or guessing due to incomplete information. Some <b>games</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> such as poker may involve bluffing {{and other forms of}} psychological warfare.|$|R
50|$|<b>Games</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> include <b>games</b> <b>of</b> {{physical}} <b>skill,</b> such as wrestling, tug of war, hopscotch, target shooting, and horseshoes, and <b>games</b> <b>of</b> mental <b>skill</b> such as checkers and chess. <b>Games</b> <b>of</b> strategy include checkers, chess, go, arimaa, and tic-tac-toe, {{and often}} require special equipment to play them. <b>Games</b> <b>of</b> chance include gambling games (blackjack, mah-jongg, roulette, etc.), {{as well as}} snakes and ladders and rock, paper, scissors; most require equipment such as cards or dice.|$|R

500|$|According to LifeZette, pinball {{video games}} {{from the first}} half of the 2000s were {{released}} with [...] "very little anticipation" [...] of success with audiences. From the same publication, Josh Smith wrote that they all relied on a similar formula: [...] "Make it classic, or add popular characters." [...] Titles based on other franchises, such as Metroid and Pac-Man, were also published alongside those for The Little Mermaid. However, Brett Allan Weiss of AllGame wrote that pinball video games were popular and achieved a status as [...] "a harmless <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> and chance that can be played by thrill-seekers of all ages and persuasions". Weiss found that the release of The Little Mermaid II: Pinball Frenzy reflected how pinball had become a widely accepted activity on the same level as baseball and checkers.|$|E
500|$|In response, DraftKings and FanDuel filed {{lawsuits}} {{against the state}} of New York on November 13, arguing that their games were one of skill, they had been denied due process due to the Attorney General's abruptness, {{that he does not}} have the power to make such a ruling, and that Schneiderman engaged in tortious interference by sending cease and desist notices to their payment processors. On November 16, the two services tried to request a temporary restraining order to prevent Schneiderman from enforcing the cease-and-desist, but a state judge declared their request to be premature. Following the hearing, a spokesperson for the Attorney General declared that he could file a formal lawsuit against the two sites [...] "as soon as tomorrow". The same day, state senator Michael Ranzenhofer introduced a bill that would explicitly classify daily fantasy sports as a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill.</b>|$|E
500|$|In an [...] "IAmA" [...] thread on Reddit, DraftKings CEO Jason Robins {{described}} the service as being [...] "almost identical to a casino", {{described the}} concept of DFS as a cross between fantasy sports and online poker, and repeatedly referred to the service using gambling-oriented terms such as [...] "wager" [...] and [...] "betting". DraftKings and FanDuel have also entered into affiliation and sponsorship agreements with gambling-oriented entities; DraftKings sponsored the 2015 Belmont Stakes and the World Series of Poker, while FanDuel has affiliated with websites related to sports betting. At the same time, both companies have insisted that their daily fantasy games represent a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill.</b> In the 2007 federal lawsuit Humphrey v. Viacom, Inc., Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh of the U.S. District Court of New Jersey distinguished an [...] "entry fee" [...] in a paid fantasy sports competition as being a fee required to participate rather than a [...] "wager", because they are [...] "paid unconditionally", and because the prizes in such games were [...] "guaranteed" [...] and determined in advance.|$|E

500|$|On November 17, 2015, the Attorney General filed {{a request}} for a {{temporary}} injunction to force DraftKings and FanDuel to cease serving customers in the state of New York. In the filing, Schneiderman argued that DFS was merely a [...] "re-branding" [...] of sports betting, and in response to claims that DFS constitutes a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill,</b> he argued that [...] "a few good players in a poker tournament may rise to the top based on their skill; but the game is still gambling." [...] Schneiderman also acknowledged that the two services had [...] "basic compliance issues" [...] (alluding to the inside information scandal), had associated themselves with gambling-oriented entities, and that DraftKings had accepted entry fees from users in states where it argued that DFS was illegal. The Attorney General also issued a subpoena for information from Yahoo! in regards to its own daily fantasy offerings. FanDuel stated that it would comply with the order and restrict participation by residents of New York, while DraftKings stated that it would continue to serve them, arguing that Schneiderman's decision was based on an [...] "incomplete understanding of the facts about how our business operates and a fundamental misinterpretation and misapplication of the law".|$|E

5000|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} Sections 197 to 206 of the Canadian Criminal Code bans for-profit gaming or betting, with exceptions made for provincial lotteries, licensed casinos, and charity events. Many stores, radio stations, {{and other groups}} still wish to hold contests to encourage more purchases or increase consumer interest.

2500|$|Interest in hold 'em {{outside of}} Nevada {{began to grow}} in the 1980s as well. Although California had legal card rooms {{offering}} draw poker, Texas hold 'em was deemed to be prohibited under a statute that made illegal the (now unheard of) game [...] "stud-horse". But in 1988 Texas hold 'em was declared legally distinct from stud-horse in Tibbetts v. Van De Kamp. Almost immediately card rooms across the state offered Texas hold 'em. [...] (It is often presumed that this decision ruled that hold 'em was a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill,</b> but the distinction between skill and chance has never entered into California jurisprudence regarding poker.) [...] After a trip to Las Vegas, bookmakers Terry Rogers and Liam Flood introduced the game to European card players in the early 1980s.|$|E

And reticence is but a habit. Practise it for a year, and you will find it harder to betray than to conceal your thoughts. It hath its joy also. Is there no pleasure, think you, when suppressing an outbreak of tender but fatal confidence in saying to yourself, 'O, if she only knew this?' 'O, if she did but suspect that?'

60|$|The canal-boatmen {{were all}} an heroic race, {{and the boys}} humbly hoped that some day, if they proved worthy, they might {{grow up to be}} drivers; not indeed packet-drivers; they were not so {{conceited}} as that; but freight-boat drivers, of two horses, perhaps, but gladly of one. High or low, the drivers {{had a great deal of}} leisure, which commended their calling to the boyish fancy; and my boy saw them, with a longing to speak to them, even to approach them, never satisfied, while they amused the long summer afternoon in the shade of the tavern by a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> peculiar to them. They put a tack into a whiplash, and then, whirling it round and round, drove it to the head in a target marked out on the weather-boarding. Some of them had a perfect aim; and in fact it was a very pretty feat, and well worth seeing.|$|E
2500|$|The Midway is a carnival-like {{setting that}} {{contains}} {{most of the}} rides at the State Fair. [...] The attractions include several funhouses, roller coasters and other thrill rides as well as numerous <b>games</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill.</b>|$|R

60|$|Croquet is {{a pretty}} game out of doors, and chess is {{delightful}} in a drawing-room. Battledoor and shuttlecock and hunt-the-slipper have also their attractions. Proverbs are good, and cross questions with crooked answers may be made very amusing. But none of these games are equal to the game of love-making,--providing that the players can be quite sure that there shall be no heart in the matter. Any touch of heart not only destroys {{the pleasure of the}} game, but makes the player awkward and incapable and robs him of his skill. And thus it is that {{there are many people who}} cannot play the game at all. A deficiency of some needed internal physical strength prevents the owners of the heart from keeping a proper control over its valves, and thus emotion sets in, and the pulses are accelerated, and feeling supervenes. For such a one to attempt a game of love-making, is as though your friend with the gout should insist on playing croquet. A sense of the ridiculous, if nothing else, should in either case deter the afflicted one from the attempt. There was no such absurdity with our friend Mrs. Dobbs Broughton and Conway Dalrymple. Their valves and pulses were all right. They could play the game without the slightest danger of any inconvenient result;--of any inconvenient result, that is, as regarded their own feelings. Blind people cannot see and stupid people cannot understand,--and it might be that Mr. Dobbs Broughton, being both blind and stupid in such matters, might perceive something of the playing of the game and not know that it was only a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The player uses a cue {{that is like}} a broom-handle with a quarter-moon of wood {{fastened}} {{to the end of}} it. With this he shoves wooden disks the size of a saucer--he gives the disk a vigorous shove and sends it fifteen or twenty feet along the deck and lands it in one of the squares if he can. If it stays there till the inning is played out, it will count as many points in the game as the figure in the square it has stopped in represents. The adversary plays to knock that disk out and leave his own in its place--particularly if it rests upon the 9 or 10 or some other of the high numbers; but if it rests in the [...] "10off" [...] he backs it up--lands his disk behind it a foot or two, to make it difficult for its owner to knock it out of that damaging place and improve his record. When the inning is played out it may be found that each adversary has placed his four disks where they count; it may be found that some of them are touching chalk lines and not counting; and very often it will be found {{that there has been a}} general wreckage, and that not a disk has been left within the diagram. Anyway, the result is recorded, whatever it is, and the game goes on. The game is 100 points, and it takes from twenty minutes to forty to play it, according to luck and the condition of the sea. It is an exciting game, and the crowd of spectators furnish abundance of applause for fortunate shots and plenty of laughter for the other kind. It is a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill,</b> but at the same time the uneasy motion of the ship is constantly interfering with skill; this makes it a chancy game, and the element of luck comes largely in.|$|E
60|$|On {{that first}} storey, the doors stood ajar, {{three of them}} like three ambushes, shaking his nerves like the throats of cannon. He could never again, he felt, be {{sufficiently}} immured and fortified from men's observing eyes, he longed to be home, girt in by walls, buried among bedclothes, and invisible to all but God. And at that thought he wondered a little, recollecting tales of other murderers and the fear they were said to entertain of heavenly avengers. It was not so, at least, with him. He feared the laws of nature, lest, in their callous and immutable procedure, they should preserve some damning evidence of his crime. He feared tenfold more, with a slavish, superstitions terror, some scission in the continuity of man's experience, some wilful illegality of nature. He played a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>skill,</b> depending on the rules, calculating consequence from cause; and what if nature, as the defeated tyrant overthrew the chess-board, should break the mould of their succession? The like had befallen Napoleon (so writers said) when the winter changed {{the time of its}} appearance. The like might befall Markheim: the solid walls might become transparent and reveal his doings like those of bees in a glass hive; the stout planks might yield under his foot like quicksands and detain him in their clutch; ay, and there were soberer accidents that might destroy him: if, for instance, the house should fall and imprison him beside the body of his victim; or the house next door should fly on fire, and the firemen invade him from all sides. These things he feared; and, in a sense, these things might be called the hands of God reached forth against sin. But about God himself he was at ease; his act was doubtless exceptional, but so were his excuses, which God knew; it was there, and not among men, that he felt sure of justice.|$|E
