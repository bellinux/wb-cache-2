40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach that}} enables a mobile "Interceptor" robot to intercept targets in an indoor environment using information from a <b>distributed</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> network. The approach assumes the indoor environment has been previously mapped and that the sensor nodes know {{their position in the}} map. The targets are localized in the sensor network based upon local maxima of the acoustic volume. The current target localization information is reported to an Interceptor robot, which utilizes a dual wavefront path planner to move from its current location to a location that is within visibility range of a target. Results of the complete implementation of this approach using 70 sensor net robots in the Player/Stage multirobot simulator are reported, as well as implementation results to date on a team of physical robots. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a multi-robot system that combines the use of an acoustic sensor net for target detection with an Interceptor robot that can efficiently reach the moving position of the detected target in indoor environments...|$|E
40|$|First {{successful}} {{experiments with}} optical fibre acoustic sensors were performed in 1970 s by Bucaro et al. 1 and Cole et al. 2. Those and later developments were {{primarily concerned with}} point sensors which are equivalent to single microphone or a microphone array with fixed number of microphone. Optical fibre acoustic sensors utilise pressure induced variations in the refractive index of the fibre and its geometrical deformation caused by flexural wave to measure acoustic disturbance 3. Single point optical fibre acoustic sensors are usually more expensive than microphones. However, if {{a large number of}} sensors is needed, distributed optical fibre sensors can offer a cost-effective alternative to microphone array due to the possibility of mapping the sound pressure level as a function of distance. Historically the oldest application of distributed optical fibre sensors (DOFS) were to measure the integrity of optical fibres along long telecom optical links. Just recently the focus has shifted towards distributed measurements of sound and vibration 4. This paper briefly reviews the optical fibre <b>distributed</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> technology. First, we look into distributed sensing principles in more details and compare different methods. In the next section,we will discuss the principle of Phase Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (phi-OTDR) and Rayleigh backscattering, which is used in the system designed and built by Masoudi et al. 5. We will discuss the limitations of the system from acoustics point of view. Then, we propose possible applications of such a system in acoustic measurements. In sections 4 – 6, the results of the preliminary experiment performed in a reverberation chamber are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{computing}} devices {{equipped with}} various wired and wireless network capabilities, built-in microphones and audio capture devices {{are becoming increasingly}} popular. At the same time, sophisticated signal processing algorithms for hands-free acoustic human-machine interfaces are being developed. Those algorithms are currently restricted to dedicated audio hardware, {{in part because they}} require perfectly synchronized audio data. Naive attempts to use the available audio devices for microphone array processing in a distributed wireless setting fails due to the algorithms’ sensitivity to deviations in the sampling rates of the distributed devices. We propose here a synchronization scheme, which combines the microphones of different spatially distributed computing devices to an acoustic ad-hoc network. The proposed scheme is capable to significantly compensate the sampling rate deviations of the different audio capture devices and we will show that, as an example, blind source separation performs well with the synchronized data of <b>distributed</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractSeismic {{techniques}} are the dominant geophysical techniques for {{the characterization of}} subsurface structures and stratigraphy. The seismic techniques also dominate the monitoring and mapping of reservoir injection and production processes. Borehole seismology, of all the seismic techniques, despite its current shortcomings, {{has been shown to}} provide the highest resolution characterization and most precise monitoring results because it generates higher signal to noise ratio and higher frequency data than surface seismic techniques. The operational environments for borehole seismic instruments are however much more demanding than for surface seismic instruments making both the instruments and the installation much more expensive. To address the critical site characterization and monitoring needs for CCUS programs, US Department of Energy (DOE) funded Paulsson, Inc. in 2010 to develop a fiber optic based ultra-large bandwidth clamped borehole seismic vector array capable of deploying up to one thousand 3 C sensor pods suitable for deployment into high temperature and high pressure boreholes. Tests of the fiber optic seismic vector sensors developed on the DOE funding have shown that the new borehole seismic sensor technology is capable of generating outstanding high vector fidelity data with extremely large bandwidth: 0. 01 – 6, 000 Hz. Field tests have shown that the system can record events at magnitudes much smaller than M- 2. 6 at frequencies up to 2, 000 Hz. The sensors have also proved to be about 100 times more sensitive than the regular coil geophones that are used in borehole seismic systems today. The fiber optic seismic sensors have furthermore been qualified to operate at temperatures over 300 °C (572 °F). Simultaneously with the fiber optic based seismic 3 C vector sensors we are using the lead-in fiber to acquire <b>Distributed</b> <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Sensor</b> (DAS) data from the surface to the bottom the vector array. While the DAS data is of much lower quality than the vector sensor data it provides a 1 m spatial sampling of the downgoing wavefield which will be used to build the high resolution velocity model which is an essential component in high resolution imaging and monitoring...|$|E
40|$|In {{the next}} 20 years, {{computers}} will become so cheap {{that they will}} be everywhere – ultimately every product will have at least one computer chip in it. More complex items like cars will have hundreds, if not thousands or more, computer chips each controlling a different aspect of the vehicle. Computers will essentially be a necessity of life, like the oxygen we breathe. How will these computers interact and communicate with one another? How will they work together, solving common goals, to fulfill human needs and desires? A distributed system using Contract Net Interaction Protocol could solve these problems, revolutionizing not only the way we think of computers but our entire world. A distributed system could literally connect every person to every other entity (person, business, object, etc.) creating an intelligent global net. The possibilities of this distributed network compared to the current internet would be like comparing the modern computer to the abacus used in ancient times. Contract Net specifies the interaction between agents for fully automated competitive negotiation through the use of contracts. In essence, Contract Net allows tasks to be distributed among a group of agents. Originally perceived by Smith in 1980, it was first applied to a simulated <b>distributed</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> network. One of the most promising uses for Contract Net is to create an electronic marketplace for buying and selling goods. An important idea to note is that each agent is self-interested, meaning that the final solution maybe be the best for the agents involved, but not for the group as a whole. A simple analogy is to think of a system like eBay. However, Contract Net is an improvement on this online marketplace. Under a Contract Net system, a user could specify the good he wanted as well as a price maximum price he was willing to pay. The agent program would then find other user(s) willing to sell the good within the desired price range. The user with the lowest price would then be selected to fulfill the contract. Other details such as units (quantity) of the good and the delivery time could also be specified. This example can be expanded to demonstrate wide-scale industrial and commercial uses of Contract Net. In any manufacturing process specific inputs are required at certai...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{outlines}} novel {{approaches to}} design {{a new generation of}} <b>distributed</b> networks of <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors.</b> The key-concept is marked by the use of time-frequency signal analysis tools directly embedded at the sensor node. The general framework for analysis at the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> level is based on spectrogram which is very simple and easy to implement. The choice of the detection threshold in time-frequency domain is always a difficult task, even more complicated in the embedded computing configurations where eventual threshold adaptive selection algorithms might not have the required complexity. That is, the performances in terms of probability of detection classification and localization accuracy are generally strongly depending of the operational conditions. As such, this paper proposes a novel approach of local signal processing based on phase coherence criterion, designed to track the time-frequency multi-components and which is implemented in a distributed network with a minimum number of <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} aspects {{affecting}} {{the quality of life}} of people living in urban and suburban areas is their continued exposure to high Road Traffic Noise (RTN) levels. Until now, noise measurements in cities have been performed by professionals, recording data in certain locations to build a noise map afterwards. However, the deployment of Wireless <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Sensor</b> Networks (WASN) has enabled automatic noise mapping in smart cities. In order to obtain a reliable picture of the RTN levels affecting citizens, Anomalous Noise Events (ANE) unrelated to road traffic should be removed from the noise map computation. To this aim, this paper introduces an Anomalous Noise Event Detector (ANED) designed to differentiate between RTN and ANE in real time within a predefined interval running on the <b>distributed</b> low-cost <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> of a WASN. The proposed ANED follows a two-class audio event detection and classification approach, instead of multi-class or one-class classification schemes, taking advantage of the collection of representative acoustic data in real-life environments. The experiments conducted within the DYNAMAP project, implemented on ARM-based <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors,</b> show the feasibility of the proposal both in terms of computational cost and classification performance using standard Mel cepstral coefficients and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The two-class GMM core classifier relatively improves the baseline universal GMM one-class classifier F 1 measure by 18. 7 % and 31. 8 % for suburban and urban environments, respectively, within the 1 -s integration interval. Nevertheless, according to the results, the classification performance of the current ANED implementation still has room for improvement...|$|R
40|$|<b>Distributed</b> <b>acoustic</b> {{emission}} <b>sensors</b> {{are used}} in structural health monitoring (SHM) {{for the detection of}} impacts and/or strain, in real time. Secondary damage may result from the initial impact or strain. This damage may include surface pitting, erosion, or cracking. This type of damage may not be detectable by the SHM system, specifically in passive fiber optic based sensing systems. The integration of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) by robots into SHM enables the detection and monitoring of a wider variety of damage. Communicating via acoustic transmissions represents a wireless communications method for use by NDE inspection robots to communicate with an integrated SHM system that does not require any additional hardware, as piezoelectric transducers are commonly used in the NDE of materials. In this paper, we demonstrate the detection of both acoustic emissions and transmissions with a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) <b>sensor.</b> The <b>acoustic</b> communications channel comprises of a piezoelectric transmitter, an aluminum panel as the transmission medium, and a FBG receiver. Phase Shift Keying was used to encode the acoustic transmissions. Results for the frequency and transient response of the channel are presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of <b>distributed</b> {{compression}} in <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> networks. A typical scenario consists of a set of microphones that record a sound source located at some unknown position. The goal then is to convey the corresponding audio signals to a central base station for processing. We thus aim at designing efficient distributed communication schemes that minimize the overall bit-rate needed in order to achieve a given reconstruction accuracy. In this paper, we show how the a priori knowledge of the system’s geometry can be beneficially used in order to lower the transmission rates. We propose a distributed coding scheme for simple synthetic sources. These results are then applied to more general signals by means of oversampled analog-to-digital conversion. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our approach. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a hybrid <b>distributed</b> <b>acoustic</b> and temperature <b>sensor</b> (DATS) using a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) distributed feedback (DFB) laser, a single-mode optical fiber, {{and a common}} receiver block. We show that the spectral and frequency noise characteristics of the laser, combined with a suitable modulation scheme, ensure the inter-pulse incoherence and intra-pulse coherence conditions required for exploiting the fast denoising benefits of cyclic Simplex pulse coding in the hybrid measurement. The proposed technique enables simultaneous, distributed measurement of vibrations and temperature, with key industrial applications in structural health monitoring and industrial process control systems. The sensor is able to clearly identify a 500 Hz vibration at 5 km distance along a standard single-mode fiber and simultaneously measure the temperature profile along the same fiber with a temperature resolution of less than 0. 5 °C with 5 m spatial resolution...|$|R
40|$|Different {{centralized}} approaches such as least-squares (LS) and particle filtering (PF) algorithms {{have been}} developed to localize an acoustic source by using a <b>distributed</b> <b>acoustic</b> vector <b>sensor</b> (AVS) array. However, such algorithms are either not applicable for multiple sources or rely heavily on sensor-processor communication. In this paper, a distributed unscented PF (DUPF) approach is proposed for multiple acoustic source tracking. At each distributed AVS node, the first-order and the second-order statistics of the local state are estimated by using an unscented information filter (UIF) based PF. The UIF is employed to approximate the optimum importance function due to its simplicity, by which the matrix operation is the state information matrix rather than the covariance matrix of the measurement sequence. These local statistics are then fused between neighbor nodes and a consensus filter is applied to achieve a global estimation. In such an architecture, only the state statistics need to be transmitted among the neighbor nodes. Consequently, the communication cost can be reduced. The distributed posterior Cramer-Rao bound is also derived. Simulation results show that the performance of the DUPF tracking approach {{is similar to that of}} centralized PF algorithm and significantly better than that of LS algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.

50|$|Urban areas {{typically}} exhibit diurnal noise patterns where {{background noise}} is higher during the daytime and lower at night, where {{the noise floor}} directly correlates to urban activity (e.g., automobile traffic, airplane traffic, construction, and so on). During the day, when the noise floor is higher, a typical handgun muzzle blast may propagate {{as much as a}} mile. During the night, when the noise floor is lower, a typical handgun muzzle blast may propagate as much as 2 miles. Therefore, a co-located array of microphones or a <b>distributed</b> array of <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> that hear a muzzle blast at different times can contribute to calculating the location of the origin of the discharge provided that each microphone/sensor can specify to within a millisecond when it detected the impulse. Using this information, it is possible to discriminate between gunfire and normal community noises by placing <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> at wide distances so that only extremely loud sounds (i.e., gunfire) can reach several sensors; this has been termed a ‘spatial filter’ in the first patent issued to ShotSpotter, Inc.Infrared detection systems have a similar advantage at night because the sensor does not have to contend with any solar contributions to the background signal. At night, the signature of the gunshot will not be partially hidden within the background of solar IR contributions. Most flash suppressors are designed to minimize the visible signature of the gunfire. Flash suppressors break up the expanding gases into focused cones, thereby minimizing the blossoming effect of the exploding gasses. These focused cones contain more of the signature in a smaller volume. The added signal strength helps to increase detection range.|$|R

In the {{considered}} scenario, multiple <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes within communication {{range of a}} cluster head are grouped into clusters. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes in a cluster detect acoustic signals and convert them into electric signals (packets). Detection by <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> can be executed periodically or randomly and random detection by <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> is event driven. As a result, each <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> generates their packets (50 bytes each) periodically or randomly over short time intervals (400 ms~ 4 seconds) and transmits directly to a cluster head (coordinator node). Our approach proposes to use a slotted carrier sense multiple access. All <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes in a cluster are allocated to time slots {{and the number of}} allocated sensor nodes to each time slot is uniform.
