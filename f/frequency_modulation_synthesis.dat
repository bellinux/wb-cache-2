2500|$|The Yamaha DX7, {{the most}} well known synth of the 1980s, used entirely digital {{circuitry}} leaving it {{free from the}} need of calibration, and vast numbers of parameters that could be accessed. [...] The [...] "FM" [...] (<b>frequency</b> <b>modulation)</b> <b>synthesis</b> method was something {{that had not been}} explored to near this depth. [...] Most synthesizers before this were subtractive. [...] i.e. You start with a very harmonic-laden sound and you selectively subtract from them using low, high or bandpass filters, or some other methods that tended to result in stranger sounds like ring modulation. Also in 1983 Dave Smith's company SCI marketed the first polyphonic synthesizer keyboard that could play more than one sound at a time called the 'Six-Trak'. [...] It had a six track sequencer and each track could access a different sound. [...] The same year the SCI Prophet T8 with optical key sensing became the first piano action emulating midi keyboard.|$|E
2500|$|FM {{synthesis}} (<b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> <b>synthesis)</b> is {{a process}} that usually involves the use of at least two signal generators (sine-wave oscillators, commonly referred to as [...] "operators" [...] in FM-only synthesizers) to create and modify a voice. [...] Often, this is done through the analog or digital generation of a signal that modulates the tonal and amplitude characteristics of a base carrier signal. FM synthesis was pioneered by John Chowning, who patented the idea and sold it to Yamaha. [...] Unlike the exponential relationship between voltage-in-to-frequency-out and multiple waveforms in classical 1-volt-per-octave synthesizer oscillators, Chowning-style FM synthesis uses a linear voltage-in-to-frequency-out relationship and sine-wave oscillators. [...] The resulting complex waveform may have many component frequencies, and there is no requirement that they all bear a harmonic relationship. [...] Sophisticated FM synths such as the Yamaha DX7 series can have 6 operators per voice; some synths with FM can also often use filters and variable amplifier types to alter the signal's characteristics into a sonic voice that either roughly imitates acoustic instruments or creates sounds that are unique. FM synthesis is especially valuable for metallic or clangorous noises such as bells, cymbals, or other percussion.|$|E

The spectra of low piano tones have long been known to display unusual, inharmonic characteristics. Surprisingly, precisely this property allowed for fairly successful generation of artificial piano tones by the <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> (FM) <b>synthesis</b> techniques pioneered at Stanford in the 1970 s. Though FM synthesis techniques are largely empirical in nature, the close correspondence between the spectra of the FM simulation of piano tones and their actual spectra suggests the hypothesis {{that there may be a}} deeper physical connection between <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation</b> and the timbre of string instruments. Recent, highly sophisticated numerical simulations of the physics of pianos have reproduced these characteristic spectra using a geometrically exact form of the equations for vibrating strings. We take these equations as a starting point for an analytical investigation into the connection between modulated waves and instrumental timbre. The content of the investigation is primarily theoretical, establishing approaches and equations which may be used for further exploration. We proceed by deriving the equations of motion from variational principles. The Lagrangian is given careful treatment so that the transverse and longitudinal directions of motion are clearly separated and their coupling is collected in a single interaction term. Approximate equations of motion are then derived. These are shown to have a structure that supports modulated wave behavior. A general form of the solution is offered which has the form a traveling wave plus a correction term. Understanding the correction term demands the solution of a complex set of nonlinear integral equations, though suggestions are made on how determining certain properties of the integral equations would be sufficient for significant insight into the role of modulation effects in the production of distinct musical timbres. Finally, another form of the solution is offered, one more amenable to iterative solution techniques but less transparent in terms of frequency-domain behavior. A discussion regarding the initial conditions and the requirements for the convergence of either of these forms of the solution is given. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|R
50|$|As {{outlined}} above, {{phase distortion}} broadly applies similar mathematical concepts to phase <b>modulation</b> <b>synthesis</b> (often euphemised as, and mathematically similar to, <b>frequency</b> <b>modulation),</b> but their implementation and {{results are not}} equivalent. Whereas PM - pioneered by John Chowning and commercially used by Yamaha - uses an oscillating modulator that can have its own period, PD applies an angular modulator of straight-line segments hard-synchronised to the same period as its corresponding carrier, i.e. modulating each cycle identically. PM/FM produces Bessel function-derived spectra unless linearised by the application of feedback, whereas PD produces more linear spectra. This manifests in PD synths' reputation for being easier to produce traditional subtractive sounds, such as those typically associated with analogue synths, which are characterised by linear spectra. These facts demonstrate how although the broad concept - alteration of phase - is the same, implementation and results differ greatly.|$|R
