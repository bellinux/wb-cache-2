Mussie is referenced <b>in</b> <b>travel</b> pamphlets for the Whitewater Region area; one suggests {{that it can be}} caught by a fishing rod.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{remained}} a Senator while {{each of his}} appeals were pending. Allegedly, his colleagues made it known that they would move to expel him if he appeared in the Senate.

5|$|Further {{expansion}} moves {{were also}} made in other global markets during 2012. The African market saw a new agreement with Grand Parade Investments of South Africa to enter Africa's largest economy, with restaurants opening in 2013. In Europe, Burger King {{returned to the}} French market in 2012 with an agreement with multinational operator Autogrill, a move that has met with some excitement in the country. The chain left the country in 1997, closing its 22 franchised and 17 corporate locations after a poorly executed entry into the market that left it unable to compete against McDonald's and local chain Quick. The partnership with Autogrill is a move to consolidate Burger King's presence <b>in</b> <b>travel</b> plazas along major highways in France, Italy, Poland and other European nations.|$|E

5|$|Interstate 11, the Hassayampa Freeway, is a {{proposed}} Interstate Highway in the United States {{to run from}} Casa Grande, Arizona Northwest to Las Vegas, Nevada by way of Kingman, Arizona. The highway will parallel and/or upgrade existing U.S. 93 north of Wickenburg, Arizona; south of Wickenburg, it will follow a new freeway near the Hassayampa River, turning Southeast near southern Goodyear, through Casa Grande and Interstate 10, and to its terminus with intersection of the proposed Pinal North-South Freeway near Coolidge, AZ. Interstate 11 {{is part of a}} long-range vision for the Valley's future transportation needs, as defined by the Maricopa Association of Governments and ADOT. Interstate 11 was approved June 30, 2012 as part of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act. In June 2013, a joint draft study commissioned by the respective DOTs of Arizona and Nevada concluded that the freeway was justified, citing benefits <b>in</b> <b>travel,</b> tourism, trade, and economic growth. The conclusion of the study further clears the way for Interstate 11's funding and implementation.|$|E
