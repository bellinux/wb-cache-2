As common <b>cyclone</b> <b>separators</b> (<b>dry</b> <b>cyclone</b> <b>separators)</b> unable to collect fine particles efficiently, the liquid droplets are injected into cyclone chamber, to improve separation efficiently of <b>cyclone</b> <b>separators.</b> The major focus {{is the study of}} the effect of liquid droplet injection, on the collection of particles with diameter smaller than 10 microns. The problem of isothermal flow-field in <b>cyclone</b> <b>separators</b> is formulated in terms of the Eulerian partial differential equations of the gas phase conservation of mass and momentum An algebraic Reynolds stress model (ASM), is also used to involve turbulence efefcts. A Lagrangian approach is employed to predict the trajectories of discrete phase (particles and droplets) in cyclone chamber. The effect of velocity fluctuations on separation efficiency is studied by use of instantaneous fluctuating velocities instead of the mean velocities. The solid particles and liquid droplets are introduced in a converged flow solution. The injected droplets collect particles by use of one or more several collection mechanisms.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. This mini-dissertation {{reports on}} the {{performance}} of a <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> used to remove excess soot that is typically formed during the production of pebble fuel for High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors. A chemical vapour deposition process is used to manufacture TRISO-coated fuel particles and during this process soot is formed that needs to be removed. This removal process uses <b>cyclone</b> <b>separators</b> as pre-filters and a bag filter as the final means of preventing unwanted particles from being introduced into the atmosphere. An important requirement of the <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> is the need for a safe geometry design. This implies that the containment of enriched-uranium fuel particles can under no circumstances result in a criticality situation. An advantage of this safe geometry design is that it eliminates the use of expensive gamma detectors within the <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator.</b> In this mini-dissertation, the performance of a new safe geometry <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> design {{to be used in the}} removal of soot in the manufacturing of TRISO-coated particles was investigated via theoretical modelling. Various models for predicting the performance of <b>cyclone</b> <b>separators</b> are in existence. These were examined and the best-suited model for the task at hand was selected. The model as described by Li and Wang appeared to be the most applicable and useful, given the available information, such as the cyclone geometries and particle characteristics. Li and Wang’s model, as with many of the other models in the literature, were developed to calculate the collection efficiency. This model was first benchmarked with empirical data obtained from the current <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> used in the production of coated particles at the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) Advance Coater Facility (ACF) situated at Pelindaba in South Africa. The calibrated model was then used to predict the collection efficiencies of three newly designed <b>cyclone</b> <b>separators.</b> The results obtained from the model predicted an increase in collection efficiency for all the newly designed <b>cyclone</b> <b>separators</b> when compared to the existing units. Therefore, this project found that any of the newly designed cyclones should serve as a good alternative to the current <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator.</b> Master...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cyclone</b> <b>separators</b> are {{commonly}} used for separating dispersed solid particles from gas phase. These devices have simple construction; are relatively inexpensive to fabricate and operate with moderate pressure losses. Therefore, they are widely used in many engineering processes such as dryers, reactors, advanced coal utilization such as pressurized and circulating fluidized bed combustion and particularly for removal of catalyst from gases in petroleum refinery such as in fluid catalytic cracker (FCC). Despite its simple operation, the fluid dynamics and flow structures in a <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> are very complex. The driving force for particle separation in a <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> is the strong swirling turbulent flow. The gas and the solid particles enter through a tangential inlet at {{the upper part of}} the cyclone. The tangential inlet produces a swirling motion of gas, which pushes the particles to the cyclone wall and then both phases swirl down over the cyclone wall. The solid particles leave the cyclone through a duct at the base of the apex of the inverted cone while the gas swirls upward in the middle of the cone and leaves the cyclone from the vortex finder. The swirling motion provides a centrifugal force to the particles while turbulence disperses the particles in the gas phase which increases the possibility of the particle entrainment. Therefore, the performance of a <b>cyclone</b> <b>separator</b> is determined by the turbulence characteristics and particle-particle interaction...|$|R
