500|$|Although {{the film}} {{develops}} on these themes of oppression, both {{the narrator and}} Pintilie {{look back on the}} age of Greater Romania with a dose of nostalgia. Simon writes: [...] "What was the most horrible summer {{in the life of a}} young mother, driving her to drink and wasting away, was for her small son the most unforgettably lovely season of his life." [...] Variety argues: [...] "The frantic crescendo of the final sequence has an eerie resonance, as the narrator's <b>final</b> <b>remarks</b> reframe all that has gone before in a different, deeply ironic light." [...] Discussing this aspect, Pintilie stated: [...] "Maybe I'm even a bit perverse to begin the film in a light and playful way: people fall into the trap of thinking it's not a serious film." ...|$|E
500|$|Created by Trey Callaway, David Simkins, and Milo Frank, Mercy Point was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} concept for a feature film. Callaway drew his primary inspiration for the original screenplay from a concept by Frank, entitled [...] "Nightingale One". And while pitching the idea to film executives, Callaway said in his closing comments that he could also envision it as the framework for a successful television series. [...] "Nightingale One" [...] was eventually purchased by Mandalay Entertainment, a production company headed by Peter Guber, but the film's production was stalled after the poor commercial performance of the 1997 film Starship Troopers. However, a producer who saw Callaway's original pitch to Mandalay Entertainment's executives decided to reformat [...] "Nightingale One" [...] as a television series based on Callaway's <b>final</b> <b>remarks</b> in the meeting. After the concept's approval for television, [...] "Nightingale One" [...] was renamed Mercy Point.|$|E
500|$|Brown's victory {{ended the}} 60-vote supermajority in the Senate that the Democrats had held since mid-2009, and {{appeared}} to spell the end {{for health care reform}} legislation. But Democrats rallied and passed the measure; Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was instrumental in doing so, credited Kennedy's life work in her <b>final</b> <b>remarks</b> on the House floor before the final vote. Kennedy's widow Vicki attended the signing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, at which both she and President Obama wore blue [...] "Tedstrong" [...] bracelets. Congressman Patrick Kennedy brought a copy of a national health insurance bill his father had introduced in 1970 as a gift for the president. Patrick Kennedy then laid a note on his father's grave that said, [...] "Dad, the unfinished business is done." [...] (Patrick's earlier decision not to seek re-election meant that in January 2011, a 64-year-long period in which a Kennedy held Federal elective office came to an end, but it resumed in January 2013 (due to the November 2012 election) with Ted's great-nephew, Joseph P. Kennedy III, becoming a member of the House. Democratic control of Kennedy's Senate seat was also regained following Brown's 2012 loss to Elizabeth Warren.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Video game {{developer}} Nathan Frost describes Portal as an [...] "exploration of {{a relationship}} with someone with narcissistic personality disorder". He adds {{that in order to}} fulfill her self-centered narcissistic desire to toy with someone, the player-character is trapped in the Enrichment Center, forced to do tricks for the computer. However, once the player-character becomes skilled enough to break the confines of the center, GLaDOS's secure amusement gives way to [...] "histrionic, bipolar deportment". He describes this as a parallel to how a real-life narcissist might attempt to secure the admiration of another person by empowering them in some ways, but limiting them in others. He adds that this works out well for the narcissist until the other person learns to think and act for themselves. He concludes by saying that a part of Portals resonance {{comes from the fact that}} using the portal gun to escape the center is a [...] "cogent metaphor for escaping an intimate relationship with someone diagnosably narcissistic". Grant Tavinor, author of The Art of Videogames, wrote that GLaDOS' actions and personality in Portal were [...] "in the best of science fiction traditions" [...] and describes her as [...] "insincere, malfunctioning, and probably insane". Wendy Despain, author of Writing for Video Games Genres: from FPS to RPG used Portal as an example of a [...] "modern classic" [...] video game and [...] "how they tell their stories". She called GLaDOS an [...] "endlessly cheerful and clearly insane computer" [...] and called her narrative [...] "simple". Emily Short, creator of a female artificial intelligence character in the video game Galatea, speculates that in GLaDOS's <b>final</b> <b>remarks</b> to Chell (“No one likes you, you know”), [...] "there is a hint that she’s talking about herself, not Chell; that she herself desires an emotional connection that she has never been able to achieve, because she also needs to survive, and all humans are a threat to her... learned that the humans view her as potentially threatening and essentially disposable, and so she has to see them the same way." ...|$|E

60|$|A long {{session of}} three hours followed. The {{deciding}} factor {{was not the}} big automatic pistol, but the certitude that Daylight would use it. Not alone were the three men convinced of this, but Daylight himself was convinced. He was firmly resolved to kill the men if his money was not forthcoming. It {{was not an easy}} matter, {{on the spur of the}} moment, to raise ten millions in paper currency, and there were vexatious delays. A dozen times Mr. Howison and the head clerk were summoned into the room. On these occasions the pistol lay on Daylight's lap, covered carelessly by a newspaper, while he was usually engaged in rolling or lighting his brown-paper cigarettes. But in the end, the thing was accomplished. A suit-case was brought up by one of the clerks from the waiting motor-car, and Daylight snapped it shut on the last package of bills.
