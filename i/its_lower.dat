5|$|Keyser Creek has {{unstable}} banks due to {{abandoned mine}} impacts. Its banks are shallow and natural cobblestone banks in <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> reaches. However, the creek is channeled {{and has a}} steep bank further upstream.|$|E
5|$|Amanita exitialis {{is similar}} to A.bisporigera, a species {{originally}} described by George Francis Atkinson from the United States. In comparison to A.exitialis, A.bisporigera differs by <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> placement of the ring on the stem, smaller spores (typically 8–9.5 by 7–8.5µm), and different structure of the volva. American specimens of A.bisporigera have more abundant inflated cells than that of A.exitialis. Two other white Asian species, A.oberwinklerana and A.subjunquillea var. alba also resemble A.exitialis, but are four-spored.|$|E

5|$|At <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> reaches, {{the terrain}} grows flatter and less rocky, {{supporting}} oak, mesquite and juniper. As it meanders through Wilson and Karnes Counties, passing Zuehl, New Berlin, La Vernia, Sutherland Springs, and Cestohowa, Cibolo Creek meets with the San Antonio River near the ghost town of Helena.|$|E
5|$|In {{its upper}} reaches, most of Scotch Run is closed to public access. For this reason, a 1997 report stated that {{this section of}} the stream offered poor {{recreational}} opportunities. However, the report stated that the stream provided good recreational opportunities in <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> reaches. According to the report, both sections of the stream are poor sites for angling.|$|E
5|$|Like most known tyrannosaurids, Tarbosaurus {{was a large}} bipedal predator, {{weighing}} up to five tonnes and equipped with about sixty large teeth. It had a unique locking mechanism in <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> jaw and the smallest forelimbs relative to body size of all tyrannosaurids, renowned for their disproportionately tiny, two-fingered forelimbs.|$|E

5|$|Much of Harveys Creek is in a forested gorge, {{which is}} {{situated}} in <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> reaches. The upper reaches of its watershed contain swamps and glacial lakes. The cliffs of Tilbury Knob are also situated {{near the mouth of}} the creek. The creek's source is in Harveys Lake, which is the largest natural lake in Pennsylvania. It flows in a generally southward direction.|$|E
5|$|Neptune's spectra {{suggest that}} <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> {{stratosphere}} is hazy due to condensation of products of ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as ethane and ethyne. The stratosphere {{is also home}} to trace amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Brook has a {{high level}} of water quality {{downstream}} as far as Cobbs Gap. However, in <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> reaches, it is impacted by urban storm impacts and abandoned mining land. Silt from the DeNaples Auto Parts property washed into the stream in 1991. There are also stormwater impacts and combined sewer overflows in <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> reaches. Most of the stormwater flowing into the stream is associated with a combined sewer system in Scranton and Dunmore. Some highways in the watershed contribute stormwater as well. It is also affected by stormwater from the Daleville Shopping area, the village of Elmhurst, the borough of Moscow, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. There are 12 stormwater detention facilities in the watershed's lower reaches.|$|E

50|$|ABE arises {{after the}} hyperpolarizing current is terminated: the {{potential}} across the cell rises rapidly with {{the absence of}} hyperpolarizing stimulus, but the action potential threshold stays at <b>its</b> <b>lowered</b> value. As a result, the potential is suprathreshold: sufficient to cause an action potential within the cell.|$|R
5|$|Spring Brook flows {{across the}} Pocono Plateau and {{passes through the}} Moosic Mountains via a water gap known as the Spring Brook Gap. Its mouth is in the Lackawanna Valley. In <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> reaches, the stream is {{channelized}} in a large open concrete channel. A number of bank stabilization projects have been done on the stream from Berlin Village downstream to its mouth. Some land {{in the vicinity of}} the stream is designated as a 100 year floodplain.|$|E
5|$|St. Andrew's Bastion – an {{asymmetrical}} pentagonal bastion. It is two-tiered, with <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> part originally {{containing the}} Marsamxett Gate, which was demolished {{in the early}} 20th century. A small faussebraye is located beneath the bastion. Ponsonby's Column {{was built on the}} bastion in 1838, but it was destroyed by lightning in 1864.|$|E
5|$|St. Michael's Counterguard – a three-tiered counterguard {{built in}} 1640 near St. Michael's Bastion. <b>Its</b> <b>lower</b> tier {{contains}} an echaugette at its salient angle, {{and a small}} chapel dedicated to St. Roche. The chapel was destroyed in World War II, but was rebuilt in 2014.|$|E
50|$|The Dacre knot, {{a type of}} {{decorative}} unknot, is a heraldic knot used primarily in English heraldry. It is most notable for its appearance on the Dacre family heraldic badge, where <b>its</b> two <b>lower</b> dexter loops entwine a scallop, and <b>its</b> two <b>lower</b> sinister loops entwine a log.|$|R
50|$|The {{predecessor}} of the Mega Trailer was the so-called; Swan-neck trailer (1989). This trailer {{was designed}} to ship chassis parts of the Opel Vectra. The Swan-neck trailer enabled shippers to load 5 crates instead of 3 because of <b>its</b> <b>lowered</b> floors which allowed the crates to be stacked.|$|R

5|$|Stafford Meadow Brook {{has very}} high water quality as far {{downstream}} {{as the old}} Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad corridor. The stream has received little impact from development above the Williams Bridge Reservoir. However, its banks are affected by urban debris such as yard waste {{in some parts of}} <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> reaches. Municipal sewers also sometimes overflow into the stream during rainy conditions. The borough of Moosic has a permit to discharge stormwater into the stream.|$|E
5|$|The Avon rises {{just north}} of the village of Acton Turville in South Gloucestershire, before flowing through Wiltshire. In <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> reaches from Bath to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth near Bristol, the river is navigable and known as the Avon Navigation.|$|E
5|$|The main soils in the {{watershed}} of Messers Run are the Leck Kill soil and the Hazleton soil. The Leck Kill soil {{occurs in the}} northwestern part of {{the watershed}} (in <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> reaches). The Hazleton soil is found {{throughout the rest of}} the watershed.|$|E
50|$|More modern Paratrooper rides use a {{pneumatic}} lifting piston {{to raise}} the wheel to their riding angle while spinning the seats.

5|$|The pagoda {{was then}} {{completed}} {{by his son}} King Kyansittha (r.1084–1113). While <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> terraces were built by Anawrahta, the balance structure is credited to Kyansittha. Its final completion date is 1086 and the footprints below the four standing Buddha statues here are also believed {{to be of the}} same period. The pagoda is a replica of the pyramidal Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, the location of Buddha’s illuminating realisation in India.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Toby Creek is {{very narrow}} in <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> reaches. However, it becomes much broader in its {{middle and upper}} reaches. The watershed is developed. The number of employees in the creek's drainage basin {{is expected to increase}} until 2030. Pennsylvania Route 309 runs through the watershed in a north-south direction. Pennsylvania Route 118 is in the watershed's northwestern portion and US Route 11 passes through its southernmost part.|$|E
5|$|Whelp Side, between Whelpside Gill and Mines Gill, {{appears as}} a {{distinct}} shoulder of the mountain when seen from the west, largely grassy though with a few crags and boulders in places, and with coniferous plantations on <b>its</b> <b>lower</b> slopes which were planted to stabilise the land around the reservoir. North of Mines Gill are the Helvellyn Screes, a more craggy stretch of hillside, beneath the north-west ridge, with a loose scree covering in places.|$|E
