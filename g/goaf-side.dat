40|$|<b>Goaf-side</b> entry {{driving in}} {{underground}} coal mines could greatly improve coal recovery rates. However, {{it becomes more}} difficult to maintain stability, especially in deep coal mines. Pillar width plays {{a pivotal role in}} the stability of <b>goaf-side</b> entry driving. To obtain a reasonable and appropriate narrow pillar width, theoretical calculations of the widths of mining-damaged zone and limit equilibrium zone in the pillar are derived according to limit equilibrium theory. Based on the stability issues of <b>goaf-side</b> entry driving in the first island longwall coal face (LCF) at a depth of 800 m below the surface in Guqiao Coal Mine in China, a numerical model is established by FLAC software to analyze the stability of the surrounding rock of <b>goaf-side</b> entry driving during excavation, using various coal pillar widths and support schemes. The results obtained from theoretical calculations, numerical simulation, and engineering practice indicate that an 8 -m-wide coal pillar is relatively reasonable, appropriate, and feasible. Field measurements show that deformations of the surrounding rock could be efficiently controlled 31 days after the support schemes were implemented in <b>goaf-side</b> entry driving with an 8 -m-wide narrow pillar along the adjacent goaf side with a compaction duration of 10 months. The mining influence range of the overlying LCF on the stability of <b>goaf-side</b> entry driving is found to be the area from 50 m ahead of the LCF to 70 m behind the LCF as it passes over the measurement point...|$|E
30|$|The {{retained}} <b>goaf-side</b> roadway {{is subject}} to repeated collapse of its lateral rock strata and continuous disturbance, the movement and crack development characteristics of goaf overburden {{are very important to}} the roadway stability and dictate the gas rich region and drainage position.|$|E
30|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} evolution regularities of overburden’s displacement field and stress field, dynamic development process and distribution of fracture field were analyzed and {{it was found that}} there was an “arch-in-arch” mechanical structure of internal goaf bounded by expansion angle in the lateral direction of the retained <b>goaf-side</b> roadway.|$|E
30|$|In recent years, {{extensive}} {{studies have}} been carried out in the prevention and control of coal mine gas by researchers in China and made a number of technological breakthroughs. One of such breakthroughs is the integrated coal production and gas extraction technologies for pillarless mining of multiple seams of low permeability with the “Y” type ventilation system through retaining <b>goaf-side</b> roadways. These technologies have been successfully applied in almost all highly gassy mining areas in China where 2.1  billion tonnes of coal is produced annually, putting an end to the gas explosion accidents, and achieving safe coal production.|$|E
30|$|As {{can be seen}} in Fig.  9 {{that there}} were rupture-dilative rock areas along the <b>goaf-side</b> {{direction}} of the retained roadway which was bounded by rupture line, that was the fracture stable development zone defined in previous section. The overlying strata caving form in goaf under the retained roadway was similar to that of open-off cut on the goaf side. The roof periodic caving phenomenon did exist in both directions of the working face. Roof on the goaf side under the retained roadway broke in the form of “cantilever” and layered caving. The cantilever breaking point acted as a rotation axis of the overlying strata. Due to differences in the physical, mechanical and geometric parameters, the breaking period of the overlying strata varies, resulting in the formation of a stable structure of fracture development, and this structure can’t be compacted because of lateral stability region balanced action. The fracture closure zone exists in the middle of goaf. The fracture stable development zone {{is on the side of}} retained roadway. A fan-shaped fracture region is formed in this area (or “O” ring), which is also gas accumulation area.|$|E
40|$|<b>Goaf-side</b> Roadway Retained (GRR) without coal pillar {{can achieve}} Y-type ventilation, {{mitigate}} outburst hazard of coal and gas, etc., {{the stability of}} which is the key basis of simultaneous extraction of coal and methane (SECM) for multiple coal seams with rich gas and low permeability. However, its long-term stability until the end of longwall face mining is extremely difficult to control and maintain under intense mining dynamic pressure, especially in deep coal mines. To achieve SECM for multiple coal seams with rich gas and low permeability in Zhuji Coal Mine, GRR with multiple segments innovating Y-type ventilation system is put forward and applied in 910 m deep longwall face. The numerical simulation model is established by means of Universal Distinct Element Code (UDEC) software to analyze the influence of filling wall width on the stability of GRR. The results show that 3000 mm wide filling wall is relatively appropriate. Engineering practice indicates the maintenance duration of GRR with multiple segments is greatly reduced, compared with that of traditional GRR and the deformations are effectively controlled. The amount of methane extraction was 14. 49 m^ 3 per ton of coal on average. SECM has been successfully achieved...|$|E
30|$|In {{multiple}} seams mining, {{the seam}} with relatively low gas content (protective seam) is often extracted prior to mining its overlying and/or underlying seams of high gas content and low permeability {{to minimize the}} risk of high gas emission and outbursts of coal and gas. A key to success with this mining sequence is to gain a detailed understanding of the movement and fracture evolution of the overlying and underlying strata after the protective seam in extracted. In Zhuji mine, the No. 11 - 2 seam is extracted as a protective seam with the pillarless mining method by retaining <b>goaf-side</b> roadways prior to its overlying No. 13 - 1 seam. An investigation has been undertaken in the panel 1111 (1) of Zhuji mine to physically simulate the movement and fracture evolution of the overlying strata after the No. 11 - 2 seam is extracted. In the physical simulation, the displacement, strain, and deformation and failure process of the model for simulation were acquired with various means such as grating displacement meter, strain gauges, and digital photography. The simulation result shows that: (1) Initial caving interval of the immediate roof was 21.6  m, the first weighting interval was 23.5 – 37.3  m with the average interval of 33.5  m, and the periodic weighting interval of the main roof was in a range of 8.2 – 20.55  m and averaged at 15.2  m. (2) The maximum height of the caving zone after the extraction of No. 11 - 2 seam was 8.0  m, which was 4 times of the seam mining height and the internal strata of the caving zone collapsed irregularly. The mining-induced fractures developed 8 – 30  m above the mined No. 11 - 2 seam, which was 7.525 times of the seam mining height, the fracture zone was about 65 ° upward from the seam open-off cut toward the goaf, the height of longitudinal joint growth was 4 – 20 times of the mining seam height, and the height of lateral joint growth was 20 – 25 times of the mining seam height. (3) The “arch-in-arch” mechanical structure of the internal goaf was bounded by an expansion angle of broken strata in the lateral direction of the retained <b>goaf-side</b> roadway. The spatial and temporal evolution regularities of overburden’s displacement field and stress field, dynamic development process and distribution of fracture field were analyzed. Based on the simulation results, it is recommended that several goaf drainage methods, i.e. gas drainage with buried pipes in goaf, surface goaf gas drainage, and cross-measure boreholes, should be implemented to ensure the safe mining of the panel 1111 (1).|$|E
30|$|The {{theoretical}} and innovative achievements in the integrated coal production and gas extraction technology {{have been widely}} noted and highly recognized by the Chinese government and the international mining industry. Since 2006, five international workshops on coal mine gas prevention and control technologies have been successfully held in Huainan, China and attended by over 1200 delegates from various international and domestic organizations, including the United Nation Development Program, Germany, Australia, USA, Poland, India, and Ukraine. The achievements in the integrated technology have been well recognized. The Chinese government organized two nation-wide on-site meetings on coal mine gas prevention and control (in 2005 and 2011) in Huainan to promote the integrated coal production and gas extraction technologies. In 2011, the integrated coal production and gas extraction technologies won the “Outstanding Contribution Award” in the 22 th World Mining Congress. In 2013, the World Intellectual Property Organization and the State Intellectual Property Office of China jointly awarded China Patent Medal to the goaf gas drainage method through roof de-stressing and <b>goaf-side</b> roadways retaining with the “Y” type ventilation system, {{a key component of}} the integrated coal production and gas extraction technologies, the only gold medal awarded in the Chinese coal mine safe production category. In 2014, the project on the comprehensive mine gas control and utilization in Huainan mining area, in which the integrated coal production and gas extraction technologies made up the key achievements, won the China Industry Grand Award.|$|E
30|$|The {{permeability}} of coal reservoir in China {{is generally}} low. The coal seams in Huainan are typical “three-high, one-low and one soft” seams, namely high gas content in coal (12 – 26  m 3 /t), high gas pressure (up to 6.2  MPa), high rock stress (the {{maximum principal stress}} is up to 26.8  MPa), low seam permeability (0.001  mD), and soft coal strength (Yuan 2006). The complex geological conditions pose serious threats to coal mining. In high gas seams, gas must be extracted before coal mining, however the low permeability of coal seams seriously affects the gas drainage effect. Based on the geological conditions of the coal seams in Huainan mining area, the technology of integrated coal production and gas extraction was innovated by Yuan Liang through mining a protective seam with retained <b>goaf-side</b> roadways and “Y” type ventilation system. A key of the technology is to significantly increase the permeability of the overlying and underlying protected seams and subsequent gas extraction from the protected coal seams by boreholes drilled from the retained roadways (Yuan 2008). The technology of integrated coal production and gas extraction requires a detailed understanding of the deformation and failure of the surrounding rocks in working faces and gas migration and enrichment {{in and around the}} working faces, especially the fracture evolution of overlying strata after the protective seam is extracted as the fracture distribution significantly affects the target zones of gas drainage by boreholes.|$|E
40|$|Stability of the {{retained}} <b>goaf-side</b> gateroad (RGSG) {{is influenced}} mainly by {{the movements of}} the roof strata near coal seam after coalface passes by. To make effective controlling technology for the stability of the RGSG, we analyze the roof structure over the RGSG to illustrate the mechanism causing the RGSG instability under different roof conditions. We then examine the dynamic evolution of the deformation and abutment stress in the rock surrounding the RGSG during coal seam mining, using the FLAC 3 D numerical software to reveal the instability characteristics of the RGSG under different roof conditions. Next, corresponding stability controlling technologies for the RGSGs are proposed and tested in three typical deep underground coalmines. Results show that: sink and rotation of the roof cantilever over the RGSG impose severer influence on the stability of the RGSG. The RGSG suffers disturbances three times during the coal-seam mining, and the deformation and abutment stress in the rock surrounding the RGSG increase significantly when the main roof becomes thicker and the immediate roof becomes thinner. Staged support technology involving grout cable bolts has better controlling results of the RGSG stability than that composed of conventional rock bolts, when the RGSG is beneath weak immediate roof with large thickness. Roof structure optimizing technology involving pre-split technology can improve the stability of the RGSG effectively when the RGSG is covered by hard main roof with large thickness directly...|$|E
30|$|A {{large number}} of studies have been {{undertaken}} to understand in the mining-induced fracture distribution in overlying strata (Karmis et al. 1983; Hasenfus et al. 1988; Bai and Elsworth 1990; Shu and Bhattacharyya 1993; Palchik 2002; Unver and Yasitli 2005; Cao et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012; Usanov et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2014). It is generally recognized that overlying strata in longwall extraction can be divided into three different zones: caving zone, fracture zone and continuous deformation zone. Qian et al. (2003) established the key strata theory in ground control. Song (1988) proposed the theory of transferring rock beam. Liu (1995) attributed the damage of overlying rock strata to “three zones”, respectively caving zone, fracture zone and continuous deformation zone, and put forward the general understanding of “three horizontal zones” and “three vertical zones”. Based on the findings of the simulation test, Deng et al. (1998), Guo et al. (2009) and Guo et al. (2012) obtained the evolution characteristics of mining fracture regularity and fractured rock mass. Xue and Xue (2012), Li et al. (2012) and Li and Zhang (2011) developed a method to predict the propagation height of mining induced fractures, the height of fractured zone in top coal caving mining, and the non-steady state evolution of fractures. They also revealed the development of two types of fractures in overlying strata: delamination fractures and vertical fractures. Most of the above-mentioned studies were undertaken in normal mining depth, as mining depth increases ground stress becomes quite high and the pore forming rate and effective drainage time are relatively low (Palchik 2005; Li 2012; Szlazak et al. 2014). Physical modeling test has been undertaken to simulate the <b>goaf-side</b> roadway retaining process in mining the first panel 1111 (1) of the protective No. 11 - 2 seam at Zhuji mine in Huainan mining area. This paper presents the test findings, including the spatial and temporal evolution regularities of overburden’s displacement and stress fields, and dynamic development process and distribution of overburden’s fracture field.|$|E
