5|$|Sometimes {{the colour}} of a tile is {{understood}} {{as part of the}} tiling; at other times arbitrary colours may be applied later. When discussing a tiling that is displayed in colours, to avoid ambiguity one needs to specify whether the colours are part of the tiling or <b>just</b> <b>part</b> of its illustration. This affects whether tiles with the same shape but different colours are considered identical, which in turn affects questions of symmetry. The four colour theorem states that for every tessellation of a normal Euclidean plane, with a set of four available colours, each tile can be coloured in one colour such that no tiles of equal colour meet at a curve of positive length. The colouring guaranteed by the four-colour theorem does not generally respect the symmetries of the tessellation. To produce a colouring which does, it is necessary to treat the colours as part of the tessellation. Here, as many as seven colours may be needed, as in the picture at right.|$|E

Components can contain program files, folders, COM components, registry keys, and shortcuts. The user does not directly interact with components.|$|E
25|$|What seems true is more {{important}} than what is true – Perception of reality is far more influential than the actual objective reality. A person can know that a computer is a box made of wires and processors but can still assign a personality to it. The important point to remember is that these responses are <b>just</b> <b>part</b> of being human and participating in a communication event.|$|E
25|$|Logicism is {{the thesis}} that {{mathematics}} is reducible to logic, and hence nothing but a part of logic. Logicists hold that mathematics can be known a priori, but suggest that our knowledge of mathematics is <b>just</b> <b>part</b> of our knowledge of logic in general, and is thus analytic, not requiring any special faculty of mathematical intuition. In this view, logic is the proper foundation of mathematics, and all mathematical statements are necessary logical truths.|$|E

25|$|In System des transzendentalen Idealismus, 1800 (System of Transcendental Idealism) Schelling {{included}} {{ideas on}} matter and the organic in Part III. They form <b>just</b> <b>part</b> {{of a more}} ambitious work that takes up other themes, in particular aesthetics. From this point onwards Naturphilosophie was less of a research concern for him, as he reformulated his philosophy. However, it remained an influential aspect of his teaching. For a short while, he edited a journal, the Neue Zeitschrift für speculative Physik (bound volume 1802).|$|E
25|$|Religion was not {{stressed}} at the school, but was <b>just</b> <b>part</b> of the curriculum. Many alumni were, {{in their}} adult lives, agnostic or irreligious. Nonetheless, those {{who wished to}} observe traditional Friday evening observances and holidays {{were able to do}} so with similarly interested staff. Most Bunce Court pupils were from families that had assimilated into the local culture and the children knew little about Jewish culture. Nazi persecution and discrimination made them aware of their Jewishness, so that in England, the school added courses on Jewish history, the teachings of Jewish prophets and the ideas of Jewish philosophers like Maimonides and Spinoza. These courses were taught by Hanna Bergas.|$|E
25|$|A {{million people}} in our country and abroad like songs like Kalinka, Katyusha, Smuglyanka and the other songs of the {{military}} years as well as The Day of the Victory, Dark Eyes, Vecherny zvon and Podmoskovnye vechera. All these songs are known because of the Alexandrov folk song and dance company and {{people want to hear}} these songs at every concert. They are not <b>just</b> <b>part</b> of our history; they are great masterpieces. It is interesting that Svyaschennaya Voyna, written by Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov in 1941, helped Soviet soldiers to protect their Motherland and is still popular in Slovakia, Poland and Bulgaria. Those audiences listen to it standing up and it touches their hearts and souls.|$|E

25|$|Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania, who had <b>just</b> <b>part</b> by part {{inherited}} the previously internally partitioned duchy to become her sole ruler in 1625, issued a paper called Dreijährige Drangsal ("three years of distress") after the Swedish take-over, which {{read that the}} capitulation in Franzburg had been forced upon him by the military. At the same time, {{he wrote a letter}} to the Holy Roman Emperor apologizing for the Swedish alliance, saying he had no choice but to obey Swedish demands, and included a passage in the Treaty of Stettin stating the alliance be for the empire's best. Bogislaw did not survive the war: He died without issue in 1637, terminating some 500 years of rulership of the House of Pomerania.|$|E
25|$|Current genetic {{research}} has demonstrated that humans on the African continent are the most genetically diverse. There is more human genetic diversity in Africa than anywhere else on Earth. The genetic structure of Africans was traced to 14 ancestral population clusters. Human genetic diversity decreases in native populations with migratory distance from Africa and this is thought {{to be the result of}} bottlenecks during human migration. Humans have lived in Africa for the longest time, which has allowed accumulation of a higher diversity of genetic mutations in these populations. Only part of Africa's population migrated out of the continent, bringing <b>just</b> <b>part</b> of the original African genetic variety with them. African populations harbor genetic alleles that are not found in other places of the world. All the common alleles found in populations outside of Africa are found on the African continent.|$|E
25|$|Stanley Gilkey, {{a sophomore}} from New Hampshire {{and the son}} of a Congregational minister, was {{probably}} an active homosexual, but he successfully lied to the Court about his associates and judgments. The Court expelled him for associating too closely with Roberts, for demonstrating an interest in the subject of homosexuality, and for claiming the ability to recognize homosexuals. He admitted reading works by Havelock Ellis, but explained that his interest in homosexuality was <b>just</b> <b>part</b> of his more general interest in criminology. Though expelled, the Court had no evidence he had participated in homosexual activity. His request to be readmitted was granted in 1921 and he graduated in 1923. He lived in Paris for two years, then returned to the U.S., where he produced ten Broadway shows over 20 years. He died in Pacifica, California in 1979.|$|E

25|$|The peace {{established}} in Sicily at the Congress of Gela {{did not last}} long. Shortly after the Congress, Syracuse intervened in an episode of civil strife between the democratic and oligarchic parties in Leontini, supporting the oligarchs. Before too long, the prospect of foreign domination had united the Leontinians, and the two parties united in war against Syracuse. Athens had sent an emissary to Sicily in 422 to sound {{out the possibility of}} renewing the war against Syracuse, but achieved nothing. In 416, however, a second Sicilian conflict provided the invitation Athens had sought in 422. The city of Segesta—an Athenian ally in the 420s—went to war against Selinus and, after losing an initial battle, sent to Athens for help. In order to win the Athenians' support, the Segestaeans claimed that they were capable of funding much of the cost of sending a fleet, offering 60 talents of uncoined silver up front, and tricking Athenian ambassadors into believing that the city was more prosperous than it actually was, by making sure that the ambassadors saw all their golden and other valuable objects in a way as if these were <b>just</b> <b>part</b> of what they had.|$|E
25|$|Nicholas {{wakes up}} to find himself entombed alive in a {{cemetery}} in Mexico. He sells his gold watch to escape. He returns to find his mansion foreclosed {{and most of his}} possessions removed. He retrieves a hidden gun and seeks the aid of his ex-wife. While talking with her and apologizing for his neglect and mistreatment, he discovers that Jim Feingold, the CRS employee who had conducted his psychological tests, is an actor working in television advertisements. Nicholas locates Feingold and forces him to find CRS's real office, whereupon he takes Christine hostage. Nicholas demands to be taken to the leader of CRS. Attacked by CRS troops, Nicholas takes Christine to the roof and bars the door behind them. The CRS troops begin cutting through the door. Christine realizes that Nicholas's gun is not a prop and is terrified. She frantically tells Nicholas that the conspiracy is a hoax, a fiction that is <b>just</b> <b>part</b> of the game, that his finances are intact, and that his family and friends are waiting {{on the other side of}} the door. He refuses to believe her. The door bursts open, and Nicholas shoots the first person to emerge—Conrad, bearing an open bottle of champagne. Devastated, Nicholas leaps off the roof, just as his late father did.|$|E
500|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} {{can also}} conceal specific features. Animals such as fish, birds, frogs and snakes can readily be detected by their eyes, which are necessarily round and dark.

500|$|Pfeiffer lent {{her voice}} for the {{character}} of goddess of chaos Eris in [...] (2003), an animated film featuring Brad Pitt {{as the voice of}} Sinbad the Sailor. She had struggles with finding the character's villainies. Initially the character was [...] "too sexual," [...] then she lacked fun. After the third rewrite, Pfeiffer called producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him [...] "You know, you really can fire me.", but he assured her that this was <b>just</b> <b>part</b> of the process. Following the release of the film, she took a four-year hiatus from acting, during which she remained largely {{out of the public eye}} to devote time to her husband and children. At the time, she turned down the role of the White Witch in the fantasy film [...] (2005), which went to Tilda Swinton.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{the credit}} crunch has {{prompted}} buyout firms to pursue {{a new group of}} transactions in order to deploy their massive investment funds.

[...] According to investors and fund managers, the consensus among industry members in late 2009 was that private equity firms will need to become more like asset managers, offering buyouts as <b>just</b> <b>part</b> of their portfolio, or else focus tightly on specific sectors in order to prosper.
