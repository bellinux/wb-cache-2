500|$|On February 8, 1945, Brown {{accepted}} the job, {{saying he was}} sad to leave Ohio State, but he [...] "couldn't turn down this deal <b>in</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>to</b> my family." [...] Brown was still Ohio State's head coach in absentia, and the decision surprised and outraged school officials who expected him to return after the war. The AAFC did not start play until after the war, however, and Brown continued {{to get ready for}} the 1945 season at Great Lakes. That year, many of his best players were transferred to bases on the West Coast as the focus of the war shifted to the Pacific. The team started with a 0–4–1 record, but rattled off six straight wins after the war ended and players returned from service overseas. Within weeks of Brown's final Bluejackets game, a 39–7 victory over Notre Dame, he set off for his new job in Cleveland.|$|E
500|$|McBride {{first set}} his sights on Notre Dame's Frank Leahy as his team's head coach, and the two men shook hands on a deal to make him coach and general manager. Not wanting to lose Leahy, however, Notre Dame's {{president}} objected and McBride backed off. He then asked Cleveland Plain Dealer sportswriter John Dietrich who he should hire. Dietrich suggested Paul Brown, the Ohio State Buckeyes coach who was then serving in the U.S. Navy and coaching a team at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside of Chicago. With his limited football knowledge, McBride had never heard of Brown, and it was Ward who made the initial approach. McBride later met with Brown, whose star was on the rise after bringing Ohio State its first national championship in 1942, and offered him $17,500 a year ($ in current dollar terms) – the biggest salary for any football coach at any level – and an ownership stake in the team. He also offered Brown a stipend {{for the rest of his}} time in the military. Brown accepted the position, saying that while he was sad to leave Ohio State, he [...] "couldn't turn down this deal <b>in</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>to</b> my family." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>to</b> Krause, Jackson [...] "never did the legwork, the scouting, the recruiting, all {{the things}} that the two Jerrys -- Krause and West -- did for him in Chicago and Los Angeles. The league moved too fast for Jackson, and he never showed any desire to catch up. If you're {{thinking}} that Phil might have newfound respect for the jobs done by the two Jerrys, especially the late Krause, whom he regularly mocked while the Bulls were winning six titles, think again". Krause remarked when Jackson become President of the New York Knicks that [...] "Phil didn't take the job because he thought he had a playoff club. He took the job for the money".|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{his most}} {{spectacular}} performances have occurred in Ashes series against England In particular, the famous [...] "Gatting Ball", otherwise known as the [...] "Ball of the Century" [...] which spun sharply and bowled a bemused Mike Gatting in the 1993 Ashes series. Conversely, he has struggled against India, particularly against Sachin Tendulkar: his bowling average against India is 47.18 runs per wicket, compared with his overall average of less than 26. [...] <b>In</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>to</b> Warne, other foreign spinners have also struggled against India in recent years; Warne's contemporary off-spinner rival, Muttiah Muralitharan, for instance, has a much higher bowling average (32.61) in Tests played in India than his overall Test figures.|$|E

The Avengers' only successes in 1942 would be against the light carrier [...] and the battleship [...] In the initial part of the Pacific War, the poor performances of US torpedo bombers {{was due to the}} vulnerability of that type in general against fire from anti-aircraft artillery and defending fighters, plus the inexperience of American pilots and lack of coordinated fighter cover, as well as serious defects in US torpedoes which were not discovered and corrected until the fall of 1943. It took growing American air superiority, improved attack coordination, and more experienced pilots, before the Avengers were able to successfully accomplish their roles in subsequent battles against Japanese surface forces.|$|E

2500|$|They {{added an}} empty threat that anyone {{found guilty of}} profiteering would be barred from {{taking part in the}} Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. In fact, many leading amateurs were paid for playing and it is widely {{believed}} that the most famous amateur cricketer, W. G. Grace, made more money out of cricket than any genuine professional. In Charles Williams' view, the dictum was very subtly worded because it did not forbid amateurs from making money from cricket [...] "off the field of play". <b>In</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>to</b> Grace, he was a general practitioner who had to pay for a locum tenens to run his medical practice while he was playing cricket and he had a reputation for treating his poorer patients without charging a fee. C. B. Fry commented that Grace was the only man who became a doctor of medicine [...] "on account of successful operations on the cricket field".|$|E
2500|$|American successes {{were largely}} {{credited}} to Pershing, {{and he became}} the most celebrated American leader of the war. Critics, [...] however, claimed that Pershing commanded from far behind the lines and was critical of commanders who personally led troops into battle. [...] MacArthur saw Pershing as a desk soldier, {{and the relationship between}} the two men deteriorated by the end of the war. Similar criticism of senior commanders by the younger generation of officers (the future generals of World War II) was made in the British and other armies, but <b>in</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>to</b> Pershing, although it was not uncommon for brigade commanders to serve near the front and even be killed, the state of communications in World War I made it more practical for senior generals to command from the rear. He controversially ordered his troops to continue fighting after the armistice was signed. This resulted in 3,500 American casualties on the last day of the war, an act which was regarded as murder by several officers under his command.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his role}} as manager, Zimmer took over a team that had {{finished}} in seventh place in 1902. [...] By the first of June 1903, the Phillies were struggling with an 11-26 record. Zimmer at that time acknowledged that the [...] "task of managing a team that does not stand so well up in the race {{is not the most}} pleasant one in the world", but he insisted that he was not discouraged and noted that the greater satisfaction comes not from taking charge of a first-class team and keeping it going, but [...] "to take hold of a team that is down in the race and bring it up to a high standard." [...] The Phillies did improve late in the season, compiling a 16-13 record in their last 29 games. However, with a seventh-place finish, the 1903 season was Zimmer's only one as a Major League manager. [...] <b>In</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>to</b> Zimmer, the Phillies simply lacked the talent to compete with the best teams in the National League, had finished in seventh place in 1902 under Bill Shettsline, and dropped to eighth place in 1904 under Hugh Duffy.|$|E

Over the years, he went from being the crew's best friend and just being grateful for the work and all of that to realizing that he was going to be a movie star and wanting to move on.

Cross-layer performance indicators, including power consumption, signal-to-noise ratio, and load variance are optimized using multi-objective optimization (MOO) with Pareto method. Consequently, optimization can be performed simultaneously to obtain a compromise among three resources over all possible path pairs. The Pareto method is further compared to the scalarization method <b>in</b> achieving <b>fairness</b> <b>to</b> each resource. We examine the statistics of power consumption, SNR, and load variance for both methods through simulations.
