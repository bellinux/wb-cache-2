30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig. 2, when a {{symmetrical}} short circuit {{occurs in the}} forward direction of the wind-side <b>directional</b> <b>relay,</b> the phase angle of the terminal voltage of the wind farm periodically fluctuates. With the LVRT capability, DFIGs switch on a crowbar to protect the converter during the fault when DFIGs {{can be seen as}} an induction motor, which leads to a change of frequency. Therefore, a traditional <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> cannot reliably identify the fault direction. On the other hand, the grid-side <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> of the outgoing transmission line performs well in this situation. Further simulation shows that if the fault current measured by the <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> is provided by the power system, the <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> identifies the fault direction correctly and if the current measured by the <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> is supplied by the DFIG-based wind farm, the <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> cannot correctly identify the fault direction.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{seen that}} with the new {{direction}} identification criterion, the <b>directional</b> <b>relays</b> {{on both sides of the}} outgoing transmission line of the DFIG-based wind farm can quickly provide a correct fault direction. The identification process takes just 30 ms.|$|R
30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of wind generation {{technology and the}} increasing growth of wind power capacity in power systems, large-scale wind farms have {{a great impact on}} relay protection [1, 2]. As the electricity collecting element, the outgoing transmission line is quite important for normal operation of a wind farm, especially in a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farm, which is a widely applied type [3, 4]. Thus it is necessary to find a reliable protection scheme for such transmission lines. The <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> {{is one of the most}} important protection elements. A traditional fault component-based <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> is extensively used in practice because of its simple structure, fast response, and good adaptability to load, fault type and transition resistance. However, the fault characteristics of a wind farm are different from those of conventional power systems [5, 6]. Because of the input of a crowbar protection circuit, the main frequency of the short circuit current fed by a doubly-fed wind farm with a capacity of low voltage ride through (LVRT) will be the rotating frequency of the wind turbine before the fault, and it may no longer maintain the power frequency (50 Hz). This may considerably impact on the performance of the traditional <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> which compares the phase angles of current and voltage.|$|E
30|$|<b>Directional</b> <b>relay</b> {{decision}} is imperative for distance relay to maintain system integrity and stability [1]. However, {{the decision of}} <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> is often affected by the instrument errors [2, 3]. CCVT is generally applied in high voltage and extra high voltage system as {{it is capable of}} producing the exact replica of the line voltage in the secondary side at lower cost and with improved accuracy. The output response of CCVT is affected by subsidence transient which may contain decaying dc component, high frequency decaying and low frequency decaying components [4]. Under such conditions, the phasor estimation process will be either delayed or erroneous [3, 4]. The presence of subsidence transient in the secondary side of CCVT is either due to zero voltage fault, high source impedance ratio (SIR), fault with zero resistance path, close-in fault and several other causes such as configuration of ferroresonance suppression circuit (FSC), high burden on the secondary side etc. [5 – 8]. Fault during single-pole-operation is one of many causes behind CCVT subsidence transient [5, 9]. Fault at voltage zero causes magnitude reduction and a phase angle shift of the CCVT output voltage [10, 11]. This reduced voltage magnitude if further supplied to <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> may cause relay maloperation [7, 10].|$|E
30|$|CCVT {{subsidence}} transient is a {{major reason}} behind the <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> malfunction. Fault during single-pole-tripping {{is one of many}} causes of CCVT secondary subsidence transient. Conventional directional techniques based on voltage information are affected by transient condition. Negative sequence based directional relaying methods are not reliable for higher SIR system condition.|$|E
30|$|Integration of DER {{changes the}} network {{topology}} and additional requirement of <b>directional</b> <b>relays</b> arises for which identification of correct backup relays becomes more complicated. However graph theory based approaches {{are used in}} the literature [46], but more reliable techniques will be required for highly complicated networks.|$|R
30|$|The rest of {{the paper}} is {{organized}} as follows: <b>directional</b> <b>relaying</b> challenges with CCVT transient during SPT is described in Section 2. Section 3 explains the different directional methods and the proposed method. Simulation results are presented in Section 4. Finally, the conclusion is drawn in Section 5.|$|R
30|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{researchers}} have been developed different CCVT model using various software packages to conduct the transient studies [12 – 16]. In [17], a detail review of different mathematical models of CCVT to represent the nonlinear behavior of the magnetic core is provided. Also in the literature several phasor estimation techniques have been proposed to reduce the impact of CCVT on distance relay [10, 18]. In [19], the performance report of CVT (capacitive voltage transformer) with electronic FSC under different system and fault conditions is provided. In the literature several mathematical modeling methods, phasor estimation techniques and distance relay algorithms {{have been reported to}} mitigate the impact of CCVT subsidence transient. However, no such specific research article providing the solution to mitigate the impact of <b>directional</b> <b>relaying</b> during CCVT subsidence transient has been reported. With this motivation, the impact of CCVT subsidence transient generated during single-pole operation on <b>directional</b> <b>relaying</b> is investigated in this work and a solution is provided.|$|R
30|$|Doubly-fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG)-based wind farm has the characteristic of transient fault {{with low voltage}} ride through (LVRT) capability. A new three-phase fault direction identification method for the outgoing transmission line of the wind farm is presented. The ability of the new <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> to differentiate between a three-phase fault in one direction or the other is obtained by using the increment of phase angle difference between the memory voltage signal and the fault current signal within a certain time, and using the amplitude variation of the fault current. It can be inferred that the fault current is supplied by the wind farm whether the phase angle differs or the current amplitude varies considerably. Different fault locations at the outgoing transmission line have been simulated by PSCAD/EMTDC to evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of the proposed technique. Results show that the new <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> is of faster response when a three-phase fault occurs at the outgoing transmission line of a DFIG-based wind farm.|$|E
30|$|At {{the moment}} when the {{three-phase}} fault occurs, the frequency of the fault current provided by the DFIG deviates from the power frequency immediately. Frequency tracking according to [11] consumes more time. The <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> presented in this paper only needs to calculate the increment of phase angle difference Δθ and the decay rate of the fault current d, which avoids frequency tracking and is time saving.|$|E
30|$|If the ROCOV relay can be {{supervised}} by a directional signal that indicates faults {{in the forward}} direction, the ROCOV settings can be lowered to cover high resistant faults without reducing the security. Such a <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> will not {{be affected by the}} high dv/dt created during the opening of circuit breakers in the reverse direction. Furthermore, the directional ability greatly simplifies the coordination of settings.|$|E

30|$|It was {{projected}} {{before that}} the different voltage information based techniques which are used for <b>directional</b> <b>relaying</b> during SPT condition have limitations due to CCVT transient. Instead of using voltage information, negative sequence based current-only techniques are also preferred during SPT. However, for high system SIR value the negative sequence component based technique will get affected. To solve these problems, in this paper a positive sequence current base approach is proposed as described below.|$|R

30|$|Different {{speeds of}} a wind turbine {{will affect the}} value of {{measured}} Δθ. A smaller crowbar resistor and a shorter outgoing line will cause a larger stator time constant, which will influence the current decay rate d. The wind farm integration shown in Fig. 1 is built, and different cases are simulated to analyze {{the effect of these}} three factors on the proposed <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> criterion.|$|E
3000|$|According to (9) and (10), {{when the}} {{rotating}} {{frequency of the}} rotor ranges from 47.83 Hz to 52.17 Hz, Δθ calculated by the <b>directional</b> <b>relay</b> would be less than 8 °. On the other hand, the fault current supplied by the wind farm decays quickly while the fault current supplied by the regular power system stays relatively stable. A further algorithm on quantity amplitude shows that the maximum error is 3.38 [...]...|$|E
30|$|Based on this characteristic, the {{threshold}} of Δθ can be set as Δθ_set = 8 ^∘. When Δθ > Δθ_set, {{it means that the}} fault current is supplied by the DFIG and thereby the fault direction can be identified by the <b>directional</b> <b>relay.</b> When Δθ < Δθ_set, there are two possibilities: ① the fault current is provided by the DFIG with rotating frequency near the power frequency; ② the fault current is supplied by the power system. Thus further criteria are needed to identify the direction.|$|E

Different from [1, 17], the proposed schemes in this article increase frequency utilization by considering FFR in multi-cells.|$|R
40|$|The main {{function}} of the protective devices in the power system is to detect and remove the selected faulty parts as fast as possible. <b>Directional</b> over current <b>relays</b> are commonly used {{for the protection of}} interconnected sub transmission systems, distribution systems, or as a secondary protection of transmission systems. For the systems having more than one source connected, that is meshed or looped networks, <b>directional</b> over current <b>relays</b> become the suitable choice for better selectivity, since <b>directional</b> <b>relays</b> operate only when the fault current flows in the specific tripping direction desired. The most vital task when installing <b>directional</b> <b>relays</b> on the system is selecting their suitable current and time settings such that their fundamental protective functions are met under the requirements of sensitivity, selectivity, reliability and speed. The problem of setting Directional Over Current Relay(DOCR) is a highly constrained optimization problem that has been solved as a linear programming problem. The calculation of the time dial setting (TDS) and pick up current (IP) setting of the relays is the core of the coordination. This paper calculates the TDS by choosing one of the available pick up current settings as the predetermined value. The simplex two phase method is used to determine the optional TDS of the relays. Improvement in the solution is brought by using the particle swarm optimization technique to the co-ordination problem for reaching the global optimum value with less computational time. Sample 3 bus and 8 bus systems are utilized for comparing the results obtained by PSO with that of the simplex method. The optimization method used in the recent times minimizes the operating time of the relays much, when compared to the other methods. This method also enhances quicker solution of coordination process...|$|R
30|$|So, it {{is clear}} from the results that the {{proposed}} <b>directional</b> <b>relaying</b> method based on phase angle difference of fault to prefault positive sequence current has satisfactory performance for different critical system and fault conditions. CCVT subsidence transient during SPT condition is not an issue for this method as it is independent of voltage information.
