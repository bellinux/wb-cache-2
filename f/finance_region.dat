40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a simple model of bailing out that closely {{describes}} the intergovernmental relationships between the Central government and the regional governments in the Italian public health care sector. The theoretical model suggests that bail out expectations by regions can be thought as the missing variable emphasised by Culyer (1988) in empirical models explaining health expenditure. We test this prediction by using data on regional health expenditure during the years 1990 - 1999. We show that <b>financing</b> by <b>regions</b> is influenced by political variables that capture changes in bail out expectations. This “expected” funding has a positive relationship with expenditure, even when Central government decreased <b>financing</b> to <b>regions.</b> Moreover, the “alignment effect” shows that “friendly” regional governments receive more money and support Central government by reducing expenditure. health care expenditure, intergovernmental relationships...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper has}} two parts: {{in the first}} one, {{economic}} aspect of regionalization is considered, in the second a financial one. Regionalization, like every type of decentralization, represents a serious reform of a state and brings upon several expected as well as unexpected although significant effects on political, social, and economic life. Its goal is an improvement of political, social, and economic functions of a state, not their deterioration. Unfortunately, experience of other countries does not support overwhelming optimism. Most frequently, regionalization is done due to political considerations; economic considerations are of secondary importance or even neglected. Such a dominance of political reasoning neglects fundamental principles and arguments of the economic science, standards of rational approach to decentralization, and even economic efficiency and equality between citizens. Because of that, the emphasis in this paper is on economic and financial aspects of regionalization in Serbia. In the first part the author explores economic aspects of regionalization; four state functions (regulation, stabilization, redistribution, and allocation) in decentralized setting; relations between regionalization, deregulation, and privatization; vertical distribution of functions (exclusive functions by the state, exclusive functions by regions, shared functions). After that he explores advantages of the selected model of creating regions and distribution of authorities in Serbia, particularly economic authorities of regions (1. land planning, urban land use, housing; 2. development and maintenance of infrastructure of regional importance and coordination of public utilities in municipalities; 3. agriculture; 4. tourism; 5. forestry 6. hunting and fishing; 7. vocational training and employment; 8. ecology; 9. public works).

40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, Austria {{and many}} other industrialized {{countries}} have experienced massive growth in their external asset and liability positions. However, Austria's high degree of real economic integration due to its position as a small, open economy only partly explains this development. Autonomous financial transactions, effected independently of external trade financing from a profit motive, are increasingly determining cross-border movements of capital. Legal measures adopted {{in the run-up to}} Austria's accession to the EU (e. g. the full liberalization of the Austrian financial sector) favored this development, as did the country's participation in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). In terms of the rate of internationalization, Austria has as high a degree of financial integration as Finland and Sweden. However, it lags well behind Switzerland or the Netherlands in this respect. In terms of GDP, foreign equity holdings are on a far smaller scale in Austria than in these countries. Austrian securities investors prefer foreign debt investments.

40|$|This paper reviews some of {{the main}} issues with {{intergovernmental}} transfers in Latin America. The analysis is set {{against the backdrop of the}} basic normative principles of revenue assignments and the practice of sub-national government <b>financing</b> in the <b>region.</b> Own revenue collections and an equalization transfer program are key components of a sound sub-national fiscal structure. However, in most Latin American countries own revenue collections represent a minor share of sub-national revenues and equalization programs, if present, are generally not properly designed. Instead, sub-national <b>finances</b> in the <b>region</b> heavily rely on revenue sharing schemes with often multiple and unclear objectives and with negative effects on equity and economic efficiency. In this paper we provide a critical analysis of those revenue sharing schemes utilized in Latin America, and propose an alternative approach to the structuring of the transfer systems and more generally of the sub-national revenue systems in the region. ...|$|R

40|$|International audience—Nowadays, {{ecology and}} {{sustainable}} development are priority government's actions. In Europe, and more specifically in France, sustainable development (SD) is generally broken down into several distinct evaluation criteria. Each criterion is a requirement imposed {{by the government and}} corresponds to strategic stakes. When SD improvement actions are financed in an economic region or a city of the French territory by the government, a set of measures is usually set up to assess and control the impact of these actions. More precisely, these measures are used to check whether the region or the city has efficiently invested its budget in respect to the SD strategy of the government. This assessment process is a complex task for the government. Indeed, evaluations are only based on reports provided by the <b>financed</b> <b>regions.</b> These very numerous reports are written in natural language and thus, it is a thorny and time-consuming task for the government to efficiently identify the meaningful information in a plethora of reports and then objectively assess all the expected priorities. This project aims at automating the assessment process from the huge corpus of documents. Text-mining and segmentation techniques are introduced to automatically quantify the attention the region or the city pays to a given criterion. Obviously, this quantification can only be imprecisely determined. Then, the possibility theory is used to merge the information related to each criterion prioritization from all the documents. Finally, an application on the 265 largest cities in France shows the potential of the approach...|$|R
