Reduction of <b>diesel</b> <b>smoke</b> by adaptive control was {{the ultimate goal of}} this research. The objective {{of this study was to}} find an empirical model of diesel engine transfer function for control purpose. With an assumption of linear diesel operation in a limited region, the linear theory was adopted. Since a smoke problem generally appears during unsteady operation, fuel metering rate was selected as an input variable. Binary input signals (pseudo-random binary sequence and multi-frequency binary sequence) were selected as input signals. Step input signal was also used for transient study of smoke production. The system identification method using binary signals was tested by computer simulation before applying it to the engine experiment;An engine control and monitoring package was developed using an 8088 based personal computer. This package included a host computer, a multipurpose interface board for signal processing, a fuel metering valve perturbing mechanism with a modified fuel metering pump, an in-line smoke opacity meter, and an operating software written in C and Assembly languages. Temperatures at various engine locations and air/fuel flow were also measured. The spectral analysis was implemented to find the frequency response of system for the pseudo-random binary signal. The multi-frequency binary input and the output signals were Fourier transformed. The resulting frequency domain signals were plotted on Bode plot and postulated transfer functions were fitted using the Box nonlinear optimization procedure;The higher order of transfer function between smoke opacity and fuel metering rate was obtained for 9 operating points. These models can be utilized in development of an electronic injection pump for the reducing smoke level and increasing fuel economy. With sufficiently fast computation, on-line identification might be possible and adaptive control of fuel metering could be implemented.

40|$|Objective: A {{community-based}} {{research project}} {{is used as}} a case study to debate the concept of community participation in setting research priorities. Background: A multidisciplinary team of researchers in health, engineering, and ecosystem management at the American University of Beirut (AUB) conducted a pilot study, funded by IDRC, to investigate lead pollution in a densely populated community in Beirut, Lebanon. It was hypothesized that lead pollution is a major health problem, mainly due to leaded gasoline. Thirty households were visited, where a member of the household was interviewed and blood and environmental samples were collected and analyzed for lead levels. Several meetings with community representatives and interviews with 28 members of the community were also conducted to identify the community’s environmental health (EH) priorities. Observations: The community specified the emissions from vehicles using diesel fuel, poor water quality, and municipal waste disposal among the leading EH priorities. Leaded gasoline and lead pollution did not make the list. Household cooperation with the lead study was low. Contrary to expectations, blood lead levels and concentration of lead in air/water/dust/food samples were within acceptable international standards. Discussion: This study is a clear example of the frequent mismatch between researchers’ priorities and that of the community under investigation. The community’s priorities were all sensual and tangible- smell (diesel, solid waste), color (water, <b>diesel),</b> <b>smoke</b> (diesel), and taste (water). Out-of-sight and non-tangible EH problems such as lead pollution fell from the community’s sphere of concern. Researchers face the dilemma of imposing their own agenda or changing direction mid-stream. Is it ethical to educate and raise community awareness about a problem to later investigate it? Or is it a moral duty? How can researchers balance their own needs and objectives with that of the community?

40|$|The {{complexity}} and the astronomic {{number of possible}} chemical mixtures preclude any systematic experimental assessment of toxicology of all potentially troublesome chemical mixtures. Thus, the use of computer modeling and mechanistic toxicology {{for the development of}} a predictive tool is a promising approach to deal with chemical mixtures. In the past 15 years or so, physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) modeling has been applied to the toxicologic interactions of chemical mixtures.

In this presentation we provide some examples of the utility of PBPK/PD modeling for toxicologic interactions in chemical mixtures.

Hence in the present work, an experimental investigation has been carried out using hydrogen in the dual fuel mode in a Diesel engine system. In the study, a Diesel engine was converted into a dual fuel engine and hydrogen fuel was injected into the intake port while Diesel was injected directly inside the combustion chamber during the compression stroke. Diesel injected inside the combustion chamber will undergo combustion first which in-turn would ignite the hydrogen that will also assist the Diesel combustion. Using electronic control unit (ECU), the injection timings and injection durations were varied for hydrogen injection while for Diesel the injection timing was 23 Â° crank angle (CA) before injection top dead centre (BITDC). Based on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics, the optimized injection timing was found to be 5 Â° CA before gas exchange top dead centre (BGTDC) with injection duration of 30 Â° CA for hydrogen Diesel dual fuel operation. The optimum hydrogen flow rate was found to be 7. 5 lpm.

To study the fuel performance, three oxygenated blend fuel designs containing volumes of 15 % ethanol with cetane improver additive, 10 % ethanol with 10 % bio diesel and 15 % ethanol with 20 % bio diesel were formed. The physical stability of ethanol diesel blend is studied and phase separation is prevented by adding co solvents like Tetrahydrafuran and bio diesel.

The HC, CO, and smoke emissions of BLF 15 were found {{lower than those of}} petroleum diesel. The fuel blend BLF 15 is suggested to be used as an alternative fuel for diesel engines without any engine modification...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative stress {{caused by}} {{generation}} of free radicals and related {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) at the sites of deposition has been proposed as a mechanism {{for many of the}} adverse health outcomes associated with exposure to particulate matter (PM). Recently, a new profluorescent nitroxide molecular probe (BPEAnit) developed at QUT was applied in an entirely novel, rapid and non-cell based assay for assessing the oxidative potential of particles (i. e. potential of particles to induce oxidative stress). The technique was applied on particles produced by several combustion sources, namely cigarette <b>smoke,</b> <b>diesel</b> exhaust and wood smoke. One of the main findings from the initial studies undertaken at QUT was that the oxidative potential per PM mass significantly varies for different combustion sources as well as the type of fuel used and combustion conditions. However, possibly the most important finding from our studies was that there was a strong correlation between the organic fraction of particles and the oxidative potential measured by the PFN assay, which clearly highlights the importance of organic species in particle-induced toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Several {{cell-free}} assays {{are currently}} used to quantify and detect the Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). All {{of them have}} certain limitations, do not provide direct comparison of results and, to date, none of these assays have been acknowledged as the most suitable acellular assay and none has yet been adopted for investigation of potential PM toxicity. These assays include DTT, ascorbic acid, DCFHDA and PFN assays which {{have been used in}} measurements of the particles generated from various combustion sources such as <b>diesel</b> engine, wood <b>smoke</b> (or biomass burning) and cigarette smoke, as well as for outdoor measurements. All the probes use different units for expressing redox properties of PM. Also, their reactivity is being triggered by different types of ROS. This limits the direct comparison of the results that are reporting the toxicity of the same aerosol type measured with various probes. This study is evaluating and comparing the various assays in order to develop deeper understanding of their capabilities, selectivity as well as improve understanding of the underlying chemical mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract: Vegetable {{oils and}} animal fats (triglycerides) {{were the first}} liquid fuels used {{in the rise of}} civilization, and now again are a {{potential}} source of alternate diesel fuel. They are 20 times as viscous as diesel fuel, however, and so form carbon deposits on diesel cylinders and injectors. They are also typically % 3 -$S/gallon, and so are too expensive to compete economically with diesel today. A number of solutions have been proposed for these problems, including transesterification, dilution, pyrolysis and Microemulsification The viscosity can be lowered by transesterification of the triglycerides with methanol or ethanol to form fatty acid esters. This cleaves the fat molecule and removes the glycerine, yielding a viscosity comparable to that of diesel. The heat of combustion is 95 % of that for conventional diesel (on a volume basis). They have a Cetane number of 50 - 80 (compared to 42 for diesel). The cost of the fuel can be reduced by using waste vegetable cooking oils. There are 350 million gallons of waste vegetable oil produced annually in the U. S. A., and various quantities available in other countries. We have developed a process for making the esters from waste vegetable oils and we call the fuel “M-Diesel”. The oil is reacted with sodium hydroxide dissolved in methanol. A sufficient quantity of alkali is used to neutralize the fatty acids in the waste oil plus 0. 3 % excess. A batch of 300 gallons was made for testing. We have tested the fuel in a Denver public bus and find power comparable to that of diesel. A 30 % blend with <b>diesel</b> reduced <b>smoke</b> opacity to 60 % of that from diesel, while neat M-Diesel reduced the opacity to 26 % of that of diesel...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{biodiesel}} named {{rapeseed oil}} monoester of ethylene {{glycol monomethyl ether}} is developed. This fuel has one more ester group than the traditional biodiesel. The fuel was synthesized and structurally identified through FT-IR and P 1 PH NMR analyses. Engine test results show that when a tested diesel engine is fueled with this biodiesel in place of 0 # <b>diesel</b> fuel, engine-out <b>smoke</b> emissions can be decreased by 25. 0 %– 75. 0 %, CO emissions can be reduced by 50. 0 %, and unburned HC emissions are lessened significantly. However, NOx emissions generally do not change noticeably. In the area of combustion performance, both engine in-cylinder pressure and its changing rate with crankshaft angle are increased to some extent. Rapeseed oil monoester of {{ethylene glycol monomethyl ether}} has a much higher cetane number and shorter ignition delay, leading to autoignition 1. 1 °CA earlier than diesel fuel during engine operation. Because of certain amount of oxygen contained in the new biodiesel, the engine thermal efficiency is improved 13. 5 %– 20. 4 % when fueled with the biodiesel compared with diesel fuel...|$|R
