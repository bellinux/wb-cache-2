5|$|Due to {{the extreme}} nature of the {{original}} NES Battletoads difficulty, almost all future ports went to measures to tone <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> varying degrees, seeking to make the game more accessible to casual players. The Mega Drive version of Battletoads features toned down difficulty, {{as well as providing}} higher definition and more colourful graphics as opposed to the NES version. The Game Gear port features downscaled graphics, also removing three levels and the two-player mode.|$|E

Three years later, a realignment in Marysville, realigned M-29 onto the Busha Highway, returning the old route to local control. Finally, in 1971, M-29 south of exit243 on I-94 was truncated back to its present-day terminus, and the route has existed as such since then.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{returned}} to the Royals on July 7. Through July 27, he had a 2.18 ERA. He did not give up more than one earned run until August 5, when {{he got his first}} loss of the year against the Oakland Athletics. However, Affeldt had a 12.71 ERA in his next eighteen appearances, which raised his ERA to 6.93. He held opposing batters scoreless for the final nine games of the season to bring <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a seasonending 5.26.|$|E
5|$|During {{production}} Burtt had {{the opportunity}} to look at the items used by Jimmy MacDonald, Disney's in-house sound designer for many of their classic films. Burtt used many of MacDonald's items on WALL-E. Because Burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post-production, the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas, which Burtt found an unusual experience. He worked in sync with the animators, returning their animation after adding the sounds to give them more ideas. Burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character, but if he could not find one that worked, he would choose a dramatic and unrealistic noise. Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters, before he and Stanton pared <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a distinct few for each robot.|$|E

5|$|In the 10th minute, Christian Eriksen had {{the first}} {{meaningful}} shot, hitting the crossbar with a 25-yard free kick for Tottenham. Twenty minutes later, Eric Dier was given the game's first yellow card for a foul on Diego Costa. At {{the end of the}} first half, Chelsea won a free kick on their right side when Branislav Ivanović was pulled down by Nacer Chadli. Willian took the free kick, which arrived at Kurt Zouma, played <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> captain John Terry. Terry's shot – Chelsea's first on target – went past Hugo Lloris due to a deflection by Dier. In added time at {{the end of the first}} half, Gary Cahill had a header from a corner, which was caught by Lloris.|$|E
5|$|Liman {{approached}} {{a wide range}} of actors for the role of Bourne, including Brad Pitt, who turned <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> star in Spy Game, as well as Russell Crowe, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise and Sylvester Stallone, before he eventually cast Damon. Liman found that Damon understood and appreciated that, though The Bourne Identity would have its share of action, the focus was primarily on character and plot. Damon, who had never played such a physically demanding role, insisted on performing many of the stunts himself. With stunt choreographer Nick Powell, he underwent three months of extensive training in stunt work, the use of weapons, boxing, and eskrima. He eventually performed a significant number of the film's stunts himself, including hand-to-hand combat and climbing the safe house walls near the film's conclusion.|$|E
5|$|McCudden's {{long-term}} interest in mechanics {{prompted him to}} modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He {{made a series of}} modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time. Performance, a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden's changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.|$|E

5|$|North Korean {{prisoners of}} war {{captured}} by the US troops during the battle reported that the NK 3rd Division suffered about 2,000 casualties, mostly from artillery fire, in the attack on Yongdong on July 24–25. This brought <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a strength of about 5,000 men, approximately half the strength it had when the war began. The 1st Cavalry Division's actions were able to delay the North Korean advance for several days, giving the UN forces valuable time {{to set up the}} Pusan Perimeter. The UN losses after this battle and the subsequent fight at Hwanggan cost the 1st Cavalry Division 916 casualties. The defeat was a poor showing for the division, but its record quickly improved with experience and it became a more reliable fighting unit {{by the time it was}} placed on Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|The first Guardian video shows {{one officer}} lunge at Tomlinson from behind, strike {{him across the}} legs with a baton and push his back, causing him to fall. On 8 April Channel4 News {{released}} their own footage, which showed the officer's arm swing back to head height before bringing <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> hit Tomlinson on the legs with the baton. Another video obtained by The Guardian on 21 April shows Tomlinson standing by a bicycle rack, hands in his pockets, when the police approach him. After he is hit, he can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side}} of his forehead; eyewitnesses spoke of hearing a noise as his head hit the ground.|$|E
5|$|Through the {{enclosure}} ran the processional path, which {{led from the}} temple entrance through the main gate in {{the enclosure}} wall. The path was frequently decorated with sphinx statues and punctuated by barque stations, where the priests carrying the festival barque could set <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> rest during the procession. The processional path usually ended in a quay on the Nile, which served as the entrance point for river-borne visitors and the exit point for the festival procession when it travelled by water. In Old Kingdom pyramid temples, the quay adjoined an entire temple (the valley temple), which {{was linked to the}} pyramid temple by the processional causeway.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{tracking}} inland on July16, {{interaction with}} China's mountainous terrain disrupted {{the organization of}} Billie, weakening <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> tropical storm intensity. However, the tropical cyclone's stint over land was short-lived as the system quickly curved northward into the Yellow Sea by July17. Despite moving back over water, Billie continued to weaken, and made landfall on the western coast of North Korea with winds of 75km/h (40mph). Over the Korean peninsula, Billie began to intake cold air from a polar front, enabling the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone by 1800UTC that day. These remnants tracked eastward across the Sea of Japan before they were last noted just off of Hokkaido on July18.|$|E
5|$|When Obsidian were {{preparing}} to present Knights of the Old Republic II at E3 2004, they tried to fit {{as much information as}} they could, saying that it would need to be a duration of 30 minutes as it was the only E3 event it would be showcased at; however, due to the limited time frame, they would have to cut <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a five- to ten-minute presentation. During this time, none of the levels Obsidian designed were ready to be shown, so they picked three levels, and put them through a schedule to finish them on time. The demo was finished {{a few days before the}} event, and the game was presented in May 2004. The first trailer for Knights of the Old Republic II was later unveiled in July 2004, and the official website was launched in October.|$|E
5|$|Kansas, {{which had}} won the pre-game coin toss, {{received}} the ball to open the second half. Todd Reesing initially began where he had left off in the first half, completing a pass to Dexton Fields for 12yards and a first down. On subsequent plays, however, Virginia Tech showed some of the defensive prowess that had been promoted heavily heading into the game. Aqib Talib was tackled for a loss of sixyards after catching a pass. Reesing was sacked under heavy pressure from the Tech defense. On third down, a Reesing pass was nearly intercepted by Cody Grimm, who knocked <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> force a Kansas punt. On the subsequent return, Virginia Tech earned its first big play of the game. Eddie Royal, who had returned every one of Virginia Tech's first-half kicks, received the ball and lateraled it to Justin Harper, who returned it 84yards for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points with 11:35 remaining in the third quarter.|$|E
