5|$|After the film's mainly {{negative}} reviews Akshay <b>Kumar</b> {{lashed out}} at critics, accusing them of lacking {{an understanding of the}} audience and the basic ideas of filmmaking. There were rumours about a feud between <b>Kumar</b> and Ekta Kapoor about the former's distancing himself from the project and not promoting it enough. The three leads attended the inaugural 2013 Indian Premier League match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils to promote the film, but the match organisers asked their cameramen not to focus on the actors. After this, a disappointed <b>Kumar</b> asked Kapoor to re-arrange the film's marketing schedule.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Uyarndha Manithan, AVM Productions was keen to remake it in Hindi and {{approached}} Dilip <b>Kumar.</b> After watching the film, <b>Kumar</b> was hesitant to play the lead role as he felt he would not match Ganesan's performance in the original version. K. Balachander was signed {{up to be the}} director of the remake, which led to <b>Kumar</b> being initially convinced that he could be successful.|$|E
5|$|Khan {{had wanted}} to cast Sabu Dastagir, a Hollywood star of Indian origin, as Birju. Dastagir {{travelled}} to India from Los Angeles, stayed in a hotel in Mumbai (then known as Bombay) and received a retainer. However, delays and obstacles in beginning shooting and getting a work permit for Dastagir led to his dismissal from the project. Dilip <b>Kumar,</b> an established actor in the Hindi film industry, had originally {{expressed an interest in}} playing Birju, which Khan found agreeable; Dilip <b>Kumar</b> agreed to play Shamu as well. However, Nargis objected that the public would not accept their casting as mother and son because she had done several romantic films alongside him. Sunil Dutt—with the experience of just one film—was finally cast, after Mukri, a comedian in the film, introduced him to Khan. Sajid Khan, the actor who portrayed the young Birju, was unknown at the time, and was from a poor family from the Mumbai slums. Sajid's salary in the film was 750. He was later adopted by Mehboob Khan. Subsequently, Raaj <b>Kumar</b> was cast as Shamu and Rajendra <b>Kumar</b> as Ramu. Mother India was the first successful film and {{a turning point in the}} careers of Dutt, Raaj <b>Kumar</b> and Rajendra <b>Kumar.</b>|$|E

5|$|After a fortnight, <b>Kumar</b> met Balachander in Chennai {{and watched}} Uyarndha Manithan {{again for a}} second time to study his character. This time, however, <b>Kumar</b> hesitated to portray Ganesan's role and {{requested}} Balachander to direct the remake of Babu (1971). Balachander showed concern with Kumar's change of heart and refused the offer, leading to both the remakes of Uyarndha Manithan and Babu being shelved.|$|E

The Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF) sent a videographer to shoot extensively the bouts involving the likely opponents of the five Indian boxers. A team of coaches went through the video footage shot by videographer Sambhu of the National Institute of Sports, Patiala, and studied the technique of the boxers from various countries in detail, so as to prepare Vijender and the others regarding the opponent's manoeuvres and fighting techniques.|$|E

The rewritten version was read to Nagarjuna in {{two and a half}} hours and to Nageswara Rao over six hours, as the latter wanted every detail to be clear. Due to the complex nature of the second half, the latter suggested <b>Kumar</b> to add a comedy plotline between grandfather and grandson. After its incorporation into the script, and after considering the titles Hum and Trayam, Manam was chosen as the film's title on Nageswara Rao's suggestion.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in October 2003 by producer Subhash Ghai, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his production company Mukta Arts. The media reported that Akshay <b>Kumar,</b> Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra were cast in lead roles, making it the third film collaboration between <b>Kumar</b> and Chopra after the highly successful Andaaz (2003) and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi (2004). <b>Kumar</b> was cast as Raj, a working man accused of rape at his workplace; Kapoor portrayed his supportive wife, who goes to extremes to defend him. According to the directors, <b>Kumar</b> was cast against type; he generally played action heros, and {{they wanted him to}} underplay his character. Abbas–Mustan, known for stylish thrillers and intriguing antagonists, cast Chopra in her first negative role. She plays a woman, married to a business magnate more than twice her age (played by Amrish Puri), who falsely accuses her ex-lover (<b>Kumar)</b> of raping her to seek revenge. Chopra was initially apprehensive about such a bold character, due to the controversial theme of sexual harassment, but Abbas–Mastan and Subhash Ghai convinced her to accept the role. The director duo had previously offered her the lead role in their 2002 thriller Humraaz, which she could not do.|$|E

The most recent recipient is Akshay <b>Kumar,</b> who was honoured at the 64th National Film Awards for his performance in the 2016 Hindi film Rustom.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} considered Danny Denzongpa for {{the role}} of bandit chief Gabbar Singh, but he could not accept it as he was committed to act in Feroz Khan's Dharmatma (1975), under production at the same time. Amjad Khan, who was the second choice, prepared himself for the part by reading the book Abhishapta Chambal, which told of the exploits of Chambal dacoits. The book was written by Taroon <b>Kumar</b> Bhaduri, the father of fellow cast member Jaya Bhaduri. As cast members had read the script ahead of time, many were interested in playing different parts. Pran was considered {{for the role}} of Thakur Baldev Singh, but Sippy thought Sanjeev <b>Kumar</b> was a better choice. Initially, Dharmendra was also interested {{to play the role of}} Thakur. He eventually gave up the role when Sippy informed him that Sanjeev <b>Kumar</b> would play Veeru if that happened, and would be paired with Hema Malini, who Dharmendra was trying to woo. Dharmendra knew that <b>Kumar</b> was also interested in Malini. Sippy wanted Shatrughan Sinha to play the part of Jai, but there were already several big stars signed, and Amitabh Bachchan, who was not extremely popular yet, lobbied hard to get the part for himself.|$|E
