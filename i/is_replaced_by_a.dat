5|$|In some archaea, the {{lipid bilayer}} <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> monolayer. In effect, the archaea fuse the tails of two {{phospholipid}} molecules {{into a single}} molecule with two polar heads (a bolaamphiphile); this fusion may make their membranes more rigid and better able to resist harsh environments. For example, the lipids in Ferroplasma are of this type, which is thought to aid this organism's survival in its highly acidic habitat.|$|E

Suddenly, {{the real world}} <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> magical reality influenced by the writer's own imagination. The Doctor must battle witches and wizards to reach Rowling and put the world to rights.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Ehlers' arrival, {{the main}} {{research}} of Jordan's group had been {{dedicated to a}} scalar-tensor modification of general relativity that later became known as Jordan–Brans–Dicke theory. This theory differs from general relativity in that the gravitational constant <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> variable field. Ehlers was instrumental in changing the group's focus to the structure and interpretation of Einstein's original theory. Other {{members of the group}} included Wolfgang Kundt, Rainer K. Sachs and Manfred Trümper.|$|E
50|$|The ferry <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{bridge in}} 1923, which <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> new bridge in 1948. That bridge lasted until the {{construction}} of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway in the 1970s.|$|R
25|$|Gradually, {{electrical}} reproduction {{entered the}} home. The spring motor <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> electric motor. The old sound box with its needle-linked diaphragm <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> electromagnetic pickup that converted the needle vibrations into an electrical signal. The tone arm now served {{to conduct a}} pair of wires, not sound waves, into the cabinet. The exponential horn <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> amplifier and a loudspeaker.|$|R
50|$|The old {{building}} {{appears to have}} <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> housing complex, and has <b>been</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> new building at 275 W. Market Street. The new building was dedicated on May 2, 1976.|$|R
5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill, I-196 enters the urban core of Grand Rapids. The freeway runs eastward through {{residential}} neighborhoods on the city's west side as it approaches the interchange with US131. This complex structure is adjacent to the Grand River north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum. The carriageways for I-196 run through the interchange on different levels, with the eastbound traffic carried down near river level and the westbound lanes above the criss-crossing carriageways of US131's freeway. I-196 crosses the river {{on the opposite side of}} the interchange and both directions return to the same level. The freeway picks up an additional lane at this point as the median <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> concrete barrier.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of the James Bay transmission system, the cross-rope suspension tower was invented. This type of tower features two guyed-tower legs similar to the V-guyed tower, but the two legs don't converge at the tower base. In the case of the cross-rope suspension tower, the tower legs are spread apart on two different foundations. In addition, the crossbar <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> series of suspension cables with three vertical insulator strings to support the three bundles, which allows this design to consume only 6.3 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. The design is also known as the Chainette (little necklace).|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{referred}} to Müsstler's agents as the Iron Guard, thereby naming them after the real Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist group {{that sought to}} oust King Carol II and forge a Romanian-German alliance. The Bordurian officers wore uniforms based on those of the German SS, while the Bordurian planes are German in design; in the original version Tintin escapes in a Heinkel He 112, while in the revised version this <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Messerschmitt Bf 109. Hergé adopted the basis of Borduria's false flag operation to take over Syldavia from the plans outlined in Curzio Malaparte's Tecnica del Colpo di Stato ("The Technique of a Coup d'Etat").|$|E

5|$|In Tibetan Buddhism, sharabha is {{represented}} as a beast with a goat's head and horns, a lion's mane and horse's body and legs. It symbolizes determination, strength and speed. Sometimes, it {{is represented}} additionally with horns of an antelope and claws of an eagle. Sometimes, the goat head <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> lion's, horse's feet by a lion's and horns can be of a ram. A common feature of all representations is the horse's body. It is often depicted as mounts of young Devas or dwarfs in a Torana – a six-level archway behind an enlightenment throne of a Buddha or Boddhisattva. Together with the devas, they symbolize the perfection of effort (virya).|$|E
5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|In the noncanonical , {{written by}} Christie Golden, Chakotay is {{promoted}} after the ship returns to Federation space, and becomes Captain of Voyager. He and Seven of Nine break off their relationship. In Old Wounds, {{the first of}} the Spirit Walk two-book series, the crew goes on their maiden cruise under Captain Chakotay and is joined by his sister, Sekaya, who's become a spiritual leader in their tribe. In the second book, Enemy of my Enemy, Chakotay <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Founder who was previously pretending to be his first officer. Meanwhile, the real Chakotay and his sister are being held by a deranged Cardassian doctor, forcing Chakotay to undergo a spirit walk to save them both.|$|E

5|$|Most useful ATP analogs {{cannot be}} hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a {{structure}} {{closely related to}} the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> sulfur atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.|$|E
5|$|The confederacy also {{implemented}} ready-made {{supplies of}} button, {{consisting of the}} U.S. Government stockpiles throughout the war. These consisted of the Enlisted men's coat button, (an eagle with the shield of the U.S., with the olive branch and arrows held in its talons,) and the officer's buttons, (the same as before, but the shield <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> blank shield, with the respective letter for each branch of service, I for infantry, A for artillery, C for cavalry, and D for dragoons).|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} set up {{a second}} committee in 1968 who suggested that the old eastwest runway be closed and the airport's area reduced, allowing for development {{to the east of}} the airport. They suggested that this <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> new runway in the sea, adjacent to the beach. The runway was closed, and a high density upper-middle income neighborhood was built to the east of the airport, although the new runway was never constructed due to the high cost involved.|$|E
50|$|The OFC-3 {{system is}} modular design that {{comprises}} a laser range finder, a color TV camera, and an IR camera, and the laser range finder can <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> laser designator (for a laser beam-riding SAM), the TV camera can <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> night vision camera, and the IR camera can <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> ImIR, at higher cost. Development {{to incorporate the}} dual band IR, night vision camera, and the color TV camera is reportedly in progress.|$|R

5|$|Chris Boucher's five Star Cops scripts {{have been}} semi-professionally {{published}} {{in two volumes}} by Judith Proctor. The first volume An Instinct for Murder was adapted from the first Star Cops episode of the same name. The second volume Little Green Men and Other Stories included the four remaining Boucher scripts. There are some changes from the broadcast episodes – neither the characters of Alexander Krivenko nor Anna Shoun appear in these books. Krivenko <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Chinese character, Jiang Li Ho, {{as an attempt to}} update the Star Cops universe to reflect the ending of the Cold War in 1989. Shoun is replaced by an Irish character, Dana Cogill – Boucher didn't own the rights to use the Shoun character who had been created by John Collee.|$|E
5|$|His wartime {{experiences}} led Fitch {{to decide}} to become a physicist. Robert Bacher, {{the head of the}} physics division at Los Alamos, offered him a graduate assistantship at Cornell University, but first he needed to complete his undergraduate degree. Rather than return to Northwestern or Carnegie Mellon, he elected to enter McGill University, which Titterton had recommended. Fitch graduated from McGill with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1948. On the advice of Jerry Kellogg, who had been a student of Rabi's at Columbia University, and was a division head at the Los Alamos, Fitch decided to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia. Kellogg wrote him a letter of introduction to Rabi. James Rainwater became his academic supervisor. Rainwater gave him a paper by John Wheeler concerning mu-mesic atoms, atoms in which an electron <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> muon. These had never been observed; they were completely theoretical and {{there was no evidence that}} they existed, but it made a good thesis topic.|$|E
5|$|In K. guimarotae, the {{two halves}} of the dentary diverge from each other at an angle of 20° near the front, then 40° near the back. It also bears two convexities {{on the bottom of the}} jaw, one at the third and fourth teeth and another at the eighth to tenth teeth. The latter {{convexity}} <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> concavity in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the top margin of the jaw behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. Near the back of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. On the interior of the jaw, the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the symphysis in both species, and the top of the bone bears a low and roughened crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E

5|$|Many other {{cellular}} automata {{and other}} computational systems {{are capable of}} emulating the behavior of Rule 90. For instance, a configuration in rule 90 may be translated into a configuration into the different elementary cellular automaton Rule 22. The translation replaces each Rule 90 cell by three consecutive Rule 22 cells. These cells are all zero if the Rule 90 cell is itself zero. A nonzero Rule 90 cell is translated into a one followed by two zeros. With this transformation, every six steps of the Rule 22 automaton simulate a single step of the Rule 90 automaton. Similar direct simulations of Rule 90 are also possible for the elementary cellular automata Rule 45 and Rule 126, for certain string rewriting systems and tag systems, and in some two-dimensional cellular automata including Wireworld. Rule 90 can also simulate itself in the same way. If each cell of a Rule 90 configuration <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> pair of consecutive cells, the first containing the original cell's value and the second containing zero, then this doubled configuration has the same behavior as the original configuration at half the speed.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{the first}} of Eliot's that relied on speech, with a narrator who speaks to the {{audience}} directly. Described as a poem of early summer, air, and grace, it begins with a narrator recalling a moment in a garden. The scene provokes a discussion on time and how the present, not the future or past, really matters to individuals. Memories connect the individual to the past, but the past cannot change. The poem then transitions from memory to how life works and the point of existence. In particular, the universe is described as orderly and that consciousness is not found within time even though humanity is bound by time. The scene of the poem moves from a garden to the London underground where technology dominates. Those who cling to technology and reason are unable to understand the universe or the Logos ("the Word", or Christ). The underworld <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> churchyard and a discussion of death. This, in turn, becomes a discussion of timelessness and eternity, which ends the poem.|$|E
5|$|When {{it first}} emerges from its egg, the young red-throated loon {{is covered with}} fine soft down feathers. Primarily dark brown to dark grey above, it is {{slightly}} paler {{on the sides of}} its head and neck, as well as on its throat, chest, and flanks, with a pale grey lower breast and belly. Within weeks, this first down <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> second, paler set of down feathers, which are in turn replaced by developing juvenile feathers. The juvenile's plumage {{is similar to that of}} the adult, though with a few distinguishing features. It has a darker forehead and neck, with heavy speckling on the sides of the neck and the throat. Its back is browner and less speckled, and its underparts are tinged with brown. Its eyes are reddish-brown, and its beak is a pale grey. Though some young birds hold this plumage until mid-winter, many quickly become virtually indistinguishable from adults, except for their paler bills.|$|E
