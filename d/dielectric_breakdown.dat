40|$|In this work, {{we explore}} the {{possibility}} of emergent nonequilibrium steady states arising from the electric-field-driven Mott insulator via the Keldysh-Floquet dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which can determine the fully-interacting, nonequilibrium steady-state Green's functions with the noninteracting counterparts as an input to the DMFT self-consistency loop. Unlike the retarded component, obtaining the lesser Green's function for the noninteracting system presents an important obstacle since the thermalization of the noninteracting system still requires a precise understanding of the dissipation mechanism. A crucial breakthrough in this work is that the noninteracting lesser Green's function can be determined {{in terms of the}} Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) eigenstates, which are thermalized via the standard canonical ensemble according to the Markovian quantum master equation. As a result, it is shown that the intricate interplay between strong correlation and large electric field can generate a sequence of two <b>dielectric</b> <b>breakdowns</b> with the first induced by a coherent reconstruction of the mid-gap state within the Mott gap and the second by an incoherent tunneling through the biased Hubbard bands. It is predicted that the reconstructed mid-gap state generates its own emergent WSL structure with a reduced effective electric field. The two <b>dielectric</b> <b>breakdowns</b> are mediated by a reentrant insulating phase, which is characterized by the population inversion, causing instability toward inhomogeneous current density states at weak electron-impurity scattering.

In this latter case, a closed-form expression for the current–voltage characteristic, based on the Lambert W function, is presented. Current evolution from one regime to the other during constant voltage stress takes place by means of discrete current steps of nearly identical magnitude, which would be indicative of the occurrence of multiple <b>dielectric</b> <b>breakdowns</b> across the insulating layer...|$|R

25|$|When {{the spark}} gap fires, the charged {{capacitor}} discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit to oscillate. The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring {{energy into the}} secondary side of the transformer and causing it to oscillate with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs {{over a number of}} cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer.

25|$|Another large {{component}} of the remodelling process is the disconnection of branched vessels, which then migrate to distal areas in order to supply blood homogeneously. Branching morphogenesis {{has been found to}} follow the <b>dielectric</b> <b>breakdown</b> model, in that only the vessels with sufficient flow will enlarge, while others will close off. At locations inside the vessel where two tube split off from one, one arm of the split is likely to close, detach, and migrate towards the venous line, where it will re-attach. The result of the closure of a branch is that flow increases and becomes less turbulent in the main line, while blood also begins to flow towards areas which are lacking. Which branch will close depends on the flow rate, direction, and branching angle; in general, a branching angle of 75° or more will necessitate the closing of the smaller branch.|$|E
25|$|Leakage is {{equivalent}} to a resistor in parallel with the capacitor. Constant exposure to heat can cause <b>dielectric</b> <b>breakdown</b> and excessive leakage, a problem often seen in older vacuum tube circuits, particularly where oiled paper and foil capacitors were used. In many vacuum tube circuits, interstage coupling capacitors are used to conduct a varying signal from the plate of one tube to the grid circuit of the next stage. A leaky capacitor can cause the grid circuit voltage to be raised from its normal bias setting, causing excessive current or signal distortion in the downstream tube. In power amplifiers this can cause the plates to glow red, or current limiting resistors to overheat, even fail. Similar considerations apply to component fabricated solid-state (transistor) amplifiers, but owing to lower heat production {{and the use of}} modern polyester dielectric barriers this once-common problem has become relatively rare.|$|E
25|$|At {{a reverse}} voltage lower than −1.5V at room temperature, the cathode {{aluminum}} foil begins {{to build up}} an oxide layer corresponding to the applied voltage. This is aligned with generating hydrogen gas with increasing pressure. At {{the same time the}} oxide layer on the anode foil begins dissolution of the oxide, which weakens the voltage proof. It is now a question of the outside circuit whether the increasing gas pressure from oxidization leads to bursting of the case, or the weakened anode oxide leads to a breakdown with a short circuit. If the outside circuit is high-ohmic the capacitor fails and the vent opens due to high gas pressure. If the outside circuit is low-ohmic, an internal short circuit is more probable. In every case a reverse voltage lower than −1.5V at room temperature may cause the component to catastrophically fail due to a <b>dielectric</b> <b>breakdown</b> or overpressure, which causes the capacitor to burst, often in a spectacularly dramatic fashion. Modern electrolytic capacitors have a safety vent that is typically either a scored section of the case or a specially designed end seal to vent the hot gas/liquid, but ruptures can still be dramatic.|$|E
2500|$|Conventional {{capacitors}} (also {{known as}} electrostatic capacitors), such as ceramic capacitors and film capacitors, consist of two electrodes which {{are separated by}} a dielectric material. When charged, the energy is stored in a static electric field that permeates the dielectric between the electrodes. The total energy increases {{with the amount of}} stored charge, which in turn correlates linearly with the potential (voltage) between the plates. The maximum potential difference between the plates (the maximal voltage) is limited by the <b>dielectric's</b> <b>breakdown</b> field strength. The same static storage also applies for electrolytic capacitors in which most of the potential decreases over the anode's thin oxide layer. The somewhat resistive liquid electrolyte (cathode) accounts for a small decrease of potential for [...] "wet" [...] electrolytic capacitors, while electrolytic capacitors with solid conductive polymer electrolyte this voltage drop is negligible.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} explain the {{development}} {{of different types of}} water trees and the related <b>dielectric</b> <b>breakdowns</b> in extruded power cables, it is necessary to analyse the dielectric properties of the corresponding treed regions and their influence on the distribution of electric field.

Experimentally, we performed the laboratory ageing of a power cable for accelerated conditions of applied voltage and frequency: we inspected the different shapes, orientations and dimensions of vented, bow-tie, single-bow-tie and global water trees produced in the polymeric insulation. From a theoretical point of view we proposed adequate models for obtaining the field distribution analytically and using a suitable finite element method. A local electric field amplification is calculated according to the different characteristics of the water trees: length, shape, permittivity and law of variation for permittivity.
