The value stream through product development processes is a flow of information, and hence waste exists in interpersonal communication. The study elaborates the hypothesis that most <b>information</b> <b>transfers</b> do not add value to the product. It was further theorized that different means of communication are better suited for different kinds of information, {{at least from the}} lean point of view. In order to understand the occurrence and ramifications of waste in product development information flows, the <b>information</b> <b>transferred</b> between team members was analyzed in two student product development projects. With the help of a paper-based value stream map, frequencies of waste drivers in information, the share of waste in <b>information</b> <b>transfers,</b> the interdependencies of waste and means of communication, as well as timeliness of <b>information</b> <b>transfers</b> were analyzed. The study’s results show that waste is omnipresent in product development <b>information</b> <b>transfers,</b> as only twelve percent of all <b>information</b> <b>transfers</b> contribute value to the product, and nearly half of the <b>information</b> <b>transfers</b> could have been omitted without a decrease in product value.

Neurons can generate multiple action potentials in sequence forming so-called spike trains. These spike trains are the basis for neural coding and <b>information</b> <b>transfer</b> in the brain.

Oscillatory activity in single neurons can also be observed in sub-threshold fluctuations in membrane potential. These rhythmic changes in membrane potential do not reach the critical threshold and therefore do not result in an action potential. They can result from postsynaptic potentials from synchronous inputs or from intrinsic properties of neurons.|$|E

25|$|Neural {{oscillations}} {{are observed}} throughout {{the central nervous}} system at all levels, and include spike trains, local field potentials and large-scale oscillations which can be measured by electroencephalography (EEG). In general, oscillations can be characterized by their frequency, amplitude and phase. These signal properties can be extracted from neural recordings using time-frequency analysis. In large-scale oscillations, amplitude changes are considered to result from changes in synchronization within a neural ensemble, also referred to as local synchronization. In addition to local synchronization, oscillatory activity of distant neural structures (single neurons or neural ensembles) can synchronize. Neural oscillations and synchronization have been linked to many cognitive functions such as <b>information</b> <b>transfer,</b> perception, motor control and memory.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that of this multiplicity of protocells, only one line survived. Current phylogenetic {{evidence suggests that the}} last universal ancestor (LUA) lived during the early Archean eon, perhaps 3.5Ga or earlier. This LUA cell is the ancestor of all life on Earth today. It was probably a prokaryote, possessing a cell membrane and probably ribosomes, but lacking a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria or chloroplasts. Like modern cells, it used DNA as its genetic code, RNA for <b>information</b> <b>transfer</b> and protein synthesis, and enzymes to catalyze reactions. Some scientists believe that instead of a single organism being the last universal common ancestor, there were populations of organisms exchanging genes by lateral gene transfer.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, Roger Sperry {{developed}} split-brain preparations in non-human primates {{that emphasized}} the importance of <b>information</b> <b>transfer</b> that occurred in these neocortical connections. For example, learning on simple tasks, if restricted in sensory input and motor output to one hemisphere of a split-brain animal, would not transfer to the other hemisphere. The right brain has no idea what the left brain is up to, if these specific connections are cut. Those experiments were followed by tests on human beings with epilepsy who had undergone split-brain surgery, which established that the neocortical connections between hemispheres are the principal route for cognition to transfer {{from one side of the}} brain to another. These experiments also formed the modern basis for lateralization of function in the human brain.|$|E

Our explanation for this anomaly, which is supported by additional analysis, is that intra-industry information facilitates predicting transitory, rather than permanent, earnings components.

40|$|Abstract Background Out-of-hours GP care in England, Denmark and the Netherlands {{has been}} reorganised {{and is now}} {{provided}} by large scale GP co-operatives. Adequate <b>transfer</b> of <b>information</b> is {{necessary in order to}} assure continuity of care, which is of major importance in palliative care. We conducted a study to assess the availability, content and effect of <b>information</b> <b>transferred</b> to the GP co-operatives. Methods Cross-sectional exploratory study of all palliative care phone calls during a period of one year to a GP co-operative. Results The total number of phone calls about patients who needed palliative care was 0. 75 % of all calls to the GP co-operative. <b>Information</b> was <b>transferred</b> by GPs on 25. 5 % of palliative care patient calls, and on 12 % of palliative care patient calls from residential care homes. For terminally ill patients the number of <b>information</b> <b>transfers</b> increased to 28. 9 %. When <b>information</b> was <b>transferred,</b> the content consisted mainly of clinical data. Information about the diagnosis and current problems was transferred in more than 90 % of cases, information about the patient's wishes in 45 % and information about the patient's psychosocial situation in 30. 5 % of cases. A home visit was made after 53 % of the palliative care calls. When <b>information</b> was <b>transferred,</b> fewer patients were referred to a hospital. Conclusion GPs frequently fail to <b>transfer</b> <b>information</b> about their palliative care patients to the GP co-operatives. Locums working at the GP co-operative are thus required to provide palliative care in complex situations without receiving adequate information GPs should be encouraged and trained to make this information available to the GP co-operatives. </p...|$|R
