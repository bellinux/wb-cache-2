40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{research that}} suggested {{that it may be}} commonplace for <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovations</b> to be targeted at the wrong initial market and which proposed a prescription for identifying the more favourable initial market.  To purposively commercialise an innovative technology it has to be decided what product, or service, to use it for and often, by implication, what market to target. How can these decisions be made to ensure successful commercialisation? If the innovator is a small company, a start-up one or government-funded body hoping to boost its budget, they often only have one chance at getting these decisions right because of their limited resources. The decision about what product-market to target is not made any the easier because the technology may well be still under development.  Some overall conclusions are drawn on the product-market choice for <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovations...</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b> in {{a cathedral}} {{conception}} was brought by new construction masonry in 1420. Because {{of a lack}} of written reference the architect of construction masonry is anonymous. Ambition of uprightness, light materials and spaciousness of church resulted in construction of the three-aisle cathedral, whereby the essential change of plan was added by the counter aisles to the main nave. This was situated unconventionally {{to the middle of the}} main nave length by which a unique central hall space was created. The statue portal decoration of a main nave and side aisles were inspired by Gothic buildings in Prague and Kraków, and was included in the second construction stage. The influence of Parleř masonry at Prague´s Saint Vitus Cathedral in the second half of the 14th century became evident in the King´s oratory and its spiral staircase as well as a motif of round banisters of oratory and a stone gallery over the sacristy. Then building of the cathedral continued with the north external wall construction, the polygonal chevet of the north aisle (parallels of south apsids) and eight-sided top levels of The Sigimund tower. At the end of the second construction stage the cathedral was ready for vaulting and it was necessary to pull down the old church. St Michael´s church (today called chapel) was built at the same time as the new church, but it was finished in 1400, and it took over the function of a parish church.|$|E

According to the technological growth curve, the process of technological innovation is divided into the growth phase, plateau phase and transitional phase, then the paper proposed that the enterprises should adopt innovation combination, conduct continuous and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b> management activities during technological growth and technology alternation, and the author built the manage model of the continuous and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b> based on technological growth...|$|E

For more on definitions of disruptive technologies and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovations,</b> see Walsh and Linton [1999] who provide a number of definitions for disruptive technologies and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovations.</b> Disruptive technologies and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovations</b> present a unique challenge and opportunity for R and D organizations seeking to build their commercialization efforts and to reinvent the corporation. These technologies do not have a proven path from scientific discovery to mass production and therefore require novel approaches. These critically important {{technologies are}} the wellspring of wealth creation and new competency generation but are not readily accepted by the corporate community. They are alternatively embraced and eschewed by the commercial community. They are finally accepted when the technology has already affected the industry or when the technological horse has already flown out of the hanger. Many firms, especially larger firms, seem reluctant to familiarize themselves with these technologies quickly. The trend seems to be that these firms prefer to react to a proven disruptive technology that has changed the product market paradigm. If true, then there is cause for concern. This paper will review the literature on disruptive technologies presenting a model of the progression from scientific idea to mass production for disruptive technologies contrasted to the more copious incremental technologies. The paper will then describe Sandia National Laboratories' involvement in one of the disruptive technology areas, namely micro-electromechanical systems (sometimes referred to as Microsystems or MEMS) and will survey a number of companies that have investigated Sandia's technological discoveries for potential use in an industrial capacity. The survey will focus on the movement of the research findings from the laboratory into the marketplace and all of the problem areas that disruptive technologies face in this arena. The paper will then state several hypotheses that will be tested. The data will be described with results and conclusions reported...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} This paper investigates the question: What are the {{challenges}} to the purchasing function when faced with <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation?</b> The paper defines <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation,</b> differentiating it from other forms of innovation, and discusses the challenges for the purchasing function involved in the <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b> process. Design/methodology/approach The paper reviews and analyses the existing literature on purchasing involvement in incremental and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation.</b> Analysing existing research on early supplier - and early purchasing - involvement in new product development and innovation, we develop conceptual frameworks to further the understanding of, and radically rethink, the role of purchasing involvement in innovations of different degrees of change. Findings The typology highlights some important challenges for the purchasing function when faced with discontinuous rather than the more common incremental innovation challenge. In particular, our analysis of the literature suggests that both Early Supplier involvement (ESI) and Early Purchasing Involvement (EPI) practices need to be reconsidered when applied to <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation.</b> Research limitations/implications The paper is conceptual so does not rely on an empirical study conducted {{for the purpose of}} addressing our specific research question. Nevertheless, on the basis of analysis of the existing literature we suggest <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation</b> calls for a fundamental rethink of established ESI and EPI practices. Practical implications (if applicable) Purchasing functions are advised to widen their search and selection environments for completely new technologies, scanning outside existing supply relationships and supply chains. Purchasing should be involved particularly early in the sourcing process, before any specific project has even been formally started. Short-term supplier relationships or dalliances should be developed. Ask new suppliers for solutions instead of informing suppliers of well-defined specifications. What is original/value of paper The paper examines a well-established field (ESI) and an emerging related field (EPI). Focusing on the challenges of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation,</b> we suggest that both ESI and EPI practices need to be fundamentally reconsidered when applied to <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovation...</b>|$|E

50|$|Crossing the Chasm {{is closely}} related to the {{technology}} adoption lifecycle where five main segments are recognized: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. According to Moore, the marketer should focus on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for marketing to the next group. The most difficult step is making the transition between visionaries (early adopters) and pragmatists (early majority). This is the chasm that he refers to. If a successful firm can create a bandwagon effect in which enough momentum builds, then the product becomes a de facto standard. However, Moore's theories are only applicable for disruptive or <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovations.</b> Adoption of continuous innovations (that do not force a significant change of behavior by the customer) are still best described by the original technology adoption lifecycle.|$|R

Critical {{to the development of}} new products/services is the management of the front-end phase, which crucially determines the eventual fate of a new product/service idea. However, studies on how knowledge is created at the front-end of the new product development process are rare. This empirical paper addresses this gap by focusing on knowledge conceptualization - where new knowledge from its generation is crystallized into a concrete and explicit form. Employing a qualitative methodology, the paper examines ten discontinuous projects and develops a front-end knowledge conceptualization framework. The framework consists of the identified knowledge conceptualization stages and illuminates the pattern of overlaps, outcomes, contributors, knowledge, interactions and volatility across each stage. Our main contribution is a knowledge-based appreciation of the dynamic and interactive nature of the new product/service development's front-end phase in the context of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovations,</b> and thence the paper provides clear managerial learning points for the effective management of this phase. © 2012 The Author(s).

40|$|M. CommHigh-technology {{marketing}} is different to consumer marketing in that with consumer marketing {{a number of}} different rules apply. The complexity, cost, and risk of technology products makes them fundamentally different from consumer products, and marketing practices are usually different as well. (McKenna, 1991 : 218) Consumer marketing of continuous innovations refers to the normal upgrading of products that does not require the consumer to change behaviour. Between continuous and discontinuous products lies a spectrum of demands for change. When a marketplace is confronted with the opportunity to switch to a new infrastructure paradigm- customers self-segregate along an axis of risk aversion. With high-technology marketing the prospective buyer is attracted by the value of the high-technology product, but fears it may not work, is uncertain about the solution and doubt the validity of the solution - referred to as the FUD —factor (fear; uncertainty; doubt) (Wiefels, 1998 : 7). Truly <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovations</b> are new products or services that require the end user and the marketplace to dramatically change their past behavior, with the promise of gaining equally dramatic new benefits. Discontinuous products require customers to change their current mode of behaviour or to modify other products and services that they rely on...|$|R

40|$|The {{provision}} of artificial light was revolutionised {{by a series}} of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovations</b> in lighting appliances, fuels, infrastructures and institutions during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In Britain, the real price of lighting fell dramatically (3, 000 -fold between 1800 and 2000) and quality rose. Along with rises in real income and population, these developments meant that total consumption of lighting was 40, 000 times greater by 2000 than in 1800. The paper presents estimates of the income and price elasticities of demand for lighting services over the past three hundred years, and explores how they evolved. Income and price elasticities increased dramatically (to 3. 5 and - 1. 7, respectively) between the 1840 s and the 1890 s and fell rapidly in the twentieth century.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the nature of}} discontinuity in innovations by examining whether consumers 2 ̆ 7 cognitive schema development affected their ability {{to make a decision}} to symbolically accept or reject an innovation, based on high and low levels of information, and whether that decision would be positive or negative. A three-phased approach was used, first eliciting cognitive scripts for the consumption process using the innovation and for the activities which the innovation would replace, next validating the innovation script, and finally testing the hypotheses related to differences between high and low schema groups. ^ The results did not reveal a direct relationship between schema development and ability to make a decision, although consumer 2 ̆ 7 s age and creativity level appeared to interact with the amount of information they had received about the innovation to affect the degree of certainty they felt about their decision. Consumers with high schema development were no more likely to adopt the innovation than those with lower schema development, and in fact there was some tendency for those with high schema development to reject the innovation. These findings are in direct contrast to propositions made by Gatignon and Robertson (1985), which predicted that consumers with more well developed schemata would adopt an innovation earlier. ^ Consumers 2 ̆ 7 anticipated regret and satisfaction regarding adoption and nonadoption situations also was explored; consumers tended to anticipate greater regret or satisfaction for adoption decisions than for nonadoption decisions, but no differences in regret levels between high and low schema groups were detected. In general, {{the findings of this study}} suggest that consumers anticipate the behavioral process and possible outcomes associated with innovations, and that in the case of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>innovations</b> which present ideas inconsistent with a consumer 2 ̆ 7 s current beliefs or lifestyles, resistance to this change may occur.
