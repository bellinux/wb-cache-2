5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four long <b>fingers</b> and an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon {{arrangement}} in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration of the <b>fingers</b> is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. Additionally, {{without the use of}} the thumb, the <b>fingers</b> and hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting the tops of the <b>fingers</b> against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E

50|$|The middle <b>finger,</b> long <b>finger,</b> or tall <b>finger</b> is {{the third}} digit of the human hand, located between the index <b>finger</b> and the ring <b>finger.</b> It is usually the longest <b>finger.</b> In anatomy, it is also called the third <b>finger,</b> digitus medius, digitus tertius, or digitus III.|$|R

5|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{affecting the}} digits (<b>fingers</b> and toes) {{have been observed}} with the syndrome. A broadening of the thumbs and big toes (halluces) was reported in two brothers. The broadening was apparent in all distal phalanges of the <b>fingers,</b> although the pinkies were unaffected yet appeared to be clinodactylic (warped, or bent toward the other <b>fingers).</b> Additional eports described this broadness of the thumbs and big toes, with brachydactyly (shortness) in the distal phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals. On X-rays of a two-year-old boy with the disorder, the brachydactyly was shown {{to be caused by}} shortening of epiphyses (joint-ends) of the distal phalanges. The broadness and brachydactyly of the big toes in particular may give them a stunted, rounded and stub-like appearance.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs were robustly {{built and}} {{proportionally}} long, measuring 70% {{of the length}} of the hind limbs. The radius of the forearm measured 70% {{of the length of}} the humerus (forearm bone). The hand was large, approaching the humerus in length, and possessed five <b>fingers</b> equipped for grasping. The second finger was the longest, followed by the third and the first finger (the thumb). The first three <b>fingers</b> ended in large and strong claws. The fourth and fifth <b>fingers</b> were strongly reduced, and possibly vestigial. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of finger bones in each finger starting from the first, was 2-3-4-3-2.|$|E

50|$|Some {{scissors}} have an appendage, {{called a}} <b>finger</b> brace or <b>finger</b> tang, below the index <b>finger</b> hole {{for the middle}} <b>finger</b> to rest on to provide for better control and more power in precision cutting. A <b>finger</b> tang {{can be found on}} many quality scissors (including inexpensive ones) and especially on scissors for cutting hair (see hair scissors pictured below).

5000|$|The index <b>finger</b> (also {{referred}} to as forefinger, first <b>finger,</b> pointer <b>finger,</b> trigger <b>finger,</b> digitus secundus, digitus II, and [...] ), is the first <b>finger</b> and the second digit of a human hand. It is located {{between the first and}} third digits, between the thumb and the middle <b>finger.</b> It is usually the most dextrous and sensitive <b>finger</b> of the hand, though not the longest - it is shorter than the middle <b>finger,</b> and may be shorter or longer than the ring <b>finger</b> - see digit ratio.|$|R

A group of mobsters after the manuscript ransack Anna Maria's hotel room, as well as George's bail bonds office, and steal the manuscript. George discovers that the mobsters are led by <b>Fingers</b> Martino, who runs an old meat packing factory. George sneaks into the factory and overhears a conversation between <b>Fingers</b> and Mr. Spallacci, who has obtained the manuscript. George manages to covertly take back the manuscript, which he examines with Anna Maria. George figures out that the fortified city on it must be Istanbul.|$|E
