2500|$|During their ill-fated Franklin-Nashville Campaign in late 1864 regimental rations had {{dwindled to}} near nothing, with troops forced to {{scavenge}} sorghum from farms; one Mess Sergeant was even jokingly advised {{to throw away}} his scales, since the men believed that no more rations would ever be issued and the man {{should not have to}} haul the unnecessary weight. Local farmers had fled the area, leaving their fields unplanted and their stock scattered or dead; while cornbread, biscuits and beef were occasionally issued in minute quantities, persimmons were often the only food the 33rd <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> on a regular basis. When he was wounded at Franklin, Matthews was transferred to a Confederate hospital at Columbia, Tennessee, where he was fed [...] "beef soup, wheat and corn bread, fresh beef often hashed, pork and bacon, Irish potatoes and onions." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Oscar Wao, Diaz {{began work}} on a second novel, a science-fiction epic with the working title Monstro. Diaz had {{previously}} attempted to write a science fiction novel twice prior to Oscar Wao, with earlier efforts in the genre [...] "Shadow of the Adept, a far-future novel in the vein of Gene Wolfe's The Shadow of the Torturer, and Dark America, an Akira-inspired post-apocalyptic nightmare" [...] remaining incomplete and unpublished. Part {{of the appeal of}} science fiction to Diaz, he explained in an interview with Wired, is that science fiction grapples with the idea of power in a manner other genres do not: [...] "I didn't see mainstream, literary, realistic fiction talking about power, talking about dictatorship, talking about the consequences of breeding people, which of course is something that in the Caribbean is never far away." [...] In an interview with New York Magazine prior to the release of This Is How You Lose Her, Diaz revealed that the work-in-progress novel concerns [...] "a 14-year-old 'Dominican York' girl who saves the planet from a full-blown apocalypse". but he also warned that the novel may never be completed: [...] "I'm only at {{the first part of the}} novel, so I haven't really gotten down to the eating," [...] he says, [...] "and I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> a couple cities before I think the thing will really get going." [...] As of June 2015, the novel-in-progress appears to be abandoned– in a June 2015 interview for Words on a Wire, when asked about his progress on Monstro, Diaz said [...] "Yeah, I'm not writing that book anymore..." [...] Diaz's next book, Islandborn, is to be a children's book, due for publication in March 2018.|$|E

6000|$|... "They have <b>got</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> {{that smells}} nice," [...] Jack said, {{as they approached}} the fire. [...] "I hope to goodness they are going to give us some. I feel awfully peckish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lor!" [...] he said, [...] "it's Bert. I thought you'd {{be coming}} back some day, and I'm glad to see you. But I carn't arst you <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> {{anything}}, because I 'aven't <b>got</b> anything <b>to</b> <b>eat....</b> Where you been, Bert, all this time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But that's {{just the}} reason why you've got to go. We can't run such risks. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> or die--you ought to know that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have I? We girls haven't <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> {{like you}} men. I'll call up towards {{the evening and}} see if you've {{anything}} ready for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorry, {{there goes}} the supper bell!" [...] {{interrupted}} Tom. [...] "Come on, we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> even if we miss the finest poem in the universe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hetty, dear," [...] sighed Cecilia, [...] "I'm so hungry. What {{difference}} does it make whether he's a prince or a burglar? I don't care. Bring him in if he's <b>got</b> anything <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I <b>got</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> an' a fair {{place to}} sleep in; but {{it seems as though}} a feller like me ought er have more'n that, if he works hard all day for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> work, {{and pretty}} hard, but I {{tell you we}} are a good bit better off {{than they are in}} the prisons of Russia. We have <b>got</b> plenty <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> though I cannot say much for its niceness; anyhow we are a long way better fed than the {{soldiers}} who look after us; but here comes the food." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it's risky, but I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> {{and take}} a rest," [...] he said. [...] "The trees are pretty thick, and if the smoke goes up, the hill's a good background." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Okay," [...] Red said, [...] "I guess they'll eat it. Holy Smokes, they've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> something. Let's {{walk along}} toward {{the hill and}} see what Dad and your father are going to do." ...|$|E
60|$|But there's no God outside you, {{whom you}} can rise to or sink to or swoop away to. You can't even gum {{yourself}} to a divine Nirvana moon. Because all the time you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> your dinner and digest it. There is no goal outside you. None.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you didn't {{sound like}} Ohio. I {{always like to}} make sure. Well, you must pull up. Mother, have you <b>got</b> {{anything}} fit <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> this evening?" ...|$|R
60|$|So with a groan I {{consigned}} {{all these}} valuables to my capacious pockets. Then I locked up the empty safe, replaced the keys where I had found them on Marnham, fastened the shutter {{and left the}} room with Anscombe, waiting for a while outside till Heda joined us, sobbing a little. After this we <b>got</b> something <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> insisting on Heda doing the same.|$|R
60|$|The {{idea of a}} feast pleased all the boys. They always <b>got</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> during regular meal {{hours at}} the Hall, but there was {{something}} enticing in {{the idea of having a}} feast on the sly some night in one of the dormitories. They had had a number of such in the past and these had been productive of a good deal of sport.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shore. A feller has jest <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> I can rustle {{along without}} whisky, {{but not without}} grub. Thet's {{what makes it so}} embarrassin' travelin' these parts dodgin' your shadow. Now, I'm on my way to Mercer. It's a little two-bit town up the river a ways. I'm goin' to pack out some grub." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Garlic and grease," [...] added Larry. [...] "And this {{bread is}} hard enough {{to build a wall}} with," [...] he continued. [...] "However, we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> or go hungry." [...] And he partook of just enough to stay his stomach. Luke and Grandon were not so {{particular}} and despite their grumbling managed to make away with all that remained.|$|E
6000|$|... "That I won't; my men are men. I've {{been out}} to your miserable barracks and watched them eat. Faugh! Potatoes! Nothing but potatoes! No salt! Nothing! Only potatoes! I may have been mistaken, but I thought I {{understood}} them {{to say that that}} was all they ever <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> Two meals a day and every day in the week?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you are {{a bright}} specimen, aren't you?" [...] said Dunstable, seating himself on the table which should have been groaning {{under the weight of}} cake and biscuits. [...] "I should like to know where you expect to go to. You lure me in here, and then have the cheek to tell me you haven't <b>got</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> What have you done with it all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you have}} killed us, Mr. Stubbs," [...] wailed Toby. [...] "We never can find {{our way out}} of here; an' now we hain't <b>got</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> and by tomorrow we shall be starved to death. Oh dear! wasn't you bad enough when you threw all the money away, so you had to go an' do this just when we was in awful trouble?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Three {{more days}} went by without {{any sign of}} Higgs's {{aspiration}} being fulfilled. On the contrary, except in one respect, the luck remained steadily against us. The exception was that we <b>got</b> plenty <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and consequently regained our normal state of health and strength more rapidly than might have been expected. With us it was literally a case of [...] "Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die." ...|$|R
6000|$|Though the uninvited slunk away sorrowfully, the {{entertainment}} provided at Auld Licht houses of mourning was {{characteristic of a}} stern and sober sect. They <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and to drink to the extent, as a rule, of a [...] "lippy" [...] of shortbread and a [...] "brew" [...] of toddy; but open Bibles lay on the table, and the eyes of each were on his neighbours to catch them transgressing, and offer up a prayer for them on the spot. Ay me! there is no Bowie nowadays to fill an absent minister's shoes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, I don't suppose there's much to settle. Nor many {{tears to}} shed—when a fellow spends his years an' his prime on the Lord knows who, you can't expect those that {{remember}} him young {{to feel his}} loss too keenly. He'd had his fling in his day, though, ma'am. Ay—must ha' had some rich times. No lasting satisfaction in it though—always wanting, craving. There's nothing like marrying—you've got your dish before you then, and you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> it." [...] He lapsed again into reflection, from {{which he did not}} rouse till we had locked up the desk, burned the useless papers, put the others into my pockets and the black bag, and were standing ready to depart. Then the doctor looked up suddenly and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{depends on}} when you get them," [...] Deering replied. [...] "A June steelhead, fresh from the sea, is pretty good, but a salmon that has pushed through to head waters in the fall is another thing. When you think about it, the salmons' journey inland is remarkable. They bore against the autumn floods when the melted snow comes down; they force {{tremendous}} rapids, whirlpools, and roaring falls. Where the water's calm in the valleys, eagles and fish-hawks harry them, and the mink hunts them in the shallows. But they can't be stopped; they follow Nature's urge and shove on across all obstacles for the distant gravel banks. Then they spawn, where they were hatched, and the bears eat their spent carcasses. The trouble is, I'm not a bear, but I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> salmon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nit," [...] said Hetty. [...] "It ain't him. You're {{up against}} real life now. I believe you said your hero friend had money and automobiles. This {{is a poor}} skeezicks that's <b>got</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> but an onion. But he's easy-spoken and not a freshy. I imagine he's been a gentleman, he's so low down now. And we need the onion. Shall I bring him in? I'll {{guarantee}} his behavior." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, master," [...] whispered Jacques, [...] "it {{seems to}} my {{observation}} that the fellow you called Redfeather eats less than any Injin I ever saw. He has <b>got</b> a comrade <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> {{more than half of}} his share; now that's strange." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've <b>got</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> today, {{and enough}} is enough, {{so what is}} the use of working when I don't have to?" [...] says Peter. [...] "I don't believe in working today so that I won't have to work {{tomorrow}}, because when tomorrow comes there may be no need of working, and then I would feel that I had wasted all this good time today." [...] No, Peter isn't the least bit thrifty.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] murmured Smither in the hall, {{where the}} air had the {{singular}} freshness of the outside day, [...] "we haven't been very satisfied with him, not all this week. He's always been one to leave a titbit to the end; but ever since Monday he's been eating it first. If you notice a dog, Mr. Soames, at its dinner, it eats the meat first. We've always thought it such a good sign of Mr. Timothy at his age to {{leave it to the}} last, but now he seems to have lost all his self-control; and, of course, it makes him leave the rest. The doctor doesn't make anything of it, but"--Smither shook her head--"he seems to think he's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> it first, in case he shouldn't get to it. That and his talking makes us anxious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{were sure}} that they would return next spring, it wouldn't be so bad," [...] he muttered. [...] "It's those terrible guns. I {{know what it is}} to have to watch out for them. Farmer Brown's boy used to hunt me with one of them, but he doesn't any more. But even when he did hunt me it wasn't {{anything}} like what the Ducks have to go through. If I kept my eyes and ears open, I could tell when a hunter was coming and could hide in a hole if I wanted to. I never had to worry about my meals. But with the Ducks it is a thousand times worse. They've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> while making that long journey, and they can eat only where there is the right kind of food. Hunters with terrible guns know where those places are and hide there until the Ducks come, and the Ducks have no way of knowing whether the hunters are waiting for them or not. That isn't hunting. It's--it's--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, {{but if you}} <b>got</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> {{for ever}} so long?" [...] said Tom, his {{imagination}} becoming quite active under the stimulus of that dread. [...] "When I'm a man, I shall make a boat with a wooden house {{on the top of}} it, like Noah's ark, and keep plenty <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> in it,--rabbits and things,--all ready. And then if the flood came, you know, Bob, I shouldn't mind. And I'd take you in, if I saw you swimming," [...] he added, in the tone of a benevolent patron.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you," [...] breathed the artist. [...] "I didn't know. And I did {{hate to see}} {{the thick}} peeling go; it seemed such a waste. But I thought they always had to be peeled. When you've <b>got</b> only {{potatoes}} <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> the peelings count, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go away?" [...] echoed Mrs Butts; [...] "you {{must not}} talk of going away till you've had {{a bite of}} lunch with us. It's our dinner, you know, but lawks! what do it matter what you calls it so long as you've <b>got</b> it <b>to</b> <b>eat?</b> An' there's such a splendid apple dumplin' in the pot, miss; you see, it's Tommy's birthday, for he was born on a Christmas Day, an' he's very fond of apple dumplin', is Tommy." ...|$|R
