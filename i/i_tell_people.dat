500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kricfalusi {{complained about}} Nickelodeon {{executives}} requesting that Ren have [...] "a softer side". Bill Wray said that Ren {{was his favorite}} character to write for; Wray described Ren as [...] "fun" [...] because [...] "you can make him mean."

2500|$|Jones {{spoke about}} {{his desire to}} {{continue}} his boxing career further, “Anything is possible, I’m {{not going to make}} an immediate decision. Why would I stop when I looked that good though?... I want a shot at a cruiserweight title ... I do intend on fighting and we’ll see what happens in the future. I looked good." [...] Jones later told On The Ropes Boxing Radio, [...] "Yeah I think it’s my last year in boxing, and <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> all the time." [...] Hinting he may retire at the end of 2017.|$|E

2500|$|Fox hired Terry Erdmann (Blue Blaze {{code name}} [...] "Silver Fox") {{and a team}} of publicists {{including}} Blake Mitchell and Jim Ferguson to promote the film at Star Trek conventions with a few film clips and free Banzai headbands, which have since become highly sought-after collector's items by fans of the film. The studio made no attempts to sell the film to a mainstream audience with traditional promotion, although there was some magazine advertising (primarily in Marvel Comics) and related licensing which served as viral advertising in limited venues. Studio publicist Rosemary LaSalmandra said, [...] "Nobody knew what to do with Buckaroo Banzai. There was no simple way to tell anyone what it was about—I'm not sure anybody knew". Lithgow said, [...] "I've tried to explain the story line to people and it takes about an hour. I mean it; it's that complicated. But it's terrific. Every time <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> about it, I get so excited that I end it by saying, Buckaroo Banzai, remember where you heard it first!" ...|$|E

6000|$|I resumed: [...] "There was no {{one else}} to look after his interests, and it was not only his right but his duty to get the most he could for himself and his own, {{according}} to his best light.

6000|$|I {{listened and}} shivered. The inquiry into rare cases of disease after {{vaccination}} had been interesting work, which, whatever deductions people {{might choose to}} draw, in fact committed me to nothing. But {{to become one of}} the ragged little regiment of medical dissenters, to swallow all the unscientific follies of the anti-vaccination agitators, to make myself responsible for and to promulgate their distorted figures and wild statements--ah! that was another thing. Must I appear upon platforms and denounce this wonderful discovery as the [...] "law of useless infanticide"? Must <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> that [...] "smallpox is really a curative process and not the deadly scourge and pestilence that doctors pretend it to be"? Must I maintain [...] "that vaccination never did, never does, and never can prevent even a single case of smallpox"? Must I hold it up as a [...] "law (!) of devil worship and human sacrifice to idols"? ...|$|E

5000|$|Newman {{was quoted}} as stating that “there are many factual errors either through bad {{research}} or overzealous attempts to show the evils of capitalism.

2500|$|The {{book also}} {{influenced}} R.L. Stine, who said, [...] "Ray Bradbury {{is one of}} my favorite authors. <b>I</b> always <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> that the scariest book I ever read was one of his books—Something Wicked This Way Comes." ...|$|R

5000|$|Look at what realists {{have done}} for us. They have led us to war and climate change, poverty on an unimaginable scale, and {{wholesale}} ecological destruction. Half of humanity goes to bed hungry {{because of all the}} realistic leaders in the world. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> who call me [...] "unrealistic" [...] to show me what their realism has done. Realism is an outdated, overplayed and wholly exaggerated concept.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with No Depression in 2013, member Stephen Murray stated,"It started off very Dixieland and ragtime, and right now we’re so much into the ‘60s and ‘70s, like horn-rock, The Band and The Stones and The Beatles, kind of just like really groovy.

We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version. <b>I</b> always <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> {{to go back to the}} '82 version.|$|R
5000|$|His first {{swimming}} {{competition was}} {{at the age of}} nine. Aungles stated: [...] "I didn't consider myself as having a disability until I was about 10 because I was born that way.

5000|$|In 2001, {{she wrote}} of the {{challenges}} facing rock groups of this kind:When <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> that I am the drummer for an all-Asian American female rock band, I don't expect to be taken seriously. There aren't any other bands like Kim in Chicago, let along in america, so I don't expect the masses to comprehend that, YES, women rock, and that, YES, Asian American women also rock ... and we rock hard, dammit! ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Huckabee stated, [...] "I'm {{not real}} fond when {{people try to}} tell me that I'm just against same sex marriage. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people</b> I'm {{actually}} just for keeping marriage in the only manner in which it's even been known in any culture in any civilization throughout all of history, and dear friends, until Moses comes down with two stone tablets from Brokeback Mountain saying he's changed the rules, let's keep it like it is." ...|$|E
5000|$|McCartney later {{described}} in Beat Instrumental how he went about the song's composition: [...] "Here’s {{one example of}} a bit I pinched from someone: I used the bass riff from 'Talkin’ About You' by Chuck Berry in 'I Saw Her Standing There'. I played exactly the same notes as he did and it fitted our number perfectly. Even now, when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>people,</b> I find few of them believe me; therefore, I maintain that a bass riff hasn’t got to be original".|$|E

5000|$|Amber Eliza Watts {{suggested}} that Hung's cult following derived from him being {{the antithesis of}} everything Idol represented, with his lack of musical talent and odd looks, and how unlike other audition failures he was not arrogantly expecting to be made a pop star, {{he just wanted to}} sing.
