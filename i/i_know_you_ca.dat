6000|$|HESTER. <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>you</b> {{had heard}} it. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> {{would agree with}} me. A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn't she? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now that's right, York--but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> {{would do}} it. You couldn't leave that poor chap to fight along without means or profession, with certain defeat before him, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't, for his father's sake {{if not for}} his own." ...|$|R
