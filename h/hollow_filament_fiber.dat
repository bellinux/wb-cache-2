50|$|In 1861, a {{group of}} German quarry workers found the fossil of Archaeopteryx, which had {{feathers}} like modern birds, but also teeth in its mouth, a long, bony wing, and claws on its wings like a reptile. Archaeopteryx {{seems to be a}} transitionary animal from reptile to bird. However, Archaeopteryx had already rather developed feathers, which didn’t help to show how the feathers had evolved in the first place. In 1996, the missing fossil to help show the evolution of feathers was found. Sinosauropteryx was covered in thin, <b>hollow</b> <b>filaments</b> that covered its back and tail. Now, after finding many dinosaurs with primitive feathers, it is believed that feathers started out as these thin, <b>hollow</b> <b>filaments,</b> and eventually evolved into the fluffy coats of feathers seen on modern birds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Filament</b> <b>fibers</b> {{that are}} {{produced}} using the wet spinning method can be dyed while the fibers {{are still in}} the coagulating bath. The dye penetration at this stage is high, as the fibers are still soft. This method is known as gel dyeing.|$|R

50|$|Integumentary {{structures}} {{that gave rise}} to the feathers of birds are seen in the dorsal spines of reptiles and fish. A similar stage in their evolution to the complex coats of birds and mammals can be observed in living reptiles such as iguanas and Gonocephalus agamids. Feather structures are thought to have proceeded from simple <b>hollow</b> <b>filaments</b> through several stages of increasing complexity, ending with the large, deeply rooted feathers with strong pens (rachis), barbs and barbules that birds display today.|$|R
50|$|For {{specialized}} polyester-based materials {{the recycling}} process is significantly different. The {{first step is}} to remove the buttons and zippers; then the garments are cut into small pieces. The shredded fabric is then granulated and formed into small pellets. The pellets are broken down polymerized and turned into polyester chips. The chips are melted and spun into new <b>filament</b> <b>fiber</b> used to make new polyester fabrics.|$|R
5|$|Polyps feed on {{a variety}} of small organisms, from {{microscopic}} zooplankton to small fish. The polyp's tentacles immobilize or kill prey using their nematocysts. These cells carry venom which they rapidly release in response to contact with another organism. A dormant nematocyst discharges in response to nearby prey touching the trigger (cnidocil). A flap (operculum) opens and its stinging apparatus fires the barb into the prey. The venom is injected through the <b>hollow</b> <b>filament</b> to immobilise the prey; the tentacles then manoeuvre the prey to the mouth.|$|R

The use of woody sources of cellulose makes viscose cheaper, so it was used on a larger scale than the other methods.

50|$|Although {{knitting}} may be {{done with}} ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers. In spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a Z-twist or S-twist yarn. If the fibers are first aligned by combing them, the yarn is smoother and called a worsted; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed, the yarn is fuzzier and called woolen-spun. The fibers making up a yarn may be continuous <b>filament</b> <b>fibers</b> such as silk and many synthetics, {{or they may be}} staples (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally <b>filament</b> <b>fibers</b> are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning. The strength of the spun yarn against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn. In general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension. The thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a slub is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.|$|R
40|$|The study {{deals with}} the elastostatic problem of a penny-shaped crack in an elastic matrix which is {{reinforced}} by <b>filaments</b> or <b>fibers</b> perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} crack. An elastic filament model is first developed, followed by consideration of the application of the model to the penny-shaped crack problem in which the filaments of finite length are asymmetrically distributed around the crack. Since the primary interest is in the application of the results to studies relating to the fracture of fiber or filament-reinforced composites and reinforced concrete, the main emphasis of the study is on the evaluation of the stress intensity factor along the periphery of the crack, the stresses in the <b>filaments</b> or <b>fibers,</b> and the interface shear between the matrix and the <b>filaments</b> or <b>fibers.</b> Using the <b>filament</b> model developed, the elastostatic interaction problem between a penny-shaped crack and a slender inclusion or filament in an elastic matrix is formulated...|$|R

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{has led the}} {{development}} of unique flame retardant fibers for the specific requirements of different space programs. Three of these fibers have greatly contributed {{to the safety of}} all the space missions since the Apollo program. Beta alumina-silica microfiber developed for the outer layer of the space suit after the Apollo 1 fire is no longer used and has been replaced by other glass fibers. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) fiber used in the current spacesuit is mostly known today through its trade mark Gore-Tex. Polybenzimidazole (PBI) <b>filament</b> <b>fiber</b> used in many applications from the Apollo to the Space Shuttle program is no longer available. More recently, TOR"TM" copolymer of polyimide fiber developed during the space shuttle program to resist the atomic oxygen present in Low Earth Orbit has been barely used. The high cost and narrow range of aeronautical and aerospace applications have, however, led to a limited production of these fibers. Only fibers that found niche markets survived. Yet, deep space exploration will require more of these inherently flame retardant fibers than what is available today. There is a need for new flame retardant fabrics inside the space vehicles as well as a need for logistics reduction for long term space missions. Materials like modacrylic and polyimide are good candidates for future flame retardant aerospace fabrics. New fabrics must be developed for astronauts' clothing, as well as crew quarters and habitat. Therefore, both staple and <b>filament</b> <b>fibers</b> of various linear densities are needed for a three years mission to Mars...|$|R
50|$|There is a {{difference}} between filament and total measurements in deniers. Both are defined as above; but the first relates to a single <b>filament</b> of <b>fiber</b> (commonly called denier per filament (DPF)), whereas the second relates to a yarn.|$|R
50|$|The {{continuous}} <b>filament</b> polyester <b>fibers</b> {{are gathered}} {{together in a}} bundle of 7-15 fibers and are twisted on a twister frame to form filler yarns. The plied and twisted yarn is then wound onto a spool called a filler bobbin.|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} twist in a yarn helps {{to define the}} style of yarn- a yarn {{with a lot of}} air such as a woollen yarn will have much less twist than a yarn with little air, like a worsted yarn. It also affects the stretchiness of the yarn, {{strength}}, the halo of the yarn, and many other attributes. Filling or weft yarns usually have fewer twists per inch because strength is not as important as with warp yarns, and highly twisted yarns are, in general, stronger. Warp yarns have to be stronger so that they can withstand the tension of the loom. <b>Filament</b> <b>fibers,</b> such as silk, or many synthetics, need only to be twisted slightly to create a yarn.|$|R

50|$|Precursors {{for carbon}} fibers are {{polyacrylonitrile}} (PAN), rayon and pitch. Carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>filament</b> yarns {{are used in}} several processing techniques: the direct uses are for prepregging, filament winding, pultrusion, weaving, braiding, etc. Carbon fiber yarn is rated by the linear density (weight per unit length, i.e. 1 g/1000 m = 1 tex) or by number of filaments per yarn count, in thousands. For example, 200 tex for 3,000 <b>filaments</b> of carbon <b>fiber</b> is three times as strong as 1,000 carbon filament yarn, but is also three times as heavy. This thread can then be used to weave a carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>filament</b> fabric or cloth. The appearance of this fabric generally depends on the linear density of the yarn and the weave chosen. Some commonly used types of weave are twill, satin and plain. Carbon filament yarns can also be knitted or braided.|$|R
