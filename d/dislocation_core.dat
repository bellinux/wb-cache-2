40|$|Dislocations in {{perovskite}} oxides {{have been}} found to have important impacts on their electronic and ionic transportation properties, which are believed {{to be related to the}} structure and chemistry of <b>dislocation</b> <b>cores.</b> For <b>dislocation</b> <b>cores</b> at a 6 ° low-angle [0 0 1] tilt grain boundary in SrTiO 3, an embedded TiOx rocksalt-like structure has been suggested, consistent with a deficiency of Sr. However, direct evidence supporting these suggestions has not been obtained up to now. In this work, we reveal the atomic structure and chemistry of edge <b>dislocation</b> <b>cores</b> at a low-angle [0 0 1] symmetric tilt-boundary in SrTiO 3 bicrystals by imaging techniques of high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with an FEI Titan cube 3 60 – 300 (PICO) microscope operated at 80 kV. The experimental results demonstrate direct evidence for a local coordination of edge-sharing TiO 6 octahedra at the <b>dislocation</b> <b>cores,</b> which can be understood as the result of strain. The local coordination of edge-sharing TiO 6 octahedra is associated with the face-centered cubic (FCC) NaCl-type TiO phase.

50|$|Cottrell atmospheres {{occur in}} body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) {{materials}} , such as iron or nickel, with small impurity atoms, such as carbon or nitrogen. As these interstitial atoms distort the lattice slightly, {{there will be}} an associated residual stress field surrounding the interstitial. This stress field can be relaxed by the interstitial atom diffusing towards a dislocation, which contains a small gap at its core (as it is a more open structure), see Figure 1. Once the atom has diffused into the <b>dislocation</b> <b>core</b> the atom will stay. Typically only one interstitial atom is required per lattice plane of the dislocation.|$|E
50|$|In some materials, the {{transition}} is sharper than others and typically requires a temperature-sensitive deformation mechanism. For example, in materials with a body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice the DBTT is readily apparent, as the motion of screw dislocations is very temperature sensitive because the rearrangement of the <b>dislocation</b> <b>core</b> prior to slip requires thermal activation. This can be problematic for steels with a high ferrite content. This famously resulted in serious hull cracking in Liberty ships in colder waters during World War II, causing many sinkings. DBTT can also be influenced by external factors such as neutron radiation, which leads {{to an increase in}} internal lattice defects and a corresponding decrease in ductility and increase in DBTT.|$|E

The main conclusion {{of this study is}} that due to their characteristic properties, the non-singular displacement fields, non-singular stresses and <b>dislocation</b> <b>core</b> shape of screw and edge dislocations obtained in the framework of strain gradient elasticity are more realistic and physical than the corresponding fields of the Peierls-Nabarro model.

40|$|A {{network of}} screw dislocations was artificially created in SrTiO 3, and {{characterized}} by {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM). Slight expansion of the <b>dislocation</b> <b>core</b> was observed by TEM. The composition of the <b>dislocation</b> <b>core</b> was quantified by electron energy loss spectroscopy, which reveals a 13 +/- 5 % Ti/O ratio increase but no Sr/Ti ratio change in the core, demonstrating an oxygen deficiency or oxygen vacancy surplus in the <b>dislocation</b> <b>core.</b> The vacancy surplus {{was estimated to be}} about one vacancy every unit cell along the core. The <b>dislocation</b> <b>core</b> is positively charged; therefore, oxygen vacancies and holes are expelled from the dislocation network, forming a double Schottky barrier, which blocks charge carrier transports across the network.

Partial substitution of Ca for Y in YBa_ 2 Cu_ 3 O_ 7 -δ has shown significant improvement in J_gb but the mechanisms are still not well understood.

Coherent x rays are particularly suited for bulk dislocation studies because lattice phase shifts in condensed matter induce typical diffraction patterns which strongly depend on the fine structure of the <b>dislocation</b> <b>cores.</b> The strength of the method is demonstrated by performing coherent diffraction of a single dislocation loop in silicon.

Compared with the substitutional atoms such as Al, {{there is a large}} repulsive interaction between oxygen interstitials at the octahedral site and an -type screw <b>dislocation</b> <b>core,</b> since the volume for the interstitial atom between Ti lattice sites is largely reduced in the core. Differential displacement maps and distributions of interstitial volume surrounding the <b>dislocation</b> <b>core</b> show that the interaction with an oxygen interstitial is very short ranged (~ 5 Angstrom) and directional, mainly located on the prismatic plane where the majority of lattice displacements in the screw <b>dislocation</b> <b>core</b> occurs. At long distances the interactions mediated by the strain from the interstitial oxygen and the dislocation vanish. We show that the large repulsive interaction at short range can push an oxygen atom from its original interstitial site to a new interstitial site on the basal plane in the <b>dislocation</b> <b>core.</b> The strong repulsive interaction and the mechanical shuffle of oxygen interstitials can be expected to have a large impact on dislocation dynamics, and can be used to explain the strong strengthening effects of oxygen impurities in alpha-titanium observed experimentally...|$|E

It was found that when an arsenic atom sits in a crystalline position near the <b>dislocation</b> <b>core,</b> there is charge transfer from the arsenic towards the <b>dislocation</b> <b>core.</b> As a result, the arsenic becomes positively charged and the core negatively charged. The results indicate that the structural changes around the impurity are very small in both environments, namely, the crystal and the <b>dislocation</b> <b>core.</b> In this scenario, the interaction between arsenic and the core is essentially electrostatic, which eventually leads to arsenic segregation.
