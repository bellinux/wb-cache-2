Specifically there are four vegetation zones. Coniferous forest form the taiga region of the northern areas with alpine noted at higher zones. In the mountain forest-steppe zone vegetation is dense on the northern slopes; Siberian larches (grows up to 45 m height), Siberian cedars, interspersed with spruces, pines (Siberian and Scotch pines), and firs along with deciduous vegetation of white and brown birches, aspens, and poplars are noted to dominate the area. The inter-montane basins, wide river valleys and the southern slopes of the mountains have steppe vegetation. Pastureland have a cover of feather grass, couch grass, wormwood, and several species fodder plants.

40|$|The Mediterranean Basin is {{expected}} to face warmer and drier conditions in the future, following projected increases in temperature and declines in precipitation. The {{aim of this study}} is to explore how forests dominated by Abies borisii-regis, Abies cephalonica, Fagus sylvatica, Pinus nigra and Quercus frainetto will respond under such conditions. We combined an individual-based model (GREFOS), with a novel tree ring data set in order to constrain tree diameter growth and to account for inter- and intraspecific growth variability. We used wood density data to infer tree longevity, taking into account inter- and intraspecific variability. The model was applied at three 500 -m-wide elevation gradients at Taygetos in Peloponnese, at Agrafa on Southern Pindos and at Valia Kalda on Northern Pindos in Greece. Simulations adequately represented species distribution and abundance across the elevation gradients under current climate. We subsequently used the model to estimate species and functional trait shifts under warmer and drier future conditions based on the IPCC A 1 B scenario. In all three sites, a retreat of less <b>drought-tolerant</b> <b>species</b> and an upward shift of more <b>drought-tolerant</b> <b>species</b> were simulated.

40|$|Continuous {{desertification}} of arable lands mandates use of {{low quality}} / saline water for irrigation, especially in regions experiencing water shortage. Using low quality / saline water for irrigation imposes more stress on {{plants that are}} already under stress in these regions. Thus, a logical solution will be to find a salt / <b>drought-tolerant</b> plant <b>species</b> that will survive/sustain under such stressful conditions. As the native plants are already growing under such conditions and are adapted to these stresses, they are most suitable for use under these harsh arid environmental conditions.

Selective effects of extremes suggests that appropriate traits to withstand extremes, {{or the ability to}} modulate traits, may increase the competitive advantage and survival of a species. We tested how multiple extreme events affect riparian plant performance, and whether this relates to intraspecific trait variation. We hypothesised that species tolerant to extreme environmental conditions would show highest intraspecific trait variation. We conducted a greenhouse experiment where 25 wet to <b>drought-tolerant</b> <b>species</b> (grasses and herbs) were subjected to single and double 10 day drought and inundation events, and all combinations thereof. We measured plant performance and multiple traits. Performance was severely reduced, with clear synergistic, non-additive effects of extreme events. Adverse effects were stronger for wet-tolerant than <b>drought-tolerant</b> <b>species</b> and for grasses than herbs. Three traits were identified as predictors of species responses to extremes. Despite known trait variation for these species, no variation occurred under these conditions, indicating that responses are difficult to explain from impacts of mean environmental conditions.

The Ordos plateau is a unique ecotone and is a focal region for the {{campaign}} to reduce or reverse desertification in China. This paper explores the relationship between vegetation and environmental gradients on the Ordos plateau based on a field survey of species distribution, vegetation distribution patterns, plant community structure, ecophysiological properties, and soil water content along an environmental gradient. The vegetation on the Ordos plateau may be divided into three types from east to west: steppe (eastern part), desert steppe (middle part) and steppe desert (western part). From east to west, precipitation declines significantly (from 400 mm to 150 mm). The spatial distribution pattern of vegetation at different sites was random. The density of shrub islands decreased from east to west, and their height and diameter were negatively correlated with precipitation. From east to west, the transpiration rate increased as temperature increased.

Water-use efficiency was positively correlated with average annual precipitation but negatively correlated with increasing percentage of sunshine hours. The results suggest that for effective revegetation, highly <b>drought-tolerant</b> <b>species,</b> such as Caragana tibetica and C. stenophylla, should be used and a lower percentage of vegetation cover expected (30 - 40 %) in the western half of the Ordos plateau.

The interaction of climate change and increasing area burned {{has the potential to}} alter forest composition and community assembly. However, the overall forest response is likely to be influenced by species-specific responses to environmental change and the scale of change in overstory species cover. In this study, we sought to quantify how projected changes in climate and large wildfire size would alter forest communities and carbon (C) dynamics, irrespective of competition from nontree species and potential changes in other fire regimes, across the Sierra Nevada, USA. We used a species-specific, spatially explicit forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) to evaluate forest response to climate-wildfire interactions under historical (baseline) climate and climate projections from three climate models (GFDL, CCSM 3, and CNRM) forced by a medium-high emission scenario (A 2) in combination with corresponding climate-specific large wildfire projections. By late century, we found modest changes in the spatial distribution of dominant species by biomass relative to baseline, but extensive changes in recruitment distribution. Although forest recruitment declined across much of the Sierra, we found that projected climate and wildfire favored the recruitment of more <b>drought-tolerant</b> <b>species</b> over less <b>drought-tolerant</b> <b>species</b> relative to baseline, and this change was greatest at mid-elevations. We also found that projected climate and wildfire decreased tree species richness across {{a large proportion of the}} study area and transitioned more area to a C source, which reduced landscape-level C sequestration potential. Our study, although a conservative estimate, suggests that by late century, forest community distributions may not change as intact units as predicted by biome-based modeling, but are likely to trend toward simplified community composition as communities gradually disaggregate and the least tolerant species are no longer able to establish.

40|$|A {{full-length}} drought-responsive gene Ccrboh, encoding {{the respiratory}} burst oxidase homologue (rboh), was cloned in Citrullus colocynthis, a very <b>drought-tolerant</b> cucurbit <b>species.</b> The robh protein, also named NADPH oxidase, is conserved in plants and animals, and {{functions in the}} production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The Ccrboh gene accumulated in a tissue-specific pattern when C. colocynthis was treated with PEG, abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), or NaCl, while the homologous rboh gene did not show any change in C. lanatus var. lanatus, cultivated watermelon, during drought. Grafting experiments were conducted using C. colocynthis or C. lanatus as the rootstock or scion. Results showed that the rootstock significantly affects gene expression in the scion, and some signals might be transported from the root to the shoot. Ccrboh in C. colocynthis was found to function early during plant development, reaching high mRNA transcript levels 3 d after germination. The subcellular location of Ccrboh was investigated by transient expression of the 35 S::Ccrboh::GFP fusion construct in protoplasts. The result confirmed that Ccrboh is a transmembrane protein.
