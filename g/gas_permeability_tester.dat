40|$|A laboratory, {{field and}} {{numerical}} {{study of the}} changes in <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> which rock salt experiences during deformation is given. The laboratory tests involves <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> and porosity measurements coincident with hydrostatic and triaxial quasi-static, stress-rate controlled compression tests. The permeability and porosity of the as-received samples decrease significantly as a result of hydrostatic loading. These changes are largely irreversible, and are believed to "heal" or return the rock to a condition comparable to its undisturbed state. Deviatoric loading induces a dramatic change in pore structure. The permeability can increase more than 5 orders of magnitude over the initial (healed) state as the samples are loaded. The <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> changes are consistent with flow paths initially developing along the grain boundaries and then along axial secondary tensile cracks. The results from two sets of in situ <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> measurements from the underground workings of the WIPP Facility are given. The results consistently indicate that there is no measurable <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> prior to disturbing the rock by excavation. In the immediate vicinity of an excavation, the <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> can be 5 orders of magnitude greater than the undisturbed permeability. A numerical procedure to predict the in situ permeability is developed {{based on the results of}} the laboratory tests. The stress and strain fields surrounding excavations in rock salt, predicted with an elastoplastic model, are used in a model of <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> based on the equivalent channel model. The zone of the gas permeable rock is predicted well, but the magnitude of the <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> is underpredicted very near excavations. The <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> which develops in situ is principally a result of flow along dilated grain boundaries...|$|R
40|$|Nodule {{nitrogen}} fixation rates are regulated by a mechanism which {{is responsive to}} the rhizosphere oxygen concentration. In some legumes, this oxygen-sensitive mechanism appears to involve changes in the <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> of a diffusion barrier in the nodule cortex. In soybean evidence for such a mechanism has not been found. The purpose {{of this research was}} to make quantitative measurements of soybean nodule <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> to test the hypothesis that soybean nodule <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> is under physiological control and responsive to the rhizosphere oxygen concentration. Intact hydroponically grown soybean plants were exposed to altered rhizosphere oxygen concentrations, and the nodule <b>gas</b> <b>permeability,</b> acetylene reduction and nodule respiration rates were repeatedly assayed. After a change in the external oxygen concentration, nitrogenase activity and nodule respiration rates displayed a short-term transient response after which the values returned to rates similar to those observed under ambient oxygen conditions. In contrast to steady-state nitrogenase activity and nodule respiration, nodule <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> was dramatically affected by the change in oxygen concentration. Decreasing the external oxygen concentration to 0. 1 cubic millimeter per cubic millimeter resulted in a mean increase in nodule <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> of 63 %. Increasing the rhizosphere oxygen concentration resulted in decreased nodule <b>gas</b> <b>permeability.</b> These data are consistent with the hypothesis that soybean nodules are capable of regulating {{nitrogen fixation}} and nodule respiration rates in response to changes in the rhizosphere oxygen concentration and indicate that the regulatory mechanism involves physiological control of the nodule <b>gas</b> <b>permeability...</b>|$|R

This paper reports an extensive experimental research {{on the influence of}} loading condition on the evolution of <b>gas</b> <b>permeability.</b> A cyclic loading scheme under displacement control, which is employed to accelerate the evolution of its microstructure and model the loading condition under real service, is applied on cylinder specimens ϕ 37 u 74 mm dried to constant weight at 60 °C.

40|$|An {{experimental}} characterisation of a {{low permeability}} caprock is first reported. Two different methods are compared to measure the porosity: water imbibition and weighting versus gas (Argon) pycnometry. Water measured porosities appear to systematically underestimate gas measured porosities. A capillary pressure curve is derived from successive equilibrium of samples at imposed relative humidities. The relative <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> is thoroughly measured on the same samples. Gas porosity and effective <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> measurements {{have been carried out}} under different confining pressures. All measured relative <b>gas</b> <b>permeabilities</b> lie on a master curve and present a low critical water saturation beyond which the effective <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> nearly vanishes. In an attempt to model this last feature, the salient properties of the microstructure are extracted from electron microscopy images to propose a micro-macro model of the relative <b>gas</b> <b>permeability.</b> The multi-scale modeling is performed within the framework of random media or so-called continuum micromechanics, including localised flow effects within interfaces.

Al 2 O 3 thin films are deposited on paper substrates, prepared with different fiber sizes, to improve their barrier properties.

The analysis of the results has allowed us to identify the limiting conditions (water saturation and hydrostatic stress) for the apparition of a hydraulic cut-off, also called the “permeability jail”. Dry <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> at low confining pressure (5 MPa) has appeared to be a good indicator of the sensitivity of a sample to both hydraulic stress and liquid saturation.

Four mixtures were made, each with a different FA replacement level- 0, 35, 50 and 67 %-but with the same water-to-cementitious materials ratio. A vacuum saturation technique and a gas permeation experiment indicate that both porosity and <b>gas</b> <b>permeability</b> increase with increasing FA content. A reduction is noticed between 1 and 3 months for the FA mixtures owing to the pozzolanic reaction.

Another approach is to use ‘the approximate method’ which uses self-diffusivities of gases to predict <b>gas</b> <b>permeabilities</b> of MOF membranes.
