5|$|Delaroche's {{attention}} to detail and literal precision <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> evidences and demonstrates the slow but steady evolution of realism in art during the 19th century, and how its popularity began to rise.|$|E
5|$|The textural hues and {{schemes that}} Delaroche uses <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> are quite {{detailed}} and well considered, especially {{in regards to}} the most important figures; such aspects of the work were described as being '...rendered with a fidelity that has not omitted the plait of a drapery, the shaggy texture of the four-footed animal, nor a detail of the harness on his back'.|$|E
5|$|In {{the smaller}} painting, Mary averts {{her eyes and}} folds her hands in a gesture that symbolised {{submission}} to God's will. Mary is not submissive, however, in the larger piece. The girl, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman appears to accept her role as the Mother of God, not with resignation but with confidence. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting,</b> the young Leonardo presents the humanist face of the Virgin Mary, recognising humanity's role in God's incarnation.|$|E

5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting,</b> Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (I Can See the Whole Room... and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{attempted}} {{for more than}} a century to understand who is portrayed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting.</b> Earlier proposals that the subject was John III Sobieski (who would have been eight years old in 1637) or Stephen Bathory (who died in 1586) have been discredited. According to Otakar Odložilík, while the man in the painting is clearly wearing Polish garb, it is neither certain who he is, nor whether he is a Pole. Odložilík's research on this issue suggested that the painting may be that of Andrzej Rej, a Polish noble and diplomat of that era who passed through Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where Rembrandt was working, at the time the painting was created. Nonetheless, without any documents from that era clearly acknowledging that fact, as Odložilík noted, it may never be known for certain who the subject really is.|$|E
5|$|The Third of May {{is cited}} as an {{influence}} on Pablo Picasso's 1937 Guernica, which shows {{the aftermath of the}} Nazi German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. An exhibition in 2006 at the Prado and the Reina Sofía showed The Third of May, Guernica, and the Execution of the Emperor Maximilian in the same room. Also in the room was Picasso's Massacre in Korea, painted in 1951 during the Korean War—an even more direct reference to the composition of The Third of May. The perpetrators <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> were intended to be the United States Army or their United Nations allies.|$|E

25|$|The {{garden of}} the Hesperides in Greek mythology was {{somewhat}} similar to the Christian concept of the Garden of Eden, and by the 16th century a larger intellectual association {{was made in the}} Cranach painting (see illustration at top). <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting,</b> only the action that takes place there identifies the setting as distinct from the Garden of the Hesperides, with its golden fruit.|$|E
25|$|Piero della Francesca {{carried his}} study of light further. In the Flagellation he {{demonstrates}} a knowledge of how light is proportionally disseminated from its point of origin. There are two sources of light <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting,</b> one internal to a building and the other external. Of the internal source, though the light itself is invisible, its position can be calculated with mathematical certainty. Leonardo da Vinci was to carry forward Piero's work on light.|$|E

25|$|Domenico di Bartolo's Madonna of humility, {{painted in}} 1433, was {{described}} by art historian Andrew Ladis {{as one of the}} most innovative devotional images from the early Renaissance. The formal symmetry of the strips below her feet and those hovering above her express the symbolic duality of her nature: an earthly woman, as well as a heavenly queen. Despite the low seating position, the star and the gems as well as the halo signify her regal status. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting,</b> which is at the Pinoteca Nazionale in Siena, Domenico does not use cast shadows as he does in other works such as the Madonna Enthroned.|$|E
25|$|Zoffany {{went to see}} a play at Covent Garden {{concerning}} the death of Captain Cook who had been killed in Hawaii on his third voyage to find the North-West Passage in 1779. This is thought to have inspired him to paint the death of Cook at the hand of the Hawaiian natives. Cook had been given a mahiole (feathered helmet) and a feather cloak which was given to the Leverian Museum. Zoffany borrowed these as props for the construction of the painting which was not intended to be accurate and included poses that were taken from classic statues. This helmet remained in Sir Ashton Lever's collection, which was originally housed in Leicester Square. The feathered helmet that had been given to Cook and included <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> is now in a museum in Vienna.|$|E
25|$|Degas's style {{reflects}} his deep {{respect for the}} old masters (he was an enthusiastic copyist well into middle age) and his great admiration for Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Eugène Delacroix. He was also a collector of Japanese prints, whose compositional principles influenced his work, as did the vigorous realism of popular illustrators such as Daumier and Gavarni. Although famous for horses and dancers, Degas began with conventional historical paintings such as The Daughter of Jephthah (c.1859–61) and The Young Spartans (c.1860–62), in which his gradual progress toward a less idealized treatment of the figure is already apparent. During his early career, Degas also painted portraits of individuals and groups; {{an example of the}} latter is The Bellelli Family (c.1858–67), a brilliantly composed and psychologically poignant portrayal of his aunt, her husband, and their children. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting,</b> as in The Young Spartans and many later works, Degas was drawn to the tensions present between men and women. In his early paintings, Degas already evidenced the mature style that he would later develop more fully by cropping subjects awkwardly and by choosing unusual viewpoints.|$|E

500|$|For Foucault, Las Meninas {{illustrates}} {{the first signs}} of a new episteme, or way of thinking. It represents a midpoint between what he sees as the two [...] "great discontinuities" [...] in European thought, the classical and the modern: [...] "Perhaps there exists, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> by Velázquez, the representation as it were of Classical representation, and the definition of the space it opens up to us... representation, freed finally from the relation that was impeding it, can offer itself as representation in its pure form." ...|$|E
500|$|There is a {{proof that}} Aurangzeb {{continued}} the Mughal practice of Jharokha Darshan {{in a painting}} dated 1710 {{in which he is}} shown at the jharokha with two noblemen in attendance in the foreground. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting,</b> the emperor is painted in a side profile and has a white jama (upper garment) attire adorned with a turban in a background of blue colour. In 1670, Hindus had assembled at the jharokha to protest against the jizya tax imposed on them by Aurangzeb. However, Aurangzeb who was a [...] "puritanical" [...] and practiced strict Islamic codes of conduct in his [...] personal life, stopped this practice on the basis that it was idolization of human beings.|$|E
500|$|A visitor was {{so moved}} by George he felt {{compelled}} to express his gratitude for its display in the Dedham Community Theatre basement, writing [...] "Someone had slipped into the bathroom as I took <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> and began peeing loudly into a toilet. The reverberating sound of urine splashing while viewing George brought the painting to life, and when the denouement of the flush sounded, I wept." [...] MOBA's accompanying caption introduces questions and observations: [...] "Can the swirling steam melt away the huge weight of George's corporate responsibilities? This pointillist piece is curious for meticulous attention to fine detail, such as the stitching {{around the edge of}} the towel, in contrast to the almost careless disregard for the subject's feet." ...|$|E

500|$|In Las Hilanderas, {{probably}} {{painted the}} year after Las Meninas, two different scenes from Ovid are shown: one in contemporary dress in the foreground, and the other partly in antique dress, played before a tapestry on {{the back wall of}} a room behind the first. According to the critic Sira Dambe, [...] "aspects of representation and power are addressed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> in ways closely connected with their treatment in Las Meninas". In a series of portraits of the late 1630s and 1640s—all now in the Prado—Velázquez painted clowns {{and other members of the}} royal household posing as gods, heroes, and philosophers; the intention is certainly partly comic, at least for those in the know, but in a highly ambiguous way.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's {{analysis}} of the painting emphasises {{the relationship between the}} representation of geographical sites in the Yuendumu region and the dreaming stories associated with those sites. She concludes that there is [...] "a topographic rationale for the order in which the Dreamings appear from left to right (that is, east to west) across the painting [...] the transverse Dreaming trails". However, beyond this general principle, she argues that the layout of symbols and images is influenced by the desire to present a symmetrical work. There is greater visual symmetry <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting</b> than in its 1976 predecessor; symmetry is a strong influence in the works of many of the early Western Desert artists, including Clifford Possum, Billy Stockman Tjapaltjarri and Kaapa Tjampitjinpa.|$|E
500|$|Artists of the 18th and 19th centuries {{striving to}} evoke republican ideals {{commonly}} used representations of Libertas as an allegorical symbol. [...] A figure of Liberty was also depicted on the Great Seal of France. [...] However, Bartholdi and Laboulaye avoided {{an image of}} revolutionary liberty such as that depicted in Eugène Delacroix's famed Liberty Leading the People (1830). <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>painting,</b> which commemorates France's Revolution of 1830, a half-clothed Liberty leads an armed mob over {{the bodies of the}} fallen. Laboulaye had no sympathy for revolution, and so Bartholdi's figure would be fully dressed in flowing robes. Instead of the impression of violence in the Delacroix work, Bartholdi wished to give the statue a peaceful appearance and chose a torch, representing progress, for the figure to hold.|$|E
