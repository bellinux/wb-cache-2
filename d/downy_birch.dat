5|$|B. pendula is {{distinguished}} from the related <b>downy</b> <b>birch</b> (B. pubescens, the other common European birch) in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in <b>downy</b> <b>birch),</b> more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in <b>downy</b> <b>birch),</b> and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in <b>downy</b> <b>birch).</b> It is also distinguished cytologically, silver birch being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas <b>downy</b> <b>birch</b> is tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being triploid, are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with silver birch found mainly on dry, sandy soils, and <b>downy</b> <b>birch</b> more common on wet, poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs. Silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does <b>downy</b> <b>birch,</b> which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch's alternative vernacular name 'white birch', with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.|$|E

5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and spruce forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (Norway maple), Betula pendula (silver birch), Carpinus betulus (common hornbeam), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender sedge), Carex rostrata (bottle sedge), Lysimachia thyrsiflora (tufted loosestrife) and Sphagnum angustifolium (fine bogmoss). At Mohos, vegetation consists of Alnus glutinosa (common alder), Betula pendula and Salix. The peat bog contains trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens (<b>downy</b> <b>birch))</b> and Ericaceae.|$|E

30|$|The {{number and}} canopy cover of hazel shrubs were {{evaluated}} separately for hazels lower than 4  m and taller than 4  m. The cover of selected {{plants in the}} ground vegetation layer was visually estimated at randomly located 10 [*]×[*] 10 -m squares in each transect. During the evaluation process, the following canopy-forming tree species were recorded: Norway spruce, silver and <b>downy</b> <b>birches</b> B. pendula and B. pubescens, grey and black alders, pedunculate oak, ash, aspen, willow Salix spp. (mostly Salix caprea, but also Salix cinerea and Salix myrsinifolia), small-leaved lime, Scotch pine Pinus sylvestris, Wych and field elms Ulmus glabra and Ulmus minor, Norway maple Acer platanoides, wild apple Malus sylvestris, common buckthorn Rhamnus cathartica, and common hornbeam Carpinus betulus. Understory species recorded were hazel, glossy buckthorn, bird cherry, rowan, dwarf honeysuckle, European spindle Euonymus europaeus, blackcurrant Ribes nigrum, red elderberry Sambucus racemosa, and mezereon Daphne mezereum.|$|R
50|$|Forest {{landscapes of}} the Urals are diverse, {{especially}} in the southern part. The western areas are dominated by dark coniferous taiga forests which change to mixed and deciduous forests in the south. The eastern mountain slopes have light coniferous taiga forests. The Northern Urals are dominated by conifers, namely Siberian fir, Siberian pine, Scots pine, Siberian spruce, Norway spruce and Siberian larch, {{as well as by}} silver and <b>downy</b> <b>birches.</b> The forests are much sparser in the Polar Urals. Whereas {{in other parts of the}} Ural Mountains they grow up to an altitude of 1000 m, in the Polar Urals the tree line is at 250-400 m. The polar forests are low and are mixed with swamps, lichens, bogs and shrubs. Dwarf birch, mosses and berries (blueberry, cloudberry, black crowberry, etc.) are abundant. The forests of the Southern Urals are the most diverse in composition: here, together with coniferous forests are also abundant broadleaf tree species such as English oak, Norway maple and elm. The Virgin Komi Forests in the northern Urals are recognized as a World Heritage site.|$|R
5|$|The lower {{areas of}} the {{wilderness}} area are covered by a taiga forest of Scots pine. Less common trees include <b>downy</b> <b>birch,</b> goat willow, aspen and rowan. Logging {{in the past has}} mostly occurred in the southern part ("Kessi"), a large proportion of Vätsäri's forests being old-growth forests. The barren soil makes for poor growth conditions and most of the ground vegetation in the forests is subshrubs. One area with limestone rock features green spleenwort. The reserve is located in an area between a western and eastern vegetation zones, giving rise to unique combinations of species, such as Siberian spruce and red cottongrass.|$|E
5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from the bark of trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the <b>downy</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pubescens).|$|E
5|$|The larvae of a {{large number}} of species of butterflies, moths and other insects feed on the leaves and other parts of the silver birch. In Germany, almost 500 species of insect have been found on silver and <b>downy</b> <b>birch</b> {{including}} 106 beetles and 105 lepidopterans, with 133 insect species feeding almost exclusively on birch. Birch dieback disease can affect planted trees, while naturally regenerated trees seem less susceptible. This disease also affects Betula pubescens and in 2000 was reported at many of the sites planted with birch in Scotland during the 1990s. In the United States, the wood is attacked by the bronze birch borer (Agrilus anxius), an insect pest to which it has no natural resistance.|$|E

40|$|THESIS 7215 The {{majority}} of Irish forests are plantations of exotic conifer species, with semi-natural woodlands occupying less than 1 % of Ireland. Recent land-use changes, {{in particular the}} expansion of National Parks and Nature Reserves, provide opportunities {{for the restoration of}} native woodlands to areas formerly occupied by conifer plantations. Woodland restoration, however, has received little research attention in Ireland. The main objectives of this project are; i) to determine in what situations natural succession will be sufficient to establish native woodlands, and ii) to identify where more intensive management options, such as tree planting, will be successful. Twenty-one pairs of 400 m 2 permanent plots were established in or near the Wicklow Mountains and Killarney National Parks. One plot of each pair was fenced to exclude large herbivores. In each plot, vegetation was surveyed in eleven Im" quadrats, and the growth and survival of 72 planted sessile oaks (Quercus petraea) and <b>downy</b> <b>birches</b> (Betula pubescens) and also of naturally regenerating trees was measured annually over three years. Vegetation development was slow over the first few years after felling, but older clearfelled sites developed fairly stable heath vegetation. Acid grassland developed on clearfells with better soils, while rush-dominated communities occurred on wet soils. Early vegetation development was strongly influenced by the soil seed bank, but large herbivores appeared to have little effect...|$|R
50|$|Spruce woods {{thrive in}} the highest {{locations}} from about 800 m to the tree line at around 1,000 m above sea level. These woods are also home to some deciduous trees such as rowan, silver and <b>downy</b> <b>birches</b> (Betula pendula and Betula pubescens) and willows (Salix spec.). Conditions of high humidity foster an environment rich in mosses and lichens. In spite of the near-natural habitat {{there are only a}} few, indigenous, genetically adapted (autochthone) spruce trees. Wood-reed spruce woods dominate. A well developed ground vegetation thrives on their moderately rocky and fresh, but certainly not wet, soils, characterised in appearance especially by grasses such as shaggy wood-reed (Calamagrostis villosa) and wavy hair-grass (Avenella flexuosa). The soils in the higher regions are, as in most of the Harz, comparatively poor in nutrients and bases, so that only a few herbaceous plants occur here, such as heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile). For that reason it is more the ferns, mosses, lichens and fungi that, in addition to spruce trees, characterise these woods. Boulders and stone runs occur in the areas of weather-resistant rock in the high (alti-)montane and montane zones - these are extreme habitats for vegetation. Due to the lack of soil material, only weak, straggly, very open spruce woods thrive here. They have an especially high variety of trees and allow more room of light-loving species such as silver birch, rowan, sycamore, willow and dwarf bushes such as the blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus). Mosses and ferns are also common here. One unusual species is the Carpathian birch (Betula pubescens subsp. carpatica). Bog-spruce woods are found around the raised bogs on marshy and boggy soils. In these sorts of places spruce woods can, in exceptional cases, also form the natural woodland in lower down the mountains. These wet, moorland woods have a high proportion of peat mosses (Sphagnum spec.). The ground vegetation may also have a rich proliferation of low bushes such as cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). Clumps of purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) are also typical of this type of woodland habitat. The characteristic species of fungi in natural spruce woods are Phellinus viticola and prunes and custard (Tricholomopsis decora).Ravine (Schluchtwald), riparian (Auwald) and river source (Quellwald) woods only occur in small areas. In these places the common beech gives way to hardier deciduous species such as sycamore, large-leaved lime (Tilia platyphyllos), Scots elm or ash. The herbaceous layer {{is similar to that of}} the better-nourished beech woods. Notable species amongst the plant communities here include the Alpine blue-sow-thistle (Cicerbita alpina), perennial honesty (Lunaria rediviva), hard shield fern (Polystichum aculeatum) and long beech fern (Phegopteris connectilis).|$|R
25|$|Riparian and marshlands {{along the}} river courses are also sites of rare species of chain ferns (Woodwardia radicans), willow (Salix repens), <b>downy</b> <b>birch</b> (Betula pubescens), {{deciduous}} shrubs (Spiraea hypericifolia), Portuguese enchanter's nightshade (Circaea lusitanica) and angelica herbs (Angelica laevis).|$|E
25|$|The nature {{varies from}} barren coastal areas facing the Barents Sea, to more {{sheltered}} fjord areas and river valleys with gullies and tree vegetation.

25|$|Banks of {{the river}} used to contain groves of trees, which were cut during the 18th–19th centuries. Some of the trees were used for {{shipbuilding}} during the Russian-Turkish wars {{in the time of}} Peter I. By the 20th century, most meadows along the river banks were converted into farmers' fields. Only {{a small part of the}} old groves remains, mainly in the Kharkiv Oblast. North of Izium, there are still broadleaf forests, and pine forests are found near Chuhuiv. Many species of wild plants survive near floodplain wetlands. These include willow, <b>downy</b> <b>birch,</b> alder and krushinnik. Along the river banks, there are cane, swamp horsetail, carex, kizlyak, swamp sabelnik and other types of grass.|$|E
