40|$|Commercial feed {{blending}} is {{a complex}} process consisting of many potential raw ingredi-ents and <b>final</b> <b>products.</b> The sheer number of daily orders and <b>final</b> <b>products</b> at a typical feed mill means that raw ingredients cannot be mixed to directly produce <b>final</b> <b>products</b> in an economical fashion. As a result, the intermediate production of pellets with prespecified nutritional content is a necessity that makes the feed blending problem highly nonlinear. We discuss a nonlinear approach to feed blending and compare results from an empirical application to those from a sequential linear programming approach common to most feed mills. Modern U. S. commercial feed mills that blend feed for sale to agricultural op-erations {{are engaged in a}} complex production process consisting of many potential raw ingredients and <b>final</b> <b>products.</b> The typical feed mill likely produces and delivers feed for poultry (turkeys and broilers), swine, beef cattle, and dairy operations. 1 Each of these operations requires several types of feed rations since they are typically designed around the nutritional requirements of animals in var-ious stages of growth or production. For example, a lactating dairy cow requires a different feed ration than a bred heifer and a just weaned pig requires a different feed ration than a hog approaching market weight. Although feed ration balancing is a prototype-blending problem found in many introductory linear programming (LP) textbooks (for example, Paris or Taylor), there are many reasons why strict application of the model is not used at feed mills. First, the sheer number of <b>final</b> <b>products</b> produced in conjunction with multiple daily orders of varying sizes, means that raw ingredients cannot be mixed to directly produce <b>final</b> <b>products</b> in an economical or practical manner. Also, storage and other production-capacity constraints limit the usefulness of such a basic approach.

These intermediate products, called pellets, typically possess nutritional characteristics (or at leas...|$|R
