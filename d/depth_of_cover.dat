50|$|According {{to recent}} reviews on the subject, {{adequate}} protection against gouging activity may {{be achieved through}} pipeline burial. Placing the pipeline in Zone 3 would be the safest option, but the costs for this option are deemed prohibitive. Instead, current design philosophy envisages pipe location within Zone 2, which is still below the gouge depth, but where the soil is expected to move {{as a result of}} a gouging event above it. This implies that the pipeline must undergo a certain amount of bending and consequent deformation, or strain, of the pipeline wall. For the currently operating North Star production site, “the minimum pipeline <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> (original undisturbed seabed to top of pipe) to resist ice keel loads was calculated based on limit state design procedures for pipe bending”. For that particular site, “predicted seabed soil displacements beneath the maximum ice keel gouge depth (3.5 ft) yielded a 7-ft minimum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> for pipe bending strains up to 1.4%”.|$|E
40|$|The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC) {{is the new}} Canadian design {{standard}} for bridge structures over three metres in span. Soil-steel structures fall {{into the category of}} buried structures, which is the subject of Section 7 of the Code. Soil-steel structures have been in existence for over 100 years. A variety of design methods were developed during that period, each improving on the one before. Most of the soil-steel structure design methods used prior to the CHBDC were based on working stress, while the new CHBDC is based on the limit states design method developed for the Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code (OHBDC). The CHBDC also includes a specific check of strength requirements during construction which was not in the OHBDC. This part of the design method replaces the flexibility factor check of the previous design methods. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to: review the historic design methods used for soil-steel structures, provide a detailed description of the philosophies used in the CHBDC and AISI (American Iron and Steel Institute) methods, including a description of the critical differences between the methods, and report on a comparison of design results using the two methods. In order to compare design results from the two methods, a range of structure shapes and sizes were evaluated for numerous <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover.</b> The study was limited to the 152 mm x 51 mm corrugation profile. Assumptions were required such that the comparison of methods using different design philosophies (working stress, limit states) are realistic. In general, the CHBDC results in more liberal designs for shallow <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> and more conservative designs for large <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover.</b> However, the differences between the methods compared are relatively small for the shorter span structures under mid-range <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> combined with normal highway loading. 1. ...|$|R

When all of the defined criteria have not been fulfilled simultaneously, the depth of soil cover above the crown was increased, and the analyses were then restarted for a new <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover.</b> The minimum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> in which all of the criteria were simultaneously fulfilled {{was chosen as the}} minimum depth of soil cover for a specific bridge structure.|$|E

30|$|As {{a result}} of the various {{numerical}} analyses and satisfying the aforementioned criteria, the minimum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> was evaluated against the span of railway box and low-profile arch bridges using various panel types (stiffness) and with respect to the permissible settlement criterion. A brief review of these data demonstrates that the trends of the minimum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> for box bridges differ from that of the low-profile arches. This is due to the different structural geometry of the boxes which results in a different mechanism of behavior under load. Thus, to ease the process of finding the new pattern of minimum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover,</b> the data have been separately categorized for boxes and low-profile arches in the following step.|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that an {{equation}} is not given in the CHBDC and AASHTO for the minimum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> of box culverts. Only a minimum of 0.3 m and a maximum of 1.5 m are specified in the CHBDC (2006) and AASHTO Highway Bridges (2000), respectively. By accounting for the buckling criterion of the railway box bridges, a minimum of 0.6 m (called the bending limit) was obtained for the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover,</b> which is indicated by the dashed lines in Figure  11.|$|E
30|$|Because a {{large number}} of {{calculations}} (considering geometry and panel types, different <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover,</b> axle loads, and loading patterns) were required to determine the preliminary new pattern of the minimum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover,</b> a 2 D idealization was initially used to reduce the computing power and time required to perform the analyses.

30|$|From {{the results}} {{shown in the}} table, the {{equations}} are applicable for panels I to V for boxes and low-profile arches because the R 2 values are greater than 0.85.

30|$|Soil-steel bridges are {{categorized}} as composite structures and {{are composed of}} corrugated steel plates buried in engineered soil materials. One of the failure modes for these bridges can be initiated by shear or tension failure in the soil cover and can result in structural buckling due to an inadequate <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> soil above the metal structure. This mode of failure is often avoided in the design codes by specifying a minimum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>cover.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{finite element}} analysis, {{by means of}} ABAQUS, has been {{undertaken}} to {{study the effects of}} inserting geogrid layers in the soil <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> a circular soil-steel bridge with a diameter of 7. 6 m. Two loads are applied to the soil-steel bridge: gravity, as well as a truck load defined by the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code design truck. Because experimentation and design of geogrids involve the application of a strip load, it is necessary to apply a strip load at the soil surface. Therefore, the rear two axles of the truck, separated by 1. 2 m, are the largest loads of the truck and are converted into a strip load in order to model the strip load utilized for study of geogrids. The study analyzed different <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> above the flexible pipe, with unreinforced and reinforced soil cover. Geogrids are placed in soil in order to increase the bearing capacity of the soil. It is expected that the geogrid will increase the load carrying capacity of the soil-steel bridge. Thus, various geogrid layers are placed in the specified <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> over the flexible pipe. Two types of strip loading, concentric and eccentric, will be applied, and each was applied until failure of the soil occurs. Concentric load is defined as the strip load applied at the soil surface where the centre of the strip load is directly above the crown of the pipe. Eccentric load is defined by the strip load applied at the soil surface offset a horizontal distance from the crown of the pipe. Soil behaviour due to the failure load, defined by vertical and horizontal displacements and shear stresses of the soil, are presented for the two types of load cases for the unreinforced and reinforced soil cover above the circular soil-steel bridge. Also, factors of safety are presented, defined by the failure strip load divided by the applied truck strip load from the design code. Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

3000|$|However, in the OHBDC (1992), the {{empirical}} formulas for the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> were modified {{based on the}} results of a finite element (FE) analysis that considered the geometric shape of the metal structure and the axle load of a truck (Hafez and Abdel-Sayed 1983). Furthermore, the minimum required <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> Hmin in the third edition of the OHBDC (1992) and in the current Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC 2006) has been specified as the greater of 0.6 m or D h / 6 ((D h /D v [...]) 0.5) with a maximum of 1.5 m, where D h [...] and D v [...] are the effective span and rise of the metal structure, respectively CSPI and AISI (2002; CHBDC 2006). This empirical-based formula is commonly used to calculate the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>cover</b> for highway and railway bridges (Abdel-Sayed and Salib 2002; Hafez 1981). An analytical formula has not yet been established specifically for the minimum cover depth of railway bridges although several structural studies have been done on dynamic and static behaviors of soil-steel structures (Flener et al. 2005; Flener and Karoumi 2009; Manko and Beben 2005; Manko and Beben 2008).|$|E

Therefore, two types of exponential, one type of polynomial, and one type of power trend line were examined as follows: (1) exponential trend line {{as a function of the}} effective span (D h [...]); (2) power trend line as a function of the effective span (D h [...]); (3) exponential trend line as a function of D h /D v [...] (D v [...] effective rise of the structure); and (4) polynomial trend line as a function of D h /D v [...].
