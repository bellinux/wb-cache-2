5|$|The woman wakes, sits up, {{looks at}} Sigurd, {{and the two}} {{converse}} in two stanzas of verse. In the second stanza, the woman explains that Odin placed a sleeping spell on <b>her</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not break, and due to that spell she has been asleep a long time. Sigurd asks for her name, and the woman gives Sigurd a horn of mead to help him retain her words in his memory. The woman recites a heathen prayer in two stanzas. A prose narrative explains that the woman is named Sigrdrífa and {{that she is a}} valkyrie.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-four {{hours after}} his arrest, King {{was allowed to}} see local {{attorneys}} from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home {{after the birth of}} their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told <b>her</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.|$|E
5|$|Chrissie {{plans to}} sell the pub to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and a mystery second buyer, and flee the country, {{although}} Phil and Grant Mitchell try to taunt her. Chrissie though, is unfazed, as Sharon still supports her – however, Grant finally convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison. Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an innocuous, but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught as she felt that so long as Sharon, Den's daughter, thought well of <b>her,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> think well of herself. Panicking, she begins to make mistakes, arguing with Jake outside of Johnny's club. Chrissie had confessed her role in Den's death to Jake, and lets information regarding her guilt slip as they argue. This is caught on CCTV by Johnny, who delights in telling Jake {{that he has a}} recording. Chrissie asks to get the money for The Queen Victoria right away, and Johnny takes advantage, saying the only way she will get the money is if she sleeps with him. Chrissie resists, saying that she will not hurt Jake. Johnny tells her that she will not receive the money, and tells Phil and Grant about the tape.|$|E

5|$|Historian Ban Zhao (45116 CE) {{wrote in}} her Lessons for Women that, like the {{opposite}} and complementary forces of yin and yang, men's great virtues were strength and rigidity, while a woman's great virtues were respect and compliance. Throughout her life, a Han woman was to bend {{to the will of}} first her father, then her husband, and then her adult son (三從四德). However, there are many recorded deviations from this rule, as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments with their husbands over concubines (sometimes beating concubines out of jealousy and to punish the husband), wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials, and sometimes husbands turned to their wives for advice on political affairs of the court. When a father died, the eldest son was theoretically the senior member of the family, yet as hinted in various works of Han literature, they still had to obey the will of their mother and she could even force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense. Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially pronounced in the imperial family. The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives (even her father) and if they disobeyed <b>her,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> publicly reprimand and humiliate them.|$|E
25|$|A daughter's {{estate was}} usually managed for {{her by her}} brothers, but if they {{dissatisfied}} <b>her,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> appoint a steward. If she married, her husband then managed it. Sons also appear to have received their share on marriage, but then did not always leave their father's house; they might bring their wives there. This was usual in child marriages.|$|E
25|$|Dickinson {{returned}} to the small screen in March 1974 for an episode of the critically acclaimed hit anthology series Police Story. The guest appearance proved to be so popular, NBC offered Dickinson her own television show, which became a ground-breaking weekly series called Police Woman; {{it was the first}} successful dramatic TV series to feature a woman in the title role. At first, Dickinson was reluctant, but when producers told <b>her</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> become a household name, she accepted the role. They were right.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} scandal {{occurred}} on Easter Sunday in 1768, in which Sade procured {{the services of}} a woman, Rose Keller, a widow-beggar who approached him for alms. He told <b>her</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make money by working for him—she understood her work to be that of a housekeeper. At his chateau at Arcueil, Sade ripped her clothes off, threw her on a divan and tied her by the four limbs, face-down, so that she could not see behind her. Then he whipped her. Keller testified that he made various incisions on her body into which he poured hot wax, although investigators found no broken skin on Keller, and Sade explained that he had applied ointment to her after the whipping. Keller finally escaped by climbing out of a second-floor window and running away. At this time, la Présidente, Sade's mother-in-law, obtained a lettre de cachet (a royal order of arrest and imprisonment, without stated cause or access to the courts) from the King, excluding Sade from the jurisdiction of the courts. The lettre de cachet would later prove disastrous for the marquis.|$|E

After ordering room service from {{the concierge}} in broken French, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell <b>her</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> come, the man consents nevertheless.

She asked Kaukolampi to work on the album, and he produced nine of its songs for <b>her.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not afford to rent a studio, so Annie recorded demos by asking to use local studios at night or borrowing one owned by her friend. In late 2003, Annie signed with 679 Recordings, and the advance enabled her to complete the record. Producer Richard X, impressed with [...] "The Greatest Hit", asked her to record vocals for his debut album Richard X Presents His X-Factor Vol. 1. In exchange, he contributed [...] "Chewing Gum" [...] and [...] "Me Plus One", both written with Hannah Robinson. Annie also worked with Röyksopp, who co-wrote and produced three songs on the album.|$|E

500|$|Brown's {{trial began}} in Naha on May 26 with {{testimony}} from V. N.. Over {{the next three}} days of testimony, V. N. repeatedly stated that Brown was innocent and that she wanted to withdraw her complaint. She said that any contact between her and Brown on the night in question was consensual and that she allowed Brown to fondle and kiss her breasts. At that point, V. N. said, she began to resist and Brown became angry. V. N. testified that when she threatened to call police, Brown threw her cell phone into the [...] river. Angry at the loss of her cell phone, V. N. stated that she then embellished the story when she told it to the guards at the Courtney main gate. V. N. further claimed that she had been coerced by police, prosecutors and her employer, a local agency that provides temporary workers for USMC bases on Okinawa, to file the charges. She said that once the charges were filed, Japanese prosecutors told <b>her</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only withdraw the charges in court. One of the Naha judges then asked V. N. why she was not angry at Brown to which V. N. replied, [...] "Because he didn't attempt to rape me. Before, I was angry at him for throwing away my cell phone. But not now." ...|$|E
500|$|In Borissik, the {{applicant}} {{and her husband}} were joint owners of a semi-detached house with a plot size of around [...] which was attached to another semi-detached house with a plot size of around [...] In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) revised its guidelines for the redevelopment of semi-detached houses, now permitting a semi-detached house to be converted to a detached house if and only if both the semi-detached plot and its adjoining semi-detached plot each had a size of at least [...] On the basis of this guideline, the URA rejected the application submitted by {{the applicant}} and her husband to demolish their semi-detached house {{and replace it with a}} detached house. Dissatisfied, the applicant applied for a mandatory order for approval to be granted. One of her arguments was that she had a legitimate expectation that her proposal would be approved on the basis of the old guidelines; in other words, she sought fulfilment of a substantive legitimate expectation. In the end, the High Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to <b>her.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> neither show that any person with actual or ostensible authority had made any promise to her, nor that the URA's officers had acted in a way to lead her to have a legitimate expectation that her redevelopment plans would be approved. Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong has cautioned against reading the case as an implicit acknowledgement that legitimate expectations can be substantively enforced. He noted that [...] "there is good reason for judges in Singapore to tread carefully, stepping gingerly on each stone in crossing the river".|$|E
2500|$|Further extrasensory {{communication}} ensued. The automatic writing {{gradually became}} easier and the handwriting became {{that of her}} mother's.

[...] Vera had struggled to correct this having been repeatedly told at school that such penmanship was [...] "a sign of bad character". But {{no matter how often}} school masters implored <b>her,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not remedy matters.

It was while playing at the Servicemen's Club at Piarco that someone bet <b>her</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not play something in the boogie-woogie style that was popular back home in the United States.

Of the characters, Roger Ebert said [...] " [...] are so thin, they're transparent" [...] but praised Campbell's appearance saying [...] "The camera loves <b>her.</b> <b>She</b> <b>could</b> become a really big star and then giggle at clips from this film at her AFI tribute".

2500|$|By contrast, Genie {{never used}} any {{automatic}} speech or interjections during conversations. Despite repeated efforts to teach <b>her</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not start an interaction with automatic speech, and she only responded to ritual questions, such as [...] "How are you?", if someone repeatedly asked her {{and pushed her}} into doing so; [...] she then could say [...] "How are you?" [...] or [...] "I am fine", {{but it would be}} very forced. The only exception was when the person speaking to her had some additional affect, after which she usually laughed or tried to get the person to do it again. In addition, Genie never learned any profanity nor ever used other substitute swear words. These aspects of speech are typically either bilateral or originate in the right hemisphere, and split-brain and hemispherectomy patients normally learn them without difficulty, but linguists were unsurprised that Genie never used them. Curtiss wrote that Genie's failure to do so was because her childhood gave her no opportunity to observe conversation, where children typically learn them.|$|E
2500|$|Campbell's first widely {{released}} {{film was}} The Craft (1996).
