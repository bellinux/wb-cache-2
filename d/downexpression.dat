40|$|Abstract Background HER- 2 gene {{testing has}} become an {{integral}} part of breast cancer patient diagnosis. The most commonly used assay in the clinical setting for evaluating HER- 2 status is immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). These procedures permit correlation between HER- 2 expression and morphological features. However, FISH signals are labile and fade over time, making post-revision of the tumor difficult. CISH (chromogenic in situ hybridization) is an alternative procedure, with certain advantages, although still limited as a diagnostic tool in breast carcinomas. Methods To elucidate the molecular profile of HER- 2 status, mRNA and protein expression in 75 invasive breast carcinomas were analyzed by real time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and IHC, respectively. Amplifications were evaluated in 43 of these cases by CISH and in 11 by FISH. Results The concordance rate between IHC and qRT-PCR results was 78. 9 %, and 94. 6 % for qRT-PCR and CISH. Intratumoral heterogeneity of HER- 2 status was identified in three cases by CISH. The results of the three procedures were compared and showed a concordance rate of 83. 8 %; higher discordances were observed in 0 or 1 + immunostaining cases, which showed high-level amplification (15. 4 %) and HER- 2 transcript overexpression (20 %). Moreover, 2 + immunostaining cases presented nonamplified status (50 %) by CISH and HER- 2 <b>downexpression</b> (38. 5 %) by qRT-PCR. In general, concordance occurred between qRT-PCR and CISH results. A high concordance was observed between CISH/qRT-PCR and FISH. Comparisons with clinicopathological data revealed a significant association between HER- 2 <b>downexpression</b> and the involvement of less than four lymph nodes (P = 0. 0350). Conclusion Based on these findings, qRT-PCR was more precise and reproducible than IHC. Furthermore, CISH was revealed as an alternative and useful procedure for investigating amplifications involving the HER- 2 gene. </p...|$|E
40|$|Myelodysplastic {{syndrome}} (MDS) {{is a rare}} hematological malignancy in children. It {{was performed}} FISH analysis in 19 pediatric MDS patients to investigate deletions involving the PPAR gamma and TP 53 genes. Significant losses in the PPAR gamma gene and deletions in the tumor suppressor gene TP 53 were observed in 17 and 18 cases, respectively. Using quantitative RT-PCR, it was detected PPAR gamma transcript <b>downexpression</b> in a subset of these cases. G-banding analysis revealed 17 p deletions in {{a small number of}} these cases. One MDS therapy-related patient had neither a loss of PPAR gamma nor TP 53. These data suggest that the PPAR gamma and TP 53 genes may be candidates for molecular markers in pediatric MDS, and that these potentially recurrent deletions could contribute to the identification of therapeutic approaches in primary pediatric MDS.

40|$|Artemisinin (ART) -based {{combination}} therapies (ACTs) are the first-line drugs—and {{often the}} last treatments—that can effectively cure Plasmodium falciparum infections. Unfortunately, the decreased clinical efficacy of artesunate, {{one of the}} major ART derivatives, was recently reported along the Thailand-Cambodia border. Through long-term artemisinin pressure in vitro, we have obtained an ART-tolerant strain that can survive extremely high doses of ART. We showed that drug pressure could induce a subpopulation of ring stages into developmental arrest, which can explain the ART tolerance in P. falciparum. We also observed interesting transcriptomic modifications possibly associated with the acquisition of ART tolerance. These modifications include the overexpression of heat shock and erythrocyte surface proteins and the <b>downexpression</b> of a cell cycle regulator and a DNA biosynthesis protein. This study highlights a new phenomenon in the Plasmodium response to ART that may explain the delayed clearance of parasites after artesunate treatment observed on the Thailand-Cambodia border and that provides important information for achieving {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms of antimalarial resistance...|$|E

TDBP-TAZTO can pass through the blood brain bar-rier and accumulate in brain. However, the neurotoxicity of TDBP-TAZTO has not yet stud-ied in rodents. We hypothesize that TDBP-TAZTO could induce the neurotoxicity in rat hippocampal neurons. The male adult rats were exposed to TDBP-TAZTO of 5 and 50 mg/ kg by gavage, daily for 6 months. TDBP-TAZTO resulted in cognitive impairment and depression-like behaviors, which may be related with TDBP-TAZTO-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivation, upregulation of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, overexpression of pro-apoptotic proteins, <b>downexpression</b> of neurogenesis-related proteins in hippocampus, and hippocampal neurons damage in DG, CA 1 and CA 3 areas.

Methods. Microarray was used to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs in RA PBMC. miR- 155 expression in PBMC and FLS of RA were identified by real-time PCR. Enforced overexpression and <b>downexpression</b> of miR- 155 were used to investigate the function of miR- 155 in RA-FLS. Expression of IKBKE which was previously identified as the actual target of miR- 155 was examined by Western blot and real-time PCR in RA-FLS. Results. miR- 155 levels were increased in both PBMC and FLS of RA and could be induced by TNF-α. Upregulation of miR- 155 decreased MMP- 3 levels and suppressed proliferation and invasion of RA-FLS.

In the present study, lentiviral small interference RNA expression vectors (shRNA) of SOCS 3 were constructed and stably transferred into HSCs. We found that SOCS 3 knockdown induced erythroid expansion in HSCs. Conversely, Ectopic expression of SOCS 3 in progenitor cells blocked erythroid expansion and erythroid colony formation of HSCs. To further explore the involved mechanism, we compared gene expression profiles of SOCS 3 -shRNA tranduced HSCs with that of control HSCs by whole genome microarrays. The results indicated that cell developmental process related genes, especially hematopoietic lineage-specific genes, associated with the responses to SOCS 3 in HSCs. <b>Downexpression</b> of SOCS 3 in HSCs or differentiated erythroid progenitor cells induced a transcriptional program enriched for erythroid development relative genes.

Thirty-six New Zealand white rabbits were randomized into no-graft group, graft group, and CES group. The rabbit arteriovenous graft model was established. In CES group, the vein graft was wrapped around with CES. The hemodynamic parameters of vein grafts were measured intraoperatively and 4 weeks after operation by ultrasonic examination. Histological characteristics of vein grafts were also evaluated 4 weeks later. The mRNA and protein levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), active cleaved-caspase- 3 (ClvCasp- 3), and smooth muscle 22 alpha (SM 22 α) were measured 4 weeks later by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Results. CES significantly improved the hemodynamic stability of vein grafts, with higher blood velocity and blood flow. Similarly, CES also markedly mitigated intimal hyperplasia and inhibited dilatation of vein grafts. In CES group, the upexpression of PCNA and ClvCasp- 3 and the <b>downexpression</b> of SM 22 α were inhibited. Conclusion.

We found that Ad-siAT 1 R treatment resulted in a significant decrease both in AT 1 R mRNA level and in AT 1 R protein expression level. With <b>downexpression</b> of AT 1 R, notable increased insulin secretion and decreased glucagon secretion levels were found by perifusion.

The properties of Lycium barbarum berries cultivated in Umbria (Italy) and their effect on human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG 2) have been investigated in this work. The obtained results demonstrated that the Lycium barbarum berries from Umbria region display high antioxidant properties evaluated by total phenolic content and ORAC method, on hydrophilic and lipophilic fractions. Moreover, on HepG 2 cell line Lycium barbarum berries extract did not change cell viability analyzed by MTT and Trypan blue exclusion assay and did not induce genotoxic effect analyzed by comet assay. Furthermore, it was demonstrated, for the first time, that the berries extract showed a protective effect on DNA damage, expressed as antigenotoxic activity in vitro.

40|$|Obesity {{and type}} II {{diabetes}} mellitus are {{often associated with}} hyperleptinemia and commonly accompanied by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which could cause hepatic fibrosis. During hepatic fibrogenesis, the major effectors hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) become active, coupling with depletion of cellular lipid droplets and <b>downexpression</b> of genes relevant to lipid accumulation. Accumulating evidence supports the proposal that recovering the accumulation of lipids would inhibit HSC activation. We recently reported that leptin stimulated HSC activation, which was eliminated by curcumin, a phytochemical from turmeric. The current {{study was designed to}} explore the underlying mechanisms, focusing on their effects on the level of intracellular lipids. We hypothesized that one of the mechanisms by which leptin stimulated HSC activation was to stimulate the depletion of intracellular lipids, which could be abrogated by curcumin by inducing expression of genes relevant to lipid accumulation. In this report, we observed that leptin dose dependently reduced levels of intracellular fatty acids and triglycerides in passaged HSCs, which were eliminated by curcumin. The phytochemical abrogated the impact of leptin on inhibiting the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in HSCs in vitro. The activation of AMPK resulted in inducing expression of genes relevant to lipid accumulation and increasing intracellular lipids in HSCs in vitro. In summary, curcumin eliminated stimulatory effects of leptin on HSC activation and increased AMPK activity, leading to inducing expression of genes relevant to lipid accumulation and elevating the level of intracellular lipids.

This study investigated whether an HC diet increases human ER-positive breast cancer progression and modulates natural killer (NK) cell functions. Four-week-old female BALB/c athymic nude mice were fed a HC diet (5320 kcal/kg) or standard calorie diet (SC, 2820 kcal/kg) for 6 mo. After 5 mo, the mice were randomly implanted with MCF- 7 breast cancer cells (SCT and HCT) or received an isovolumic injection (SC and HC) in both inguinal fat pads. Tumor growth was greater in the HCT group than in the SC group without change in body weight. The HC diet decreased the tumor expression of genes involved in the citrate cycle and in adiponectin and lipid metabolism but increased that of genes controlling glycolysis and angiogenesis. The tumor expression level of Ki 67 was increased while that of the cleaved caspase 3 and the ER-beta and progesterone receptors was reduced. Tumor development in response to the HC diet was associated with smaller numbers and lower cytotoxicity of splenic NK cells. These results indicate that an HC diet without body weight gain increases ER-positive breast cancer cell proliferation and reduces tumor apoptosis. The underlying mechanisms might involve a <b>downexpression</b> of tumor hormonal receptor and reduced NK cell functions, and might also result in the regulation of genes involved in several cellular functions.

Expression of AXL was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 42 PDAC. The AXL role in oncogenesis was studied using the short hairpin RNA approach in a pancreatic carcinoma cell line. We further generated antihuman AXL mAbs and evaluated their inhibitory effects and the AXL downstream signaling pathways first in vitro, in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines and then in vivo, using subcutaneous or orthotopic pancreatic tumor xenografts. AXL receptor was found expressed in 76 % (32 / 42) of PDAC and was predominantly present in invasive cells. The AXL-knockdown Panc- 1 cells decreased in vitro cell migration, survival and proliferation, and reduced in vivo tumor growth.

40|$|IntroductionLittle {{research}} has been done to test the usefulness of metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA 1) as a prognostic marker for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we investigated MTA 1 expression and its prognostic value for NSCLC. MethodsNSCLC surgical tissue samples were taken from 100 patients with NSCLC who had been followed up for more than 2 years. The expression of MTA 1 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and the correlations between the expression of MTA 1 and clinical features and the prognosis were analyzed. The difference of MTA 1 protein expression between NSCLCs and their adjacent nonneoplastic lung tissues was analyzed in a tissue microarray. The change of MTA 1 mRNA expression and protein expression after RNA interference (RNAi) was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry in NSCLC cell line 95 D. ResultsOverexpression of MTA 1 (immunoreactivity scoring > 4) was shown in 61. 0 % of the NSCLC cases but only in 9. 4 % of their adjacent nonneoplastic lung tissues (p < 0. 001). The MTA 1 expression level was correlated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0. 013) and clinical stage (p = 0. 002). Survival analysis showed that the MTA 1 overexpression group had a significantly shorter overall survival time than the MTA 1 <b>downexpression</b> group (p = 0. 003). However, multivariate analysis showed that MTA 1 expression was not a significant and independent prognostic parameter for patients with NSCLC.

Methods and Results: In vivo and ex vivo experiments assessing platelet activation were investigated in healthy subjects, obese patients, and subjects with different low rates of NOx 2 activity, namely X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD) patients and X-CGD carriers. We included 27 X-CGD patients, 31 women carriers of hereditary deficiency of NOx 2, 31 obese women, and 62 healthy subjects matched for sex and age. Plasma levels of soluble sCD 40 L (sCD 40 L) and soluble P (sP) -selectin, 2 markers of in vivo platelet activation, were reduced in X-CGD patients (sCD 40 L=- 55 %; sP-selectin=- 51 %, P < 0. 001) and in X-CGD carriers (sCD 40 L=- 41 %; sP-selectin=- 57 %, P < 0. 001) compared with respective controls. Conversely, obese women, who disclosed NOx 2 upregulation, had significantly higher plasma levels of sCD 40 L (+ 47 %, P < 0. 001) and sP-selectin (+ 70 %, P < 0. 001) compared with controls. Ex vivo study showed platelet isoprostane <b>downexpression</b> and enhanced platelet NO generation in both X-CGD patients and X-CGD carriers compared with controls; opposite findings were observed in obese patients.

Substantial data indicate that the oncogene miR- 494 - 3 p is significantly elevated in gliomas, but the mole-cular functions of miR- 494 - 3 p in gliomagenesis are largely unknown. The present study aimed to explore the role of miR- 494 - 3 p and its molecular mechanism in human brain gliomas, malignant glioma cell lines, and cancer stem-like cells. The expression level of miR- 494 - 3 p in 48 human glioma issues and 8 normal brain tissues was determined using stem-loop real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To study the function of miR- 494 - 3 p inhibitor in glioma cells, the miR- 494 - 3 p inhibitor lentivirus was used to transfect glioma cells. Transwell invasion system was used to estimate the effects of miR- 494 - 3 p inhibitor on the invasiveness of glioma cells. A mouse model was used to test the effect of miR- 494 - 3 p inhibitor on glioma prolif-eration and invasion in vivo. Results showed that the ex-pression of miR- 494 - 3 p in human brain glioma tissues was higher than in normal brain tissues. Downregulated ex-pression of miR- 494 - 3 p can inhibit the invasion and proliferation and promote apoptosis in glioma cells.

We included 27 X-CGD patients, 31 women carriers of hereditary deficiency of NOx 2, 31 obese women, and 62 healthy subjects matched for sex and age. Plasma levels of soluble sCD 40 L (sCD 40 L) and soluble P (sP) -selectin, 2 markers of in vivo platelet activation, were reduced in X-CGD patients (sCD 40 L= 55 %; sP-selectin= 51 %, P< 0. 001) and in X-CGD carriers (sCD 40 L= 41 %; sP-selectin= 57 %, P< 0. 001) compared with respective controls. Conversely, obese women, who disclosed NOx 2 upregulation, had significantly higher plasma levels of sCD 40 L (+ 47 %, P< 0. 001) and sP-selectin (+ 70 %, P< 0. 001) compared with controls. Ex vivo study showed platelet isoprostane <b>downexpression</b> and enhanced platelet NO generation in both X-CGD patients and X-CGD carriers compared with controls; opposite findings were observed in obese patients. Correlation analysis showed that platelet NOx 2 regulation was directly associated with plasma levels of sCD 40 L (R= 0. 336, P< 0. 001) and sP-selectin (R= 0. 441; P< 0. 001). Conclusions-—The study provides the first evidence that in vivo platelet activation is significantly and directly associated with NOx 2 activity. Platelet NOx 2 may be a novel target for platelet activation inhibition. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2014; 3 :e 000920 doi...|$|E
40|$|Background: HSTL {{is a rare}} entity {{characterized}} by an infiltration of bone marrow, spleen and liver tissues by neoplastic gammadelta (gd) -more rarely alphabeta (ab) - T cells. Its pathogenesis is poorly understood. Our purpose was to identify the molecular signature of HSTL and explore molecular pathways implicated in its pathogenesis. Methods: Gene expression profiling and array CGH analysis of 10 HSTL samples (7 gd, 3 ab), 1 HSTL cell line (DERL 2), 2 normal gd samples together with 16 peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL,NOS) and 7 nasal NK/T cell lymphomas were performed. Results: By unsupervised analysis, ab and gdHSTL clustered together remarkably separated from other lymphoma entities. Compared to PTCL, NOS, HSTL overexpresed genes encoding NK-associated molecules, oncogenes (VAV 3) and the Sphingosine- 1 -phosphatase receptor 5 involved in cell trafficking. Compared to normal gd cells, HSTL overexpressed genes encoding NK-cell and multi drug resistance-associated molecules, transcription factors (RHOB), oncogenes (MAFB, FOS, JUN, VAV 3) and the tyrosine kinase SYK whereas genes encoding cytotoxic molecules and the tumor suppressor gene AIM 1 {{were among the most}} downregulated. By immunohistochemistry, SYK was demonstrated on HSTL cells with expression of its phosphorylated form in DERL 2 cells by Western blot. Functional studies using a SYK inhibitor revealed a dose dependent increase of apoptotic DERL 2 cells suggesting that SYK could be a candidate target for pharmacologic inhibition. <b>Downexpression</b> of AIM 1 was validated by qRT-PCR. Methylation analysis of DERL 2 genomic DNA treated by bisulfite demonstrated highly methylated CpG islands of AIM 1. Genomic profiles confirmed recurrent isochromosome 7 q (n= 6 / 9) without alterations at 9 q 22 and 6 q 21 containing SYK and AIM 1 genes, respectively. Conclusion: The current study identifies a distinct molecular signature for HSTL and highlights oncogenic pathways which offer rationale for exploring new therapeutic options such as SYK inhibitors. It supports the view of gd and ab HSTL as a single entity...|$|E
40|$|DOAJ - Directory of Open Access Journals, 2008 This {{study was}} carried out for {{evaluating}} the interplay of p 53, p 21 and Ki- 67 proteins along the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma oncogenic transformation sequel. Therefore, Fifty colorectal cancerand 14 adenoma patients were involved. The histopathological expression of p 53, p 21 and Ki- 67 proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry assay. The results revealed that remarkableoverexpression of p 53 protein {{was seen in the}} tumorous sections of cancer patients more than that in adenoma patients (p< 0. 05), while no p 53 overexpression was found in the corresponding nontumoroussections. The positive expression of p 21 protein was lower in the tumorous sections of cancer patients than that of adenoma patients (p< 0. 05) and was higher in the non-tumorous than the corresponding tumorous sections of both CRC and adenoma patients (p< 0. 05). The expression of p 53 and p 21 proteins in cancer patients was inversely correlated to each other (p< 0. 05) and the expression of p 21 rather than p 53 protein was associated with colorectal cancer staging and grading (p< 0. 05). Ki- 67 was higher in cancer than in adenoma patients and higher in the tumorous tissue sections than thecorresponding non-tumorous sections (p< 0. 05). The overexpression of p 53 and <b>downexpression</b> of p 21 proteins in colorectal cancer might be responsible largely for triggering the transformational changes innormal mucosa to develop adenoma and trigger also the malignant cascade from adenoma to carcinoma. P 53 overexpression was shown to occur due to the mutated dysfunctional p 53 gene productwhich loses its transcriptional activator necessary for p 21 expression. The level of p 21 protein which is a quantitatively affected by the loss of p 53 activation is responsible for the association with cancer staging and grading that serves as a good indicator for the disease progression.

40|$|SUMMARYThe {{diversity}} of cancer molecular origins {{associated with the}} genetic variability of patients has encouraged the development of chemotherapeutic treatments adapted {{not only to the}} target tumor, but also to a specific patient. This personalized strategy is based on cancer biomarkers allowing a better identification and characterization of each tumor where predictive biomarkers provide the distinction between various factors indicative of the response to the treatment. In this context, several studies highlighted the role of the solute carrier transporter family 22 (solute carriers 22 or SLC 22) in the uptake of platinum anticancer drugs. This mechanism being not well understood, our work intends to establish the potential role of SLC 22 member A 18 (SLC 22 A 18) as predictive biomarker in the aim to help to a better targeted chemotherapeutic strategy for each patient. We optimized a system overexpressing SLC 22 A 18 stably or transiently in HeLa cancer cell line. SLC 22 A 18 expression was confirmed by qRT-PCR, western blotting, microscopy and flow cytometry. The cell lines were treated with taxane, anthracyclin, vinca alkaloid and nitrosoureas anticancer drug families. We showed that doxorubicin, camptothecin, chloroquine, tetracycline and carmustin had no effect on the cell viability assays suggesting that they are not substrates of SLC 22 A 18. Interestingly, the cell line was sensitized in the presence of antimitotic drug with a sensitivity factor of 2. 7 in the presence of paclitaxel, 1. 4 with docetaxel, 1. 8 with vinblastin and 2. 2 in the presence of vincristine. To confirm these results, we elaborated a SLC 22 A 18 knockdown cell line in HS 683 cells using siRNA technology. The <b>downexpression</b> of SLC 22 A 18 was correlated to a tendency to resist to the accumulation of paclitaxel thereby confirming the previous results. Simultaneously, a knockout cell line was established using the transcription activator-like effectors nuclease (TALEN) technology in U 373 cell line. Our studies constitute a robust base of knowledge for further investigation on SLC 22 A 18 transporter as a predictive biomarker promoting antimitotic treatment in tumors where this transporter is detected.

40|$|Background: Gelsemium sempervirens (Gelsemium s.) is {{a highly}} toxic plant but is {{employed}} at low doses and/or high dilutions as an anxiolytic and antidepressant. Previous investigations in our laboratory [1, 2] have shown a significant anxiolytic-like activity of Gelsemium s., using emotional response models in laboratory mice. Although there is some biochemical evidence of a possible role of neurosteroid metabolism [3], the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of Gelsemium s. {{at the level of}} nervous system are largely unknown. To help determine these pathways, we used human neurocytes (SH-SY 5 Y cell line) treated in vitro with different dilutions of Gelsemium s. and evaluated their vitality and gene expression changes. &# 13; Methods: The drugs were produced by Boiron Laboratoires, Lyon (F), starting from a whole-plant-hydroalcoholic extract of Gelsemium s. Solutions 1 C, 2 C, 3 C, 4 C, 8 C and 29 C (C= centesimal dilution/dynamization prepared in 30 % ethanol/distilled water) were provided in 30 -ml glass bottles, wrapped in aluminium foil and were stored in the dark at room temperature in a metal cupboard. Control solutions (Ã¢â‚¬Å“placeboÃ¢â‚¬Â) were serially diluted/dynamized 30 % ethanol/distilled water. Before each experiment, 0. 05 ml samples of Gelsemium s. and placebo were added to 5 ml of distilled sterile and apyrogenic water in a 15 ml Falcon polystyrene plastic tube, closed and shaken in mechanical shaker DinaA for 7. 5 sec (150 strokes) to obtain the final 2 C, 3 C, 4 C, 5 C, 9 C and 30 C succussed dilutions, with ethanol concentration of 0. 3 % (v/v) (final 0. 03 % in the assay system). &# 13; Human neuroblastoma cell line SHSY 5 Y was grown in DMEM-F 12 medium (Lonza), with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). To assess cell viability and metabolism, 20, 000 cells per well were seeded in 96 microplate wells in 200 ÃŽÂ¼l of medium. After overnight incubation, 22 ÃŽÂ¼l of drug or placebo were added and the plate was incubated at 37 Ã‚Â°C with 5 % CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere for 72 hours. Then the viability test with reagent WST- 1 (Roche) was performed for 3 hours and the absorbance was detected with multiplate reader. A total of 17 experiments, each done with six replicate microwells. To make a relative measurement of protein, the cells were lysed and a Bradford assay was done directly in the plate. The Student t-test and the sign rank test for paired data were utilized for data analysis. &# 13; To obtain a profile of gene expression, cells were pre preconditioned with Gelsemium s. /placebo dilutions for 24 h, then RNA was isolated and analysed by microarray and RT-PCR. SHSY 5 Y cells were plated onto Petri dishes (day 1) and the day after the medium was replaced with the medium with 2 % FBS (day 2). After 24 h, 10 %v/v Gelsemium s. or placebo dilutions were added to the medium (day 3) and cells were incubated for a further 24 h. On day 4, cells were then harvested and the RNA extracted using the Qiagen RNAeasy Mini Kit following the manufacturerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instructions. Microarray analysis was performed on a custom 12 x 135 k human NimbleGen microarray containing 45033 genes with 3 probes per target gene. Four biological replicates were analysed for each condition. Analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed using linear modelling and empirical Bayes methods and p-values were adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini and Hochberg method. A Human Neurotransmitter Receptors and Regulators RT 2 Profiler PCR array (Qiagen) was performed in profiling the expression of genes involved in modulating the biological processes of neurotransmitter biosynthesis, uptake, transport and signaling through neurotransmitter receptors. &# 13; Results: In viability tests, cells treated with Gelsemium s. showed slightly higher metabolic activity (3 - 4 %) than those treated with placebo. Overall comparison of the data for the whole sample of placebo versus that of Gelsemium s. using the Student t-test showed a small but significant difference (p < 0. 001). Furthermore, a non parametric approach comparing the two treatments at the same dilution yielded a significant difference under the sign test (p < 0. 01) and Wilcoxon rank test for paired data (p < 0. 05), so that the values of differences were also considered. The differences between groups having the same dilution (placebo 2 C versus Gelsemium s. 2 C etc.) were significant in four dilutions: 2 C, 3 C, 4 C (p < 0. 01), 9 C (p < 0. 02), while 5 C and 30 C yielded non-significant values. No changes due to Gelsemium s. were detected using protein assay, suggesting that the viability test revealed effects on metabolic activity instead of on cell proliferation. &# 13; In microarray analysis, transcripts expression was analyzed and genes differentially expressed by the Gelsemium s. dilutions were selected. A gene was considered to be differentially expressed if it showed an absolute value of log-ratio {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 5, an index that translates to a fold-change of 1. 4 in transcript quantity. Out of a total of 45, 033 transcripts, exposure to Gelsemium s. 2 C promoted the selective <b>downexpression</b> of 49 genes (p values adj< 0. 05). Most of these 49 genes were downregulated also by lower Gelsemium s. dilutions (3 C, 4 C and 5 C) and twenty even using higher dilutions (9 C and 30 C). Seven genes were overexpressed with Gelsemium s. 2 C (p values adj< 0. 05) and 2 of these also increased their expression also in dilutions up to 9 C and 30 C. The RT-PCR analysis is currently being done. &# 13; Conclusions: Gelsemium s. caused a small but significant positive effect on neural cell viability, both at low (2 C, 3 C, 4 C) and high dilutions/dynamizations (9 C); the lack of activity of 5 C and 30 C may indicate a non-linear dose-response, reminiscent of previous models of high-dilution pharmacology [1, 4 - 7]. At doses which were proven non toxic in the viability and protein assays (namely 2 C and 3 C), the same remedy changed in statistically significant way the expression of several genes of human neurocytes. Gene regulation by higher dilutions in this model is strongly suggested but needs statistical confirmation. The relationship between neurocyte gene regulation and the neurotropic activity of Gelsemium s., including a detailed analysis of the expression patterns involved, is under investigation...|$|E
