40|$|Composite Laminates are {{generally}} designed using a <b>failure</b> criteria, {{based on a}} set of standard experimental strength values. <b>Failure</b> of composite laminates involves different <b>failure</b> mechanisms depending upon the stress state. Hence, different <b>failure</b> mechanisms become dominant at different points on the <b>failure</b> envelope. Use of a single <b>failure</b> criterion, as is normally done in designing laminates, is unlikely to be satisfactory for all combinations of stresses. As an alternate, use of a simple <b>failure</b> criterion to identify the dominant <b>failure</b> mechanism and the designing of the laminate using appropriate <b>failure</b> mechanism-based criteria is suggested in this paper. A rectangular panel subjected to boundary displacements is used as an example to illustrate this concept. Comparison of results using standard <b>failure</b> criteria such as Maximum Stress, Maximum Strain, Tsai-Wu indicates substantial differences in predicting the first ply <b>failure.</b> Results for <b>Failure</b> Load Factors, based on the <b>failure</b> mechanism-based approach are included. It is indicated that the <b>failure</b> mechanism-based design approach offers a reliable way of assessing critically stressed regions to eliminate the uncertainties associated with the <b>failure</b> criteria...|$|R

40|$|Markov {{models are}} often used to {{evaluate}} dependability attributes of fault-tolerant computer systems. The use in practice of Markov models is, however, hampered by the well-known state space explosion problem. Simulation alleviates the problem. For Markov models of repairable fault-tolerant systems, standard simulation of dependability measures tends to be expensive due to the rarity of the system <b>failure</b> event. Importance sampling can speed up the simulation. This paper develops two importance sampling schemes, called <b>failure</b> transition distance biasing and balanced <b>failure</b> transition distance biasing, which exploit the <b>failure</b> transition distance concept {{in an attempt to}} improve the efficiency of two other schemes, <b>failure</b> biasing and balanced <b>failure</b> biasing. The schemes require the computation of the so-called <b>failure</b> transition distances, and procedures to perform those computations are developed. The presentation is tied to a previously proposed measure-specific simulation method for the steady-state unavailability. An optimization method of the parameters of the importance sampling schemes is also developed. For the simulation of the steady-state unavailability, <b>failure</b> transition distance biasing has (as <b>failure</b> biasing) the bounded relative error property for balanced fault-tolerant systems and balanced <b>failure</b> transition distance biasing has (as balanced <b>failure</b> biasing) the bounded relative error property for both balanced and unbalanced fault-tolerant systems. It is proved that, for balanced fault-tolerant systems, both <b>failure</b> transition distance biasing and balanced <b>failure</b> transition distance biasing can indeed improve the efficiency of <b>failure</b> biasing and balanced <b>failure</b> biasing. In addition, numerical experiments seem to indicate that, for unbalanced fault-tolerant systems, balanced <b>failure</b> transition distance biasing can also improve the efficiency of balanced <b>failure</b> biasing. The application of the <b>failure</b> transition distance-based importance sampling schemes is, however, limited to systems not having too many minimal <b>failure</b> covers, or, at least, not having too many minimal <b>failure</b> covers of small cardinality. A minimal <b>failure</b> cover is a minimal bag of <b>failure</b> bags such that the <b>failure</b> of its components implies the <b>failure</b> of the system; a <b>failure</b> bag is any non-empty bag of component classes which can fail simultaneously.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{contrast}} to <b>failure</b> approaches at the lamina level or the micromechanics level, the present work concerns <b>failure</b> characterization at the laminate level. Specifically, attention {{is given to}} the ultimate <b>failure</b> characterization for quasi-isotropic laminates. This is in further {{contrast to}} the commonly used approaches for initial damage or progressive damage. It is shown that the analytical <b>failure</b> forms decompose into two modes, one for out-of-plane, delamination-type <b>failure</b> and one for in-plane, fiber-controlled-type <b>failure.</b> The work here is mainly given over to the delamination mode of <b>failure.</b> Experimental results are presented for laminates in this mode of <b>failure.</b> These results are then integrated with the analytical forms to give a simple criterion for delamination <b>failure.</b> KEY WORDS: delamination <b>failure,</b> <b>failure</b> criterion, quasi-isotropic laminates...|$|R

40|$|Pathophysiology {{of heart}} <b>failure</b> has been {{considered}} to be a damaged state of systolic function of the heart followed by a state of low cardiac output that is, systolic heart <b>failure.</b> Even if systolic function is preserved, left ventricular filling in diastole can be impeded and resulted in elevation of filling pressure and symptoms of heart <b>failure.</b> This kind of heart <b>failure</b> is called diastolic heart <b>failure.</b> Nowadays, diastolic heart <b>failure</b> is referred to as heart <b>failure</b> with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), whereas systolic heart <b>failure</b> is referred to as heart <b>failure</b> with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} devising a new <b>failure</b> envelope by {{the combination of the}} most commonly used <b>failure</b> criteria for the composite laminates, on the design of composite structures. The <b>failure</b> criteria considered for the study are maximum stress and Tsai-Wu criteria. In addition to these popular phenomenological-based <b>failure</b> criteria, a micromechanics-based <b>failure</b> criterion called <b>failure</b> mechanism-based <b>failure</b> criterion is also considered. The <b>failure</b> envelopes obtained by these <b>failure</b> criteria are superimposed over one another and a new <b>failure</b> envelope is constructed based on the lowest absolute values of the strengths predicted by these <b>failure</b> criteria. Thus, the new <b>failure</b> envelope so obtained is named as most conservative <b>failure</b> envelope. A minimum weight design of composite laminates is performed using genetic algorithms. In addition to this, the effect of stacking sequence on the minimum weight of the laminate is also studied. Results are compared for the different <b>failure</b> envelopes and the conservative design is evaluated, with respect to the designs obtained by using only one <b>failure</b> criteria. The design approach is recommended for structures where composites are the key load-carrying members such as helicopter rotor blades...|$|R
