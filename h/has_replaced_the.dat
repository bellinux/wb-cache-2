5|$|The GR1A and GR4A were {{equipped}} with TIRRS (Tornado Infrared Reconnaissance System), consisting of one SLIR (Sideways Looking Infra Red) sensor {{on each side}} of the fuselage forward of the engine intakes to capture oblique images, and a single IRLS (InfrarRed LineScan) sensor mounted on the fuselage's underside to provide vertical images. TIRRS recorded images on six S-VHS video tapes. The newer RAPTOR reconnaissance pod <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> built-in TIRRS system.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} linked both thematically and in its formal construction to Bacon's 1956 work Owls, and to preparatory sketches only brought to the art market in the late 1990s. The art critic Armin Zweite traces {{the origin of the}} lower figure to a photograph of an owl that Bacon found in a book on birds in motion; Bacon <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> bird's beak with a wide open human mouth.|$|E
5|$|A new £15million {{leisure centre}} on the town's Esplanade {{opened its doors}} in September 2013. This <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> old Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool from the 1970s. The {{decision}} {{to build a new}} leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save The Car Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the car park open. The group said that the closure of the car park would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners' right of access to the car park. This decision was severely criticised in an internal audit report.|$|E

5|$|At the convention, Hoffman <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> heating {{elements}} for the chafing-dishes with his own. Olivia and Peter struggle with locating Hoffman before Walter and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) arrive. Walter uses a fogger to distribute his own chemical agent, this time specific to Hoffman, {{and soon the}} man is found dying. As the team regroups, Walter fully admits to killing Hoffman, a crime in itself, but Broyles (Lance Reddick) decides to let Walter go. Later, Peter {{has been able to}} recover the rest of his grandfather's work and returns it to Walter; Walter then goes through the files, finding an old photo of his father and Hoffman working together.|$|E
5|$|In the aye-aye, which <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> toothcomb by {{evolving}} continually growing, rodent-like incisors, the hook-shaped {{tip of the}} sublingua fits precisely {{within the}} gap between the two lower incisors and keeps the area clean. Tarsiers lack a toothcomb, which may explain why their sublingua lacks the serrations typically found on the sublingua of lemuriforms. Although colugos also have a toothcomb, consisting of serrated edges on the tips of their incisors instead of finely spaced, elongated teeth, {{they do not have a}} sublingua. Instead, their toothcomb is cleaned by the tongue, which has serrated edges at the front that match the serrations on the incisors.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob SquarePants {{appears at}} the Mall of America's Nickelodeon theme park re-branded from the Mall of America's Park at MOA, {{formerly}} Camp Snoopy, to Nickelodeon Universe in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb of Bloomington, Minnesota. The new theme park features a SpongeBob-themed Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter custom roller coaster, the SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge, which <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Mystery Mine Ride and Olde Time Photo store on {{the west end of}} the theme park, which opened March 15, 2008.|$|E
5|$|By 1999, <b>the</b> Millennium Stadium <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> National Stadium, Cardiff Arms Park, as the {{national}} stadium of Wales for rugby union and association football international matches.

5|$|The ride {{features}} more than 24 regular characters from The Simpsons and features {{the voices of the}} regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer. Harry Shearer, however, decided not to participate in the ride, so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in the ride at all. In homage to the Back to the Future ride that it <b>has</b> <b>replaced,</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons Ride's queue video features a brief animated cameo from Doc Brown who is voiced by Christopher Lloyd.|$|E
5|$|A new {{parking lot}} has been {{constructed}} on college-owned land between Sullivan Arena and privately owned Clarke Farm in Bedford. This parking lot <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> former Joan of Arc parking lot, which was located between the Dana Center, Davison Dining Hall, and the Joan of Arc dormitory (JOA). The former {{parking lot was}} torn down, and a grassy open quadrangle was constructed {{during the summer of}} 2012. A grotto has been built between JOA and Gadbois Hall and was dedicated in late 2014, with the placement of a religious statue. The quadrangle is yet to be named, and has new lights and walkways; the centerpiece is a large granite seal of the college. The project is the first place on campus where electronic gates have been installed. The gates are used to cordon off the roads of the new quad during the regular semester and can be opened for emergency vehicles and during move in/out days.|$|E
5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E

5|$|For their novel, {{the group}} members {{decide to take}} the typical {{elements}} from already popular young-adult series. Homer initially suggest that they write about vampires, but Patty notes {{the fact that there}} are already so many popular novels out there in that genre. They therefore decide to write about an orphan troll who goes to a magic school located under the Brooklyn Bridge. Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy. Lisa admits defeat and takes the offer. They and the rest of the crew then approach the book publishing executive again, and he decides to buy the novel for a million dollars. As the team is celebrating at Moe's Tavern, they receive an advance copy. They are shocked to discover that the publisher <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> troll-aspects of the story with vampires, renaming the novel The Vampire Twins of Transylvania Prep, because market testing showed that vampires are more popular than trolls.|$|E

Internet Explorer 8 highlights all instances of found words while allowing the user to continue the navigation normally.|$|E
25|$|Most {{spinning}} {{today is}} done using Break or Open-end spinning, {{this is a}} technique where the staples are blown by air into a rotating drum, where they attach themselves to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. Other methods of break spinning use needles and electrostatic forces. This method <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> older methods of ring and mule spinning. It also is easily adapted for artificial fibres.|$|E

Mary apprehends Clayface, deploying excessive violence. Riddler suggests she seek a mentor while Eclipso watches with interest.|$|E

Similarly, to the north, the dual carriageway A2 <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> Rochester Road section, which was always very congested (the old road had dangerous readings of lead pollution, close to schools, before the advent of lead-free petrol).|$|E
