Low-cost audio equipment or constraints of portable communication systems cause nonlinear distortions, which limit the <b>echo</b> <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> enhancement achievable by linear adaptation schemes.

SMI is attractive because it doesn 2 ̆ 7 t require any optical part external to the laser and can be employed in a variety of measurements, ranging from the traditional measurements related to optical path length like displacements, small-amplitude vibrations, velocity; to sensing of weak optical <b>echoes,</b> like <b>return</b> <b>loss</b> and isolation factor measurements; and also to a special feature for the interaction with the medium, measurements of physical parameters, like laser line width, coherence length, and the alfa factor. Because it is also a coherent detection scheme, the SMI operation is close to the quantum limit of received field and the minimum detectable amplitudes of 20 pm/√Hz or better are currently achieved upon operation on diffusive targets, whereas a corner cube allows half-wavelength counting mode or 0. 5 μm resolution on a dynamic range up to 2 m.
