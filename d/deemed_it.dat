5|$|By {{the time}} Sri Lanka became {{independent}} in 1948, about {{sixty percent of}} government jobs were held by Tamils, who formed barely fifteen percent of the population.

5|$|Writing in TouchArcade, Jared Nelson {{wrote that}} the game is unexceptional for players who are not fans of the toy line. While in the United Kingdom the game was subject of {{controversy}} concerning its incorporation of in-app purchases, the Advertising Standards Authority <b>deemed</b> <b>it</b> acceptable. The organization found that the instructions detailing purchases did not coerce players to make such purchases.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, Diệm ordered that all VNAF {{aircraft}} be grounded, and all aerial combat missions suspended while his security officials investigated fighter pilots for any possible anti-regime tendencies. This was achieved by placing tanks on the runway at Bien Hoa Air Base.

5|$|Chinese paleontologists {{discovered}} a partial skull and {{skeleton of a}} small theropod (IVPP V4878) in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China in the mid-1960s. In 1977, Dong Zhiming described this specimen, which was recovered from the Subashi Formation in Shanshan County, as a new genus and species, Shanshanosaurus huoyanshanensis. Gregory Paul recognized Shanshanosaurus as a tyrannosaurid in 1988, referring it to the now-defunct genus Aublysodon. Dong and Currie later re-examined the specimen and <b>deemed</b> <b>it</b> to be a juvenile of a larger species of tyrannosaurid. These authors refrained from assigning it to any particular genus but suggested Tarbosaurus as a possibility.|$|E

5|$|GHV2 {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, who <b>deemed</b> <b>it</b> {{as an essential}} compilation, although some criticized the absence of new material.

Elsewhere, GHV2 also attained success, reaching the top five in Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom and several other European countries.

5|$|Planning of {{a railway}} to connect Trøndelag and Jämtland, Sweden, started in 1869, {{with one of}} the {{proposals}} being to build a line from Trondheim via Verdal to Sweden. However, surveys along the Verdal alternative <b>deemed</b> <b>it</b> unsuitable, and instead the line was built via Stjørdalen and Meråker. To conform with Swedish standards, the line was built with standard gauge instead of the more common narrow gauge. The Meråker Line opened on 22 July 1882.|$|E

Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics; some <b>deemed</b> <b>it</b> the best episode of the season while others regarded it as the weakest. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 15.4, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|The style {{continued}} to be popular in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, where it was frequently employed {{in the design of}} public and municipal buildings. From {{the latter half of the}} 19th century it was rivalled by the Gothic revival in the English-speaking world, whose champions, such as Augustus Pugin, remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples, <b>deemed</b> <b>it</b> too pagan for Anglican and Anglo-Catholic worship. However, as an architectural style it has {{continued to}} be popular and to evolve; its pediments, symmetry and proportions are clearly evident in the design of many modern buildings today.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{commercial}} smash, the record received initially lukewarm reviews from mainstream music critics; many contemporary reviewers <b>deemed</b> <b>it</b> inferior to Definitely Maybe, with the songwriting and production particular points of criticism. In the ensuing years, however, critical opinion towards the album reversed, {{and it is}} now generally considered a seminal record of both the Britpop era, and the 1990s in general. Over several months in 1995 and 1996, the band performed an extensive world tour in support of the album. The most notable of the concerts were two Knebworth House performances in August to a combined crowd of 250,000 people. At the 1996 Brit Awards, the album won Best British Album.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's most {{immediate}} issue as Secretary of Defense was the Department of Defense budget. Cheney <b>deemed</b> <b>it</b> appropriate {{to cut the}} budget and downsize the military, following the Reagan Administration's peacetime defense buildup {{at the height of}} the Cold War. As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the Avenger II Naval attack aircraft, the B-2 stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-wing helicopter, the Aegis destroyer and the MX missile, totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics. Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not having}} a sting, the {{porcupine}} ray is capable of injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly bold and tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called shagreen, had many historical uses. In particular, {{it was used to}} cover the hilts of various melee weapons, as its extremely rough texture prevented slippage during battle. For example, the Japanese <b>deemed</b> <b>it</b> the only species whose skin was acceptable for covering sword grips. The Malayans used it to cover shields. The skin was also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down the thorns to yield a mottled pattern. The native inhabitants of Funafuti Atoll used dried portions of the ray's tail as a rasp-like tool.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, a rumoured sequel for the PlayStation 2 was reported. The rumours later proved false however. While Sony {{contemplated}} {{the notion of}} a G-Police game for the PlayStation 2 (who had bought Psygnosis, renaming it Studio Liverpool), they decided that, because G-Police was not as successful as other games, Studio Liverpool would instead concentrate on the Formula 1 and Wipeout franchises. Furthermore, the development team responsible for G-Police and Weapons of Justice had moved on to other ventures. In 2007, G-Police was made available for download on PlayStation 3. Computer and Video Games noted that the graphics looked poor by current standards but <b>deemed</b> <b>it</b> still enjoyable to play.|$|E
5|$|In July 1937, the Atlantic Monthly {{accepted}} a {{revised version of}} an essay, The World of Waters, that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had <b>deemed</b> <b>it</b> too good for that purpose. The essay, published as Undersea, was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house Simon & Schuster, impressed by Undersea, contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in Under the Sea Wind (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued—her features appeared in Sun Magazine, Nature, and Collier's.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 3 was realigned {{to follow the}} entire length of the Route S3 freeway. In addition, Route 3 in Secaucus was shifted off the Paterson Plank Road to the newly built Secaucus Bypass. The {{original}} alignment of Route 3 became Route 153. Only the section west of Paterson Plank Road was state-maintained after the renumbering, and the entire route was eliminated by the 1990s. In the mid-1950s, Route 3 was planned as one of the original routes of the Interstate Highway System; however, the New Jersey State Highway Department had <b>deemed</b> <b>it</b> too expensive to bring it up to Interstate Highway standards and Interstate 280 was favored instead. In 1959, the Lincoln Tunnel approach was designated as Interstate 495 and Route 3 was truncated back to U.S. Route 1/9 in North Bergen.|$|E
