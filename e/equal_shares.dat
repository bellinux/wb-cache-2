The stated plans were {{to start with the}} service from Gothenburg to Copenhagen in January 2001, from Oslo to Gothenburg in June, and from Oslo to Stockholm in January 2002.

5|$|In 1934, the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) {{was formed}} as a joint venture by British Petroleum and Gulf. Both British Petroleum and Gulf held <b>equal</b> <b>shares</b> in the venture. KOC pioneered the {{exploration}} for oil in Kuwait during the late 1930s. Oil was discovered at Burgan in 1938 {{but it was not}} until 1946 that the first crude oil was shipped. Oil production started from Rawdhatain in 1955 and Minagish in 1959. KOC started gas production in 1964. It was the cheap oil and gas being shipped from Kuwait that formed the economic basis for Gulf's diverse petroleum sector operations in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. These last operations were coordinated by Gulf Oil Company, Eastern Hemisphere Ltd (GOCEH) from their offices at 2 Portman Street in London W1.|$|E

25|$|To {{alleviate}} this fundamentally flawed {{state of}} affairs, Skidmore {{argued for the}} end of the right of inheritance and for the strict leveling of property among adults. His program was straightforward: all property in the United States should be divvied up and redistributed, in <b>equal</b> <b>shares,</b> to American citizens. From that point on, Americans would own their share as private property, and would relinquish it only when they died. Private inheritance would be abolished, and the wealth of the deceased would be pooled into a fund and reserved, in the future, for young people when they reached the age of 18. Upon reaching that age, all Americans would inherit a generous sum of money, understood as their birthright, to get them started in adult life.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a model of}} the choice between marriage and cohabitation that is used to analyze the implications of changing from a title-based division of property on divorce to an <b>equal</b> <b>sharing</b> regime.

Offsetting this, <b>equal</b> <b>sharing</b> property division induces efficient investment in marriage, increasing the value of marriage relative to cohabitation for some couples.

25|$|Shocked by {{the peasant}} revolt, the Diet of 1514 passed laws that {{condemned}} the serfs to eternal bondage and increased their work obligations.

However, the Tripartitum was never used as a code. The Tripartitum gave Hungary's king and nobles, or magnates, <b>equal</b> <b>shares</b> of power: the nobles recognized the king as superior, but in turn the nobles {{had the power to}} elect the king.

25|$|The {{death of}} their aunt in October {{of the same year}} forced them to return once more to Haworth. Aunt Branwell had left all her worldly goods in <b>equal</b> <b>shares</b> to her nieces and to Eliza Kingston, a cousin in Penzance, which had the {{immediate}} effect of purging all their debts and providing a small reserve of funds. Nevertheless, they were asked to return to Brussels as they were regarded as being competent and were needed. They were each offered teaching posts in the boarding school, still English for Charlotte and music for Emily. However, Charlotte returned alone to Belgium in January 1843, while Emily remained critical of Monsieur Heger, in spite of the excellent opinion he held of her. He later stated that she 'had the spirit of a man', and would probably become a great traveller due to her being gifted with a superior faculty of reason that allowed her to deduce ancient knowledge of new spheres of knowledge, and her unbending willpower would have triumphed over all obstacles.|$|E

25|$|Linked to this {{category}} {{is the problem}} of unincorporated associations. Unincorporated associations cannot hold rights (chattels or land) on their own account. When they dissolve, the question is then what to do with property that has been transferred to the association. The traditional view, as laid out in Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts, is that the members of the association hold these rights on purpose trust. Where the money was raised from identified individuals, the property should be held on resulting trust for donors upon the failure of the purpose trust. Where it is impossible or impractical, the property should be passed to the Crown as bona vacantia. The more modern view developed from Walton J's judgment in Re Bucks Constabulary Benevolent Fund. This is that dissolving a society and distributing property to its members is a matter of contract, not trusts law. As such, the contract between the association's members should be the deciding factor in how the property is to be distributed, and {{there is no need to}} involve resulting trusts. If the contractual provisions identify how to distribute property, they will be followed; if not, the property will be distributed according to an implied term, usually in <b>equal</b> <b>shares.</b>|$|E

In December 2015, OtherSide Entertainment, a studio founded by former Looking Glass Studios designer Paul Neurath, announced they were developing System Shock 3 with rights granted to them by Night Dive Studios.
