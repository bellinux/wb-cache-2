25|$|Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a {{book that}} has touched many people very deeply since its {{publishing}} in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone {{has sold more than}} four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more people read this book, then {{the world as a whole}} might become a more easily survivable place.|$|E

[...] Caldwell suggested that Garfield [...] "...while he told the truth , certainly failed to tell the whole truth, clearly evading an answer to certain vital questions and thus giving the impression of worse faults than those of which he was guilty." [...] That Crédit Mobilier was a corrupt organization had been a secret badly kept, even mentioned on the floor of Congress, and editor Sam Bowles wrote at the time that Garfield, in his positions on committees dealing with finance, [...] "...had no more right to be ignorant in a matter of such grave importance as this, than the sentinel has to snore on his post." ...|$|E

2500|$|Principal {{photography}} began September 1996, in San Antonio, Corpus Christi, Poteet, Houston, and Lake Jackson, Texas. Nava used locals as extras for the film. Selena's {{singing voice}} was dubbed into the film, with Lopez lip-syncing the songs. During {{the opening of}} the Selena Etc. boutique scene, Suzette believed Lopez was wearing Selena's clothing to her disbelief that the costume crew members had replicated the suit the singer wore. Costume designer Elisabetta Beraldo remade Selena's dress she wore when she won the Grammy Award in 1994. Suzette said how she was overcome with emotions after viewing Lopez in the dress. During the elopement scene, Perez explained how he had reminiscent the event as if he was [...] "transported back in time" [...] and remembered how he had a do not disturb sign and hearing a knock on his door.

Perez refused to visit the set and explained that he did not want to partake in the film's process. Seda convinced him to visit for the scene where his character auditions for the role as the new guitarist for the band. After researching on how to perform a riff on a guitar and having lessons from Perez, Seda felt that the scene would not come off as authentic since he could not replicate Perez' guitar riffs. He tricked Perez into visiting the scene so that he could play the riff and have the director shoot a close up of his hands for the film. Seda said how after the film was released that people believed he could play the guitar, he said <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> fans how Perez was actually the one performing the riff in the scene.|$|E
2500|$|The {{seventh and}} final season, {{consisting}} of 13 episodes, begins with Michael receiving an assignment from Andrew Strong (Jack Coleman), a high-ranking CIA official {{with whom he}} made the deal that got his team and Maddie set free. Strong made the deal because he believes Michael {{is the only person}} he can entrust with a dangerous mission that involves thwarting an American named Randall Burke (Adrian Pasdar) believed to be running freelance terror operations. Fiona has moved on to a new job with her new bounty hunter boyfriend. Sam and Jesse continue to help Michael despite, or perhaps because of, intrusions on their personal and professional lives. Maddie, meanwhile, is trying to get custody of Nate's son, Charlie, to keep him out of foster care. It turns out Burke {{is part of a larger}} organization, and he sacrifices his life in order to help Michael rescue a woman whom Burke called [...] "the key to everything": Sonya (Alona Tal). Michael and the team, including Fiona, begin working with Sonya to get deeper into her organization.

It doesn't take long for Michael to find out that James works for peace and justice in the world, but uses extreme methods to get what he wants. After Michael kills Sonya to protect Fiona, James sends his men to kill Maddie, Charlie, and Jesse. Maddie sacrifices herself to protect them and Michael shoots James, intent on taking him in custody. James blows up his own building, hoping to kill Michael and Fiona. They escape, but must be presumed dead to protect themselves. Strong releases Sam and Jesse, without imprisonment. [...] While the two of them contemplate continuing helping out those who need it like they had for the past seven years, Michael and Fiona have made their home in a small town in Ireland raising Charlie as their own and being the family that Fi had always dreamed of with Michael as her husband.

2500|$|In April 1961 Stevenson {{suffered}} the greatest humiliation of his diplomatic {{career in the}} Bay of Pigs invasion. After hearing rumors that [...] "a lot of refugees {{wanted to go back}} and overthrow Castro", Stevenson voiced his skepticism about an invasion, but [...] "he was kept on the fringes of the operation, receiving...nine days before the invasion, only an unduly vague briefing by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr." [...] and the CIA. [...] Senior CIA official Tracy Barnes told Stevenson and his staff that [...] "there {{was going to be a}} clandestine operation in Cuba...it was strictly a Cuban affair. It would have some American cooperation, but only with the training and financing." [...] According to historian Peter Wyden, Barnes did not tell Stevenson that there would be a large-scale invasion of Cuba, nor did he provide details about the full extent of American support for, and involvement with, the Cuban rebels, nor did <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> Stevenson about the planned air strikes to destroy Castro's air force. Assistant Secretary of State Harlan Cleveland, who attended the briefing, felt that Barnes was [...] "too evasive", that he had been sent to reassure Stevenson that Kennedy [...] "knew what he was doing", and that [...] "evidently Stevenson was not to be told" [...] the full details of the invasion plan. Historian Garry Wills has written that [...] "news of the invasion was leaking out...Castro knew the landings would occur; only Adlai Stevenson was kept in the dark" [...] about the invasion by President Kennedy and his aides. Kennedy, anticipating that Stevenson might be angered at being left out of the discussions over whether to invade Cuba, told Schlesinger that [...] "the integrity and credibility of Adlai Stevenson constitute one of our great national assets. I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that", and he asked Schlesinger to let Stevenson know that the president was shielding him from many of the details to protect him in case the clandestine operation failed. Instead, as Robert Dallek has written, [...] "by leaving him out of the discussion it led to his humiliation." [...] Unaware that the anti-Castro Cuban exiles landing at the Bay of Pigs were being armed and assisted directly by the CIA and US Navy, and that American pilots were participating in bombing raids of Cuban targets, Stevenson unwittingly [...] "repeated a CIA cover story in a speech before the UN General Assembly." [...] He argued that the rebels were not assisted in any way by the U.S. government; when this claim was proven to be false Stevenson complained that [...] "I took this job on the understanding that I would be consulted and kept fully informed on everything. Now my credibility has been compromised and therefore my usefulness." [...] When he told his friend Harlan Cleveland that his own government had [...] "deliberately tricked" [...] him into believing there was no direct American involvement in the invasion, Cleveland replied [...] "I feel as betrayed as you do." [...] Stevenson seriously considered resigning, but was convinced by his friends and President Kennedy to stay.|$|E
