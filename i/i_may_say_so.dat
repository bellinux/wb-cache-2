2500|$|Menzies oversaw an effusive {{welcome to}} Queen Elizabeth II {{on the first}} visit to Australia by a reigning monarch, in 1954. He made the {{following}} remarks during a light-hearted speech to an American audience in New York, while {{on his way to}} attend her coronation in 1953: [...] "We in Australia, of course, are British, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> to the boot heels...but we stand together–our people stand together –till the crack of doom." ...|$|E
2500|$|For all its reservations, the Bill was for Redmond the {{fulfilment}} of {{a lifelong}} dream. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> reverently", {{he told the}} House of Commons, [...] "I personally thank God that I have lived to see this day". But Asquith missed a magnificent opportunity, by failing to incorporate into the Bill any significant concessions to Ulster Unionists, who then campaigned relentlessly against it. Nonetheless by 1914 Redmond had become a nationalist hero of Parnellite stature and could have had every expectation of becoming head of a new Irish government in Dublin.|$|E
2500|$|From 1983 to 1985, Fischer was {{a member}} of the Bundestag for the Green party. His stint in federal {{parliament}} saw him frequently engage in a frank and confrontational debating style, exemplified by an incident on 18 October 1984, when he addressed Richard Stücklen, then vice president of the parliament, with the words: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> Mr. President, you are an asshole" [...] (German: [...] "Mit Verlaub, Herr Präsident, Sie sind ein Arschloch."). In 1985, Fischer became Minister for the Environment in the Landtag of Hesse in the first governmental Red-Green coalition between the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Greens. Fischer caused a stir when he appeared at his oath of office ceremony wearing trainers. These sneakers are now part of the shoe collection at the German Leather and Shoe Museum in Offenbach, Hesse.|$|E
60|$|MENTEITH. His Royal Highness, madam? <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> quite <b>so.</b> Mr. George {{will receive}} our gallant prince upon the Pantiles (looking at his watch) in, I should say, {{a matter of}} twelve minutes from now. Such, madam, is Mr. George's order of the day.|$|R
6000|$|A {{minute later}} he drew me aside. [...] "Excellent company your friend is, sir: most gentlemanly manners; but at times, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>so</b> <b>say,</b> not very gleg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have read}} what you said," [...] Bransome remarked. [...] "What we {{should like to}} hear, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> venture to <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> is what you left unsaid." ...|$|R
2500|$|NMPs {{were made}} a {{permanent}} feature of Parliament {{with effect from}} 1 July 2010. Prior to this change, Parliament had to decide within six months after every election whether to appoint NMPs. The rationale for the changes was given by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in Parliament on 27 May 2009. According to him, the main motivation behind having NMPs as a permanent {{part of the system}} of government in Singapore {{was the fact that the}} scheme had been a great success and had improved the quality of debate in the House: [...] "The scheme has worked well. The NMPs represent non-partisan alternative views in Parliament, and the NMPs have made effective contributions and raised the quality of debate in Parliament. Sometimes, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> they may have outshone even the Opposition MPs. This NMP scheme should be a permanent part of our political system." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{religious}} polemic {{of about}} this time complains bitterly of the oppression and extortion suffered by all but the richest Romans. Many wished to flee to the Bagaudae or even to foul-smelling barbarians. Although these men differ in customs and language from those with whom they have taken refuge, and are unaccustomed too, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> to the nauseous odor of the bodies and clothing of the barbarians, yet they prefer the strange life they find there to the injustice rife among the Romans. So you find men passing over everywhere, now to the Goths, now to the Bagaudae, or whatever other barbarians have established their power anywhere... We call those men rebels and utterly abandoned, whom we ourselves have forced into crime. For by what other causes were they made Bagaudae save by our unjust acts, the wicked decisions of the magistrates, the proscription and extortion {{of those who have}} turned the public exactions to the increase of their private fortunes and made the tax indictions their opportunity for plunder? ...|$|E
60|$|TREISURE. I trust {{they will}} not find a mare's nest, sir, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 3. Deduction, {{which takes}} {{us from the}} general {{proposition}} to facts again--teaches us, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>so</b> <b>say,</b> to anticipate from the ticket what is inside the bundle. And finally-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You forget, Lady Janet (if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> {{venture to}} <b>say</b> <b>so),</b> that the {{circumstances}} are changed. She {{took me by}} surprise on the last occasion; I am prepared for her now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A most perspicacious young lady!' he interjected, well pleased. 'I have {{investigated}} that point, {{and find it}} perfectly regular. Only, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> venture to <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> {{there should be no}} erasures.' ...|$|R
60|$|ERNEST (simply). Yes, John, I believe <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> I am {{unworthy of}} her, but I think I have touched her heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly disappointed, Little Bill, but sort o' ways scumbusticated, so to speak--perplexed, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> Kind o' ways puzzled, d'ee see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No, {{you were}} always your own self, unwise and {{reckless}} and with something in it kindred to mine, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> without offence.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well....ur...yes, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> {{venture to}} <b>say</b> <b>so</b> to a lady,' the old {{shoemaker}} answered hesitatingly, with unwonted gallantry. 'I should {{say they were}} a trifle, ur, just a trifle roseate, you know.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's YOU, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> respectfully, ecstatically <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> who are different. That's {{the point}} of it all. I'm not sure that {{anything}} so terrible really ought to happen to you as to know us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said Richie, [...] "in declaring {{your trust}} in me, {{you have done}} what is honourable to yourself, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> with humility <b>say</b> <b>so</b> much, and in no way undeserved on my side. Nevertheless, we must part." ...|$|R
60|$|P.S.--My {{best wishes}} and respects to Mrs. Moore;--she is beautiful. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> even to you, for I was never more struck with a countenance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not--I hope not. But you {{are beyond}} such influences. It seems to me, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> {{that you are}} beyond all influences." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must congratulate you, Inspector, on {{handling}} so {{distinctive and}} instructive a case. Your powers, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> without offence, seem superior to your opportunities." ...|$|E
60|$|There was my reply! Poor {{enough as}} a {{composition}} (I {{could write a}} much better letter now), it had, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> presume to <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> one merit. It was the honest expression of what I really meant and felt.|$|R
6000|$|In {{a moment}} after, the Countess Isabelle entered {{on the other}} side of the grate, and no sooner saw Quentin alone in the parlour, than she stopped short, and cast her eyes on the ground for the space of half a minute. [...] "Yet why should I be ungrateful," [...] she said, [...] "because others are {{unjustly}} suspicious?--My friend--my preserver, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> almost <b>say,</b> <b>so</b> much have I been beset by treachery, my only faithful and constant friend!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Talk {{to people}} a little, and smile sometimes. Move about quicker. Don't look {{when you come}} into a room {{as if you were}} consecrating it to tears. And, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> venture to <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> drop {{something}} of the heaviness of your mourning." ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN [again gallant] But surely, Mrs Lutestring, {{that has}} been your own fault. If <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> a lady of your attractions need never have been lonely.|$|E
60|$|CUSINS [cautiously] If <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> Lady Brit, I think Charles has rather happily {{expressed}} {{what we all}} feel. Homer, {{speaking of}} Autolycus, uses the same phrase.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{very glad}} to have the {{privilege}} of your acquaintance; and, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> you 'ave--you 'ave my 'earty sympathy. Good-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I speak, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> {{presume to}} <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> {{as one who}} has some little {{experience}} of such things,' said Traddles, 'being myself engaged to a young lady--one of ten, down in Devonshire--and seeing no probability, at present, of our engagement coming to a termination.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good God!' exclaimed Waverley, 'why {{should you}} {{anticipate}} such consequences from a union where birth is equal, where fortune is favourable, where, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> venture to <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> the tastes are similar, where you allege no preference for another, where you even express a favourable opinion of him whom you reject?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{brother of}} the Monastery called the World," [...] Kou-en {{answered}} in a severe voice, [...] "doubtless you are all winning merit, but, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> venture to <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> you are winning it very slowly, especially the woman--or the sorceress--or the mighty evil spirit--whose names I understand {{you to tell me}} are She, Hes, and Ayesha upon earth and in Avitchi, Star-that-hath-Fallen----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir. I fear you may {{possibly}} have {{to submit to}} {{a certain amount of}} good-natured chaff, but nothing more. All, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> is forgiven, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> Lady Ongar," [...] said Mrs. Clavering, [...] "I would not, if I were you, {{take any}} steps in so {{important}} a matter without advice." ...|$|E
60|$|It was no {{very great}} grief {{to me to}} do that, for he was, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> hardly worthy {{to have such a}} subaltern. I saluted, however, in silence.|$|E
6000|$|He {{stared at}} me with a sort of suspicion. 'Please don't tell me you think me like my sister,' he went on. 'For though, of course, every right-minded man feels--ur--a natural respect and affection for the members his family--bows, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>so</b> <b>say,</b> to the inscrutable decrees of Providence--which has mysteriously {{burdened}} him with them--still, there are points about Lady Georgina which I cannot conscientiously assert I approve of.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My Lady Graham," [...] {{the king}} said, [...] "this my good and {{faithful}} knight Sir Archie Forbes, whose person {{as well as}} repute is favourably known to you, desires to speak alone with the young lady under your protection. <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>say</b> he does <b>so</b> at my special begging, seeing that at times like these the sooner matters are put in a straight course the better. Will you let me lead you to the next room while we leave the young people together?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wrong in {{breaking}} with her!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "You {{would be doing}} wrong if you didn't,--wrong to yourself; wrong to your family; wrong, if <b>I</b> <b>may</b> venture to <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> to Daphne; wrong even {{in the long run}} to the girl herself; for she is not fitted for you, and she IS fitted for Reggie Nettlecraft. Now, do as I bid you. Sit down at once and write her a letter from my dictation." ...|$|R
