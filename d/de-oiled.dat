5|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the problem of the}} {{excessive}} growth of phumdis that affects the lake ecosystem and local community, a study sponsored by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets, which could be used to meet both energy demands within the region. Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% <b>de-oiled</b> rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E

50|$|Microcrystalline waxes are {{a type of}} wax {{produced}} by <b>de-oiling</b> petrolatum, {{as part of the}} petroleum refining process. In contrast to the more familiar paraffin wax which contains mostly unbranched alkanes, microcrystalline wax contains a higher percentage of isoparaffinic (branched) hydrocarbons and naphthenic hydrocarbons. It is characterized by the fineness of its crystals in contrast to the larger crystal of paraffin wax. It consists of high molecular weight saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. It is generally darker, more viscous, denser, tackier and more elastic than paraffin waxes, and has a higher molecular weight and melting point. The elastic and adhesive characteristics of microcrystalline waxes are related to the non-straight chain components which they contain. Typical microcrystalline wax crystal structure is small and thin, making them more flexible than paraffin wax. It is commonly used in cosmetic formulations.|$|R

40|$|Vacuum frying is an {{alternative}} processing method for producing high quality snacks with the advantages of lower processing temperature, enhanced organoleptic quality, and reduced acrylamide content. Vacuum frying (1. 33 kPa), {{with the aid of}} a deoiling mechanism, was used to produce low-fat potato chips. The kinetics of oil absorption and oil distribution in the potato chips (total, internal, and surface oil content) was studied so that effectiveness of the <b>de-oiling</b> system could be established. An analysis of product quality attributes (PQA) such as moisture content, oil content, microstructure, diameter shrinkage, and thickness expansion, as well as, bulk density, true density, and porosity of chips fried at different temperatures (120, 130, and 140 degrees C) was performed in order to evaluate the effect of process temperature on the product. Moreover, heat capacity of the chips and convective heat transfer coefficient at the oil-chip interface were determined for the same temperature range. The final oil content of the potato chips was 0. 072 ? 0. 004, 0. 062 ? 0. 003, and 0. 059 ? 0. 003 g/g solid for frying temperatures of 120, 130, and 140 degrees C, respectively. These values are lower (80 - 85 percent less) than those found in traditionally-fried potato chip which indicates that the <b>de-oiling</b> mechanism is crucial in vacuum frying processing. A significant difference (P< 0. 05) was observed in oil content and oil distribution within temperatures. It was found that the rate of change in PQAs is greatly affected by temperature; however, the final values of moisture content, bulk density, true density, porosity, diameter shrinkage, and thickness expansion were not affected by temperature. During vacuum frying, the specific heat of potato chips decreased with time as water decreases.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} Jatropha curcas kernel meal incorporated in poultry feed in Senegal. All experimentations were conducted in the experimental station of the National Superior School of Agriculture (ENSA) of Thies University (Senegal). In the same way, all chemical analyses were performed in the feed science laboratory of the Department of Animal Production of ENSA. The {{first part of this}} study was a description of toxic and anti-nutritional compounds present in J. curcas seed meal, which most important are phorbol esters, characteristics of Euphorbiaceae, known for its inflammatory effects, and curcin, a toxalbumin which manifested by an irritant action. Other compounds, also present, interfere more or less with digestive process in animals. Different treatments were applied, with different levels of success, to reduce or eliminate these toxic and anti-nutritional compounds for the valuation of this meal in animal feed. A particular emphasis was placed on the biological treatment, not only for a significant reduction of these compounds but also to improve the nutritional quality of the meal. The second part of this work has focused on the study of the effect of the J. curcas kernel meal obtained by chemical <b>de-oiling,</b> incorporated in corn at 4, 8, and 12 % and distributed to broiler chickens at the end their growth phase to assess their feed intake, their daily weight gain and diet digestibility. For all diets, feed intake was inversely influenced by the incorporation on the jatropha kernel meal, leading a weight gain decrease in animals that received the largest amounts of jatropha despite the absence of toxicity signs and mortality. Similarly, the apparent digestibility of each nutrient has been affected by the incorporation of jatropha kernel meal as well as the differential digestibility thereof. The low digestibility, especially protein was explained by the low availability of meal proteins incorporated corn, but also the presence of anti-nutritional and toxic factors still present in the diets used. The third part of this work has presented results of two experimentations conducted successively. The first one studied the effect of jatropha kernel meal obtained by a chemical <b>de-oiling,</b> incorporated in diets at 4 and 8 %, on broiler chickens performance during growing/finishing. The second experimentation studied the effect of the same cake that was heat treated before incorporated in diets at 8 %, on day-old broiler chicks’ performance. In one as the other experimentation, feed intake and daily weight gain were affected by the incorporation of jatropha kernel meal. It was the same for the total mortality rates recorded despite the absence of visible signs of toxicity. These experimentations confirmed other experimentations have shown that the <b>de-oiling</b> of jatropha kernel meal followed by heat treatment, even if it caused a significant reduction of anti-nutritional compounds, did not remove all the toxic factors that may even interfere with feed intake and weight gain of animals. These observations were not confirmed in the fourth part, which studied the effects of jatropha kernel meal obtained by chemical <b>de-oiling,</b> subject to heat treatment then biological treatment with Aspergillus niger and incorporated in diets at 8 %, on day-old broiler chicks performance. Indeed, the feed intake, the weight gain as well as the viability of animals were not affected by the incorporation of jatropha. These successive studies were among the first which interested the same animal species at different levels of development based on a product whose nutritional quality is proven, but has toxic and anti-nutritional factors could not be completely eliminated despite different treatments applied. The application of heat treatment may have helped to reduce some anti-nutritional compounds (curcin and trypsin inhibitor) but without improve feed intake and weight gain. Considering the reaction of animals subjected to diet, biological and heat treatments may have reduced the toxicity of jatropha kernel meal, which has afected the feed intake of animals and thus the weight gain. This study showed that, despite its nutritional level, J. curcas kernel meal presented limitations in its use as a raw material that can integrate a ration for broilers in Senegal but hopes remain with biological treatments...|$|R
40|$|For oil {{production}} under high water cut conditions the efforts needed for <b>de-oiling</b> {{of the production}} water are mainly determined by the oil-droplet-size distribution of this water.

In growing cattle diets, diet concentration of modified distillers grains plus solubles (MDGS) impacted cattle performance more than oil content. Ending BW, ADG, and G:F did not differ between cattle fed <b>de-oiled</b> or full fat MDGS, however cattle fed <b>de-oiled</b> MDGS had lower DMI than those fed full fat MDGS. No significant differences in fiber digestibility were observed between <b>de-oiled</b> and full fat MDGS treatments.

5000|$|The {{first step}} in making {{paraffin}} wax is to remove the oil (<b>de-oiling</b> or de-waxing) from the slack wax. The oil is separated through crystallization. Most commonly, the slack wax is heated, mixed {{with one or more}} solvents such as a ketone and then cooled. As it cools wax crystallizes out of the solution, leaving only oil in the solution. This mixture is filtered into two streams: solid (wax plus some solvent) and liquid (oil and solvent). After the solvent is recovered by distillation, the resulting products are called [...] "product wax" [...] (or [...] "press wax") and [...] "foots oil". The lower the percentage of oil in the wax the more refined it is considered (semi-refined versus fully refined). The product wax may be further processed to remove colors and odors. The wax may finally be blended together to give certain desired properties such as melt point and penetration. Paraffin wax is sold in either liquid or solid form.|$|R

50|$|An {{oil water}} {{separation}} hydrocyclone is a device designed to separate oil from water {{by the use}} of a strong vortex. These separators are passive (no moving parts) and resemble long tapered pipes. They typically contain an inlet section, long tapered section and a long outlet section. In operation the strong vortex is created when the oily water is injected tangentially into the inlet end of the separator. This creates a centrifugal force, that accelerates as it moves down the tapered cone. The centripetal and centrifugal forces separate the heavier water component to the outside of the vortex while the lighter oil droplets are forced to the centre. The separated oils are removed through an orifice at the inlet end of the cone and treated water is discharged through the opposite end. The centrifugal forces generated inside the vortex of the better <b>de-oiling</b> hydrocyclone separators are of the order of 1,000 times the force of gravity.

At 750 RPM for 10 s, 40 s, and 60 s the oil-content was reduced by 38 %, 44 %, and 51 %, respectively. The convective heat transfer coefficient (h) of the frying oil was determined at 120 ?C and 140 ?C using the lumped capacitance method. The h-values were 217 ? 13 W/m 2 K (120 ?C) and 258 ? 37 W/m 2 K (140 ?C) using a copper-ball thermocouple. The h- values increased to 3. 6 times during the boiling period. COMSOLTM Multiphysics was used to model the heat transfer in the vacuum fryer pan. Based on the simulation results, a 1. 5 cm thick insulation material was installed in the fryer to reduce the energy losses. The refrigeration system operates at Tevap = - 26 ?C and Tcond = 50 ?C with 26 ?C sub-cooling. Sensitivity analysis showed that the system Coefficient of Performance (COP) was about 3. 87 at these conditions and compressor power requirement (CPR) was 74 W (85 % efficiency) when frying 30 g of potatoes slices. The best results were obtained at Tevap = - 10 ?C and Tcond = 40 ?C with 26 ?C sub-cooling and superheat of 5 ?C. The predicted COP was 4 and the CPR 70 W.

There {{were no significant differences}} in growth parameters between all treatments containing JKM, however, regression analysis revealed a significant negative correlation of JKM content to final weight and specific growth rate. The 70 % and 100 % replacement levels showed higher body lipid and significantly lower ash content. JKM is a promising alternative protein source in aquaculture diets for tilapia, though slower growth in this experiment suggests the need for further research to improve the nutritional value of JKM...|$|R
40|$|BPF {{developed}} {{the concept of}} a mobile, on-site NORM remediation and disposal process in late 1993. Working with Conoco and receiving encouragement born the Department of Energy, Metarie Office, and the Texas Railroad Commission the corporation conducted extensive feasibility studies on an on-site disposal concept. In May 1994, the Department of Energy issued a solicitation for cooperative agreement proposal for, "Development and Testing of a Method for Treatment and Underground Disposal of Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM) ". BPF submitted a proposal to the solicitation in July 1994, and was awarded a cooperative agreement in September 1995. BPF proposed and believed that proven equipment and technology could be incorporated in to a mobile system. The system would allow BPF to demonstrate an environmentally sound and commercially affordable method for treatment and underground disposal of NORM. The key stop in the BPF process incorporates injection of the dissolved radioactive materials into a water injection or disposal well. Disposal costs in the BPF proposal of July 1995 were projected to range from $ 1000 to $ 5000 per cubic yard. The process included four separate steps.

40|$|Cattle fed a <b>de-oiled</b> wet distiller’s grains plus {{solubles}} (WDGS) diet {{were compared}} to cattle fed corn or traditional (full-fat) WDGS diets to determine effects on discoloration, oxidation, and tenderness of beef aged for seven and 21 days. At seven days of aging, dietary treatment {{had no effect on}} discoloration. At 21 days of aging, beef from cattle fed <b>de-oiled</b> WDGS had less oxidation than the corn control and several of the full-fat WDGS treatments. Although tenderness increased with aging and retail display, dietary treatment had no effect on tenderness. These findings suggest that these dietary treatments, followed by a short aging period, don’t have a large impact on shelf life stability and oxidation, but with prolonged aging periods and retail display, feeding <b>de-oiled</b> WDGS can reduce oxidation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} was to determine and compare the digestibility of crude protein (CP) and amino acids (AA) in full-oil (no oil extracted) and <b>de-oiled</b> (oil extracted) corn distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) with different condensed distillers solubles (CDS) ratios. Six barrows (29. 6 ± 2. 3 kg) fitted with ileal T-cannula were allotted into a 6 × 6 Latin square design. Each period was comprised of a 5 -d adaption period followed by a 2 -d collection of ileal digesta. The five test diets contained 62 % DDGS as the sole source of AA. A nitrogen-free diet {{was used to measure}} the basal endogenous losses of CP and AA. Chromic oxide (0. 3 %) was used as an index in each diet. The results showed that CP and AA were very similar in 5 DDGS, but the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of lysine (from 56. 16 % to 71. 15 %) and tryptophan (from 54. 90 % to 68. 38 %) had the lowest values and largest variation within the essential AA, which suggests reduced availability of AA and different levels of Maillard reactions in the five DDGS. The apparent ileal digestibility and SID of CP and most of AA in full-oil DDGS (sources 1 and 2) were greater (p 0. 05) than full-oil with high CDS ratio DDGS (source 2); however, the SID of most AA of <b>de-oiled</b> with low CDS ratios DDGS (source 3) were non-significantly lower (p> 0. 05) than <b>de-oiled</b> with high CDS ratio DDGS (source 4); and the <b>de-oiled</b> DDGS with middle CDS ratio (source 5) but with different drying processing had the lowest SID AA values. In conclusion, <b>de-oiled</b> DDGS had lower SID of CP and AA than full-oil DDGS; a higher CDS ratio tended to decrease the SID of AA in full-oil DDGS but not in <b>de-oiled</b> DDGS; and compared with CDS ratio, processing, especially drying, may have more of an effect on AA digestibility of DDGS...|$|E

Oil removal had no impact on DM, OM, or NDF digestibility in steers fed CDS or MDGS. However, steers fed <b>de-oiled</b> CDS had a lower fat digestibility than steers fed normal CDS. Average ruminal pH was lower for steers fed <b>de-oiled</b> MDGS than for steers fed normal MDGS, however no difference within CDS was observed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{sample of}} Lar Mountain Phosphate deposit {{which is located}} in the {{southwest}} of Iran, was studied to upgrade its phosphate grade. The results obtained from mineralogical studies showed the presence of apatite, CaO, Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3 and SiO 2, in which carbonate was detected as the main gangue. Two sets of direct and reverse flotation tests were performed using samples from this deposit with 10 % P 2 O 5. In phosphate flotation (direct approach), the samples were conditioned with sodium silica, oleic acid-fuel oil and Armac T-fuel oil. The direct flotation at pH= 9. 2 yielded a product with 23. 2 % of P 2 O 5 and 75. 16 % recovery. The reverse flotation tests were carried out at pH= 5. 2, with floating carbonate and pulp <b>de-oiling,</b> using H 2 SO 4 and wash water, and phosphate was then floated from siliceous gangue. In the second sets of the reverse approach, depressing the phosphate and floating silica with Amines in natural pH were done. However the best concentrate assay was 31. 2 % P 2 O 5 with a 71. 12 % recovery, which was obtained from reverse tests...|$|R
40|$|Among the all {{parameters}} {{affecting the}} performance of a downhole <b>de-oiling</b> hydrocyclone, the investigation of internal flow field deserves more attempts especially in the petroleum industry. In this study, the effects of inlet flow rate, inlet oil volume fraction, and oil droplet diameter on the separation efficiency and pressure drop ratio have been investigated along the hydrocyclone body. All the simulations were performed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, in which the Eulerian multiphase model and the Reynolds stress turbulent model were employed for the prediction of multiphase and turbulent flow parameters through the hydrocyclone. The velocity component profiles, separation efficiency, pressure drop, and volume fraction are also other parameters which have been considered in this work. The results of the simulations illustrate good agreement with the reported experimental data. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that the separation efficiency almost increases twofold, when the droplet diameter increases from 25 to 50 micron. The effect of inlet flow rate on the separation efficiency is so significant that an increase in inlet flow rate from 5 to 25 l/min causes a sharp increase in the separation efficiency and raises it 2. 5 times the initial value. However, the inlet oil volume fraction showed a minor effect on the hydrodynamic flow behavior in the hydrocyclone body compared to the other investigated parameters...|$|R
40|$|Rapeseed meal is the {{co-product}} of {{the pressing}} and <b>de-oiling</b> process of rapeseed seeds {{and is used}} as animal feed. Most of phenolic compounds remain in the meal after processing the seeds. While sinapine (sinapoyl choline), sinapoyl glucose and sinapic acid are naturally present in the seed, canolol (4 -vinylsyringol) is formed during processes of pressing, oil extraction and roasting treatments via decarboxylation of sinapic acid. Canolol was recently described as a free-radical scavenger with various biological activities. One of the objectives of this work was the valorization of rapeseed meal {{as a source of}} canolol, this latter being produced through the transformation of sinapine and sinapic acid under hydration and roasting processes applicable at industrial scale. The parameters studied for the rapeseed meal processing were: (i) time of incubation after hydration: 0, 2 and 18 h and, (ii) thermal treatment: high-temperature steam (105 °– 160 °C) or microwave roasting (160 °– 180 °C). It was concluded that temperature, and exposure time in case of microwaves, were the most important factors in increasing concentrations of canolol in rapeseed meal. Incubation time after hydration did not influence the total phenolic compounds content suggesting the absence of endogenous enzymatic hydrolysis. However, it showed a particular contribution in sinapine, sinapic acid and canolol transformation during the microwave treatment. Finally, whatever the treatment, only a part of the sinapic acid initially present or generated during the processes, was converted into canolol. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
