40|$|Background. Palm oil is {{commonly}} consumed in Asia. Repeatedly <b>heating</b> the <b>oil</b> {{is very common}} during food processing. Aim. This study is aimed {{to report on the}} risk of atherosclerosis due to the reheated oil consumption. Material and Methods. Twenty four male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into control, fresh-oil, 5 times heated-oil and 10 times heated-oil feeding groups. <b>Heated</b> palm <b>oil</b> was prepared by frying sweet potato at 180 °C for 10 minutes. The ground standard rat chows were fortified with the <b>heated</b> <b>oils</b> and fed it to the rats for six months. Results. Tunica intima thickness in aorta was significantly increased in 10 times heated-oil feeding group (P< 0. 05), revealing a huge atherosclerotic plaque with central necrosis projecting into the vessel lumen. Repeatedly <b>heated</b> <b>oil</b> feeding groups also revealed atherosclerotic changes including mononuclear cells infiltration, thickened subendothelial layer, disrupted internal elastic lamina and smooth muscle cells fragmentation in tunica media of the aorta. Conclusion. The usage of repeated <b>heated</b> <b>oil</b> is the predisposing factor of atherosclerosis leading to cardiovascular diseases.

In the medium with waste oil the PHB concentration decreased from 0.95 to 0.65 g/l after 48 hours, while the heated-oil curve continued to rise to about 1.0 g/l.

40|$|Background: Poor {{control of}} blood {{pressure}} leads to hypertension {{which is a}} major risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease. The present study aimed to explore possible mechanisms of elevation in blood pressure following consumption of <b>heated</b> vegetable <b>oil.</b> Methods: Forty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into six groups: Group I (control) - normal rat chow, Group II - fresh soy oil, Group III - soy <b>oil</b> <b>heated</b> once, Group IV - soy <b>oil</b> <b>heated</b> twice, Group V - soy <b>oil</b> <b>heated</b> five times, Group VI - soy <b>oil</b> <b>heated</b> ten times. Blood pressure was measured at the baseline level and at a monthly interval for six months. Plasma nitric oxide, heme oxygenase and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were measured prior to treatment, at month-three and month-six later. At the end of treatment, the rats were sacrificed and thoracic aortas were taken for measurement of vascular reactivity. Results: Blood pressure increased significantly (p < 0. 01) in the repeatedly <b>heated</b> <b>oil</b> groups compared to the control and fresh soy oil groups. Consumption of diet containing repeatedly <b>heated</b> <b>oil</b> resulted higher plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme level and lower nitric oxide content and heme oxygenase concentration.
