5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf Hallermayer of the University of Munich. Of the amatoxins, α-amanitin is the chief component and along with β-amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects. Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism <b>grind</b> <b>to</b> a halt and the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, {{as it is the}} organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible. The RNA polymerase of Amanita phalloides is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself.|$|E
5|$|By 24 November, Potiorek was {{predicting}} that Serbia would be defeated {{within a matter}} of days and appointed Stjepan Sarkotić to be the country's governor once it was occupied. The Austro-Hungarians made further gains on 25 November, forcing the Serbian Army from Čovka and Vrače Brdo with an intense artillery bombardment. On 26 November, they attempted to cross the Kolubara at its junction with the Sava River and managed to do so in their initial attack. The Serbs soon counterattacked and forced the invaders back, inflicting 50 percent casualties on the Austro-Hungarians and causing their offensive to <b>grind</b> <b>to</b> a halt. On 27 November, the Serbian Army attacked Čovka and Vrače Brdo and succeeded in forcing the Austro-Hungarians out.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} <b>grind</b> <b>to,</b> still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It is a place where you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E

5|$|Walt Disney Productions {{first began}} {{exploring}} a possible live action/animation biography film of author and poet Hans Christian Andersen sometime in late 1937 before the December premiere of its film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first feature-length hand-drawn animated film ever made. In March 1940, Walt Disney suggested a co-production to film producer Samuel Goldwyn, where Goldwyn's studio would shoot the live-action sequences of Andersen's life and Disney's studio would animate Andersen's fairy tales. The animated sequences {{would be based}} on some of Andersen's best known works, such as The Little Mermaid, The Little Match Girl, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, The Snow Queen, Thumbelina, The Ugly Duckling, The Red Shoes, and The Emperor's New Clothes. However, the studio encountered difficulty with The Snow Queen, as it could not find a way to adapt and relate the Snow Queen character to modern audiences. Even {{as far back as the}} 1930s and 1940s, it was clear that the source material contained great cinematic possibilities, but the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic. After the United States entered World War II, the studio began to focus on making wartime propaganda, which caused development on the Disney–Goldwyn project to <b>grind</b> <b>to</b> a halt in 1942. Goldwyn went on to produce his own live-action film version in 1952, entitled Hans Christian Andersen, with Danny Kaye as Andersen, Charles Vidor directing, Moss Hart writing, and Frank Loesser penning the songs. All of Andersen's fairy tales were, instead, told in song and ballet in live-action, like the rest of the film. It went on to receive six Academy Award nominations the following year. Back at Disney, The Snow Queen, along with other Andersen fairy tales (including The Little Mermaid), were shelved.|$|E

25|$|The Winter Line {{proved a}} major {{obstacle}} to the Allies {{at the end of}} 1943, halting the Fifth Army's advance on the western side of Italy. Although the Gustav Line was penetrated on the Eighth Army's Adriatic front, and Ortona captured, blizzards, drifting snow and zero visibility at the end of December caused the advance to <b>grind</b> <b>to</b> a halt. The Allies' focus then turned to the western front, where an attack through the Liri valley was considered to have the best chance of a breakthrough towards the Italian capital. Landings at Anzio during Operation Shingle, advocated by the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, behind the line were intended to destabilise the German Gustav line defences, but the early thrust inland to cut off the German defences did not occur, thanks to the indecisiveness of the American commander (Major General John P. Lucas), and the Anzio forces became bottled up in their beachhead. Lucas was replaced by Major General Lucian Truscott.|$|E
500|$|Writing for TouchArcade, Karl Burnett {{said the}} {{restricted}} set of environments made the game {{a bit of}} <b>grind</b> <b>to</b> play. He did praise the game's sense of speed and physics model however; {{he believed that the}} car handling and physics identically matched the first two iterations of the series. He concluded that it was a satisfactory game that was ultimately held back by the limited amount of content in the package. VideoGamer.com writer Pete Worth considered the game to be too difficult, highlighting that it had [...] "limited appeal" [...] amongst players who were not rally fans or dedicated to racing games. Slide to Play also agreed that the challenge posed by the game would by enjoyed by hardcore players but might be off-putting for a beginner. They identified some performance issues but ultimately thought that Codemasters had effectively transitioned the series from console to mobile devices.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy VIII used an {{experience}} point and level system {{quite different from}} previous games in the series. [...] While EXP is awarded after battling and defeating enemies, who are predominantly encountered randomly, {{and contribute to the}} continued strengthening and level-gaining of the characters, here the similarity ends. [...] While previous levels required ever-increasing amounts of EXP to surmount (e.g. getting to level 2 might require 200 experience points, level 3 required 400, etc.), FF8 characters gain a level after accumulating a flat rate of 1000 points per level. [...] Enemies around the world gain levels averaging with the party's average level. [...] Higher-level enemies are capable of inflicting and withstanding significantly more damage, may have additional special attacks, and carry additional magic spells, allowing for Junctioning bonuses which themselves far exceed the bonuses imparted by level-gain. [...] The game's unique EXP and level system allows a player to <b>grind</b> <b>to</b> maximum Level 100 before even beginning the plot.|$|E

Additionally, the team looked closely at the bugs found by Japanese players and attempted to replicate every reported bug.

Unfortunately, the one-hit kill option did not apply to the bosses, so debuggers still had to <b>grind</b> <b>to</b> gain enough levels to defeat the bosses. In total, six official testers found 104 system-type bugs and 259 text bugs.|$|E

[...] It ended up taking Johnston 3 days to move his army just 23 miles. This was a significant setback for the Confederate Army, as the originally scheduled attack would have commenced when Buell's Army of the Ohio was too far away to be of any aid to Grant. [...] Instead, it would happen on the 6th with Buell's army close at hand and able to re-enforce Grant on the second day. [...] Furthermore, the delay left the Confederate Army desperately short of rations. [...] They had issued their troops 5 days of rations just before leaving Corinth, but failure to properly conserve their food intake and the 2-day delay left most troops completely out rations by the time the battle commenced.|$|E
