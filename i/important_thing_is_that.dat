5|$|After {{interrogation}} by Doggett, Purnell {{confesses to}} snatching Billy in 1990 {{on behalf of}} someone else. Doggett recognizes Purnell was also a victim, and with enough prodding, gets a name: Cal Jeppy. The police and the two FBI agents go to Jeppy’s home and find Josh in a compartment under {{the floor of his}} horse trailer. Doggett chases Jeppy into the woods, catches him, and discovers the skull of Billy that Purnell dug up earlier. As the Underwoods stand over the shallow grave of their long dead son, Scully and Doggett discuss the case. Scully believes it was justice from beyond the grave and that the <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it saved Josh Underwood.|$|E

A character who is appealing is not necessarily sympathetic – villains or monsters can also be appealing – the <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the viewer feels the character is real and interesting. There are several tricks for making a character connect better with the audience; for likable characters a symmetrical or particularly baby-like face tends to be effective. A complicated or hard to read face will lack appeal, it may more accurately be described as 'captivation' {{in the composition of}} the pose, or the character design.|$|E

It fired two different mortar bombs, a light 3.265 kg bomb {{to a range of}} 3400 m and a heavy 6.85 kg bomb to 1200 m. It broke down into three loads, barrel, baseplate and tripod, for transport.

25|$|The cosmic {{experiment}} {{envisioned by}} Wheeler {{could be described}} either as analogous to the interferometer experiment or as analogous to a double-slit experiment. The <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> by a third kind of device, a massive stellar object acting as a gravitational lens, photons from a source can arrive by two pathways. Depending on how phase differences between wavefunction pairs are arranged, correspondingly different kinds of interference phenomena can be observed. Whether to merge the incoming wavefunctions or not, and how to merge the incoming wavefunctions can be controlled by experimenters. There are none of the phase differences introduced into the wavefunctions by the experimental apparatus as {{there are in the}} laboratory interferometer experiments, so despite there being no double-slit device near the light source, the cosmic experiment is closer to the double-slit experiment. However, Wheeler planned for the experiment to merge the incoming wavefunctions by use of a beam splitter.|$|E

[...] The FA also intended to prevent any interference made by the Charity Commission into where money raised by the game should go.

After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her {{white blood cell count}} halved.

This episode is nearly everything a Fringe fan could have asked for... Besides the awesomeness with the Bishops, Olivia finally returns to taking an active role in an episode... But the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the overarching Fringe plot finally progressed, and it's going in a pretty damn good direction". Jane Boursaw from TV Squad enjoyed the episode because it had a [...] "few reveals and a nice cliffhanger." [...] She liked the interactions between Walter and Peter, and also praised the scene between Olivia and Newton. Josh Wigler of MTV was pleased that the [...] "mystery of the week" [...] also tied into the ongoing plot, and that answers were provided to certain mysteries, such as why Walter's behavior and personality is [...] "a little...off.

[...] Art-wise it was compared to Dear Brother and The Rose of Versailles by Anime News Network's Lynzee Lamb, who said it [...] "reinforces {{a lot of the}} dangerous work ethic that permeates sports series, like battling through a serious injury or abandoning emotional 'dalliances' like romance." ...|$|E
500|$|On 30 March 2005 the BBC {{confirmed}} that Eccleston {{would not be}} staying in the role for a second series, claiming that he was scared of being typecast. On 4 April they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post in 2010, Eccleston denied that he left due to fear of being typecast. He stated that he [...] "didn't enjoy {{the environment and the}} culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in" [...] and {{that he did not want}} to do any more based on the experience. He said, [...] "I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt.|$|E

As it was {{traveling}} in March 2007, pulling the dead wheel behind, the wheel scraped off the upper layer of the Martian soil, uncovering a patch of ground that scientists say shows evidence of a past environment that would have been perfect for microbial life. It is similar to areas on Earth where water or steam from hot springs came into contact with volcanic rocks. On Earth, these are locations that tend to teem with bacteria, said rover chief scientist Steve Squyres. [...] "We're really excited about this," [...] he told a meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU). The area is extremely rich in silica–the main ingredient of window glass. The researchers have now concluded that the bright material must have been produced in one of two ways. One: hot-spring deposits produced when water dissolved silica at one location and then carried it to another (i.e. a geyser). Two: acidic steam rising through cracks in rocks [...] stripped them of their mineral components, leaving silica behind. [...] "The <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> whether it is one hypothesis or the other, the implications for the former habitability of Mars are pretty much the same," [...] Squyres explained to BBC News.
