50|$|In economics, an <b>implicit</b> <b>cost,</b> {{also called}} an imputed cost, implied cost, or {{notional}} cost, {{is the opportunity}} cost equal to what a firm must give up {{in order to use}} a factor of production for which it already owns and thus does not pay rent. It is the opposite of an explicit cost, which is borne directly. In other words, an <b>implicit</b> <b>cost</b> is any cost that results from using an asset instead of renting it out or selling it. The term also applies to foregone income from choosing not to work.|$|E

40|$|A {{model to}} value the total {{economic}} cost of managing a defined benefits pension plan using an options approach is presented. The total cost combines both explicit <b>costs</b> and <b>implicit</b> <b>costs.</b> The explicit costs are the contributions {{made by the}} corporation or a governmental entity to fund the future benefit obligation. The <b>implicit</b> <b>costs</b> are those incurred by not meeting the plan sponsor’s objectives. These costs are represented by a collection of real options that the plan sponsor has the flexibility to manage through the asset allocation process. The <b>implicit</b> <b>costs</b> can also be viewed as agency costs that the plan sponsor incurs in managing the plan’s assets. ...|$|R
40|$|Agents' {{decisions}} to exert effort {{depends on the}} provided incentives {{as well as the}} potential costs for doing so. So far most of the attention has been on the incentive side. However, our lab experiments underline that both the incentive and cost side can be used separately to shape work performance. In our experiment, subjects work on a real-effort task. Between treatments, we vary the incentive scheme used for compensating workers. Additionally, by varying the available outside options, we explore the role of <b>implicit</b> <b>costs</b> of effort in determining workers' performance. We observe that incentive contracts and <b>implicit</b> <b>costs</b> interact in a non-trivial manner. Performance reacts significantly to changes in <b>implicit</b> effort <b>costs</b> under low-powered piece-rate and target-based bonus contracts, but not under a high piece rate contract. In addition, comparisons between the incentive schemes depend crucially on the <b>implicit</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{measures}} and benchmarks {{are used in}} transaction cost analysis. The multitude of definitions for best execution and the dangers inherent in placing {{too much emphasis on}} a single statistic necessitate the ability to compare agents to a diverse set of benchmarks. These comparisons allow costs to be split into several categories, including explicit cost, <b>implicit</b> <b>cost,</b> delay cost, and opportunity cost. The accurate measurement of each of these costs is necessary to facilitate decision management. For example, if the combination of explicit and implicit costs, which represent the realized cost of transacting, is greater than the opportunity cost of not transacting, it suggests that trades may have been executed too quickly. If the reverse is true, it suggests the need to execute more quickly.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) {{adoption}} increases, the question whether SaaS is the right choice for an organization is still open. The main objective {{of this study is}} to propose the Software Licensing Selection Support (SL 2 S) model for selecting a SaaS Licensing (SaaSL) model or a Perpetual Software Licensing (PSL) model. The SL 2 S model considers different types of criteria under Green IT policies and sustainable IT resource conditions proposed in the literature. Based on the criteria that influence the selection of the software licensing type, we perform a sensitivity analysis, to understand the dependencies between explicit cost, <b>implicit</b> <b>cost,</b> and energy consumption. To validate the model, we constructed a scenario, in which a medium-sized company has to decide on a software licensing model. The scenario and its parameters were populated with data about CRM solutions of Salesforce. com and Microsoft, the SME definition of the European Commission, and several case studies. The results show that <b>implicit</b> <b>cost</b> criteria (25 % of SaaSLM) are major decision factors. It suggests that a sustainable IT policy cannot only consider lowering cost (as a mean for lowering energy consumption) but also has to re-evaluate its relation to <b>implicit</b> <b>cost</b> criteria.

40|$|Liquidity {{fragmentation}} {{occurs when}} traders have choices in trading fungible securities. This article documents {{the migration of}} Dow futures’ liquidity from the pit to the electronic market. The implied spread declines dramatically for electronic trades as volume increases over a sample period from April 2002 through December 2004. This <b>implicit</b> <b>cost,</b> despite dwindling volume, does not increase for trades in the pit but drops by about $ 13 per trade. This somewhat surprising result suggests that competition for order flows brings about positive externality within the same exchange. Seller-initiated trades tend to have higher costs on both trading platforms. The <b>implicit</b> <b>cost</b> difference between a buyer-initiated trade and a seller-initiated trade is economically significant.

In this paper, we propose a class of simple, flexible algorithms, called LambdaRank, which avoids these difficulties by working with <b>implicit</b> <b>cost</b> functions. We describe LambdaRank using neural network models, although the idea applies to any differentiable function class. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the resulting <b>implicit</b> <b>cost</b> function to be convex, and we show that the general method has a simple mechanical interpretation. We demonstrate significantly improved accuracy, over a state-of-the-art ranking algorithm, on several datasets. We also show that LambdaRank provides a method for significantly speeding up the training phase of that ranking algorithm. Although this paper is directed towards ranking, the proposed method can be extended to any non-smooth and multivariate cost functions. ...|$|E

40|$|We try to {{quantify}} the effect of working conditions on retirement behaviour by estimating an <b>implicit</b> <b>cost</b> of keeping on working in a bad job. The cost {{is measured by the}} amount of the increase in retirement pension that the employee would claim to accept to postpone the date on which he intends to retire. We use data of a specific survey on employees aged 54 to 59 years and working in the private sector. They were required to state their preferences while reacting to various scenarios of retirement. We construct an indicator of bad working conditions from the answers provided by the employee to questions on job satisfaction and health status. We find that to compensate for the disutility of keeping on working one year more in a bad job it would be necessary to increase the retirement pension by roughly 10 %. In other words a worker facing bad working conditions will accept postponing retirement with an increase of his pension 10 points higher than the one requested by an employee in a good job. retirement decision; working conditions; stated preferences; <b>implicit</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{existing}} literature on fisheries bycatch {{has focused on the}} technological aspects of hycatch control. By contrast, there has been precious little consideration of the role of incentives in fostering or hindering bycatch avoidance and even less thought to the incentive structures found in many real-world fisheries. This thesis addresses this gap by developing analytical and empirical models for a particular case study: the flatfish fisheries of the Eastern Bering Sea. These fisheries are managed under a system of multiple common pool quotas on bycatch and target species enforced by quota-triggered closures. We develop a game theoretic model to explain how this system fosters suboptimal bycatch avoidance behavior due to fishermen's inability to fully capture the benefits of bycatch avoidance. We derive the bycatch penalty that aligns private incentives with the rent-maximizing solution and find, surprisingly, that this penalty must increase with improvements in the bycatch efficiency of the harvesting technology. We then develop an empirical discrete choice model of fishing location choice at a fine level of spatial and temporal resolution in order to reveal the <b>implicit</b> <b>cost</b> of bycatch to fishermen. We uncover substantial avoidance in the waning moments of the season but little otherwise. This avoidance is driven by a number of theoretically important factors on the fishing grounds. Even at its greatest, the <b>implicit</b> <b>cost</b> attached to bycatch is well below its value to the entire fleet. We also find substantial evidence that the common property quota system fosters excessive inertia in the movements of vessels over the fishing grounds. Finally, we combine several modeling approaches to weigh the success of a voluntary program of information sharing and hycatch avoidance. The presence of data {{both before and after the}} program's inception and the initial nonparticipation of one cohort of vessels make our problem amenable to several variants of the difference-in-differences approach. Ultimately we find no basis for a positive impact of the voluntary program upon either bycatch outcomes or the <b>implicit</b> <b>cost</b> of bycatch to participating fishermen. We close by considering a number of hypotheses for the apparent failure of the cooperative program...|$|E
