The one mounts his mailed steed and clanks his long sword against his iron stirrup, riding forth into the world with a feeling that he can do anything that pleases him, if he finds himself strong enough.

[...] Despite this light criticism, he nevertheless added, [...] "But in its quietly beautiful, introspective way it touches on {{a whole range of}} musical worlds, from late Brahms to Arvo Pärt." [...] Also writing for The Guadian, the music critic Kate Molleson remarked, [...] "Abrahamsen's recent language is less urgently polemical, more suggestive, and here he uses the orchestra to paint wide, subtle landscapes on to which the soloists place delicate but definite sound objects. The piece spirits away - a classic Abrahamsen move leaving us in lingering mystery." [...] In an article for The Herald, Molleson further wrote: It would be foolish ... to mistake the succinctness and natural, almost naive imagery in Abrahamsen's music for any lack of technical sophistication. Take the Double Concerto: on the surface it sounds simple, organic and clean, but its construction is glitteringly intricate. Tonality mingles with atonality; conventional tuning slips into just intonation; two tempos coexist and tropes from as far back as Bach filter into the mix. This isn't simplicity at all, but it is all part of that calm synthesis <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier.</b> Terms like 'magical', 'mysterious' and 'elusive' are often used describe Abrahamsen's music, and for good reason.

Four years earlier I happened to be in Weimar at the home of Princess Wittgenstein - a devoted friend of Liszt, and a woman of character and intelligence who has often given me support in my darkest hours. I was led to talk of my admiration for Virgil and of the idea I had formed of a great opera, designed on Shakespearean lines, for which Books Two and Four of the Aeneid would provide the subject-matter. I added that I was all too aware of the pain that such an undertaking would inevitably cause me ever to embark on it. [...] "Indeed, the princess replied, the conjunction of your passion for Shakespeare and your love of antiquity must result in the creation of something grand and novel. You must write this opera, this lyric poem; call it what you like and plan it as you wish. You must start work on it and bring it to completion." [...] As I persisted in my refusal: [...] "Listen, said the princess, if you shrink before the hardships that it is bound to cause you, if you are so weak as to be afraid of the work and will not face everything for the sake of Dido and Cassandra, then never come back here, for I {{do not want to see}} you ever again." [...] This was more than enough to decide me. Once back in Paris I started to write the lines for the poem of Les Troyens. Then I set to work on the score, and after three and a half years of corrections, changes, additions etc., everything was finished. As I was polishing the work over and over again, after giving numerous readings of the poem in different places, listening to the comments made by various listeners and benefiting from them to the best of my ability, I decided to write the following letter to the Emperor: ...|$|E
5000|$|... :This {{gives some}} insight into the scope of Parliament's {{legislative}} jurisdiction over railways {{and the manner in which}} it is charged with the responsibility of weighing both the national and local socio-economic ramifications of its decisions. Moreover, it cannot be seriously questioned that Parliament may deal with biophysical environmental concerns touching upon the operation of railways so long as it is legislation relating to railways. This could involve issues such as emission standards or noise abatement provisions.:To continue with the example, one might postulate the location and construction of a new line which would require approval under the relevant provisions of the Railway Act. [...] That line may cut through ecologically sensitive habitats such as wetlands and forests. The possibility of derailment may pose a serious hazard to the health and safety of nearby communities if dangerous commodities are to be carried on the line. On the other hand, it may bring considerable economic benefit to those communities through job creation and the multiplier effect that will have in the local economy. The regulatory authority might require that the line circumvent residential districts in the interests of noise abatement and safety. In my view, all of these considerations may validly be taken into account in arriving at a final decision on whether or not to grant the necessary approval. To suggest otherwise would lead to the most astonishing results, and it defies reason to assert that Parliament is constitutionally barred from weighing the broad environmental repercussions, including socio-economic concerns, when legislating with respect to decisions of this nature.:The same can be said for several other subject matters of legislation, including one of those before the Court, namely navigation and shipping. Some provisions of the Navigable Waters Protection Act are aimed directly at biophysical environmental concerns that affect navigation. Sections 21 and 22 read:::21. No person shall throw or deposit or cause, suffer or permit to be thrown or deposited any sawdust, edgings, slabs, bark or like rubbish of any description whatever that is liable to interfere with navigation in any water, any part of which is navigable or that flows into any navigable water.::22. No person shall throw or deposit or cause, suffer or permit to be thrown or deposited any stone, gravel, earth, cinders, ashes or other material or rubbish that is liable to sink to the bottom in any water, any part of which is navigable or that flows into any navigable water, where there are not at least twenty fathoms of water at all times, but nothing in this section shall be construed so as to permit the throwing or depositing of any substance in any part of a navigable water where that throwing or depositing is prohibited by or under any other Act.:As <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier</b> in these reasons, the Act has a more expansive environmental dimension, given the common law context in which it was enacted. The common law proscribed obstructions that interfered with the paramount right of public navigation. Several of the [...] "works" [...] referred to in the Act do not in any way improve navigation. Bridges do not assist navigation, nor do many dams. Thus, in deciding whether a work of that nature is to be permitted, the Minister would almost surely have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages resulting from the interference with navigation. This could involve environmental concerns such as the destruction to fisheries, and all the Guidelines Order does then is to extend the ambit of his concerns.|$|E

The increased staffing with the monies made available has greatly enhanced patient care and decreased the resident workload. I want to again compliment Dr. Axelrod for the foresight to make these funds available despite adverse criticism. He clearly understood that the changes needed were quite expensive because the problems are primarily economic in origin. What type of paramedical personnel are needed is yet uncertain. <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> briefly <b>earlier</b> that the "data manager" combines an excellent administrative secretary and a nurse. The simple institution of electronic data processing can, surprisingly enough, worsen the problem rather than help. For example, institution of a beeper system, making it possible for anyone to "beep" a house officer at any time, resulted in an astonishing increase in "beeper frequency," a house officer receiving seven or eight such messages per hour, 24 hours a day, rather than communicating by other methods. Such "instant" communication can become a serious hazard rather than a help. Second, as repeatedly mentioned, the on-call time concept is crucial, permitting flexibility that avoids fatigue and yet maintains continuity of care. Otherwise there is a real danger with a rigid time-on/time-off schedule...|$|R

Even the thousands of people who participated in the crowd scenes were so carried away when Mammootty came onstage that I instantly realised how close we were to the real thing. You should ask Ashok (Mehta) who wielded the camera. The empathy was total. For the crowds, he was Dr Ambedkar all over again. We had to present all our research before the censors. Asha Parekh, who heads the Censor Board, was of great help. She said: 'Nothing will be cut if you can back it up with facts.' And that is what we did. Pages and pages of facts helped me restore every single cut that was proposed. Finally, the film was cleared as it is. We proved to the censors that everything -- every point of confrontation, every dialogue -- shown was historically accurate. After all, you must remember that this was the early Gandhi. He became a saint later. He was much more intolerant, much more difficult during this phase and that is why he made things so difficult for Dr Ambedkar.|$|R

30|$|In the equation, Chinese {{export to}} the country i EXP is {{explained}} by the GDP of China, the GDP of country i, and the geographical distance, which are the proxies for commodity supply, demand capacity, and transportation costs, respectively. They are the basic variables in the gravity model. The key explanatory variable is the lagged term of OFDI stock that China has invested in country <b>i.</b> As <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier,</b> this can avoid the omitted bias problem of regression estimation caused by the simultaneity between the OFDI flow and trade. At the same time, the lagged term of OFDI takes the time lag of investments forming actual production capacities in the host country into consideration. In this paper, I consider the model with lag phases of investment stock (i.e., n[*]=[*] 1, 2, 3.). Subsequent regressions show the results with the current flow and current stock as the core explanatory variables, which directly assesses the impact of different core explanatory variables on empirical results. Other control variable X and the factors that capture country heterogeneities are fully controlled, which includes a neighboring dummy, a common language dummy (i.e., the official language is Chinese or English 6), {{a free trade agreement}} (FTA) with China dummy, OECD member country dummy, and WTO member dummy. In addition, continent dummies (Asia, Europe, Africa, North America, Latin America, and Oceania) and law origin dummies (Anglo-American Legal System, French civil law, German law, and Nordic law) are also controlled in the regressions.

40|$|The {{literature}} distinguishes finite sample {{studies of}} seasonal stationarity quite less intensely than it shows for seasonal unit root tests. Therefore, {{the use of}} both types of tests for better exploring time series dynamics is seldom noticed in the relative studies on such a topic. Recently, Lyhagen (2006) introduced for quarterly data the seasonal KPSS test which null hypothesis is no seasonal unit roots. In the same manner, as most unit root limit theory, the asymptotic theory of the seasonal KPSS test depends on whether the data has been filtered by a preliminary regression. More specifically, one may proceed to the extraction of deterministic components – such as the mean and trend – from the data before testing. In this paper, I took account of de-trending on the seasonal KPSS test. A sketch of its limit theory was provided in this case. Also, I studied in finite sample the behaviour of the test for monthly time series. This could enrich our knowledge about it since it was – as <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> above – <b>early</b> introduced for quarterly data. Overall, the obtained {{results showed that the}} seasonal KPSS test preserved its good size and power properties. Furthermore, like the test of Kwiatkowski et al.

As <b>I</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>earlier,</b> I feel it crucial to educate students about artists who are both currently working, {{as well as those who}} are of historical influence. However, it is not enough to simply ask students to find an artist who uses a certain technology or methodology. In future research, I will begin to differentiate between artists who use concepts that are drawn from makerspaces, and those artists that use the specific technologies. For example, Rube Goldberg was a cartoonist who drew magnificently complicated machines. Although he did earn a degree in engineering, he was an artist who used traditional means to make his art. Echo Yang repurposed common household machines to make his drawings. This type of appropriation is certainly important as a form of artistic expression; however, it is not clear the level to which Yang understands the modifications, from an electronic engineering perspective. And Jan Voorman used common Lego blocks to rebuilt war-torn walls in Berlin; once again, this is clever and visually powerful, but the connection to structural engineering might not be so strong.|$|E
