5|$|The Hubble {{classification}} system rates elliptical galaxies {{on the basis}} of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little <b>interstellar</b> <b>matter.</b> Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial burst. In this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller globular clusters.|$|E
25|$|This {{abundance}} {{difference is}} a result of the way secondary cosmic rays are formed. Carbon and oxygen nuclei collide with <b>interstellar</b> <b>matter</b> to form lithium, beryllium and boron in a process termed cosmic ray spallation. Spallation is also responsible for the abundances of scandium, titanium, vanadium, and manganese ions in cosmic rays produced by collisions of iron and nickel nuclei with <b>interstellar</b> <b>matter.</b>|$|E

Logically, all stardust are presolar grains; but not all presolar grains are stardust.

40|$|Invited lecture - 4. Winds {{interaction}} with the ISM - 4 b. Planetary nebulaeCircumstellar envelopes (CEs) around evolved stars are an active site {{for the production of}} molecules. After evolving through the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB), proto-planetary nebula (PPN), to planetary nebula (PN) phases, CEs ultimately merge with the ISM. Thus the study of PNe is the key to understand the transition from stellar to interstellar materials. The gas-phase molecules synthesized in CEs are believed to be the precursors of complex organic compounds. Strong ultraviolet radiation from PN central star can heavily photoionize, photodissociate or process molecules, resulting in different molecular compositions during the AGB-PPN-PN evolution. The discoveries of C 60 and C 60 + in circumstellar and interstellar environments suggest that large molecules can survive in PNe and enrich the ISM. In this presentation I shall briefly review some recent radio and infrared observations of molecules in PNe.

25|$|A {{lenticular}} {{galaxy is}} a type of galaxy intermediate between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy in galaxy morphological classification schemes. Lenticular galaxies are disc galaxies (like spiral galaxies) that have used up or lost most of their <b>interstellar</b> <b>matter</b> and therefore have very little ongoing star formation. They may, however, retain significant dust in their disks. As a result, they consist mainly of aging stars (like elliptical galaxies). Because of their ill-defined spiral arms, if they are inclined face-on {{it is often difficult to}} distinguish between them and elliptical galaxies. Despite the morphological differences, lenticular and elliptical galaxies share common properties like spectral features and scaling relations. Both can be considered early-type galaxies that are passively evolving, at least in the local part of the Universe.|$|E

The origin of cosmic rays {{is still a}} mystery as their paths are deflected by magnetic fields to random directions. The most likely sources of cosmic rays are Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB). As the most energetic events known in the universe, GRBs are the death throes of massive stars that end in the explosion of stellar materials into <b>interstellar</b> <b>matters.</b> The interactions between cosmic rays and materials surrounding the GRB can produce neutrinos and very-high energy gamma-rays. Studying these high-energy neutrinos and gamma-rays can enlighten us further {{on the origin of}} cosmic rays. Very-high energy gamma rays can be observed by very large volume neutrino telescopes such as ANTARES in the Mediterranean Sea and IceCube in the South Pole. This dissertation focuses on ANTARES telescope operated as a gamma-ray telescope, which is possible by searching for downgoing muons produced from the interaction of gamma-rays with the Earth's atmosphere. Analytical calculations necessary to estimate the rate of photon-induced muons from GRBs has been performed. The responses of the detector to downgoing muons have been understood by using Monte Carlo simulations. The findings also provide a discussion on the future prospect of this venture.

30|$|The duality of {{the motion}} of the HMS observed, respectively, by the CRs and the neutral {{particles}} suggests the existence of the proper motion VIGM of the <b>interstellar</b> gaseous <b>matter</b> (IGM) including the magnetic field. V_HMS^CS produces the electromagnetic interaction between the HMS and IGM and forms the disturbed region surrounding the HMS, called the Subordinate HMS (SuHMS), which prevents the C-G effect expected to be caused by the relative motion between the HMS and the low energy CRs in IGM. In the high-energy region, however, as CRs can freely pass through the IGM and the SuHMS, the C-G effect can be observed in the direction of V_HMS^CS. On the other hand, as the neutral particles cannot recognize the existence of the SuHMS owing to their long scattering mean free path compared with the scales of the SuHMS, the particles can pass through the SuHMS with the velocity VIGM and produce the motion of Vnp observed on the HMS. As above, the solar modulation of CR sidereal anisotropies are intimately correlated with the behavior pattern of the heliomagnetosphere (HMS) and also with the CR solar diurnal variation produced by the diffusion-convection process inside the HMS. One of the most remarkable results of the present analysis is that the motion (V_IGM^S) of the <b>interstellar</b> gaseous <b>matter</b> (IGM) relative to the neighboring stars could be estimated for the first time by using the duality of the velocities V_HMS^CS and V_np^HMS.|$|R
