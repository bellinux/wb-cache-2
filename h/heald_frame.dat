50|$|Shedding. Shedding is {{the raising}} of part of the warp yarn to form a shed (the {{vertical}} space between the raised and unraised warp yarns), through which the filling yarn, carried by the shuttle, can be inserted. On the modern loom, simple and intricate shedding operations are performed automatically by the heddle or <b>heald</b> <b>frame,</b> {{also known as a}} harness. This is a rectangular frame to which a series of wires, called heddles or healds, are attached. The yarns are passed through the eye holes of the heddles, which hang vertically from the harnesses. The weave pattern determines which harness controls which warp yarns, and the number of harnesses used depends on the complexity of the weave. Two common methods of controlling the heddles are dobbies and a Jacquard Head.|$|E

For {{reducing}} heald frame’s vibration {{and noise}} {{in the process of}} weaving, composite of Carbon-Fibre was applied to it, and three methods of lay up for laminate was designed in the paper. Finite element model of the <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> was set up, and element shell 181 was used to simulate different layers of the composite material, then some important natural frequencies and vibration modes were calculated, and the results of that was compared with another <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> made of aluminium alloy. The analysis result indicated that, the second method for laying had an optimum dynamic characteristics, based on that, fundamental frequency of the <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> was increased by 19. 48 Hz, and self-weight of it was lightened about 26. 82 %. In results, lightweight design of the <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> was come true, at the same time, vibration resistance of it was also strengthened effectively...|$|E
40|$|Shedding is {{the first}} primary motions of loom. It is done by raising and {{lowering}} the Heald frames. The heald frames on a loom are positioned {{side by side with}} a little distance as possible. The different positions of <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> causes the variation in distance from cloth fell to peek of shed. In the present paper, the effect ofthis positional variation upon warp yarns, fabric properties and most importantly the whole weaving procedure have been concentrated. To find out the significance of this effect, two categories of fabric was produced using same weave (combination of plain and twill) but changing drafting plan. In the first category, the warp yarnshaving plain weave were threaded to heald frames nearest to the cloth fell and the other portion of warp yarns having twill weave were threaded farthest to the cloth fell. The drafting plan of second category was reverse the first category. All the other parameters were same in both cases. During weaving, weaving performances wasobserved and recorded in both cases. Later, crimp% of plain and twill portion of both fabrics were measured by Tautex Digital Crimp Tester and yarn strength of plain and twill portion of both samples were measured by Titan universal strength tester. It was observed that selecting <b>heald</b> <b>frame</b> position have substantial effect on crimp%,yarn strength and fabric performance. It is expected that this study will be help full to increase weaving performance and ensure better fabric quality in case of producing fancy weave...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that weaving mills become noisy with {{increasing}} speed of a jet loom. One of the authors used the <b>heald</b> <b>frames</b> equipped with bar magnets {{in order to reduce the}} heald vibration, and reported that the disorder of the heald motion during shedding motion was improved. Then, sound heard by human ears seemed reduced, but there was no significant difference in the noise level measured with the noise-level meter. In this report, therefore, the high response sound measuring system was arranged in order to obtain the time chart of sound pressure level caused by healds during shedding motion. High-speed video-camera was also used in order to observe the healds motion. It was clarified that the noise was significantly connected with healds motion during shedding motion. Large sound occurred in two cases : when healds collided with the heald bar vertically near the upper dead point of shedding motion and when healds collided at random by rebounds around the lower dead point of shedding motion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to eliminate the residual vibration of shedding system and the associated mechanism that connects the heddle shafts with the cam mechanisms. Effective cam design method which is based on motion design of the cam pitch curve by “blends ” of the traditional profiles, formed by superimposing three functions; a cycloid, a ramped versine, and a ramp called as ramp-plus-ramped cycloid-plus-ramped versine is proposed in this study. This function is reshaped using the system’s natural frequency and damping ratio to yield almost zero residual vibration of the heddle shaft. The proposed method is then compared with the well known cam curves and its applicability is shown by simulation and experimental results. The results show that the proposed method is quite effective for fast vibration free motion of the <b>heald</b> <b>frame...</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the existing design solution of shedding mechanism. It is characterised by a heald attachment into the heald shaft with a necessary design allowance. The preparation of a mathematical model for the new concept of the heald attaching to the <b>heald</b> shaft <b>frame</b> is explained in this study. A damping element for dissipating the energy created during the heald impact on the carrying wire of the heald shaft is currently used for the high-speed weaving loom. This system makes use of a damping element, fitted in the profile of the rod at an optimum distance from heald eye. This element provides for reduction of the heald velocity before its drop upon the supporting wire because the opposite section of the heald is pressed into the rubber element. The calculated results of the new concept of the heald attaching to the <b>heald</b> shaft <b>frame</b> are compared with the existing solution without application of the damping element...|$|R
