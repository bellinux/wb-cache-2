40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the demand for}} <b>import</b> documentary <b>credit</b> in Lebanon. Five explanatory variables are selected that stand respectively for risk, price, size, conjecture, and availability of credit. As expected, the long run elasticities are {{significantly higher than the}} short run ones. Risk has an adverse impact. Interest rate elasticities, or price elasticities, are all negative and statistically significant except for bills for collection which are paid in cash at presentation of the shipping documents, and that do not depend on the interest rate. Size and conjectural elasticities are all positive and statistically significantly different from zero. As expected, the availability of credit is only important for opened and utilized letters of credit and not for outstanding documentary credit and bills for collection. In the long run risk, price, and conjectural elasticities are all statistically insignificantly different from one in absolute values, but, surprisingly, long run size elasticities are statistically significantly less than + 1.

40|$|The European Union (EU) {{has raised}} {{concerns}} {{about the use of}} sinks and an Emissions Intensity system in Canada and has decided not to allow sinks to be included in its trading system. Despite this restriction, the EU has shown interest in expanding its trading system to include other countries such as Japan and Canada, while Canada hopes to use sinks and a domestic trading system with an Emissions Intensity regulatory mechanism to meet its Kyoto GHG commitments. In this paper, we briefly discuss some of the implications of the Emissions Intensity regulations scheme, and then develop a simple credit model with trade to illustrate the effect of a trade ban put in place by the EU, first, when it is fully binding and second, when there are countries that can act to arbitrage both markets (e. g., Japan). We also look at the possibilities of using harmonization frameworks to control trade, as well as using a form of discounting with respect to Canadian credits. We show that {{it is highly unlikely that}} a trade barrier will increase the use of emission reduction (and decreased use of sinks), and that, particularly in the likely case that Canada will <b>import</b> <b>credits,</b> trade barriers will actually increase the use of sinks. We do find, however, that the use of discounting could serve as a possible policy alternative to increase the use of EU reductions, while decreasing the quantity of Canadian sink credits.

In the second part it approaches a practical application of accounts related to merchandise imports on one’s own account, on short term trade credit. Foreign Trade Companies’ merchandise imports, as an indirect form of organizing foreign trade, contains the sum of operations by which merchandise necessary to the national economy is bought for production or individual consumption. Just like exporting, importing can be done by foreign trade companies on their own account, or on commission. In indirect importing, on foreign trade companies’ own account, the abovementioned act on foreign markets and onward on the internal market, in their own name, on their own account, and at their own risk. Thus, the financial results of the import activity are reflected, in full, in the administration of the importing foreign trade company.

This will promote reduction in greenhouse gases compared to the old system. The main reasons for these changes are, first, changes in the positions of the member states due to unsatisfactory experience with performance of the EU ETS so far. Second, a "package approach" where the EU ETS reform was integrated into wider energy and climate policy facilitated agreement on the changes. Third, changes in the position of nonstate actors and a desire to affect the international climate negotiations contributed to the reform.

40|$|Executive Summary 1. In {{integrated}} {{capital markets}} assets are priced {{according to a}} common set of risks. By contrast prices reflect country-specific factors in segmented markets. 2. Capital market integration offers the possibility of better capital allocation and greater economic growth improved country risk-sharing enhanced portfolio diversification and a lower cost of capital. However it also exposes a country to capital flight and <b>imported</b> <b>credit</b> crunches inefficient capital allocation if information problems are significant increased corruption incentives and a failure to work well when most needed. 3. Recent microeconomic studies suggest that diversification and cost of capital improvements from integration may largely be exhausted in developed countries and hence are likely to be primarily confined to emerging countries. But longer-term macroeconomic evidence seems to indicate that the gains from capital market liberalisation have principally been enjoyed by developed countries. 4. Financial economists have developed a number of methods for identifying and measuring the degree of integration both globally and for individual countries. These include: return correlations tests of formal asset pricing models constructed under the assumption of perfect integration cross-country equivalence of implied pricing factors convergence of valuation ratios and various foreign market participation metrics. 5. The overall picture painted by the limited number of existing applications of these methods to New Zealand suggest (i) a high degree of integration with Australia (ii) greater integration with Asia-Pacific countries than those of Europe or North America and (iii) no compelling evidence of a general segmentation problem. 6. However these conclusions must be treated with considerable caution given that most of the analysis on which they are based is often sourced from relatively old data or from studies that are either preliminary and/or are not focussed on New Zealand. Thus it remains possible that New Zealand could achieve and benefit from additional capital market integration. Further work - applying the most recently-available New Zealand data to the methods noted above - is required {{to determine whether or not}} this is the case. 7. Existing studies suggest that the achievement of additional integration is largely driven by factors that are either beyond New Zealand's control or on which it already scores highly. However paying much closer attention to investor property rights may well be helpful in this regard...|$|R

This paper considers implications of carbon markets for natural resource management (NRM) in Australia. There are in fact a range of distinct, but overlapping carbon markets. These range from international compliance markets (the Kyoto Protocol flexibility mechanisms) through national compliance markets (such as Australia’s proposed emissions trading scheme) to unregulated voluntary markets. While NRM is intimately linked to the global carbon cycle, {{it has a very}} limited role in existing and proposed carbon markets. The only significant direct impact likely up to 2015 is a small increase in tree planting. While trees have excellent potential to sequester carbon, the incentives for tree planting will be relatively small, given the limited scope of Australia’ proposed emissions reductions and the ability to <b>import</b> carbon <b>credits</b> from international markets. NRM managers should continue to manage carbon as one of a suite of issues without expecting rivers of gold to flow from carbon markets. Some may choose to participate directly in carbon markets, although this is inherently risky given their ill-defined and rapidly evolving nature. There is a need to develop improved understanding of carbon stocks and flows in the landscape, at both national and local scales. New institutions will be needed to secure carbon opportunities from agriculture and land management while also recognising other social and environmental objectives. carbon trading, emissions trading, environment, agriculture...|$|R

40|$|World Bank, This paper {{examines}} {{the problems of}} Russia’s post-communist economic transformation. Its main thesis is that the Russian attempt at radical economic reform largely failed, because of extraordinary rent-seeking by old enterprise managers through export rents, subsidized <b>credits,</b> <b>import</b> subsidies and direct government subsidies, while they gained little from privatization. The reason why the managers were so strong was that the Soviet Union left large economic distortions behind and a virtually unconstrained economic elite. The reforms could have been reinforced if democratic institutions had been developed faster, or if the West had provided financial support for the reforms in early 1992. Over time, rents have dwindled, but Russian institutions have been seriously damaged by corruption. Intense competition over rents contributed to the financial crash in August 1998, but the competition also limits the rents, and might ease the way for future reforms. 2 During the last decade, Russia’s GDP has fallen by about 40 percent, and GDP is likely to fall by several percent in 1999.
