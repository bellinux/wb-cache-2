2500|$|Another {{issue that}} can lead {{researchers}} not to take part is whether the researcher would stand to gain any benefit from {{taking part in the}} experiment. [...] It is an ethical principle that volunteers must stand to gain some benefit from the research, even if that is only a remote future possibility of treatment being found for a disease that they only have a small chance of contracting. [...] Tests on experimental drugs are sometimes conducted on sufferers of an untreatable condition. [...] If the researcher does not have that condition then there can be no possible benefit to them personally. [...] For instance, Ronald C. Desrosiers in responding to why he did not test an AIDS vaccine he was developing on himself said that he was not at risk of AIDS so could not possibly benefit. [...] Against that, the early stages of testing a new drug are usually focused merely on the safety of the substance, rather than any benefits it may have. [...] Healthy individuals are required for this stage, not volunteers suffering from the target condition, so if the researcher is healthy, he or she is a potential candidate for testing. [...] An issue peculiar to AIDS vaccine research is that the test will leave <b>HIV</b> <b>antibodies</b> in the volunteers blood, causing the person to show HIV positive when tested even if they have never been in contact with an HIV carrier. [...] This could cause a number of social problems for the volunteers (including any self-testers) such as issues with life insurance.|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} ninety eight men {{seropositive}} for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (<b>HIV)</b> <b>antibody</b> and 58 <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> seroconverters were studied {{for an average of}} 19. 3 (SEM 0. 5) months to assess the relation between HIV antigenaemia and the risk of developing the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS related complex. Forty (20. 2 %) of the 198 <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> seropositive men were antigen positive at entry and remained so during follow up. Eight (13. 8 %) of the 58 <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> seroconverters and 20 (12. 7 %) of the remaining 158 <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> seropositive men became antigen positive during follow up, resulting in an end point attack rate for HIV antigenaemia of 14. 3 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND. We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing on sexual behavior and communication with sexual partners about AIDS risk among heterosexual adults at a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases. METHODS. We randomized 186 subjects to receive either AIDS education alone (the control group) or AIDS education, an <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> test, and the test results (the intervention group). These subjects were then followed up 8 weeks later. RESULTS. At follow-up, mean {{number of sexual partners}} decreased, but not differently between groups. However, compared with controls, <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> test intervention subjects, all of whom tested negative, questioned their most recent sexual partner more about <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> status (P less than 0. 01), worried more about getting AIDS (P less than 0. 03), and tended to use a condom more often with their last sexual partner (P = 0. 05) : 40 % of intervention subjects vs 20 % of controls used condoms, avoided genital intercourse, or knew their last partner had a negative <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> test (P less than 0. 005). CONCLUSION. <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing combined with AIDS education increases concern about HIV and, {{at least in the short}} term, may promote safer sexual behaviors. Additional strategies will be necessary if behaviors risky for HIV transmission are to be further reduced...|$|R

50|$|A combination, or 4th {{generation}} assay, {{is designed}} to detect both the p24 antigen and <b>HIV</b> <b>antibodies</b> in a single test. Combination tests can detect HIV as early as 2-6 weeks after infection, and are recommended in laboratory testing.|$|E
50|$|For the {{detection}} of <b>HIV</b> <b>antibodies,</b> the wells of microtiter plate are coated with the HIV antigen. Two specific antibodies are used, one conjugated with enzyme and the other present in serum (if serum is positive for the antibody). Cumulative competition occurs between the two antibodies for the same antigen, causing a stronger signal to be seen. Sera to be tested are added to these wells and incubated at 37 °C, and then washed. If antibodies are present, the antigen-antibody reaction occurs. No antigen is left for the enzyme-labelled specific <b>HIV</b> <b>antibodies.</b> These antibodies remain free upon addition and are washed off during washing. Substrate is added, {{but there is no}} enzyme to act on it, so a positive result shows no color change.|$|E
40|$|<b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> {{testing is}} a key measure of HIV {{prevention}} for {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM). The World Health Organization recommends sexually active and at-risk MSM to take up <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing regularly. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of behavioral intention to take up <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing in the next six months among Hong Kong MSM who were ever-testers. An anonymous cross-sectional survey recruited 326 MSM who had taken up <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing from gay-friendly venues and internet in Hong Kong. Of the participants, 40. 8 % had had unprotected anal intercourse with regular or non-regular male sex partners in the last six months; they were at risk of HIV transmission despite experience in <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing. Only 37. 2 % showed a strong intention to take up <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> testing again in the next six months. Adjusted analysis showed that both perceived discrimination toward Hong Kong MSM (AOR =. 60, 95 % CI:. 36 -. 98) and the CARE Measure assessing perceived empathy of service providers (AOR = 1. 05, 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 08) were significantly associated with intention for retesting. Perceived discrimination, however, became statistically non-significant (AOR =. 68, 95 % CI:. 41 - 1. 14), when both CARE Measure and perceived discrimination entered into the adjusted model. It is warranted to increase HIV retesting rate by removing perceived discrimination and reducing the negative effect of perceived discrimination through enhancement of empathy of service providers...|$|R
40|$|The {{context of}} testing Testing for <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> has been {{available}} in Australia since October 1984.

50|$|<b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> {{tests are}} {{specifically}} designed for routine diagnostic testing of adults; these tests are inexpensive and extremely accurate.|$|R
50|$|HIV testing {{begins with}} a {{screening}} test. The most common screening test is the rapid HIV antibody test which tests for <b>HIV</b> <b>antibodies</b> in blood, urine, or oral fluid. <b>HIV</b> <b>antibodies</b> are only produced if an individual is infected with the disease. Therefore, presence of the antibodies is indicative of an HIV infection. Sometimes, however, a person may be infected with HIV but the body has not produced enough antibodies to be detected by the test. If a woman has risk factors for HIV infection but tests negative on the initial screening test, she should be retested in 3 months to confirm {{that she does not}} have HIV. Another screening test that is more specific is the HIV antigen/antibody test. This is a newer blood test that can detect HIV infection quicker than the antibody test because it detects both virus particles and antibodies in the blood.|$|E
50|$|HIV {{antibody}} {{tests are}} highly sensitive, meaning they react preferentially with <b>HIV</b> <b>antibodies,</b> {{but not all}} positive or inconclusive HIV ELISA tests mean the person is infected by HIV. Risk history, and clinical judgement {{should be included in}} the assessment, and a confirmation test (western blot) should be administered. An individual with an inconclusive test should be re-tested at a later date.|$|E
50|$|If no {{antibodies}} to HIV are detected, {{this does not}} mean the person has not been infected with HIV. It may take several months after HIV infection for the antibody response to reach detectable levels, during which time rapid testing for {{antibodies to}} HIV will not be indicative of true infection status. For most people, <b>HIV</b> <b>antibodies</b> reach a detectable level after two to six weeks.|$|E
50|$|Positive <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> {{tests are}} usually {{followed}} up by retests and tests for antigens, viral genetic {{material and the}} virus itself, providing confirmation of actual infection.|$|R
50|$|Diagnosis of {{infection}} using antibody testing is a well-established technique in medicine. <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> tests exceed {{the performance of}} most other infectious disease tests in both sensitivity (the ability of the screening test to give a positive finding when the person tested truly has the disease) and specificity (the ability of the test to give a negative finding when the subjects tested are free of the disease under study). Many current <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> tests have sensitivity and specificity in excess of 96% and are therefore extremely reliable. While most patients with <b>HIV</b> show an <b>antibody</b> response after six weeks, window periods vary and may occasionally be as long as three months.|$|R
40|$|Blood spot {{residues}} on {{filter paper}} circles from which antibodies have been eluted remain suitable for follow-up {{polymerase chain reaction}} to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) provirus. A method has been developed for specimen processing and nested polymerase chain reaction amplification with a single tube. HIV-positive specimens can be detected by simple, direct electrophoresis of amplified material to a single copy of provirus. The procedure is particularly suited for survey purposes to estimate rates of vertical transmission of virus among HIV antibody-positive newborns, in whom virus loads may be low. Infants born to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected mothers are <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> positive from transpla-cental transfer of maternal antibodies, but prospective stud-ies suggest that only 20 to 30 % of these seropositive infants are actually infected by HIV (7, 13, 14).

40|$|A {{national}} {{study of the}} prevalence of <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> in homosexual and heterosexual patients attending sexually transmitted disease clinics in the years 1985 - 7 was continued in 1988. Among homosexual men in two clinics in south east England <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> was less prevalent in 1988 (30 (7. 1 %) of 420) than in 1987 (81 (14. 6 %) of 556) but was more prevalent in 1988 in other regions where the corresponding findings were 48 (4. 9 %) of 975 and 36 (2. 8 %) of 1291. <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> prevalence continued to be higher in homosexual men aged 25 or more years or {{with one or more}} specified minor complaints. The trend was similar in heterosexual patients: among men in the south east in 1988 <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> was found in 1 (0. 1 %) of 948 but in 10 (1. 0 %) of 962 in 1987 and among women in 1 (0. 1 %) of 1043 in 1988 but in 7 (0. 7 %) of 949 in 1987. In other regions the corresponding findings for men were 2 (0. 1 %) of 5620 in 1988 and 3 (0. 1 %) of 5312 in 1987 and for women were 7 (0. 2 %) of 4483 in 1988 and 1 (0. 1 %) of 4778 in 1987.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} the spread of HIV {{infection}} have centred on homosexuals and intravenous drug users. To estimate the extent of infection in different groups, including heterosexuals, the prevalence of <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> was studied in 34, 222 subjects tested with consent between October 1986 and December 1987 in England. These included subjects in high risk groups for HIV infection, heterosexuals with partners in the high risk groups and heterosexuals with multiple partners or with no identifiable risk factors. The prevalence was highest in homosexual or bisexual men in London (15. 1 %; 213 / 1412), being 4. 0 % (146 / 3607) outside London. The yearly incidence of infection in 632 homosexual or bisexual men without <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> when retested {{during the study period}} was 3 %. Among intravenous drug users the prevalence of <b>HIV</b> <b>antibody</b> was 5. 7 % (36 / 633) in London and 1. 5 % (39 / 2562) outside.
