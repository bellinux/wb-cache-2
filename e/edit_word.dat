40|$|Abstract—Detection of edit disfluencies {{is key to}} transcribing {{spontaneous}} utterances. In this paper, {{we present}} improved features and models to detect edit disfluencies and enhance transcription of spontaneous Mandarin speech using hypothesized disfluency interruption points (IPs) and <b>edit</b> <b>word</b> detection. A comprehensive set of prosodic features {{that takes into account}} the special characteristics of edit disfluencies in Mandarin is developed, and an improved model combining decision trees and maximum entropy is proposed to detect IPs. This model is further adapted to desired prosodic conditions by latent prosodic modeling, a probabilistic framework for analyzing speech prosody in terms of a set of latent prosodic states. These techniques contribute to higher recognition accuracy (by rescoring with the hypothesized IPs) and better <b>edit</b> <b>word</b> detection (using conditional random fields defined on Chinese characters) in the final transcription, as verified by experiments on a spontaneous Mandarin speech corpus. Index Terms—Edit disfluency, interruption point detection, prosody, speech recognition, spontaneous speech. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel metadata extraction (MDE) system for automatically detecting edited words, fillers, and self-interruption points in conversational speech. Our <b>edit</b> <b>word</b> detection sub-system combines a Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) noisy channel model, a statistical syntactic language model, and a MaxEnt reranker. Hand-built, deterministic rules {{are used to}} detect fillers. Self-interruption points are explicitly determined by detected fillers and edited words. We have evaluated our system for these three tasks on two types of input: manually annotated words and automatically recognized speech-to-text tokens. In all six cases, our system has improved the state-of-the-art, as measured in a recent blind evaluation. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn today's Scenario, Remote Monitoring is a {{fascinating}} research aspect of mobile computing technology. In this research paper, our prime {{focus is on the}} Personal computer remote monitoring system. Another challenging task is the security while sharing data in remotely monitoring PC or handheld devices over Wi-Fi, 3 G, and Bluetooth. An application model is proposed for Secure Personal Computer Network Monitoring System. The proposed application model is efficiently able to communicate and monitor the working between handheld devices and the Personal Computer over Wi-Fi using handheld devices. Monitoring the current state of any machine in the network is possible by fetching the current state of machine on android phone. In the proposed application model mobile devices are able to watch the running processes of personal computer(s). In the proposed and implemented application model, whatever information the handheld device (android phone) requests pertaining to the network is passed on by the server. We executed and tested the designed monitoring system for set of operations such as play-stop-pause, Audio/ video recording, active sessions of web sites monitoring, grabbing files, create or <b>edit</b> <b>word</b> documents, edit and sharing of important excel files, making and sharing presentations, Logging Off and Shutting Down the Personal Computer.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{multi-step}} stacked learning model for disfluency detection. Our method incorporates refined n-gram features {{step by step}} from different word sequences. First, we detect filler <b>words.</b> Second, <b>edited</b> <b>words</b> are detected using n-gram features extracted from both the original text and filler filtered text. In the third step, additional n-gram features are extracted from edit removed texts together with our newly induced in-between features to improve <b>edited</b> <b>word</b> detection. We use Max-Margin Markov Networks (M 3 Ns) as the classifier with the weighted hamming loss to balance precision and recall. Experiments on the Switchboard corpus show that the refined n-gram features from multiple steps and M 3 Ns with weighted hamming loss can significantly improve the performance. Our method for disfluency detection achieves the best reported F-score 0. 841 {{without the use of}} additional resources. 1...|$|R
