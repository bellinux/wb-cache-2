500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in {{trying to figure out who}} would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. [...] "It had to be [...] There was no other choice." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} idea {{was written by}} Jeffrey Reddick as a spec script for The X-Files {{in order to get}} a TV agent. [...] "I was actually flying home to Kentucky and <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, 'Don’t take the flight tomorrow, I have a really bad feeling about it.’ She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed," [...] said Reddick. [...] "I thought, that’s creepy—what if she was supposed to die on that flight?" [...] Building on his idea, Reddick wrote script and got an agent, but never submitted the script to The X-Files after a colleague at New Line Cinema suggested he write it as a feature film. [...] One of the biggest misconceptions about the project is that it was based on the real-life disaster of TWA Flight 800 that occurred in 1996. Like in the movie, the TWA disaster involved a Boeing 747 that exploded after take-off from JFK International Airport in New York en route to Paris. [...] Moreover, five chaperones and sixteen high school students from Montoursville, Pennsylvania, were aboard the doomed flight, heading to Paris with their high school French club. The TV spec script for The X-Files [...] however, was actually written in 1994.|$|E

So I think the idea of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jewel {{identifies}} as a feminist and has said, [...] "I don't think I started off young as a feminist. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of books}} in Alaska, I was pretty isolated where I grew up, and I think that I never thought I was any different than a man; I {{was raised in a}} place where pioneer women were very strong still. They'd shoe horses and build their own homes and were very self-sufficient. It wasn't really until I've gotten older that I really became a fan of women. And a fan of what women are capable of balancing and achieving, by just being them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scates {{was highly}} {{competitive}} {{both as a}} player and a coach, and he designed his practices to underscore competition and intensity. Practices moved at a high pace, with high repetitions and little time between drills. [...] "I ran shorter drills and quicker, and I didn’t stop the drills to explain things very much. I just tried to coach and keep things going at the same time." [...] John Wooden was a major influence on Scates and eventually a lifelong friend. [...] "I used to sit up there and watch him when we weren’t practicing. I learned a lot from that. I liked how he changed drills very quickly. He didn’t have any down time. And then <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> book he wrote in 1965 called 'Practical Modern Basketball.'" ...|$|E

Swank has called her mother the inspiration for her acting career and her life. In California, Swank enrolled in South Pasadena High School, later dropping out because of her ADHD and lack of interest. She described her time at South Pasadena High School, [...] "I felt like such an outsider. I didn't feel like I fit in. I didn't belong in any way. I didn't even feel like the teachers wanted me there. I just felt like I wasn't seen or understood." [...] She explained that she became an actor because she felt an outsider, [...] "As a kid I felt that I belonged only when <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> book or saw a movie, and could get involved with a character. It was natural that I became an actor because I longed {{so much to be}} those other people, or at least to play them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pisemsky {{spent the}} first ten {{years of his life}} in the small {{regional}} town of Vetluga where his father served as Mayor. Later he moved with his parents to the countryside. Pisemsky described the years he spent there in Chapter 2 of People of the Forties, an autobiographical novel in which he figured under the name of Pasha. Fond of hunting and horseback riding, the boy received scant education: his tutors were a local deacon, a defrocked drunkard, and a strange old man who was known to have toured the area for decades, giving lessons. Aleksey learned reading, writing, arithmetics, Russian and Latin from them. In his autobiography Pisemsky wrote: [...] "Nobody had ever forced me to learn, and I wasn't an avid learner, but <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>a</b> lot and that was my passion: by 14 I consumed, in translation, of course, most of Walter Scott's novels, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, Faublas, Le Diable boiteux, The Serapion Brethren, a Persian novel called Haggi Baba... As for children's books, I couldn't stand them and, as far as I remember now, considering them very silly." [...] Pisemsky wrote scornfully of his primary education and regretted failing to learn any languages besides Latin. He found in himself, however, a natural predisposition to mathematics, logic and aesthetics.|$|E
