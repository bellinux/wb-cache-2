500|$|Dylan {{recorded}} around thirty new compositions with The Hawks, {{including some}} of the most celebrated songs of his career: [...] "I Shall Be Released", [...] "This Wheel's on Fire", [...] "Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)", [...] "Tears of Rage" [...] and [...] "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere". Two of these featured his lyrics set to music by members of The Band: Danko wrote the music of [...] "This Wheel's on Fire"; Manuel, who composed [...] "Tears of Rage", described how Dylan [...] "came down to the basement with a piece of typewritten paper ... and he just said, 'Have you got any music for this?' ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> musical movements that fit ... so I just elaborated a bit, because I wasn't sure what the lyrics meant.

2500|$|As {{soon as the}} {{deadline}} for Mayweather's response expired, Arum held a conference call. Arum revealed to the media that the negotiations he had been referring to consisted {{of a series of}} conversations with HBO Sports President Ross Greenburg. He also revealed that there was no actual direct communication with any representative from Team Mayweather or Golden Boy Promotions: <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> conversations with Ross [...] and I laid out all the terms that would be acceptable to our side and I also informed him about the concession that Manny had made regarding drug testing. He got back to me {{in a couple of weeks}} and told me that he had had discussions with Al Haymon, representing Floyd Mayweather, and that everything looked good and we were nearing a resolution...The subsequent conversations with Ross detailed to me conversations he had with Al Haymon. Nowhere was the name Richard Schaefer or Golden Boy mentioned, although I read, as you all did, Oscar's statement that a deal was close, so I assumed from that Haymon was keeping Schaefer and Golden Boy abreast of the situation.|$|E

6000|$|The playwright {{remained}} on his guard. [...] "Well, as I wrote you, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> plays accepted {{and helped to}} produce them. There's nothing more wearing than producing a play. The anxiety is killing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{no wonder}} I had a classy hang-over, Wrenn. I {{was at the}} Amusieren Rathskeller till four this morning, and then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> nips before breakfast, and then I didn't have any breakfast.

60|$|In fact <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> Bow street {{officers}} hold of me. The cruel Sacharissa had proclaimed who I was, {{and that}} a reward had been offered throughout the country for any tidings of me; and they had seen a description of me that had been forwarded to the police office in town. Those harpies, therefore, for the mere sake of filthy lucre, were resolved to deliver me over {{into the hands of}} my father and the clutches of my pedagogue.|$|E

6000|$|... “Yes,” {{answered}} the lady, “I {{suppose it is}} a case of partial loss of memory. I was in the train coming down here; my ticket told me that I had come from Victoria and was bound for this place. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> five-pound notes and a sovereign on me, no visiting cards or any other means of identification, and no idea as to who I am.

6000|$|All I had in {{the world}} was a small trunk, a couple of dozen books, a valise and a few acres of barren unplowed land. My {{previous}} visit to Boston was just the sort to tempt me to return, but my experiences as a laborer in New England had lessened my confidence in its resources--and yet the thought of being able to cross the Common every day opened a dazzling vista. The very fact that Mr. Bashford had gone there from the west as a student, a poor student, made the prodigiously daring step seem possible to me. [...] "If only <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred dollars," [...] I said to my mother who listened to my delirious words in silence. She divined what was surging in my heart and feared it.|$|E
6000|$|... “For myself, I laughed fit to split. If I lost {{anything}} {{it was a}} pound or two of tobacco which I was taking home for my old father, and I felt that things {{might have been a}} deal worse if they had searched the legs of my trousers, where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> bladders filled with good brandy. You see, young ’un, though everyone knows that it is against the law, no one thinks it a crime. It is a game you play; if you lose you pay handsomely, but if you win you get off scot-free. I think the lady who told you it was wrong did you a very bad service, for if she lived near that village she must have known that you would get into no end of trouble if you were to say you would have nothing more to do with it. And how is it”—turning to Tom—“that you came to go with him? You did not take it into your head that smuggling was wrong too?” ...|$|E

"My {{little boat}} was pitched about {{as if it}} had been a feather in a breeze, and when the front part of it was cleavin' itself down into the water the hind part was stickin' up until the rudder whizzed around like a patent churn with no milk in it. The thunder began to roar and the lightnin' flashed, and three seagulls, so nearly frightened to death that they began to turn up the whites of their eyes, flew down and sat on one of the seats of the boat, forgettin' in that awful moment that man was their nat'ral enemy. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> {{biscuits}} in my pocket, because I had thought I might want a bite in crossing, and I crumbled up one of these and fed the poor creatures. Then I began to wonder what I was goin' to do, for things were gettin' awfuller and awfuller every instant, and the little boat was a-heavin' and a-pitchin' and a-rollin' and h'istin' itself up, first on one end and then on the other, to such an extent that if I hadn't kept tight hold of the rudder-handle I'd slipped off the seat I was sittin' on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Once {{over there}} I was pretty comfortable; the berg {{sheltered}} {{me from the}} wind, and the sun began to shine out a bit through the clouds, and in the afternoon, although it was still blowing hard, there was a blue sky overhead. There were a good many other bergs in sight, {{but none of them}} seemed near as big as the one that I was on. Fortunately <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> biscuits in my pocket, having thrust them in there when I ran up when there was a call for an extra hand at the helm. One of these I ate, then I lay down on a broad ledge and went off sound asleep. When I awoke it was night. I was warmly clad when we struck, having my thick oil-skin over my pea-jacket, but I felt a bit cold. However I was soon off again, and when I awoke morning had broken. I ate half my last biscuit, took a drink out of a pool--I do not know whether it was melted ice or rain-water--and then climbed {{up to the top of}} the berg and looked round.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see," [...] Douglas Romilly continued, [...] "I {{was just}} going to {{scramble}} out on to the bank when my brain began to work, and I swam slowly along instead. You see, just then I was in a devil of a mess. I'd spent a lot of money, and though I'd kept the credit of the firm good, I knew that the business was bust, and the one thing I was anxious about was to get off to America without being stopped. I've explained this all to Beatrice, and why I didn't send for her before. Anyway, I swam along until I met with an old barge. I climbed in and got two of the choicest blackguards you ever saw to let me spend an hour or two in their filthy cabin and to keep their mouths closed about it. Fortunately, I had another pocketbook, with sufficient to satisfy them and keep me going. Then I borrowed some clothes and came out to America, steerage. I had no difficulty in getting my money, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> pals in Lynn whom I had fixed things up with before I started. They came and identified me as Merton Ware, and we all three started in business together as the Ford Boot and Shoe Manufacturing Company at Lynn in Massachusetts. Incidentally, we've done all right. Heaps more, of course, but that's the pith of it. As for the body that was fished out of the canal, if you make enquiries, you'll find there was a tramp missing, a month or so before." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No. But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> sisters, one older, one {{younger than}} myself, {{and there were}} plenty of girls in my circle. I thought some of them pretty--but that was a {{different}} affair. I know that I didn't connect them with the idea of the loved and worshipped goddesses at all, because I remember when I first saw the goddess in a real human being and how amazed I was at the discovery.... I was a boy of twelve or thirteen. My people took me one summer to Dymchurch in Romney Marsh; in those days before the automobile had made the Marsh accessible to the Hythe and Folkestone crowds, it was a little old forgotten silent wind-bitten village crouching under the lee of the great sea wall. At low water there were miles of sand as smooth and shining as the skin of a savage brown woman. Shining and with a texture--the very same. And one day as I was mucking about by myself on the beach, boy fashion,--there were some ribs of a wrecked boat buried in the sand near a groin and I was busy with them--a girl ran out from a tent high up on the beach and across the sands to the water. She was dressed in a tight bathing dress and not in the clumsy skirts and frills that it was the custom to inflict on women in those days. Her hair was tied up in a blue handkerchief. She ran swiftly and gracefully, intent upon the white line of foam ahead. I can still remember how the sunlight touched her round neck and cheek as she went past me. She was the loveliest, most shapely thing I have ever seen--to this day. She lifted up her arms and thrust through the dazzling white and green breakers and plunged into the water and swam; she swam straight out for a long way as it seemed to me, and presently came in and passed me again on her way back to her tent, light and swift and sure. The very prints of her feet on the sand were beautiful. Suddenly I realized that there could be living people in the world as lovely as any goddess.... She wasn't in the least out of breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be no rougher on {{him than}} you're obleeged to, because he ain't a bad nigger.

Of course I judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I WAS! and there I had to stick right straight along {{all the rest of the}} day and all night. It was a fix, I tell you! <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> patients with the chills, and of course I'd of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn't, because the nigger might get away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too. I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home--better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I WAS, with both of 'm on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start. He ain't no bad nigger, gentlemen; that's what I think about him." ...|$|E
