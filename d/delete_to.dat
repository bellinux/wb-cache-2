At first, the pair optimized the 3D graphics of the game, but Bowery, inspired by the concept of positive sum games, or cooperative games, decided the <b>delete</b> <b>to</b> entire game code from the system and start over, building in strategy and resource management elements into the base game instead of adding them on top. Bowery designed the new version to penalize over-reliance on combat and incentivize cooperation as part of a philosophical stance on what he believed actual space expansion would require. The second version of Spasim was developed over the course of three days, and the pair released it in July 1974.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{compatibility}} with the extended features was limited mainly to IBM applications, {{along with a}} few third-party products like WordPerfect and VolksWriter.

Most DOS programs did, however, support these functions and did allow the user to perform the cut, copy, and paste operations by using the TopView pop-up menus.|$|E

Based on the “iterative compression ” method introduced by Reed, Smith, and Vetta in 2004, we present new algorithms and experimental results. The worst-case time complexity is improved. Based on new structural insights, we give a simplified correctness proof. This also allows us to establish a heuristic improvement that in particular speeds up the search on dense graphs.

40|$|A {{powerful}} enhancement to the DMAP alter capability {{was developed}} and is available on all RPK-supported versions of COSMIC/NASTRAN. This enhancement involves the addition of two alter control cards, called INSERT and <b>DELETE,</b> <b>to</b> the Executive Control Deck. These cards allow for DMAP alters {{to be made by}} referencing DMAP statements by their module names rather than by their statement numbers in the rigid format DMAP sequence. This allows for increased user convenience and flexibility and makes alters more meaningful to the user. In addition, DMAP alter packages employing the alter control cards will be much less susceptible to future changes in rigid format DMAPs than alter packages employing the standard ALTER control cards. The usage of the cards is illustrated by examples...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{important}} step in laying out hierarchical network diagrams is to order the nodes on each level. The usual approach is to minimize the number of edge crossings. This problem is NP-hard even for two layers when the first layer is fixed. Hence, in practice crossing minimization is performed using heuristics. Another suggested approach is to maximize the planar subgraph, i. e. find the least number of edges to <b>delete</b> <b>to</b> make the graph planar. Again this is performed using heuristics since minimal edge deletion for planarity is NP-hard. We show that using modern SAT and MIP solving approaches we can find optimal orderings for minimal crossing or minimal edge deletion for planarization on reasonably sized graphs. These exact approaches provide a benchmark for measuring quality of heuristic crossing minimization and planarization algorithms. Furthermore, we can straightforwardly extend our approach to minimize crossings followed by maximizing planar subgraph or vice versa; these hybrid approaches produce noticeably better layout then either crossing minimization or planarization alone. ...|$|E
40|$|Web {{services}} have attracted attention {{as a possible}} solution to share knowledge and application logic among different heterogeneous agents. A classic approach to this subject is using SOAP, a W 3 C protocol aimed to exchange structured information. The Web Services Interoperability organization (WS-I), defines a set of extensions, commonly called WS-*, which further enhance this knowledge exchange defining mechanisms and functionalities such as security, addressability or service composition. This thesis explores a relatively new alternative approach to the SOAP/WS-I stack: REST-based Web services. The acronym REST stands for Representational state transfer; this basically means that each unique URL is a representation of some object. You can get the contents of that object using an HTTP GET; you then might use a POST, PUT or <b>DELETE</b> <b>to</b> modify the object (in practice most of the services use a POST for this). All of Yahoo’s Web services use REST, including Flickr; del. icio. us API uses it; pubsu...|$|E

Database Server consists of queries that used for all database operations. It must can identified each query before process it and apply that query for data in the server.

After that, query start processed according to each section. Each Section has different function. Create, to make new databases or tables.

40|$|Many {{combinatorial}} {{problems that}} {{come up in the}} real world have been classified as NP-hard [Garey and Johnson 1979]. An example is the following task: After a series of experiments, certain pairs of experiments are found to have conflicting results. We therefore know that for each pair, {{at least one of the}} experiments was faulty. We now want to find the minimum number of experiments to discard such that there are no more conflicts. This problem, in its abstract form as a graph problem, is known as Vertex Cover, where given a graph, we search for a minimum number of vertices to <b>delete</b> <b>to</b> get rid of all edges. It is by now an established assumption that NP-hardness implies an inherent combinatorial explosion in the solution space that leads to running times growing exponentially with the input size. This means that large instances of NP-hard problems cannot always be solved efficiently to optimality...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{class of}} graphs where {{the size of}} a minimum vertex cover equals that of a maximum {{matching}} is known as König-Egerváry graphs. König-Egerváry graphs have been studied extensively from a graph theoretic point of view. In this paper, we introduce and study the algorithmic complexity of finding maximumKönig-Egerváry subgraphs of a given graph. More specifically, we look at the problem of finding a minimum number of vertices or edges to <b>delete</b> <b>to</b> make the resulting graph König-Egerváry. We show that both these versions are NP-complete and study their complexity from the points of view of approximation and parameterized complexity. En route, we point out an interesting connection between the vertex deletion version and the A G V C problem where one is interested in the parameterized complexity of the V C problem when parameterized by the ‘additional number of vertices ’ needed beyond the matching size. This connection is of independent interest and could be useful in establishing the parameterized complexity of A G V C problem. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{discover}} how children acquire the T(ense) and C(omplementizer) system, finite and nonfinite embedded clauses produced by children in the CHILDES database were studied. It was discovered that young children often <b>delete</b> <b>to</b> in nonfinite embedded clauses, and that they use that in the C position of finite imbedded clauses far less often than adults do. By adapting Wexler's (1998) theory of optional infinitives to a Pesetsky and Torrego (2001, 2002) framework, I show that the facts about both finite and nonfinite embedded clauses are due to three conflicting constraints: a modified Unique Checking Constraint based on that in Wexler (1998), a conceptual constraint requiring both T and C to appear in every full clause, and a constraint which tells children to use phonological closeness to decide which goal to move when two goals are equally close to a probe. Children cannot avoid violation {{of at least one}} constraint, so they are required to violate as few as possible. This results in different possible derivations, each one of which produces results which are seen in child speech...|$|E
