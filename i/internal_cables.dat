50|$|Commander Iberian Atlantic Area was {{eventually}} established in 1967 as a Principal Subordinate Commander (PSC), reporting to CINCWESTLANT. The commander was a U.S. Navy rear admiral who {{also served as}} chief of the Military Assistance and Advisory Group in Lisbon. In 1975 IBERLANT was described as 'probably of greater symbolic value to Portugal than of military value to NATO' in <b>internal</b> <b>cables</b> of the U.S. Department of State. In 1981 the command included the Island Command Madeira. In 1982 NATO agreed to the upgrading of IBERLANT into a Major Subordinate Command (MSC), becoming Commander-in-Chief Iberian Atlantic Area (CINCIBERLANT). A Portuguese Navy Vice Admiral, dual-hatted as the fleet commander, took over the position. It was planned that Commander, Portuguese Air (COMPOAIR), a sub-PSC, would eventually {{take responsibility for the}} air defence of Portugal, reporting through CINCIBERLANT to SACEUR. Thus the Portuguese mainland would be 'associated' with Allied Command Europe.|$|E
50|$|A skeg is {{employed}} {{in the type of}} kayak used on more open water such as the sea. Its purpose and use are rather {{different from those of the}} surfing skeg. In the kayak, the amount of exposure of the skeg to the water, and also its effect on the position of the boat's centre of lateral resistance (CLR), is freely adjustable by the crew. The adjustment varies the degree to which the wind affects the boat - that is, the amount of lateral movement the wind can cause by impacting the upper parts of the boat and the crew. In more conventional calculations, this would be the centre of effort of the sail area (CE). In still water, where the wind is pushing the boat sideways, a contrary force (lateral resistance) develops, resisting that movement. If the central points of the application of those two forces coincide, the boat moves steadily sideways. Otherwise, it rotates in the horizontal plane, until they are in line. By varying the CLR, it is possible to better control the boat's attitude towards the wind and waves. Irregular flowing movement of the water complicates the issue, however. This link explains the subtleties of the kayak skeg. They may be made of wood, fiberglass or aluminum. Some are deployed using <b>internal</b> <b>cables,</b> but others use external ropes and bungee cord.Typically, these are retractable, and they are not a rudder. If properly configured (e.g., use of street sign aluminum in a narrow box that extends through the hull) they will not flex, and will greatly decrease and counter pitch, Roll and yaw, like a centerboard on a sailboat, when the craft is moving. In that sense, the skeg acts as a lifting foil.|$|E

With reference to the external prestressing, the importance of the number of saddle points to increase the safe prestressing level of the beam is shown.

40|$|The {{long-term}} behaviour {{of continuous}} steel-concrete composite beams is investigated {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness of the principal prestressing systems generally used to prevent concrete cracking in the regions of the internal supports. Four prestressing techniques are considered: the first with imposed support settlements, the second with <b>internal</b> <b>cables</b> in cast-in-situ slab, the third with <b>internal</b> <b>cables</b> in precast concrete slab and the fourth with external cables. The time-evolution of the compressive stress on the slab is studied evaluating the magnitude of the stress loss due to the concrete creep. The study is carried out on a composite beam model with flexible shear connection which permits taking into account the slip at the beam-slab interface and calculating the longitudinal shear force distribution which is particularly important at the cable anchorage sections...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} modeling {{technique is}} utilized {{to investigate the}} response of a UH- 60 A helicopter to both lightning and nuclear electromagnetic pulses (NEMP). The analytical approach involves the three-dimensional time domain finite-difference solutions of Maxwell's equations. Both the external currents and charges {{as well as the}} internal electromagnetic fields and cable responses are computed. Results of the analysis indicate that, in general, the short circuit current on <b>internal</b> <b>cables</b> is larger for lightning, whereas the open-circuit voltages are slightly higher for NEMP. The lightning response is highly dependent upon the rise time of the injected current as was expected. The analysis shows that a coupling levels to cables in a helicopter are 20 to 30 dB larger than those observed in fixed-wing aircraft...|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} response (electromagnetic {{fields and}} cable responses) of tactical shelters is addressed. Tactical shelters are usually well-shielded systems. Apart from penetrations by signal and power lines, the main leakage paths {{to the interior}} are via seams and the environment control unit (ECU) honeycomb filter. The time domain in three-dimensional finite-difference technique is employed to determine the external and internal coupling to a shelter excited by nuclear electromagnetic pulses (NEMP) and attached lightning. The responses of interest are the internal electromagnetic fields and the voltage, current, power, and energy coupled to <b>internal</b> <b>cables.</b> Leakage through the seams and ECU filter is accomplished by their transfer impedances which relate internal electric fields to external current densities. Transfer impedances which were experimentally measured {{are used in the}} analysis. The internal numerical results are favorably compared to actual shelter test data under simulated NEMP illumination...|$|E

5000|$|Unlike the Brompton or Birdy, this fold is not {{particularly}} compact; in fact, it is larger than many 20 and 16 in wheel folding bicycles (such as those from Dahon).

Here, the action of rotating the rear of the bike slackens an <b>internal</b> <b>cable</b> which enables the handlebar stem to be folded.

40|$|A new network {{construction}} {{method is}} presented for building of scalable, high throughput, low latency networks. The method {{is based on}} the exact equivalence discovered between the problem of maximizing network throughput (measured as bisection bandwidth) for a large class of practically interesting Cayley graphs and the problem of maximizing codeword distance for linear error correcting codes. Since the latter problem belongs to a more mature research field with large collections of optimal solutions available, a simple translation recipe is provided for converting the existent optimal error correcting codes into optimal throughput networks. The resulting networks, called here Long Hop networks, require 1. 5 - 5 times fewer switches, 2 - 6 times fewer <b>internal</b> <b>cables</b> and 1. 2 - 2 times fewer `average hops' than the best presently known networks for the same number of ports provided and the same total throughput. These advantage ratios increase with the network size and switch radix. Independently interesting byproduct of the discovered equivalence is an efficient O(n*log(n)) algorithm based on Walsh-Hadamard transform for computing exact bisections of this class of Cayley graphs (this is NP complete problem for general graphs).

40|$|The {{triggered}} lightning {{environment of}} the F 106 B aircraft is investigated. Scale modeling of the F 106 B with a metallized model was done to measure electric field enhancement factors on the aircraft and on canonically shaped conducting objects.

This is done using nonlinear air chemistry models to model a variety of physical phenomena which occur in a triggered lightning event. The effect of a triggered lightning strike on internal wires in the F 106 B is investigated using finite difference models and transmission line models to calculate the electromagnetic coupling of lightning currents through seams and joints of the aircraft to <b>internal</b> <b>cables.</b> Time domain waveforms are computed and compared to measured waveforms.
