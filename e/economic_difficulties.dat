5|$|Andersen {{was born}} on 9 July 1898 in Kristiania (now Oslo), and had a {{difficult}} childhood, {{the latter part of}} it in an orphanage. He was the son of construction worker Ole Andersen and Josefine Hansen. Soon after Johannes was born, Norway entered a period of <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties,</b> with little construction work available. This led to his father having to change jobs from mason to milkman. Johannes' mother became obsessed with religion.|$|E
5|$|Between 1607 and 1608 El Greco was {{involved}} in a protracted legal dispute with the authorities of the Hospital of Charity at Illescas concerning payment for his work, which included painting, sculpture and architecture; this and other legal disputes contributed to the <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties</b> he experienced towards the end of his life. In 1608, he received his last major commission: for the Hospital of Saint John the Baptist in Toledo.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is the {{comparative}} analysis of the funding of public universities with {{the focus on the}} issues of the coefficients of <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty.</b> At the beginning of the thesis the education is provided in universities set into the Czech educational system. Furthermore the thesis is targeted {{on the history of the}} Czech higher education and its development since its founding and establishing to the present status. In the theoretical part the basic concepts of funding and financing public universities and the history of the coefficient of <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty,</b> which is compared from different perspectives in the analytical part, are explained. The aim of this thesis is the comparison of the values of the coefficients of <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty</b> in selected public universities, while taking into account the development of the share of personal and non-capital costs in the main function, the number of students and the number of academic staff. The target of this thesis is the comparison of the values of the coefficients of <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty</b> in selected public universities taking into account the development of the share of personal and non-capital costs in the core business, the number of students and academic staff. The result is a proposed amendment to the values of these coefficients and the level of the amount of funding provided to public universities in the Czech Republic...|$|R
50|$|When {{businesses}} face losses or {{increases in}} prices, {{they can also}} implement budget freezes to fix spending and prevent further loss in profits. This is especially true during times of <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty.</b>|$|R
5|$|By 1950, {{more than}} half of all {{employment}} was in the manufacturing sector. Due to <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties,</b> Studebaker closed its automotive manufacturing plants in South Bend in December 1963. A general decline in manufacturing soon followed as industry was being restructured nationwide. By the year 2000, manufacturing was only 16 percent of the local economy. Due to the severe loss of jobs, the city's population decreased by nearly 30,000 people during that period.|$|E
5|$|Eastbourne’s {{reputation}} for health, enhanced by bracing air and sea breezes {{contributed to the}} establishment of many independent schools in the 19th century and in 1871, the year which saw the arrival of Queenwood Ladies College, the town was just beginning a period of growth and prosperity. By 1896, Gowland’s Eastbourne Directory listed 76private schools for boys and girls. However, <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties</b> during the inter-war years saw a gradual {{decline in the number of}} independent schools.|$|E
5|$|Only {{very small}} {{allowances}} {{were made by}} the government to families of POWs, which was not sufficient to offset the <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties</b> caused. The large proportion of men in prisoner of war camps changed the gender balance in jobs. Many women took over running family farms and businesses, and others were forced to look for employment.|$|E

5|$|Promoted to brigadier in 1928, Burgess became Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces, a {{position}} {{now known as}} the Chief of Army, in 1931 for a four-year term. The country's <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties</b> made his appointment a difficult one. The depression had resulted in New Zealand's compulsory military training scheme being abolished and the Territorial Force needed to be reorganised accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Poland from 1945 to 1989 spans {{the period of}} Soviet {{communist}} dominance imposed {{after the end of}} World War II over what had become the Polish People's Republic. These years, while featuring general industrialization and urbanization and many improvements in the standard of living in Poland, were marred by social unrest and severe <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{stability}} at last {{achieved in}} the west, Alexios now {{had a chance to}} begin solving his severe <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties</b> and the disintegration of the empire's traditional defences. In order to reestablish the army, Alexios began to build a new force on the basis of feudal grants (próniai) and prepared to advance against the Seljuks, who had conquered Asia Minor and were now established at Nicaea.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{between the}} republics and nations of Yugoslavia {{intensified}} from the 1970s to the 1980s. The causes for {{the collapse of}} the country have been associated with nationalism, ethnic conflict, <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty,</b> frustration with government bureaucracy, the influence of important figures in the country, and international politics.|$|R

5000|$|US {{economist}} Joseph Stiglitz {{has also}} criticised the EU {{for being too}} slow to help Greece, insufficiently supportive of the new government, lacking the will power to set up sufficient [...] "solidarity and stabilisation framework" [...] to support countries experiencing <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty,</b> and too deferential to bond rating agencies.|$|R
5|$|Afghanistan did {{not send}} any {{delegation}} to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties.</b> Laws implemented by the Taliban government also {{made it impossible for}} Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males were forbidden to cut their facial hair. Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games {{after the fall of the}} Taliban government in the midst of ongoing war. In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.|$|E
5|$|Having {{achieved}} {{stability in}} the West, Alexios could turn {{his attention to the}} severe <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties</b> and the disintegration of the Empire's traditional defences. However, he still did not have enough manpower to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor and to advance against the Seljuks. At the Council of Piacenza in 1095, envoys from Alexios spoke to Pope Urban II about the suffering of the Christians of the East, and underscored that without help from the West they would continue to suffer under Muslim rule.|$|E
5|$|Lê Duẩn visited China from 20–25 November 1977 to seek aid. CPC Chairman Hua Guofeng {{stated that}} Sino/Vietnamese {{relations}} had deteriorated because they held different principles. Hua insisted that China {{could not help}} Vietnam because of its own <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties</b> and differences in principles. Lê Duẩn countered that the only difference was how they viewed the Soviet Union and the United States. Following his visit, China (Xinhua) condemned COMECON. China halted all economic development projects between May and July 1978. During this period total Chinese aid to Vietnam amounted to $300 million.|$|E
50|$|From a {{very young}} age Adán {{demonstrated}} great literary talent (talent he shared with classmates Emilio Adolfo Westphalen (ES) and Estuardo Núñez (ES)).

25|$|Between May and August 1961, after {{a lengthy}} battle for the Brazilian market, Varig {{gradually}} took over the Consortium Real-Aerovias-Nacional, which was in serious <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty.</b> This purchase not only made Varig the largest airline in South America but also granted rights to other cities in Latin America, Miami, the West Coast of the United States and to Japan.|$|R
5000|$|After World War II, Japan {{experienced}} extreme <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty.</b> Commercial {{passenger car}} production started in 1947 with the model SA. The company {{was on the}} brink of bankruptcy by the end of 1949, but the company eventually obtained a loan from a consortium of banks which stipulated an independent sales operation and elimination of [...] "excess manpower".|$|R
5|$|The banking {{sector is}} one of the {{principal}} foundations of Jordan's economy. Despite the unrest and <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties</b> in the Arab world resulting from the Arab Spring uprisings, Jordan's banking sector maintained its growth in 2014. The sector currently consists of 25 banks, 15 of which are listed on the Amman Stock Exchange. Amman is the base city for the international Arab Bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the Middle East, serving clients in more than 600 branches in 30 countries on five continents. Arab Bank represents 28% of the Amman Stock Exchange and is the highest-ranked institution by market capitalization on the exchange.|$|E
5|$|When the new Parliament {{opened in}} 1923, the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin {{suggested}} that tariff reform {{was the best}} way to solve Britain's <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties.</b> Unfortunately Bonar Law, his predecessor, had promised that there would be no tariff reforms introduced during the current Parliament. Baldwin felt that the only solution was to call a new general election. In the ensuing election Baldwin's Conservatives lost 88 seats, with the Labour Party gaining 47 and the Liberal Party gaining 41. This produced a hung parliament, and Labour and the Liberals formed a coalition government with Labour as the main party. Hastings himself was re-elected without difficulty, increasing his majority.|$|E
5|$|While Russia {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{consumers}} of alcohol per capita in the world, the use of non-traditional surrogate alcohols rapidly rose in the 2010s due to ongoing <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties</b> in Russia. With a price far below that of government-regulated vodka, surrogates reached an estimated height of twenty percent of the country's alcohol consumption by 2016. These products were often nearly pure alcohol that could be diluted to a rough approximation of vodka, and were frequently available at all hours via strategically placed vending machines. In the Irkutsk incident, the victims drank scented bath lotion that was mislabeled as containing drinkable ethanol.|$|E
5000|$|... "Sick man of Europe" [...] is a label {{given to}} a European country {{experiencing}} a time of <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty</b> or impoverishment. The term was first used in the mid-19th century to describe the Ottoman Empire, but has since been applied {{at one time or}} another to nearly every other major country in Europe including UK before joining EU.|$|R
50|$|Switzerland's other watch making giant Allgemeine Schweizerische Uhrenindustrie AG (ASUAG - {{supplier}} {{of a large}} range of Swiss movements and watch assemblers) was in <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty.</b> It was the principal manufacturer of Ébauche (unfinished movements) and owner, through their sub-holding company General Watch Co (GWC), of various other Swiss watch brands including Longines, Rado, Certina, Hamilton Watch and Mido.|$|R
50|$|Ethel Myers {{believed}} {{strongly in}} the importance of her husband's artistic career, and never hesitated in putting her own artwork to the side to pursue entrepreneurial activities that would help her family weather <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty.</b> These activities included design and teaching. Her life as a businesswoman would cover a period of about 25 years, from 1915 until Jerome's death in 1940.|$|R
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to divert {{attention}} from <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties</b> in Iran and from a growing nationalist movement, a campaign of persecution against the Bahá'ís was instituted. An approved and coordinated anti-Bahá'í campaign (to incite public passion against the Bahá'ís) started in 1955 and it included the spreading of anti-Bahá'í propaganda on national radio stations and in official newspapers. In the late 1970s the Shah's regime consistently lost legitimacy due to criticism that it was pro-Western. As the anti-Shah movement gained ground and support, revolutionary propaganda was spread which alleged that some of the Shah's advisors were Bahá'ís. Bahá'ís were portrayed as economic threats, and as supporters of Israel and the West, and societal hostility against the Bahá'ís increased.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 in the United States, {{a serious}} {{outbreak}} of oyster-vectored disease {{was caused by}} Vibrio vulnificus. Although the number of victims was low, the mortality rate was high at 50%. About 10 cases have occurred annually since then and further {{research needs to be}} done to establish the epidemiology of the infections. The cases peak in mid-summer and autumn with no cases being reported in mid winter so there may be a link between the temperature at which the oysters are held between harvesting and consumption. In 1978, an oyster-associated gastrointestinal infection affecting more than 2,000 people occurred in Australia. The causative agent was found to be the Norwalk virus and the epidemic caused major <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties</b> to the oyster farming industry in the country. In 1988, an outbreak of hepatitis A associated with the consumption of inadequately cooked clams (Anadara subcrenata) took place in the Shanghai area of China. An estimated 290,000 people were infected and there were 47 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Japan Airlines {{began the}} 1990s with flights to {{evacuate}} Japanese citizens from Iraq {{before the start}} of the Gulf War. In October 1990, Japan Air Charter was established, and, in September 1996, an agreement with The Walt Disney Company made Japan Airlines the official airline of Tokyo Disneyland. JAL Express was established in April 1997, with Boeing 737 aircraft. In the 1990s the airline encountered further <b>economic</b> <b>difficulties</b> stemming from recessions in the United States and United Kingdom, plus a domestic downturn. Following years of profit since 1986 the airline began to post operating losses in 1992. Cost-cutting, including the formation of the low-cost JAL Express domestic subsidiary and the transfer of tourist operations to JALways (the successor to Japan Air Charter), helped return the airline to profitability in 1999.|$|E
50|$|A career-long {{advocate}} of deploying technology to make insurance more accessible, Smith has also emphasized {{the role the}} reinsurance sector plays in both macro- and microeconomic resilience, especially in uncertain and hazardous conditions like those influenced by climate change and <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty.</b> In January 2014 Smith spoke at the 2014 Investor Summit on Climate Risk at the United Nations in New York.|$|R
50|$|Hackman (2003) {{emphasizes}} {{this point}} via {{an example of}} his previous research {{on the effectiveness of}} airline cockpit crews. The study looked at 300 crews from various airlines located in the U.S., Europe, and Asia (Hackman, 1993). The crews varied based on success, and the current barriers they were facing, which included things such as <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty</b> and other external stressors.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, Mohammad Mosaddeq, {{head of the}} {{nationalist}} movement known as the National Front of Iran, led parliament in the nationalization of AIOC, and shortly after was appointed prime minister by the Shah. Mosaddeq oversaw the takeover of British oil facilities and rising <b>economic</b> <b>difficulty</b> and polarization in Iran as the AIOC withdrew its employees and retaliated with a boycott of Iranian oil.|$|R
