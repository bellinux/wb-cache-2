5|$|The metal-rich {{white dwarf}} WD 1145+017 {{is the first}} white dwarf {{observed}} with a disintegrating minor planet which transits the star. The disintegration of the planetesimal generates a debris cloud which passes {{in front of the}} star every 4.5 hours, causing a 5-minute-long <b>fade</b> <b>in</b> the star's optical brightness.

5|$|Young {{specimens}} of Tylopilus rubrobrunneus have a purplish cap, but unlike T.plumbeoviolaceous, their stems are never purple. The species Tylopilus microsporus, known only from China, {{is characterized by}} pale violet to violet cap, paler purple to purplish brown stem, and flesh color to pale purplish red pores. In addition to its different distribution, it can be distinguished from T.plumbeoviolaceus by its smaller spores. Another similar Asian species, T.obscureviolaceus, is only known from the Yaeyama Islands in southwestern Japan. It differs from T.plumbeoviolaceous in having a cap that does not <b>fade</b> <b>in</b> color to grayish or brownish when mature, shorter spores (6–7.2 by 3.3–4µm), and other microscopic characteristics.|$|E

5|$|Zapp spawned {{several more}} albums in close {{succession}} within the 1980s, retaining the heavily electronic style that Zapp II had adopted. Zapp III {{was released in}} 1983, {{but it did not}} reach the same chart positions as Zapp's previous efforts. While still gaining a gold certification, it only peaked at 39 on the Billboard 200 and nine on the R chart. Zapp IIIs poorer commercial performance became a sign that the band's popularity and impact were beginning to decline toward the mid 1980s, with post-disco music falling out of trend. By the release of The New Zapp IV U on October 25, 1985, Zapp's popularity declined more. The album gained gold status, but only in 1994, almost a decade after its initial release. Zapp's presence began to <b>fade</b> <b>in</b> {{the latter half of the}} 1980s, and Troutman's attention was focused on his solo career. The final release by Zapp before Troutman's death was Zapp V, on September 12, 1989, which was met with moderate commercial success and failed to receive an RIAA certification.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school <b>fade</b> <b>in</b> and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{running in}} {{practice}} and a wet qualifying session meant that teams had to improvise their strategies at the Hockenheimring. Fernando Alonso controlled much of the race from pole position, only relinquishing the lead when he pitted, {{and he went on}} to take his third victory of the season. Lewis Hamilton's one hundredth Grand Prix started with a disaster when he picked up a puncture on the third lap and spent most of the race {{at the tail end of}} the field before retiring on lap 56 with a suspension problem. Confusion briefly reigned when Hamilton, in seventeenth place at the time, began lapping faster than the leaders and sought to unlap himself. Sebastian Vettel later claimed that this was a ploy by McLaren to force both him and Alonso to drive defensively against Hamilton, slowing them down enough to allow team-mate Jenson Button to leap-frog them at the second round of stops; Vettel lost a position to Button, but Alonso was unaffected, as Ferrari pitted him before Hamilton could interfere with his race. Button briefly looked as if he had the pace to pass Alonso for the race lead, but the race was deadlocked in the final twenty laps, and Button began to <b>fade</b> <b>in</b> the final five laps of the race. The race was marked by another technical dispute regarding Red Bull Racing, who were referred to the stewards by FIA Technical Delegate Jo Bauer for what he felt was an illegal engine map in use on the Red Bull RB8. The stewards elected to take no action against Red Bull, stating that the team had not violated any of the technical regulations, but noted that they did not accept all of the arguments presented by the team when asked to explain. The stewards were less forgiving of Vettel, who ran wide at the hairpin while trying to pass Button and could only complete the pass outside the limits of the circuit. Vettel had twenty seconds added to his race time as a penalty, demoting him to fifth overall. With Button promoted to second, Kimi Räikkönen inherited third place and Kamui Kobayashi was classified a career-best fourth.|$|E
30|$|Concerning {{multipath}} <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> dynamic scenarios, {{one should}} use Nakagami distribution {{as it can}} represent all cases; a nearly Rice <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> the CP channel and Rayleigh <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> the XP channel is observed. For the CP channel, values of the shape parameter between 1.2 and 1.3 are suitable for the QLoS and NLoS cases, whereas the value for the LoS case can significantly differ between quasi- and true-dynamic scenarios, i.e. between 4.3 for the former and 19 for the latter. For the XP channel, values between 0.9 and 1.2 could be suitable for the shape parameter in either propagation conditions or user dynamics. Similarly, the subtle differences observed between corresponding values of the scale parameter suggest that values 1.6 and 1.9 will in general provide a satisfactory representation of the multipath <b>fading</b> <b>in</b> this channel.|$|R

25|$|Stellar {{remnants}} are objects {{associated with}} the death of stars. Because the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is observational in nature, these remnants cannot easily be plotted on the diagram, or cannot be placed at all. Neutron stars are relatively small and cold, and would fall far {{on the left side of}} the diagram. Planetary nebulae are dynamic and tend to quickly <b>fade</b> <b>in</b> brightness as the progenitor star transitions to the white dwarf branch. If shown, a planetary nebula would be plotted to the left of the diagram's upper left quadrant. A black hole emits no visible light of its own, and therefore would not appear on the diagram.|$|E
25|$|Three {{signals from}} three {{different}} sources (satellite, satellite, and terrestrial) are therefore combined in the receiver as radio signals, (not as audio signals). The three signals need to be combined constructively (avoiding situations where bad signals pollute good signals) in the receiver before being decoded. Heavy error correction {{is applied to the}} signals. All three signals contain the same audio content on all the channels that the receiver can receive, {{with the exception of one}} audio program waveform being transmitted ahead of the other two by approximately four seconds. With this time skew, the signals, once realigned, need to see an 8-second obstruction of overpass <b>fade</b> <b>in</b> order to lose audio content. This increases the robustness of the signal delivery in most driving conditions.|$|E

25|$|Across the Atlantic in 1922, after {{placing a}} {{transmitter}} and receiver {{on opposite sides of}} the Potomac River, U.S. Navy researchers A. Hoyt Taylor and Leo C.

Taylor submitted a report, suggesting that this phenomenon might be used to detect the presence of ships in low visibility, but the Navy did not immediately continue the work. Eight years later, Lawrence A. Hyland at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) observed similar fading effects from passing aircraft; this revelation led to a patent application as well as a proposal for further intensive research on radio-echo signals from moving targets to take place at NRL, where Taylor and Young were based at the time.|$|E
