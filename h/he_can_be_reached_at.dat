40|$|Access, maintenance, and {{distribution}} of clean water are daunting tasks for developing nations. Efforts to provide clean drinking water have often fallen short, which has prompted the World Bank to advocate for privatization. From a theoretical perspective, privatization blends the advantages of corporate efficiency with responsible management {{on behalf of the}} national government. Analysis of attempts to privatize water in the Philippines, with the establishment of the Metropolitan Waterworks Sewerage System (MWSS), shows mixed results. Between 1997 and 2003, citizens with access to water increased from 58 percent to 84 percent, yet water became five times costlier due to privatization. Advocates may applaud the efficiency of the model, but developing nations must emphasize accessibility and affordability of the resource. Privatization, as a model for water distribution, remains contentious. * The following authors include MPA candidates at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs and a researcher at the Earth Institute.

Finite state machines have been in use in computer programming for many years. Systems that are primarily reactive in nature are often well {{described in terms of}} input events and outcomes. Such eventdriven systems can be expressed as a collection of states, each representing a mode in which the system has a specific set of behaviors or reactions to input events. States can react to events by switching the system to another state, by ignoring the event, or by generating other events. State machines represent a conceptually simple way to handle disparate programming tasks, and indeed find their way into many different kinds of programs- from grammar parsers to CD players. State machines often simplify software designs dramatically, because they mimic the way systems work conceptually, allowing difficult problems to be broken down into groups of simpler ones. The main tool in designing a state machine is the state transition diagram, or state diagram for short. A state diagram is a simply directed graph whose nodes represent states and whose arrows represent transitions from one state to another. The arrows are labeled with the name of the event that caused the transition. Some transitions might occur on conditionally, and in these cases, the condition is shown next to the event name, in parentheses. Figure 1 shows a simple state diagram. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Packet {{telephony}} is {{of increasing}} interest {{in both the}} telecommunications and internet communities. The emergence of packet telephony will create new services, and presents an opportunity to rethink how conventional telephony services are implemented. In this paper, we present an architecture for telephony over packet networks (TOPS). TOPS allows users to move between terminals or to use mobile terminals while being reachable by the same name. TOPS users can have multiple terminals and control how calls are routed to them. TOPS allows for terminals {{with a range of}} capabilities such as support for video, whiteboard, and other media with a variety of coding formats. TOPS retains the necessary information on terminal capabilities to determine the appropriate type of communication to be established with the remote terminal. The architecture assumes that the underlying network supports the establishment of end-toend connectivity between terminals, with an appropriate quality of service. The components of TOPS are a directory service, anapplication layer signaling protocol, and a logical channel abstraction for communication between end-systems. The directory service maps a user’s name to a set of terminals where the user may <b>be</b> <b>reached.</b> A user <b>can</b> control the translation operation by specifying profiles that customize how his name is mapped to a set of terminals where <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached.</b> Terminal capabilities <b>are</b> also stored in the directory service. The application layer signaling protocol establishes and maintains call state between communicating terminals. The logical channel abstraction provides a shared endto-end context for a call’s constituent media and control streams, while isolating the applications from the details of the network transport mechanisms. In addition to supporting simple pointto-point calls, the architecture supports both centralized and decentralized conferencing. We also introduce a simple encapsulation format for voice.

Since cigarettes are addictive, it could be expected that taxation would have little or no effect on the number of cigarette smoked per day or the percentage of smokers within a given population.

It will be shown that the percent-age of adult smokers does not change with taxation whereas the percentage of underage smokers decreases significantly when excise taxes on cigarettes increase.

40|$|Monday, December 20, 2004 Media Advisory UGA law {{professor}} says associational effect may be crucial in any potential prosecution of Dr. Barton Corbin According to nationally recognized trial law expert and University of Georgia {{law professor}} Ronald L. Carlson, {{in the event}} the grand jury indicts Barton Corbin for shooting {{his wife in the}} head and leaving the handgun next to her on the bed, events in Augusta may dramatically affect any possible Gwinnett County prosecution. In Augusta in 1990, Corbin 2 ̆ 7 s girlfriend Dorothy Hearn was found on a couch dead from a single gunshot wound to the head with a revolver in her lap. “As in the Lynn Turner antifreeze poisoning deaths, the ability of a prosecutor to bring in evidence of both deaths is often crucial in such cases. Introduction of this sort of evidence results from the operation of Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s ‘similar crimes’ law, which allows pattern conduct exhibited in a former case to be used in a later prosecution,” Carlson said. Augusta authorities are reported to be reopening the case of the Augusta shooting of Hearn. Carlson wonders whether a gunshot residue test was ever conducted on Hearn’s hands. “Much has been made of a similar test done on the hands of Corbin, with authorities awaiting results from the GBI, but media sources have not reported whether any such test was conducted on the hands of Jennifer Corbin,” he said. Carlson is curious about whether GSR testing was done on the victim 2 ̆ 7 s hands in both the Buford shooting in 2004 as well as the 1990 fatality in Augusta.

40|$|On August 21, 1635, the Danish King Christian IV in an Open Letter {{made public}} that all foreign ships {{passing through the}} Sound had to pay toll and that {{therefore}} all shipping documents had to be translated into Danish. Thus {{you could say that}} the translation industry in Denmark - and consequently also in Norway - began with the “Sound Dues”, a special toll levied on alle ships passing through the Sound between Denmark and Sweden (then Denmark), with Hamlet’s Elsinore being a major easy-to-guard traffic junction for international shipping at that time. The “Translation Office” associated with the “Sound Dues” continued to exist until 1857. Today certification – or authorization – as a translator and interpreter is administered by the Danish government and is granted to persons who have successfully completed in-depth translation studies at either the Copenhagen Business School (CBS) or the Århus School of Business. Studies in English, French, German, Spanish and, to a limited extent, Italian and Russian are offered by the two business schools as full-time programs. The present training structure for these languages is three years for the bachelor’s degree and another two years for the master’s degree – the last two years being devoted to specialization in core subjects such as legal language, technical language, economics, accounting, banking and finance and interpretation skills both into and from Danish. Authorization is granted to these candidates after they have obtained the degree of cand. ling. merc. (MA) in translation and interpretation from either the Copenhagen Business School (CBS) or the Århus School of Business. In languages other than those mentioned above, the candidates may register for a special translator’s examination, which is administered by CBS. This is an option used by foreigners in Denmark who want to perform certified translations into and from their mother tongue, but also by Danes who want to obtain authorization to perform certified translations into and from these languages. The requirements of this special examination do not differ much from the requirements applying to the main languages mentioned above, a major difference, however, being the fact that no structured training is available, i. e. the candidates are more or less left to study on their own. Dictionaries and other aids are allowed, and so is the use of computer. The examination used to be free of charge, but currently the whole process of authorization is estimated to cost about Euro 1, 500.

40|$|This {{article is}} in Danish. On August 21, 1635, the Danish King Christian IV in an Open Letter made public that all foreign ships {{passing through the}} Sound had to pay toll and that {{therefore}} all shipping documents had to be translated into Danish. Thus {{you could say that}} the translation industry in Denmark - and consequently also in Norway - began with the “Sound Dues”, a special toll levied on alle ships passing through the Sound between Denmark and Sweden (then Denmark), with Hamlet’s Elsinore being a major easy-to-guard traffic junction for international shipping at that time. The “Translation Office” associated with the “Sound Dues” continued to exist until 1857. Today certification – or authorization – as a translator and interpreter is administered by the Danish government and is granted to persons who have successfully completed in-depth translation studies at either the Copenhagen Business School (CBS) or the Århus School of Business. Studies in English, French, German, Spanish and, to a limited extent, Italian and Russian are offered by the two business schools as full-time programs. The present training structure for these languages is three years for the bachelor’s degree and another two years for the master’s degree – the last two years being devoted to specialization in core subjects such as legal language, technical language, economics, accounting, banking and finance and interpretation skills both into and from Danish. Authorization is granted to these candidates after they have obtained the degree of cand. ling. merc. (MA) in translation and interpretation from either the Copenhagen Business School (CBS) or the Århus School of Business.

40|$|The thesis explores {{possible}} reasons {{why people are}} drawn to violent Islamist groups. This is done by mapping psychological mechanisms which might be effective {{in the process of}} making individuals receptive to the jihadi-Salafi ideology. The thesis' perspective stems from the conviction that the structural conditions in a given society are decisive in the propagation of radical oppositional groups. The psychological mechanism known as the sour-grapes syndrome will serve to illustrate the effect of the socio-economic conditions in the Middle East. In Jean de La Fontaine's fable, a fox decides that the grapes <b>he</b> <b>can</b> not <b>reach</b> <b>are</b> sour and thus not worth having. In the current context I will argue that some of the aversion towards Western style government and social order, stems from this mechanism; as the western world's standard of living and individual freedom appear unattainable to people living in many Muslim countries, they react by opposing these values...|$|R

Carlson, the delay in the Nichols trial verdict does not necessarily suggest that the jury will remain hopelessly deadlocked. Carlson has high praise for Judge Bodiford 2 ̆ 7 s shepherding of the jury through to this point, and he is hopeful the judge 2 ̆ 7 s gentle persuasion will bring about a decision. 2 ̆ 2 If all else fails, the judge will perhaps employ an 2 ̆ 7 Allen 2 ̆ 7 or 2 ̆ 7 dynamite 2 ̆ 7 jury charge, which is an instruction to the jury designed to bring about unanimity and conclude the deliberations. 2 ̆ 2 When the jury asked to hear a recording of Nichols 2 ̆ 7 telephone call wherein Nichols said he should have stopped on the D. A. 2 ̆ 7 s floor {{on the day of}} the killings with his gun in hand, that suggested an attitude of vengeance, not remorse. 2 ̆ 2 The jury 2 ̆ 7 s interest in hearing that recording again may be telling us that juror 2 ̆ 7 s who are in the majority are saying to the other jurors 2 ̆ 7 If we let him go without capital punishment, he might kill again. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 As jury deliberations continue Friday afternoon, Carlson, who has attended portions of the Nichols trial, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> at (706) 548 - 6771 (home). <b>He</b> <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> next week either at home or at (706) 542 - 5186 (law school). A recognized expert on evidence, trial practice and criminal procedure, Carlson is the Callaway Chair of Law Emeritus at the University of Georgia School of Law. A prodigious scholar and lecturer, Carlson has authored numerous books and scores of articles in prominent law reviews regarding these subjects. He has taught at Georgia Law since 1984 and often provides commentary for the national media in high-profile trials. For further information on Carlson, please visit [URL]. #...|$|R
