[...] The cylinder heads were integral with the engine.

5000|$|Starting in the 2009 {{model year}} cars with [...] "electronically {{controlled}} common rail direct injection system with Bosch high pressure pump", Volkswagen Group began migrating its light-duty passenger vehicle turbocharged direct injection (TDI) diesel engines to a common-rail fuel injection system. This system allows for higher-precision fuel delivery using electronically controlled fuel injectors and higher injection pressure, theoretically leading to better <b>fuel</b> <b>atomization,</b> better air/fuel ratio control, and by extension, better control of emissions.

This version of the engine received many updates over the previous version such as a redesigned head, more compact pistons, updated throttle body, an improved intake manifold with longer intake runners, 4 nozzle fuel injectors to improve <b>fuel</b> <b>atomization</b> and direct ignition. This version of the 1FZ-FE produced 240 horsepower (180 kW) at 4600 RPM and 300 pound-feet (410 N·m) at 3600 RPM on 91 Octane Fuel (RON) without a catalytic converter.|$|E

50|$|Internal mix nozzles contact fluids {{inside the}} nozzle; one {{configuration}} {{is shown in}} the figure above. Shearing between high velocity gas and low velocity liquid disintegrates the liquid stream into droplets, producing a high velocity spray. This type of nozzle tends to use less atomizing gas than an external mix atomizer and is better suited to higher viscosity streams.

50|$|Two {{versions}} of the Honda i-VTEC system {{can be found on}} a K series engine, and both versions can come with variable timing control (VTC) on the intake cam. The VTEC system on engines like the K20A3 only operate on the intake cam; at low rpm only one intake valve is fully opened, the other opening just slightly to create a swirl effect in the combustion chamber for improved <b>fuel</b> <b>atomization.</b> At high rpm, both intake valves open fully to improve engine breathing. In engines such as the K20A2 found in the Acura RSX Type-S, the VTEC system operates on both the intake and exhaust valves, allowing both to benefit from multiple cam profiles.|$|E
50|$|The first-generation Toyota CT26 {{utilized}} {{a single}} entry turbine housing {{and a single}} wastegate port design. It was fitted to the first generation ST165 Toyota Celica GT-Four. The intake charge was cooled by a water-to-air intercooler and the intake manifold design is Toyota's T-VIS. It has 8 independent ports and benefits from the inertia build up to improve engine torque at low and medium speeds by closing 4 ports below a certain RPM and throttle position to increase air speed and maximize <b>fuel</b> <b>atomization</b> and opening all 8 at higher engine loads for better air volume. Air metering is through an Air Flow Meter {{and there is no}} factory BPV/BOV in this generation. Fuel delivery is through 430cc injectors while air is fed through a 55mm throttle body and 7.15mm intake and exhaust valve lift. Compression ratio is 8.5:1 and produces 182-190HP and 190 lb-ft with a factory 8-9psi of boost. Fuel cut is at 12psi.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lack of an}} {{electrical}} ignition system also reduces the parasitic load on the engine, as the engine {{does not have to}} produce the necessary electricity to ignite the fuel. A significant amount of electricity is required by a spark ignition system, and as engine speeds and loads increase, the ignition system consumes proportionately more electricity, while simultaneously becoming less efficient. Higher cylinder pressure require a [...] "hotter" [...] spark with more current present to overcome the pressure and jump the gap from electrode to electrode in the spark plug. Increased engine speeds and loads also require the spark to occur more rapidly, resulting in additional electrical system loads and demands and more engine power required to meet them. As diesel engine speeds and loads increase, the higher cylinder temperatures after compression of the intake charge result in increased injection and ignition efficiency due to increased <b>fuel</b> <b>atomization.</b> Regardless of fuel system design, a mechanical diesel fuel injection system and rapid rise of fuel pressure and flow will result in injection nozzle opening pressure being reached more rapidly and also earlier in the 4-stroke cycle with more precise fuel delivery, more precise injection timing and built-in timing advance. Additional power is required to operate the injection system as engine speeds and loads increase, but the increase is more offset than in spark-ignition engines. Modern diesel engines with electronic injection systems use a large amount of electricity for injection, but the ability to precisely time injection and even perform multiple injection events per cycle result in generally increased fuel efficiency compared to mechanically-injected diesel engines of similar size and power.|$|E

5000|$|Toyota {{designed}} the engine for performance; the valve angle {{was a relatively}} wide 50 degrees, {{which at the time}} was believed to be ideal for high power production. Today, more modern high-revving engines have decreased the valve angle to 20 to 25 degrees, which is now believed to be ideal for high-revving engines with high specific power outputs. The first generation 4A-GE is nicknamed the [...] "bigport" [...] engine because it had intake ports of a very large cross-sectional area. While the port cross-section was suitable for a very highly modified engine at very high engine speeds, it caused a considerable drop in low-end torque due to the decreased air speeds at those rpms. To compensate for the reduced air speed, the first-generation engines included the T-VIS feature, in which dual intake runners are fitted with butterfly valves that opened at approximately 4,200 rpm. The effect is that at lower rpm (when the airspeed would normally be slow) four of the eight runners are closed, which forces the engine to draw in all its air through half the runners in the manifold. This not only raises the airspeed which causes better cylinder filling, but due to the asymmetrical airflow a swirl is created in the combustion chamber, meaning better <b>fuel</b> <b>atomization.</b> This enabled the torque curve to still be intact at lower engine speeds, allowing for better performance across the entire speed band and a broad, flat torque curve around the crossover point. During rising engine speed, a slight lurch can occur at the crossover point and an experienced driver will be able to detect the shift in performance. Production of the first-generation engine model lasted through 1987.|$|E

40|$|To realize {{supersonic}} combustion of hydrocarbons, {{an effective}} atomizer-igniter {{combination with the}} capabilities of <b>fuel</b> preheating, <b>atomization,</b> penetration, mixing, ignition and flameholding is desired. An original design concept incorporating these capabilities was built and tested at Virginia Tech, and was found to provide good penetration, effective atomization, and robust ignition and flameholding.
