5|$|Drowned God: Conspiracy of the Ages is a 1996 {{science fiction}} {{adventure}} game developed by Epic Multimedia Group {{and published by}} Inscape. The game propounds the conspiracy theory that all of human history <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> and that the human race's development and evolution were aided by extraterrestrials. The player attempts to uncover the truth {{through the course of}} the game by traveling to a variety of different worlds, interacting with historical and fictional characters, and solving puzzles.|$|E
5|$|Dot returns {{nearly four}} years later when Nigel tracks her down. She reveals that Nick has been arrested for drugs {{possession}} and Zoe and Ashley have moved away. After being held hostage by a convict friend of Nick, she returns to the square and is shocked when Nick returns unexpectedly. He tries to steal her money again by claiming he has AIDS and needs {{money to pay for}} illegally imported medication. Dot believes him but later discovers it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> and he is on the run from the police. She contacts the police, and he is arrested a week after his return.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{attends a}} lecture at MIT, where the {{testimony}} of Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), an alien abductee, is being presented. Mulder argues against {{other members of the}} lecture over the existence of alien life, claiming that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie</b> created to cover up a program of medical experimentation on civilians run by the military industrial complex. When the lecture ends, Mulder is met by Dr. Heitz Werber, who is surprised to see that Mulder has lost his belief in alien life since the last time they met. Werber tells Mulder that he is Cassandra's doctor, and asks him to visit her.|$|E

Kritschgau claims that the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government as a cover for {{the activities of the}} military–industrial complex. Mulder dismisses these claims until Scully tells him Kritschgau told her that she was given cancer to make him believe.|$|E
5|$|The Lorentz group <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lie</b> {{group and}} has {{as such a}} Lie algebra, The Lie algebra is a vector space of {{matrices}} {{that can be said}} to model the group near the identity. It is endowed with a multiplication operation, the Lie bracket. With it, the product in the group can near the identity be expressed in Lie algebraic terms (but not in a particularly simple way). The link between the (matrix) Lie algebra and the (matrix) Lie group is the matrix exponential. It is one-to-one near the identity in the group.|$|E
5|$|His 1952 {{paper on}} the subject, {{together}} with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery and Leo Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean group <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Lie</b> group. Gleason's contribution was to prove that this is true when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this property. As Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that monotonic functions are differentiable almost everywhere. On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper of Montgomery and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed some technical side conditions from Gleason's proof.|$|E

5|$|In Canada's St. Elias Mountains, {{a frozen}} {{extraterrestrial}} body is discovered by an expedition team. Professor Arlinsky, the team's leader, sends ice core samples containing presumably alien DNA to Fox Mulder. Both Mulder and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) eventually meet Michael Kritschgau (John Finn), a Defense Department employee who claims that everything Mulder {{thinks he knows}} about aliens <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie.</b> Kritschgau tells Mulder that his sister Samantha Mulder's abduction was fabricated, that all evidence of alien biology are merely scientific anomalies, and that the alien body discovered in Canada was fake. Kritschgau claims that the entire alien mythos is a hoax perpetrated by the U.S. government as a cover for the military–industrial complex. Distraught by Kritschgau's claims, Mulder loses his faith. Later, the FBI investigates Mulder's apparent suicide. Scully confirms the unseen body's identity.|$|E
5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie.</b> But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E
5|$|The {{people of}} South Park decide to turn Muhammad {{over to the}} Gingers, fearing the {{violence}} that will befall their town if they do not. The celebrities are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt Mecha-Streisand, a giant mechanical monster form of Barbra Streisand, who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed. The celebrities hope to use Mecha-Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands. Meanwhile, due to the chain of events, Cartman decides Connor's scheme has become too complicated and tries to quit, but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park have lied to Cartman about his true father. Although they previously claimed his hermaphroditic mother was also his father, Connor insists this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie.</b> Cartman confronts his school teacher Mr. Garrison and Garrison's old hand puppet Mr. Hat, who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover-up. Mecha-Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction as the episode ends.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} {{of the game and}} of its characters led Valve to develop merchandise for Portal made available through its online Steam store. Some of the more popular items were the Weighted Companion Cube plush toys and fuzzy dice. When first released, both were sold out in under 24 hours. Other products available through the Valve store include T-shirts and Aperture Science coffee mugs and parking stickers, and merchandise relating to the phrase the cake <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie,</b> which has become an internet meme. Wolpaw noted they did not expect certain elements of the game to be as popular as they were, while other elements they had expected to become fads were ignored, such as a giant hoop that rolls on-screen during the final scene of the game that the team had named Hoopy.|$|E
