5|$|Wipeout Pure is {{a racing}} game {{which is set}} in the year 2197, exactly 100 years after the events of Wipeout 2097, and {{revolves}} around players competing in the FX300 anti-gravity racing league. Players control anti-gravity ships which are owned racing corporations (effectively referred to as 'teams' in-game). There are a total of eight teams featured in the game, with one ship available for each. Every ship has different characteristics, for example each ship has variations in handling, thrust, maximum speed and shield strength. Each craft is equipped with an energy shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race; <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>lost</b> whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapons fire. If the shield runs out, the player's ship will explode and is consequently eliminated from the race. However, the player may replenish energy by absorbing weapon pick-ups.|$|E
5|$|Blood Money is a {{horizontal}} side-scrolling shooter that uses 2D computer graphics. Players move through four stages on the planet, {{taking control of}} a different vehicle in each level: a helicopter in the metal world, a submarine in a water world, a spacesuit in an ice world, and a fighter jet in a fire world. Each vehicle features unique weaponry, which players use to attack all advancing enemies. Players can upgrade their vehicle with power-ups, which grant them additional weapons and upgrades, such as support missiles and neutron bombs. The vehicles' energy acts as players' health, and is depleted when the vehicle makes contact with enemies and walls. When all <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>lost,</b> players lose a life; three lives are provided {{at the beginning of}} the game, and additional lives can be collected as players progress through the levels. When all three lives are lost, the game ends and players are sent to the title screen. The first two levels may be selected from the beginning of the game; after one level is complete, players can select any remaining world without restrictions. At the end of each level, players must defeat a boss.|$|E
5|$|The Wipeout {{games are}} {{a series of}} futuristic racers which involve players {{piloting}} anti-gravity ships through various forms of races. The series is known for its extreme speed, range of electronic dance music soundtracks, and consequential difficulty. Power-ups {{come in the form of}} offensive or defensive weaponry, ranging from machine guns, missiles, rockets, to energy shields, auto pilots, and mines. Power-ups are usually collected by flying over different coloured pads on race tracks. Speed boost pads also feature prominently on race tracks: once flown over, the player receives a short momentous boost. Every ship featured in a game is owned by a different racing corporation (collectively referred to as 'teams' in-game) although the number of teams and ships will vary throughout the games. Every ship has different characteristics, for example each ship will vary in handling, thrust, maximum speed and shield strength. Each ship is equipped with a compulsory shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race; <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>lost</b> whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapons fire. If the shield runs out, the ship in question will explode and the player is consequently eliminated from the race.|$|E

In this type of collision, the objects involved in the collisions do not stick, but some kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> still <b>lost.</b> Friction, sound and heat are some ways the kinetic <b>energy</b> can <b>be</b> <b>lost</b> through partial inelastic collisions.|$|R

25|$|Auroras are {{produced}} when the magnetosphere is sufficiently {{disturbed by the}} solar wind that the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma, mainly {{in the form of}} electrons and protons, precipitate them into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere) due to Earth's magnetic field, where their <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>lost.</b>|$|E

Changes of composition during development were measured in the complete body and in the exuvia from hatching through the second crab stage. Rates of exuvial loss increased during development in all parameters measured. They were generally highest in inorganic carbon and lowest in N. six to 7 % of late premolte <b>energy</b> <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> by moulting zoeae, i. e. 9 to 13 % of the energy produced during these stages. The megalopa lost 13 %, and juveniles 19 to 20 % of their LPRM energy (similar to 29 to 41 % of growth). During complete larval development of H. araneus a total of 18 % of produced <b>energy</b> <b>was</b> <b>lost</b> at ecdysis.

However, the abundance and distribution of organisms in an ecosystem is also affected by densities of consumers, which limit the success of organisms at lower trophic levels and thereby influence the abundance of these organisms (Hairston et al. 1960).|$|E

25|$|Vibrating viscometers {{can also}} be used to measure viscosity. Resonant, or {{vibrational}} viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency. As the surface of the sensor shears through the liquid, <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>lost</b> due to its viscosity. This dissipated energy is then measured, and converted into a viscosity reading. A higher viscosity causes a greater loss of energy.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{varies with}} temperature, density, {{collision}} speed and fuel. To reach net power production, reactions must occur rapidly {{enough to make}} up for energy losses. Plasma clouds lose energy through conduction and radiation. Conduction is when ions, electrons or neutrals touch a surface and escape. <b>Energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>lost</b> with the particle. Radiation is when energy escapes as light. Radiation increases with temperature. To get net power from fusion, these losses must be overcome. This leads to an equation for power output.|$|E
25|$|Speculating that {{production}} and storage of antimatter should become feasible, two further issues {{need to be}} considered. First, in the annihilation of antimatter, much of the <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>lost</b> as high-energy gamma radiation, and especially also as neutrinos, so that only about 40% of mc2 would actually be available if the antimatter were simply allowed to annihilate into radiations thermally. Even so, the energy available for propulsion would be substantially higher than the ~1% of mc2 yield of nuclear fusion, the next-best rival candidate.|$|E
25|$|Friction is a non-conservative force - {{work done}} against {{friction}} is path dependent. In {{the presence of}} friction, some <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> always <b>lost</b> {{in the form of}} heat. Thus mechanical <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> not conserved.|$|R
50|$|Under Gordon Brown's premiership {{there were}} two renamings of the role and three re-alignments of responsibility.

50|$|Under Hughes, one of {{the class}} was subject to early {{experiments}} in superheating, the process of increasing the temperature of steam produced in the boiler so the minimum of <b>energy</b> <b>was</b> <b>lost.</b> After months of trials, 20 superheated engines were authorised to be built and {{the first of the}} superheated class 27s emerged from Horwich Works in 1909. The superheated 27s had the same boiler pressure as the originals, 180 psi. The first batch had round topped boilers, but in 1912 a second batch of 20 was constructed with Belpaire fireboxes.|$|R
25|$|Just as a gun recoils when {{a bullet}} is fired, {{conservation}} of momentum requires a nucleus (such as in a gas) to recoil during emission or absorption of a gamma ray. If a nucleus at rest emits a gamma ray, {{the energy of}} the gamma ray is slightly less than the natural energy of the transition, but in order for a nucleus at rest to absorb a gamma ray, the gamma ray's energy must be slightly greater than the natural energy, because in both cases <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>lost</b> to recoil. This means that nuclear resonance (emission and absorption of the same gamma ray by identical nuclei) is unobservable with free nuclei, because the shift in energy is too great and the emission and absorption spectra have no significant overlap.|$|E

25|$|Coaxial cables are {{commonly}} used at audio frequencies and above for convenience. A coaxial cable has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube, separated by a dielectric layer. The current flowing {{on the surface of}} the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current flowing on the inner surface of the outer tube. The electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube, and (ideally) no <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>lost</b> to radiation or coupling outside the tube. Coaxial cables have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5GHz. For microwave frequencies greater than 5GHz, the losses (due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor) become too large, making waveguides a more efficient medium for transmitting energy. Coaxial cables with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they transmit power with lower loss.|$|E

25|$|Liquids {{have little}} {{compress}}ibility. Water, for example, will compress by only 46.4 {{parts per million}} for every unit increase in atmospheric pressure (bar). At around 4000 bar (58,000 psi) of pressure, at room temperature, water only experiences an 11% decrease in volume. In the study of fluid dynamics, liquids are often treated as incompressible, especially when studying incompressible flow. This incompressible nature makes a liquid suitable for transmitting hydraulic power, because {{very little of the}} <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>lost</b> in the form of compression. However, the very slight compressibility does lead to other phenomena. The banging of pipes, called water hammer, occurs when a valve is suddenly closed, creating a huge pressure-spike at the valve that travels backward through the system at just under the speed of sound. Another phenomenon caused by liquid's incompressibility is cavitation. Because liquids have little elasticity they can literally be pulled apart in areas of high turbulence or a dramatic change in direction, such as the trailing edge of a boat propeller or a sharp corner in a pipe. A liquid in an area of low pressure (vacuum) vaporizes and forms bubbles, which then collapse as they enter high pressure areas. This causes liquid to fill the cavities left by the bubbles with tremendous localized force, eroding any adjacent solid surface.|$|E

500|$|Every ship in {{the game}} has its own characteristics; {{depending}} on the team selected, a ship will vary in terms of speed, acceleration, manoeuvrability, and shield strength. Each ship is equipped with an energy shield which absorbs damage sustained; <b>energy</b> <b>is</b> <b>lost</b> whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapon fire. If the shield runs out, the ship and player in question will explode, resulting in elimination from the race. However, players may replenish energy by absorbing unwanted weapon pick-ups. The weapons are the same ones featured in Wipeout Pulse; defensive weapons range from shields—which temporarily make the player's ship invulnerable to damage—to land mines and stationary bombs. Offensive weapons include machine guns, missiles, rockets, and a [...] "quake" [...] – which {{comes in the form}} of a devastating earthquake that damages all opponents situated in front of the player.
