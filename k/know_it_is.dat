5|$|The {{trade off}} is between {{capacity}} and price. I've had some conversations with people saying 'it's {{getting a bit}} expensive Alan' and I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{intends to}} plant a fake {{advertisement}} to replace Lecktor's, but they realize that without the proper book code the Tooth Fairy will <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fake; therefore, they let the advertisement run as it is, and Graham organizes an interview with Lounds, during which he gives a false and derogatory profile of the Tooth Fairy to incite him. After a sting operation fails to catch the killer, Lounds is kidnapped by the Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan). Waking in the killer's home, he is shown a slideshow of William Blake's The Great Red Dragon paintings, along with the Tooth Fairy's past victims and slides of a family the killer identifies as his next targets. Lounds is forced to tape-record a statement before being set on fire in a wheelchair and killed, his flaming body rolled into the parking garage of the National Tattler as a warning.|$|E
5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian {{psychiatry}} {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E

2500|$|... "Stairway to Heaven" [...] {{is often}} rated among the {{greatest}} rock songs of all time. According to music journalist Stephen Davis, although {{the song was}} released in 1971, it took until 1973 before the song's popularity ascended to truly [...] "anthemic" [...] status. As Page himself recalled, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> good, but I didn't <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be almost like an anthem ... But I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the gem of the album, sure." ...|$|R

25|$|Like all macaws {{and most}} parrots seeds and fruit {{are the major}} part of the diet of the genus Ara. The {{particular}} species and range of diet varies from species to species. Unlike many birds macaws are seed predators not seed dispersers, and use their immensely strong beaks to open even the hardest shells. Their diet overlaps with that of some monkey species; in one study of green-winged macaws in Venezuela they shared many of the same trees as bearded sakis, although in some cases they ate the seeds at an earlier stage of ripeness than the sakis, when they contained more poison. Macaws, like other parrots, may consume clay to absorb toxic compounds produced by some poison...but with further research we now at last <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just to eat life saving sodium that is missing. As well, the toxic compounds of some foods may be neutralized by compounds, such as tannins, found in other foods consumed at the same time...but we have found that it is untrue and really just to gain access to sodium missing otherwise in their diet because of the area they live in.|$|E
500|$|Road {{signs in}} the Pomeroy area were painted in Tyrone colours {{leading up to the}} match. This was {{condemned}} by the Roads Service, who said the signs would cost thousands of pounds to replace. In Strabane, a sculpture was covered in Tyrone kit. Ulster Unionist Party councillor for the town, Derek Hussey, responded by saying: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a unique sporting occasion, an all-British All-Ireland final, but the hysteria that has developed around the whole event is intimidatory to some people." ...|$|E
500|$|Wogan {{introduced}} the 1991 segment with [...] "The {{world as we}} <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> about to end". Amid laughter from the audience, Icke prevaricated {{when asked if he}} was the son of God, replying that Jesus would have been laughed at too, and repeating that Britain would soon be devastated by tidal waves and earthquakes. Without these, [...] "the Earth will cease to exist". When Icke said laughter was the best way to remove negativity, Wogan replied of the audience: [...] "But they're laughing at you. They're not laughing with you." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{conductor}} John Eliot Gardiner describes Grainger as [...] "a true original {{in terms}} of orchestration and imaginative instrumentation", whose terseness of expression is reminiscent in style both of the 20th-century Second Viennese School and the [...] Italian madrigalists of the 16th and 17th centuries. [...] Malcolm Gillies, a Grainger scholar, writes of [...] Grainger's [...] style [...] that [...] "you <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> 'Grainger' when you have heard about one second of a piece". The music's most individual characteristic, Gillies argues, is its texture – [...] "the weft of the fabric", according to Grainger. Different textures are defined by Grainger as [...] "smooth", [...] "grained" [...] and [...] "prickly".|$|E
500|$|The {{concert was}} {{recorded}} on August 26, 2001, and broadcast live on HBO from The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan, watched by {{a crowd of}} 17,000.

She commented, [...] "It's a thrill for us to have Madonna back, because we <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> going to be a spectacular show, with that combination of her amazing talent and extravagant style which only Madonna can bring." [...] The broadcast was produced by Marty Callner and directed by Hamish Hamilton. The broadcast was Madonna's first since 1993, when [...] from Sydney, Australia became HBO's most-watched original program of the year.|$|E

500|$|William {{sought to}} be made a duke like his elder brothers, and to receive a similar {{parliamentary}} grant, but his father was reluctant. To put pressure on him, William threatened to stand for the House of Commons for the constituency of Totnes in Devon. Appalled {{at the prospect of}} his son making his case to the voters, George III created him Duke of Clarence and St Andrews and Earl of Munster on 16 May 1789, supposedly saying: [...] "I well <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> another vote added to the Opposition." [...] William's political record was inconsistent and, like many politicians of the time, cannot be certainly ascribed to a single party. He allied himself publicly with the Whigs as well as his elder brothers George, Prince of Wales, and Frederick, Duke of York, who were known to be in conflict with the political positions of their father.|$|E
500|$|The Bostonians made a final {{effort to}} slow the proceedings. William Coddington rose, asserting, [...] "I do not see any clear witness against her, and you <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a rule of the court that no man may be a judge and an accuser too," [...] ending with, [...] "Here is no law of God that she hath broken nor any law {{of the country that}} she hath broke, and {{therefore}} deserve no censure." [...] The court wanted a sentence but could not proceed until some of the ministers spoke. [...] Three of the ministers were sworn in, and each testified against Hutchinson. [...] Winthrop moved to have her banished; in the ensuing tally, only the Boston deputies voted against conviction. [...] Hutchinson challenged the sentence's legitimacy, saying, [...] "I desire to know wherefore I am banished." [...] Winthrop responded, [...] "The court knows wherefore and is satisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|While on the {{run from}} the law, Kate goes to Miami, where under the name [...] "Monica" [...] she meets and gets engaged to a police officer, Kevin Callis (Nathan Fillion). Before their wedding, Kevin's mother, Suzanne, gives Kate a gold locket that had been passed down on the female side of the family at weddings. A while after the ceremony, Kate calls U.S. Marshal Edward Mars (Fredric Lane). She does not want to run any more and pleads for him to stop chasing her. Mars guesses that Kate has gotten {{involved}} with a man, and tells her that if Kate can really stay put, settle down, he will stop chasing her, but that they both <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unlikely that Kate will ever stop running. Later, Kate shows signs of relief after getting a negative pregnancy test, and decides to reveal the truth about her life to her husband. She drugs Kevin, places her mother-in-law's locket in his hands and leaves.|$|E

500|$|In June 2001 Neil Smith of BBC Films {{called it}} [...] "a film that only gets better with age". In 2004, Total Film {{magazine}} named it the ninth-greatest British film of all time, {{making it the}} only James Bond film {{to appear on the}} list. In 2006, Jay Antani of Filmcritic praised the film's [...] "impressive staging of action scenes", while IGN listed it as second-best Bond film ever, behind only Goldfinger. That same year, Entertainment Weekly put the film at ninth among Bond films, criticising the slow pace. When the [...] "James Bond Ultimate Collector's Set" [...] was released in November 2007 by MGM, Norman Wilner of MSN chose From Russia with Love as the best Bond film. Conversely, in his book about the Bond phenomenon, The Man With the Golden Touch, British author Sinclair McKay states [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> heresy to say so, and that some enthusiasts regard From Russia With Love as the Holy Grail of Bond, but let's be searingly honest – some of it is crashingly dull." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar to {{the work}} in Shaun of the Dead, blood and gore was {{prevalent}} throughout the film. Visual effects supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: [...] "In many ways, the more extreme you make it, the more people <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> stylised and enjoy the humour inherent in how ridiculous it is. It's rather like the (eventually) limbless Black Knight in Monty Python's Holy Grail." [...] The most time-consuming gore sequence involved a character's head being crushed by a section of a church. A dummy was used against a green screen and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Throughout the film, over seventy gunfight shots were digitally augmented; Briscoe's rationale for adding the additional effects was that [...] "The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like our hero characters really do have it all going off, all around them. It was a great demonstration of [...] seemingly very trivial enhancements {{can make a difference}} when combined across a sequence." ...|$|E
500|$|Scalia was {{a devout}} Roman Catholic, {{and his son}} Paul entered the priesthood. Uncomfortable with the changes brought about {{following}} VaticanII, Scalia drove long distances to parishes he felt were more in accord with his beliefs, such as the Tridentine Latin Mass in both Chicago and Washington and also the Latin version of the Mass of Paul VI at St. Catherine of Siena in Great Falls, Virginia. In a 2013 interview with Jennifer Senior for New York magazine, Scalia was asked whether his beliefs extended to the Devil, and he stated, [...] "Of course! Yeah, he's a real person. Hey, c'mon, that's standard Catholic doctrine! Every Catholic believes that". When asked whether he had seen recent evidence of the Devil, Scalia replied: [...] "You <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> curious. In the Gospels, the Devil is doing all sorts of things. He's making pigs run off cliffs, he's possessing people and whatnot... What he's doing now is getting people not to believe in him or in God. He's much more successful that way". In another 2013 interview, Scalia said, [...] "In order for capitalism to work, in order for it to produce a good and stable society, traditional Christian virtues are essential".|$|E
