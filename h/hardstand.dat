25|$|The Austbuilt Maritime Museum, {{operated}} by the Port Adelaide Historical Society, is located on Fletcher Road, Peterhead. It houses an extensive collection of maritime memorabilia accumulated by the late Keith Le Leu, who famously bought the steam tug Fearless for $1 in Brisbane in 1972 and steamed it to Adelaide. This vessel, currently owned by the South Australian Maritime Museum, remains on <b>hardstand</b> at Cruickshanks Corner near the Birkenhead Bridge, while its fate is still to be determined.|$|E
25|$|Terminal B serves most United Express {{domestic}} operations and international departures. , United Express {{is the only}} tenant of Terminal B. It {{was one of the}} original two terminals of the airport to open in 1969 and was designed by Goleman & Rolfe and George Pierce-Abel B. Pierce. It is mostly an unaltered terminal from its original design. For this reason, the jet bridges are considerably lower to the ground than most others. The terminal contains 37 gates and 20 <b>hardstand</b> gates.|$|E

50|$|The {{airfield}} had a single, 6,000' x 100' asphalt runway, oriented 10/28 {{with two}} perimeter tracks, each containing about 50 aircraft parking <b>hardstands.</b> There {{may have been}} some temporary hangars and buildings, however it appears that personnel were quartered primarily in tents, and most aircraft maintenance took place in the open on <b>hardstands.</b> It also had a steel control tower.|$|R
50|$|The {{north side}} of the {{airfield}} remains relatively intact {{with the exception of the}} dispersal loop <b>hardstands,</b> which have been removed. The control tower remains, which is used by the Essex Police Helicopter Unit with their Eurocopter EC-135T a T2 hangar and short concreted lengths of runway ends. The remaining parts of the former runways, perimeter track and <b>hardstands</b> are now grassy areas.|$|R
2500|$|Operation Ranch Hand was {{the name}} of the aerial {{application}} of defoliants in Southeast Asia, aimed at stripping away the dense jungle that hid enemy activities. The center for US testing of the herbicides used in Ranch Hand was Eglin AFB, primarily on Range C-52A. For ten years, 1961 to 1971, 222,530 liters of herbicides (Agents Purple, Orange, White and Blue) were sprayed at a test grid on the base reservation. These herbicides were estimated to contain at least 3.1kg of dioxin. Soil sampling at the test site conducted in 1970–1987 confirmed that there was TCDD contamination, though only about 1 percent remained. [...] "Researchers theorized that much of the dioxin was broken down in the hot Florida sun or relocated due to wind or water erosion. At the storage and loading site west of the airstrip, residual dioxin was also found. [...] Mitigation efforts were conducted, including the construction of a concrete drainage ditch and the building of a sediment pond to keep the dioxin from migrating into the nearby ravine and water bodies that lead to the city of Fort Walton Beach water supply. In 2001, the area around <b>Hardstand</b> 7 was capped with concrete and remediation activities concluded." ...|$|E
50|$|Patterson Lakes Marina has <b>hardstand</b> areas which {{accommodate}} boats up to 60 feet in length. The <b>hardstand</b> is {{serviced by}} a travel lift, with a lifting capacity of 25 tons. The travel lift pulls a vessel {{out of the}} water and moves it to a <b>hardstand</b> berth or to one of the factories, for boat maintenance and anti-fouling. The <b>hardstand</b> is situated near the new purpose built factories, which cover all facets of the marine service industry: mechanical services, complete boat maintenance, and other services.|$|E

50|$|Today {{very little}} {{remains of the}} former wartime airfield. Only a few small concreted areas used by {{agricultural}} buildings remain. None of the runways, or <b>hardstands</b> or perimeter track remain at full width, being converted to single lane agricultural roads. The ghostly remains of some loop <b>hardstands</b> and {{the ends of the}} main runways are visible as disturbed earth in aerial photography.|$|R

50|$|Aligned {{approximately}} east-west off {{the northern}} end of the wartime north-south runway (in the adjacent suburb of Toll), the Bore Sight Range includes an aircraft <b>hardstand</b> {{in the form of a}} raised concrete platform approximately 15 metres square. A steel tie down shackle is set into the concrete surface. An adjustable metal plate, which can be raised or lowered, is set at the front of the raised <b>hardstand</b> to carry the nose wheel of aircraft fitted with tricycle undercarriages. A cleared range extends east about 360 metres from the <b>hardstand</b> to the original earth butt, in front of which a recent display target is set.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1970s, {{the north}} and west areas were {{excavated}} for iron ore and today little of the airfield remains. The majority of the main runway was removed along with the perimeter track and dispersal <b>hardstands,</b> although {{a small portion of the}} northeast (08) end of the main runway remains along with part of the perimeter road and a few loop <b>hardstands.</b> The 02/20 secondary runway is faintly visible in aerial photography ...|$|R

5000|$|Kiriwina Airfield was a coral {{surfaced}} 6000 ft long x 150 ft wide single runway, {{built by}} US Army Engineers with assistance from combat troops shortly after occupying the island on 30 June 1943 during World War II. A C-47 {{was the first}} aircraft to land at the airfield on 2 August 1943. US Navy Seabees expanded the airfield constructing a 7000 ft taxiway, 25 fighter <b>hardstands,</b> a 5300 ft taxiway and 16 bomber <b>hardstands.</b> [...] Also known as South Drome, upon completion of North Drome on {{the northern part of}} Kiriwina.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} ALGs were {{expanded}} into tactical air depots {{by the addition}} of hangars, shops, more dispersal <b>hardstands,</b> roads, and other facilities. Some were developed from the beginning.|$|R
50|$|Typically the margueriete {{consisted}} of fifteen to eighteen hardstands {{around a large}} central hangar.
