25|$|In the SimCity games, {{the player}} {{is given the}} task of {{founding}} and developing a city from a patch of green land, defining what buildings are constructed via development zones; residential zones for Sims to live in; commercial zones for Sims to shop and have offices within; industrial zones to provide work through factories, laboratories and farms - as well as ensuring their citizens are kept happy through establishing various services and amenities, all while keeping a stable budget. Since SimCity 2000, players are able to define zones by densities - low density for small buildings, medium density for low to mid-sized buildings, and high density for anything up to large tower blocks. SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, and SimCity 4 allow the player to alter the terrain of the city before building upon it. SimCitys game mechanics are based on 20th century California development, with each edition featuring similar gameplay elements. Players start from an undeveloped greenfield, cars are the <b>default</b> <b>form</b> of transportation, and earthquakes happen - but with some differences in what buildings, disasters and elements of city management are available.|$|E
500|$|In general, Naija cannot {{interact}} {{directly with}} {{objects in the}} world. Instead, the majority of actions are accomplished through singing short tunes. The player does this by selecting a series of notes displayed in a circle of eight choices in the correct order. Each note corresponds with a different color. Singing notes affects plants and objects of {{the same color as}} the note, while singing the tunes, once learned through the plot, can lift objects, create a shield around Naija, or change Naija into different [...] "forms" [...] which have different appearances and unique abilities critical to overcoming the various challenges and obstacles found in the game. The specific tones that are played when the player selects a note can subtly change in different regions, matching the background music. The <b>default</b> <b>form,</b> or [...] "normal form", is the only one in which Naija can sing, and is the only one where her appearance is modifiable by the player by having Naija wear costumes found throughout the game.|$|E

50|$|During the Soviet era, {{the word}} товарищ (comrade) {{served as a}} {{universal}} form of address. Later it fell out of use due to its sexlessness and political connotations, while pre-soviet styles seemed either archaic or too pompous (with {{the possible exception of}} Ukrainian language, where the old honorific пан (pan) seems to be successfully readopted). Eventually, such words as девушка (lady), молодой человек (young man), and even мужчина (man) and женщина (woman) have been adopted as <b>default</b> <b>forms</b> of addressing strangers, which may seem awkward or even rude to a foreigner.|$|R

2500|$|Esperanto is {{frequently}} {{accused of being}} inherently sexist, because the <b>default</b> <b>form</b> of some nouns is masculine while a derived form {{is used for the}} feminine, which is said to retain traces of the male-dominated society of late 19th-century Europe of which Esperanto is a product. Some masculine nouns, primarily titles and kin terms, such as sinjoro [...] "Mr, sir" [...] vs. sinjorino [...] "Mrs, lady" [...] and patro [...] "father" [...] vs. patrino [...] "mother". In addition, nouns that denote persons and whose definitions are not explicitly male are often assumed to be male unless explicitly made female, such as doktoro, a PhD doctor (male or unspecified) versus doktorino, a female PhD. This is analogous to the situation with the English suffix -ess, as in baron/baroness, waiter/waitress etc. Esperanto pronouns are similar. As in English, li [...] "he" [...] may be used generically, whereas ŝi [...] "she" [...] is always female.|$|E

MIG assumes {{that the goal of}} the morphological component of the language system is to output a phonological form appropriate to the grammatical context in which the word appears.

Although identity issues are prom-inent during this period, the role of personal agency and individualization in the iden-tity formation process during these years is not well understood. This study examines three psychological aspects of identity formation (style, status, and process) in rela-tion to personal agency associated with the individualization process. Structural equation modeling analyses suggest that higher levels of agency are positively related to exploration and flexible commitment, unrelated to conformity, and negatively re-lated to avoidance. Cluster {{analysis was used to}} examine and support a theorized po-larity between developmental and <b>default</b> <b>forms</b> of individualization. Replicated across three U.

40|$|Previous {{research}} with children learning {{a second language}} (L 2) has reported errors with verb inflection and cross-linguistic variation in accuracy and error patterns. However, owing to the cross-linguistic complexity and diversity of different verbal paradigms, the cross-linguistic effects {{on the nature of}} <b>default</b> <b>forms</b> has not been directly addressed in L 2 acquisition studies. In the present study, we compared accuracy and error patterns in verbal agreement inflections in L 2 children acquiring Dutch and Greek, keeping the children’s L 1 constant (Turkish). Results showed that inflectional defaults in Greek follow universal predictions regarding the morphological underspecification of paradigms. However, the same universal predictions do not apply to the same extent to Dutch. It is argued that phonological properties of inflected forms should be taken into account to explain cross-linguistic differences in the acquisition of inflection. By systematically comparing patterns in child L 2 Dutch and Greek, this study shows how universal mechanisms and target language properties work in tandem in the acquisition of inflectional paradigms...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we try to}} combine {{experiences}} gained in the machine Translation project FAST with research concerning the default extension of the terminological representation system BACK. We analyze various types of ambiguities that are problematic for translation and show that disambiguation is possible {{on the basis of}} default assumptions. Some of these <b>defaults</b> <b>form</b> preference rule systems, while others are merely an elegant way of modeling exceptions. We show how the ideas underlying the FAST implementation can be reformulated in a declarative framework by using terminological logics. We present an approach towards disambiguation which we call interpretation as exception minimization. The basic idea is to compare the possible interpretations with respect to the defaults (preference rules) they violate. Given a relevance ordering between multisets of defaults, we chose the interpretation yielding the minimal number of exceptions with respect to this ordering as the preferred oneSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RO 11 (106) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany); Commission of the European Communities (CEC), Brussels (Belgium) DEGerman...|$|R
