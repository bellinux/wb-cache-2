The shoe manufacturer Norvic incorporated a pair of their women's <b>high-leg</b> boots in the foundations of their new factory built in 1964, and an even more recent account comes from Knebworth House, where in 1991 an estate worker's shoe replaced an [...] "old court shoe" [...] that had been discovered behind some panelling. Nevertheless, only 50 post-1900 instances of concealed shoes have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|Commonly {{there is}} a <b>high-leg</b> to neutral load limit when only two {{transformers}} are used. One transformer manufacturer's page suggests that <b>High-leg</b> to neutral loading to not exceed 5% of transformer capacity.|$|E

5000|$|<b>High-leg</b> delta (also {{known as}} wild-leg, stinger leg, bastard leg, <b>high-leg,</b> orange-leg, or red-leg delta) {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} service connection for three-phase electric power installations. It is used when both single and three-phase power is desired to be supplied from a three phase transformer (or transformer bank). The three-phase power is connected in the delta configuration, and the center point of one phase is grounded. This creates both a split-phase single phase supply (L1 or L2 to neutral on diagram at right) and three-phase (L1-L2-L3 at right). It is called [...] "orange leg" [...] because when it is connected per the NEC, the high leg is marked with orange [...] "outer finish...or other effective means" [...] (usually tape). By convention, the high leg is usually set in the center (B phase) lug in the involved panel, regardless of the L1-L2-L3 designation at the transformer.|$|E
50|$|Russian boot is {{the name}} applied to a style of calf- or knee-length fashion boot for women that was popular {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Russian boots fell out of favor in the 1930s, but were the {{inspiration}} for the <b>high-leg</b> fashion boots that returned to popularity in the 1950s and 60s. Today the term Russian boot is sometimes applied to the style of low heeled boots worn by some folk dancers.|$|E
5000|$|In North America, a <b>high-leg</b> delta {{supply is}} {{sometimes}} used where one winding of a delta-connected transformer feeding the load is center-tapped and that center tap is grounded and connected as a neutral {{as shown in}} the second diagram. This setup produces three different voltages. If the voltage between the center tap (neutral) and each of the two adjacent phases is 120 V (100%), the voltage across any two phases is 240 V (200%), and the neutral to [...] "high leg" [...] voltage is ≈ 208 V (173%).|$|E

5000|$|Leg as in “hot leg” {{refers to}} one of {{multiple}} hot conductors in an electrical system. The most common residential and small commercial service in Canada and the U.S., single split-phase, 240 V, features a neutral and two hot legs, 240 V to each other, and 120 V each to the neutral. The most common three-phase system will have three “hot” legs, 208 V {{to each other and}} 120 V each to the neutral. An older, but still widely used <b>high-leg</b> delta system uses three phases with 240 volts phase-to-phase for motor loads, and 120 volts for lighting loads by use of a center-tapped transformer; two of the phases are 120 volts to neutral. The third phase, the “high leg” of the system (also referred to as the [...] "wild leg"), has 208 V to neutral and is not usually used for single-phase connections, so is distinctively colored. For larger commercial installations, 277/480 V or 347/600 V three phase is common.|$|E
50|$|<b>High-leg</b> delta {{service is}} {{supplied}} {{in one of}} two ways. One is by a transformer having four wires coming out of the secondary, the three phases, plus a neutral connected as a center-tap on one of the windings. Another method requires two transformers. One transformer is connected to one phase of the overhead primary distribution circuit to provide the 'lighting' side of the circuit (this will be the larger of the two transformers), and a second transformer is connected to another phase on the circuit and its secondary is connected {{to one side of the}} 'lighting' transformer secondary, and the other side of this transformer is brought out as the 'high leg'. The voltages between the three phases are the same in magnitude, however the voltage magnitudes between a particular phase and the neutral vary. The phase-to-neutral voltage of two of the phases will be half of the phase-to-phase voltage. The remaining phase-to-neutral voltage will be √3/2 the phase-to-phase voltage. So if A-B, B-C and C-A are all 240 volts, then A-N and C-N will both be 120 volts, but B-N will be 208 volts.|$|E
40|$|A key {{concern about}} counterfeits and weak {{intellectual}} property protection {{is that they}} may hamper innovation by displacing legitimate sales. This paper combines a natural policy experiment with randomized lab experiments to estimate the heterogeneous impacts of counterfeiting on the sales and consumer purchase intent related to branded products of various quality levels. I collect new product-line-level panel data (1993 - 2004) on Chinese shoe companies. I identify heterogeneous effects of counterfeit entry on sales of authentic products of three quality tiers, finding that counterfeits have both advertising effects for a brand and substitution effects for authentic products, additionally the effects linger for some years. The advertising effect dominates the substitution effect for high-end authentic-product sales, and the substitution effect outweighs the advertising effect for low-end product sales. The positive effect of counterfeits is most pronounced for high-fashion products (such as women’s <b>high-leg</b> boots and dress shoes), for shoes tailored to young customers, and for high-end products of brands not yet well-known {{at the time of}} counterfeiter entry. ...|$|E
