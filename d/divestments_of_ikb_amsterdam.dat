40|$|Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) is {{critical}} {{for the expression of}} multiple genes involved in inflammatory responses and cellular survival. NF-kB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm through interaction with an inhibitor <b>of</b> NF-kB (<b>IkB),</b> but inflammatory stimulation induces proteasomal degradation <b>of</b> <b>IkB,</b> followed by NF-kB nuclear translocation. The degradation <b>of</b> <b>IkB</b> is mediated by a SCF (Skp 1 -Cullin 1 -F-box protein) -type ubiquitin ligase complex that is post-translationaly modified by a ubiquitin-like molecule Nedd 8. In this study, we report that BRCA 1 -associated protein 2 (Brap 2) is a novel Nedd 8 -binding protein that interacts with SCF complex, and is involved in NF-kB translocation following TNF-a stimulation. We also found a putative neddylation site in Brap 2 associated with NF-kB activity. Our findings suggest that Brap 2 is a novel modulator that associates with SCF complex and controls TNF-a-induced NF-kB nuclear translocation...|$|R

40|$|A primary {{level of}} control for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) is {{effected}} through its interactions with the inhibitor protein, inhibitor <b>of</b> kappa B (<b>IkB).</b> Several lines <b>of</b> evidence confirm the existence of multiple forms <b>of</b> <b>IkB</b> that appear to regulate NF-kB by distinct mechanisms. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis to understand the evolutionary history and intrinsic functional diversity <b>of</b> <b>IkB</b> family members. Phylogenetic relationships were constructed to trace the evolution <b>of</b> the <b>IkB</b> family genes. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed 10 IkB subfamily members that clustered into 5 major clades. Since the ankyrin (ANK) domain {{appears to be more}} ancient than the Rel homology domain (RHD), our phylogenetic analysis suggests that some undefined ancestral set of ANK repeats acquired an RHD before any duplication and was later duplicated and then diverged into the different IkB subfamilies. Functional analysis identified several functionally divergent sites in the ANK repeat domains (ARDs) and revealed that this region has undergone strong purifying selection, suggesting its functional importance in IkB genes. Structural analysis showed that the major variations in the number of ANK repeats and high conformational changes in the finger loop ARD region contribute to the differing binding partner specificities, thereby leading to distinct IkB functions. In summary, our study has provided useful information about the phylogeny and structural and functional divergence <b>of</b> the <b>IkB</b> family. Additionally, we identified a number of amin...|$|R

40|$|We study {{alternative}} {{market power}} mitigation measures {{in a model}} where a dominant producer faces a competitive fringe with the same cost structure. We characterise the asset divestment by the dominant firm which achieves the greatest reduction in prices. This divestment entails the sale of marginal assets whose cost range encompasses the post-divestment price. A <b>divestment</b> <b>of</b> this type can be several times more effective in reducing prices than <b>divestments</b> <b>of</b> baseload (or low-cost) assets. We also establish that financial contracts (modeled as Virtual Power Plant schemes) are at best equivalent to baseload <b>divestments</b> in terms <b>of</b> consumer welfare.
