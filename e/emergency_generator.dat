5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage meant it was not {{possible}} to determine the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an <b>emergency</b> <b>generator</b> and the depot's fire pump system. The investigators did not believe that it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} {{problems before}} they even reached the fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor the building had lost power after {{the heat from the}} blaze damaged electrical cables. The <b>emergency</b> <b>generator</b> never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in the basement and firefighters directing water streams from that building had to do so without the aid of elevators.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{the fire}} {{department}} moved to Fire Station #6 with the bulb; the bulb socket's cord was severed for fear that unscrewing the bulb could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand to install the bulb into the new fire station's <b>emergency</b> <b>generator.</b> Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. Since that move, the bulb has run continuously for 38 years; previously it had only been off the grid for {{short periods of time}} (e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage).|$|E

25|$|The {{center has}} three main duties. Firstly, it {{provides}} information services to vessels, {{such as the}} traffic situation, meteorological information and regulations. Secondly, it provides navigational assistant services to ships either on request or when deemed necessary by the staff.

Thirdly, the VTS provides traffic organization to ensure a safe and orderly operation of the traffic. The center can draw on data from the Automatic Identification System, six local radars, meteorology, SafeSeaNet and video cameras. Server systems are redundant and include a backup at Horten VTS. The facility has an <b>emergency</b> <b>generator</b> which can produce power {{for at least four}} days.|$|E
25|$|As Abosso {{settled in}} the water, she {{temporarily}} righted herself, her crew got her <b>emergency</b> <b>generator</b> working, and her floodlights were switched on to help the evacuation. Almost immediately after this, U-575 fired a torpedo {{from one of her}} stern torpedo tubes, which hit Abosso at 22:28 (Berlin time) forward of her bridge. At 2305 hrs (Berlin time) Abosso sank bow first. The submarine then surfaced, approached the débris area, and scanned the boats with her searchlights. Kptlt. Heydemann reported about 10 lifeboats and 15 to 20 liferafts afloat and occupied. Heydemann did not try to question survivors to identify the ship, and claimed in his report that this was because the weather was poor.|$|E

25|$|Information {{provided}} to the IAEA indicated that storage pool temperatures at both Units 5 and 6 remained steady around 60–68°C between 19:00 JST 14 March and 21:00 JST 18 March, though rising slowly. On 18 March reactor water levels remained around 2 m above the top of fuel rods. It was confirmed that panels {{had been removed from}} the roofs of Units 5 and 6 to allow any hydrogen gas to escape. At 04:22 on 19 March, the second unit of <b>emergency</b> <b>generator</b> A for Unit 6 was restarted which allowed operation of pump C of the residual heat removal system (RHR) in Unit 5 to cool the spent fuel storage pool and reactor core alternately. Later in the day, Pump B in Unit 6 was also restarted to allow cooling of the spent fuel pool and reactor core there. Crews had installed temporary submersible seawater pumps and hoses to supply cooling water to the residual heat removal system heat exchangers as the main seawater pumps were heavily damaged by the tsunami. Additionally, as there was heavy damage to electrical equipment in the basements from flooding, temporary power connections had to be made to the residual heat removal system main loop pumps. Temperature at Unit 5 pool decreased to 48°C on 19 March 18:00 JST, and 37°C on 20 March when Unit 6 pool temperature had fallen to 41°C. On 20 March, NISA announced that both reactors had been returned to a condition of cold shutdown.|$|E
500|$|The {{strong winds}} from [...] Percy knocked out power and {{communications}} infrastructure in Swains Island. Efforts to re-establish {{contact with the}} island were unsuccessful for a week. After the storm, however, all eight people who rode out the storm survived, though nine of the eleven buildings on the islands were destroyed or severely damaged. Damage in American Samoa was minimal. In Tokelau, Percy damaged trees and knocked down powerlines. During {{the height of the}} storm, one person was injured by flying debris, and two others were swept out to sea, but all three survived. In Nokonunu, the cyclone destroyed the only school and damaged 80% of the structures. [...] The local hospital completely lost power during the storm and its <b>emergency</b> <b>generator</b> was overwhelmed by the flooding.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} torpedo plane attacks, American carrier dive bombers arrived over the Japanese {{carriers}} almost undetected and began their dives. At 10:22, 25 SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from Enterprise, led by C. Wade McClusky, hit Kaga with one [...] bomb {{and at least}} three [...] bombs. The first landed near her rear elevator and set the berthing compartments on fire, and the next bomb hit the forward elevator and penetrated the upper hangar, setting off explosions and fires among the armed and fueled planes on her hangar deck. Captain Okada {{and most of the}} ship's senior officers were killed by the third bomb, which hit the bridge. The 1000-pound bomb hit amidships and penetrated the flight deck to explode on the upper hangar. The explosions ruptured the ship's avgas lines, damaged both her port and starboard fire mains and the <b>emergency</b> <b>generator</b> powering her fire pumps, as well as knocking out the carbon dioxide fire suppression system. Fueled by the avgas pouring onto the hangar deck, the fires detonated the [...] of bombs and torpedoes strewn across the hangar deck in a series of catastrophic multiple fuel-air explosions that blew out the hangar sides. At nearly the same time, dive bombers hit and fatally damaged Akagi and Sōryū.|$|E

500|$|Mount Washington {{continued}} FM broadcasting in 1958 {{with the}} construction of WMTW-FM 94.9, which became WHOM in 1976. WHOM and WMTW-TV shared a transmitter building, which also housed the generators to supply power to the mountain. A second radio station moved to the summit in 1987. WPKQ-FM (then known as WMOU) installed its transmitters in the Yankee building and constructed a new broadcast tower behind the building which is the tallest structure on the summit. On February9, 2003, a fire broke out in the generator room of the WMTW/WHOM transmitter building, which had become the property of the state only a year earlier when WMTW left the summit. Though WMTW had left, the building at the time still had WHOM's transmitters inside it. The fire destroyed the building, including WHOM's transmitters, as well as the summit's main generators, and also spread to the adjacent Old Yankee Power House building which housed the <b>emergency</b> <b>generator,</b> destroying that building also and disrupting all power to the summit. Temporary generators had to be transported up the mountain to restore power to the observatory and to the Yankee building, which houses important public safety communications equipment. A makeshift generator room was constructed underneath the canopy of the Sherman Adams building across from the public entrance to replace the destroyed buildings. The makeshift generator room was later made permanent when power cables were installed in 2009, delivering grid power to the summit for the first time. The old sign from the destroyed Old Yankee Power House building was placed above the doorway to the new generator room. WHOM subsequently built a new transmitter building {{on the site of the}} old power building, and also constructed a new standby antenna on the Armstrong tower. (For the first time since 1948, the Armstrong tower was used for broadcasts.) ...|$|E
