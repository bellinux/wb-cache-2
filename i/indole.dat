5|$|The Fischer <b>indole</b> {{synthesis}} is {{a chemical}} reaction {{that produces the}} aromatic heterocycle <b>indole</b> from a (substituted) phenylhydrazine and an aldehyde or ketone under acidic conditions. The reaction was discovered in 1883 by Hermann Emil Fischer.|$|E

5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit {{bodies have}} been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several <b>indole</b> compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of <b>indole</b> compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts {{have been shown}} to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E

5|$|Psilocybin is a {{tryptamine}} compound with {{a chemical}} structure containing an <b>indole</b> ring {{linked to an}} ethylamine substituent. It is chemically related to the amino acid tryptophan, and is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin. Psilocybin {{is a member of}} the general class of tryptophan-based compounds that originally functioned as antioxidants in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in multicellular organisms, including humans. Other related indole-containing psychedelic compounds include dimethyltryptamine, found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals, and bufotenine, found in the skin of psychoactive toads.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} giraffe {{is mostly}} gray. Its {{thickness}} allows the animal to run through thorn bush without being punctured. The fur {{may serve as a}} chemical defence, as its parasite repellents give the animal a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although <b>indole</b> and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because the males have a stronger odour than the females, the odour may also have sexual function. Along the animal's neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The one-metre (3.3-ft) tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the oldest}} and most {{reliable}} methods for synthesizing substituted indoles is the Fischer <b>indole</b> synthesis, developed in 1883 by Emil Fischer. Although the synthesis of <b>indole</b> itself is problematic using the Fischer <b>indole</b> synthesis, it is often used to generate indoles substituted in the 2- and/or 3-positions. <b>Indole</b> can still be synthesized, however, using the Fischer <b>indole</b> synthesis by reacting phenylhydrazine with pyruvic acid followed by decarboxylation of the formed indole-2-carboxylic acid. This has also been accomplished in a one-pot synthesis using microwave irradiation.|$|E

25|$|Certain <b>indole</b> {{derivatives}} {{were important}} dyestuffs {{until the end}} of the 19th century.

25|$|<b>Indole</b> {{chemistry}} {{began to}} develop with {{the study of the}} dye indigo. Indigo can be converted to isatin and then to oxindole. Then, in 1866, Adolf von Baeyer reduced oxindole to <b>indole</b> using zinc dust. In 1869, he proposed a formula for <b>indole</b> (left).|$|E
25|$|Due to the electron-rich {{nature of}} <b>indole,</b> it is easily oxidized. Simple oxidants such as N-bromosuccinimide will {{selectively}} oxidize <b>indole</b> 1 to oxindole (4 and 5).|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>indoles</b> has been continuously studied since several naturally occurring <b>indoles</b> exert a broad spec-trum of physiological activities. 1 Recent advance toward synthesis of <b>indoles</b> has been accelerated by {{the assistance of}} homogeneous transition metal catalysts. 2 Watanabe et al. re-ported that anilines reacted with ethylene glycols as C 2 -frag-ment {{in the presence of}} a ruthenium catalyst to afford <b>indoles.</b> 3 However, ethylene glycol with primary aromatic amines did not effectively work as cyclization counterpart to give the corresponding <b>indoles,</b> instead, 1, 4 -diphenylpipera-zines being formed. As our series of studies on transition metal catalyzed synthesis of heterocyclic compounds, 4, 5 we also have recently developed and reported a ruthenium-cata-lyzed synthesis of N-alkylindoles using N-alkylanilines and trialkanolamines as C 2 -fragment. 6 However, primary aro...|$|R
40|$|Chiral indolines are {{ubiquitous}} structural motifs in {{naturally occurring}} alkaloids and many biological active molecules. 1 Some catalytic {{methods have been}} developed to obtain such molecules {{on the basis of the}} kinetic resolution. 2 Asymmetric hydrogenation of <b>indoles</b> is the most straight and powerful approach to make chiral indolines in terms of simplicity and atom efficiency. Despite the progress achieved in asymmetric hydrogenation of <b>indoles</b> and other heteroaromatic compounds in the past decade, 3 efficient hydrogena-tion of simple unprotected <b>indoles</b> remains a great challenge in organic synthesis.

25|$|<b>Indole</b> is an {{aromatic}} heterocyclic {{organic compound}} with formula C8H7N. It has a bicyclic structure, consisting of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered nitrogen-containing pyrrole ring. <b>Indole</b> is widely distributed in the natural environment and can be produced {{by a variety of}} bacteria.

25|$|Unlike most amines, <b>indole</b> is not basic: {{just like}} pyrrole, the {{aromatic}} {{character of the}} ring means that the {{lone pair of electrons}} on the nitrogen atom is not available for protonation. Strong acids such as hydrochloric acid can, however, protonate <b>indole.</b> <b>Indole</b> is primarily protonated at the C3, rather than N1, owing to the enamine-like reactivity of the portion of the molecule located outside of the benzene ring. The protonated form has an pKa of −3.6. The sensitivity of many indolic compounds (e.g., tryptamines) under acidic conditions is caused by this protonation.|$|E
