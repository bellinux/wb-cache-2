25|$|There {{really are}} two {{different}} kinds of DDD: Inside and Outside Abraded Die Doubling. This is because Die Deterioration Doubling manifests itself in two different ways. The two classes look different, and are caused by wear in two different places. Inside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by wear around the edges and inside the actual detail affected. It appears as an enlarged, irregular outline of the element overlapping the original design element. Outside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by actual wear {{in the field of}} the die. The field of a die is the highest point, so when a mint technician polishes the die or the metal flow of a coin wears it away, the field is the first thing to be worn down. The <b>difference</b> <b>here</b> is that Outside doubling does not overlap any of the original design, but rather appears like an irregular shelf around the object.|$|E

[...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that, [...] "the Lafayette dollar lacks the quaint, dated appeal of the Isabella quarter or the amusing originality of the Columbian half-dollar. [...] Despite the necessity for low relief the jugate busts are too linear. The reverse suffers from too much lettering of uniform size.

2500|$|Critics of the NIV, New Living Translation, {{and similar}} {{versions}} {{contend that the}} translation used for Acts 22:9 is inaccurate. The verb used here — akouō (ἀκούω) — can be translated both [...] "hear" [...] and [...] "understand" [...] (both the KJV and NIV translate akouō as [...] "understand" [...] in , for example). It often takes a noun in the genitive case for a person is being heard, with a noun in the accusative for the thing being heard. More classically, {{the use of the}} accusative indicates hearing with understanding. There is indeed a case <b>difference</b> <b>here,</b> with [...] using the genitive tēs phōnēs (τῆς φωνῆς), and [...] using the accusative tēn phōnēn (τὴν φωνὴν). However, there has been debate about which rule Luke was following here. On the second interpretation, Paul's companions may indeed have heard the voice (as is unambiguously stated in Acts 9:7), yet not understood it, although New Testament scholar Daniel B. Wallace finds this argument based on case inconclusive.|$|E
2500|$|The classic Anselmian {{formulation}} of the satisfaction view should be distinguished from penal substitution. Both are forms of satisfaction theory in that they speak of how Christ's death was satisfactory, but penal substitution and Anselmian satisfaction offer different understandings of how Christ's death was satisfactory. Anselm speaks of human sin as defrauding God of the honour he is due. Christ's death, the ultimate act of obedience, brings God great honour. As it was {{beyond the call of}} duty for Christ, it is more honour than he was obliged to give. Christ's surplus can therefore repay our deficit. Hence Christ's death is substitutionary; he pays the honour to the Father instead of us paying. Penal substitution differs in that it sees Christ's death not as repaying God for lost honour but rather paying the penalty of death that had always been the moral consequence for sin (e.g., [...] ). The key <b>difference</b> <b>here</b> is that for Anselm, satisfaction is an alternative to punishment, [...] "The honor taken away must be repaid, or punishment must follow." [...] By Christ satisfying our debt of honor to God, we avoid punishment. In Calvinist Penal Substitution, it is the punishment which satisfies the demands of justice.|$|E
