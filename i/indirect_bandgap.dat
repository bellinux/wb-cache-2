A nearby photon with energy equal to the recombination energy can cause recombination by stimulated emission. This generates another photon of the same frequency, polarization, and phase, travelling {{in the same direction}} as the first photon. This means that stimulated emission will cause gain in an optical wave (of the correct wavelength) in the injection region, and the gain increases as the number of electrons and holes injected across the junction increases.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Transition metal dichalcogenides, such as MoS 2 and WSe 2, have {{recently}} gained tremendous interest for electronic and optoelectronic applications. MoS 2 and WSe 2 monolayers are direct bandgap and show bright photoluminescence (PL), whereas multilayers exhibit much weaker PL {{due to their}} <b>indirect</b> optical <b>bandgap.</b> This presents an obstacle {{for a number of}} device applications involving light harvesting or detection where thicker films with direct optical bandgap are desired. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a drastic enhancement in PL intensity for multilayer WSe 2 (2 − 4 layers) under uniaxial tensile strain of up to 2 %. Specifically, the PL intensity of bilayer WSe 2 is amplified by ∼ 35 ×, making it comparable to that of an unstrained WSe 2 monolayer. This drastic PL enhancement is attributed to an <b>indirect</b> to direct <b>bandgap</b> transition for strained bilayer WSe 2, as confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Notably, in contrast to MoS 2 multilayers, the energy difference between the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>bandgaps</b> of WSe 2 multilayers is small, thus allowing for bandgap crossover at experimentally feasible strain values. Our results present an important advance toward controlling the band structure and optoelectronic properties of few-layer WSe 2 via strain engineering, with important implications for practical device applications...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe band diagram, {{deformation}} {{potential and}} photoelastic tensor of silicon are calculated self-consistently under uniaxial and shear strain by solving for the electronic wavefunctions with a finite-difference method. Many-body effects are {{accounted for by}} the local density approximation. In order to accommodate the large number of grid points required due to the diverging electrostatic potential near the atomic nuclei in an all-electron calculation, a non-uniform meshing is adopted. Internal displacements are taken into account by adding an additional coordinate transform to the method of Bir and Pikus. Good consistency of the calculated deformation potential and photoelastic coefficients is obtained with prior experimental and theoretical results, validating the numerical methods. Furthermore, it is shown that a slight correction of the multiplicative coefficient of the Xα approximation for conduction bands results in good agreement with experiment for both the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>bandgaps...</b>|$|R

40|$|Non-local carrier injection/detection schemes lie at {{the very}} {{foundation}} of information manipulation in integrated systems. This paradigm consists in controlling with an external signal the channel where charge carriers flow between a "source" and a well separated "drain". The next generation electronics may operate on the spin of carriers instead of their charge and germanium appears as the best hosting material to develop such a platform for its compatibility with mainstream silicon technology and the long electron spin lifetime at room temperature. Moreover, the energy proximity between the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>bandgaps</b> allows for optical spin injection and detection within the telecommunication window. In this letter, we demonstrate injection of pure spin currents (i. e. with no associated transport of electric charges) in germanium, combined with non-local spin detection blocks at room temperature. Spin injection is performed either electrically through a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) or optically, exploiting the ability of lithographed nanostructures to manipulate the distribution of circularly-polarized light in the semiconductor. Pure spin current detection is achieved using either a MTJ or the inverse spin-Hall effect (ISHE) across a platinum stripe. These results broaden the palette of tools available for the realization of opto-spintronic devices. Comment: 14 pages and 5 figure...|$|R
