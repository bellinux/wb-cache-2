2500|$|In welding, {{equivalent}} {{carbon content}} (C.E) {{is used to}} understand how the different alloying elements affect hardness of the steel being welded. This is then directly related to hydrogen-induced cold cracking, which is the most common weld defect for steel, thus it is most commonly used to determine weldability. Higher concentrations of carbon and other alloying elements such as manganese, chromium, silicon, molybdenum, vanadium, copper, and nickel tend to <b>increase</b> <b>hardness</b> and decrease weldability. Each of these elements tends to influence the hardness and weldability of the steel to different magnitudes, however, making a method of comparison necessary to judge the difference in hardness between two alloys made of different alloying elements. There are two commonly used formulas for calculating the equivalent carbon content. One is from the American Welding Society (AWS) and recommended for structural steels and the other is the formula based on the International Institute of Welding (IIW).|$|E

40|$|In this study, four unique {{groups of}} nano-cemented {{carbides}} with 8 wt. % Co and trace amount of Mo and VC {{have been successfully}} synthesized. The effect of Mo and VC has been investigated comprehensively on both the microstructure and mechanical behavior of nano-cemented carbide. The results show that Mo significantly <b>increases</b> <b>hardness</b> but decreases the fracture toughnesses and VC slightly <b>increases</b> <b>hardness</b> and strongly <b>increases</b> fracture toughness of nano-cemented carbide. It is found that the optimum Mo and VC contents are both 0. 5 wt. %. The average WC grain size is about 370 nm.

50|$|The cutting {{surfaces}} of {{a milling cutter}} are generally made of a hard and temperature-resistant material, so that they wear slowly. A low cost cutter may have surfaces made of high speed steel. More expensive but slower-wearing materials include cemented carbide.

50|$|The {{fineness}} of {{a precious}} metal object (coin, bar, jewelry, etc.) represents {{the weight of}} fine metal therein, {{in proportion to the}} total weight which includes alloying base metals and any impurities. Alloy metals are added to <b>increase</b> <b>hardness</b> and durability of coins and jewelry, alter colors, decrease the cost per weight, or avoid the cost of high-purity refinement. For example, copper is added to the precious metal silver to make a more durable alloy for use in coins, housewares and jewelry. Coin silver, which was used for making silver coins in the past, contains 90% silver and 10% copper, by mass. Sterling silver contains 92.5% silver and 7.5%, by mass, of other metals, usually copper.|$|E
50|$|The {{strength}} and hardness of iron increases with {{the concentration of}} phosphorus. 0.05% phosphorus in wrought iron makes it as hard as medium carbon steel. High phosphorus iron can also be hardened by cold hammering. The hardening effect is true for any concentration of phosphorus. The more phosphorus, the harder the iron becomes and the more it can be hardened by hammering. Modern steel makers can <b>increase</b> <b>hardness</b> {{by as much as}} 30%, without sacrificing shock resistance by maintaining phosphorus levels between 0.07 and 0.12%. It also increases the depth of hardening due to quenching, {{but at the same time}} also decreases the solubility of carbon in iron at high temperatures. This would decrease its usefulness in making blister steel (cementation), where the speed and amount of carbon absorption is the overriding consideration.|$|E

40|$|Deformation {{behavior}} of Cr phase in Cu- 15 Cr based in situ composites during cold deformation has been examined. Deformation strain partitioning between Cu and Cr phases after cold drawing occurs because the Cr phase tends to elongate less than Cu phase {{due to its}} higher flow stress and modulus. The deformation process of Cr phase during cold drawing comprises slight, steady and slow deforming stages, and the Cr phase is primarily deformed in the second stage. At a given drawing strain, the deformation strain of Cr phase <b>increases</b> with <b>increasing</b> <b>hardness</b> ratio of Cu phase to Cr phase, therefore, the finer drawing structure (with smaller interphase spacing and Cr thickness) will be obtained with either <b>increasing</b> <b>hardness</b> of Cu phase or reducing hardness of Cr. Hardening of Cr phase {{by the addition of}} alloying elements affects the strength of Cu- 15 Cr based in situ composites in two opposite ways-increasing the second phase strengthening and reducing the structural refinement strengthening, the latter is more prominent at higher drawing strain. The strength improvement of the as cold drawn Cu- 15 Cr based in situ composites can be achieved by <b>increasing</b> <b>hardness</b> ratio of Cu to Cr through either softening of the Cr phase or hardening of the Cu phase...|$|R

5000|$|Pure {{lead was}} used to cast hollow-base bullets for Civil War era muskets. These bullets were {{designed}} to load easily and then expand into the grooves of the rifling when fired. Pure lead is undesirably soft for casting bullets not requiring such expansion. Tin is a common alloying element. Lead alloyed {{with a small amount}} of tin fills out moulds more uniformly than pure lead. Tin also increases the hardness of cast bullets up to a maximum at about eight to ten percent tin. Tin is relatively expensive, so many modern alloys rely upon antimony to <b>increase</b> <b>hardness</b> while retaining the casting advantages of a minimal addition of tin. Linotype metal is a eutectic alloy of 3% tin, 12% antimony, and 85% lead. It is a very satisfactory alloy for casting most bullets. [...] However, bullets from Linotype alloy tend to be brittle, and not suitable for some game hunting.|$|E
50|$|Nickel {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{alloying}} elements because it refines the pearlite and graphite structure, improves toughness, and evens out hardness differences between section thicknesses. Chromium is added in small amounts to reduce free graphite, produce chill, and because it is a powerful carbide stabilizer; nickel is often added in conjunction. A small amount of tin can be added as a substitute for 0.5% chromium. Copper is added in the ladle or in the furnace, on the order of 0.5-2.5%, to decrease chill, refine graphite, and increase fluidity. Molybdenum is added on the order of 0.3-1% to increase chill and refine the graphite and pearlite structure; it is often added in conjunction with nickel, copper, and chromium to form high strength irons. Titanium is added as a degasser and deoxidizer, but it also increases fluidity. 0.15-0.5% vanadium is added to cast iron to stabilize cementite, <b>increase</b> <b>hardness,</b> and increase resistance to wear and heat. 0.1-0.3% zirconium helps to form graphite, deoxidize, and increase fluidity.|$|E

30|$|<b>Hardness</b> <b>increase</b> {{induced by}} {{annealing}} {{has also been}} also frequently observed in plastically deformed large-grained polycrystalline materials. This phenomenon has been named as a “strain-ageing hardening” effect which means annealing (ageing) the deformed materials leads to hardening. In Fe 97 Si 3 alloy (grain size = 30 μm) that was plastically deformed to ∼ 20 % strain, annealing at 573 K for an hour <b>increases</b> the <b>hardness</b> by ∼ 4.6 % [52]. Origin of this <b>increased</b> <b>hardness,</b> however, is different than that in our nanocrystalline Ni. In plastically deformed large-grained polycrystalline materials, the major resistance for further plastic deformation comes from the long-range stress field of multiplicated dislocations. Annealing can segregate Si to the multiplicated dislocations, increasing the stress {{that is needed to}} move these dislocations.|$|R
50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, brake pins and bleed valves are just a few applications that take full advantage of the deposit’s corrosion resistance. Differential pinion shafts and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). Brake pistons are plated in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to <b>increase</b> <b>hardness</b> and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast iron slip yokes are plated with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|E
