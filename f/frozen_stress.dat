40|$|A {{new method}} for {{analysis}} of full-field isochromatic fringe patterns in birefringent specimens is proposed. It {{is based on the}} point-by point method of spectral contents analysis. The method uses a CCD camera as a 256 x 256 pixel diode array and narrow band filters for the isolation of eight wavelengths on the range of 400 to 750 nm. The system uses a polariscope set for plane and circularly polarized light. This results in full-field images of intensity normalised to zero load conditions for both polariscope setups. The normalised intensity values from the circular polariscope are used to represent the spectrum on light for each pixel and comparison with the theoretical spectrum using a minimisation procedure produces the absolute retardation and consequently the fringe order N. In this manner each of the 65, 536 pixels in the 256 x 256 image is analysed to produce a full field map of calibrated isochromatic. Input of the retardation and the normalised intensity spectra from the plan polariscope yields the isoclinic parameter. The viability of the technique was shown through the analysis of a <b>frozen</b> <b>stressed</b> specimen and results showed good agreement with manual analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The stress {{analysis}} for a model with initial stresses, which we term a residual stress model, is performed by digital photoelasticity. The stresses applied on the residual stress model are obtained by analyzing both the initial stresses {{and the resultant}} stresses. The method used for analyzing the stresses applies the principle of superposition of the stress to photoelasticity, which is a well-known technique {{in the field of}} elasticity. In the digital photoelasticity technique used, the principal stress direction and the relative phase retardation are analyzed by photoelastic techniques using linearly polarized light. This technique overcomes the phase difference error associated with a quarter-wave plate by employing incident light at three different wavelengths, and using an unwrapping technique that allows and to be determined using the arctangent function. A residual stress model produced by a disk containing <b>frozen</b> <b>stresses</b> that was subjected to a diametral compressive load at an angle of 31 was used to experimentally test this method.

40|$|Sintering is {{a typical}} process for metal powders which can be {{effectively}} agglomerated by a solid state diffusion mechanism. Polymer powders are less sensible {{to this kind of}} mechanism because of the lower molecular mobility. Anyway, such applications have been mentioned about sintering of thermoplastic powders in the scientific literature. In this study, sintering has been used {{for the first time to}} agglomerate thermoset powders coming from recycling of fiberglass. This way, two interesting results have been obtained. First of all, new products have been produced by recycling fiberglass without any addition of virgin resin or linking agent. Moreover, it has been shown that sintering can lead to very high thickness products which are very difficult to obtain by typical molding processes because of shrinkage or <b>frozen</b> <b>stresses.</b> In order to show the feasibility of this new process, some powders have been collected from the waste of industrial partners. These powders have been molded without the addition of any other material so as to produce small plates or thick bricks. In such cases, a polyester coating was also added to improve the surface quality of the brick. Several samples have been extracted from these products and tested to evaluate the mechanical performances of the recycled plates. Results are very promising in terms of process easiness and part properties. A density about 1 g/cm 3 has been obtained with a flexural modulus about 1 GPa and a flexural strength up to 20 MPa...|$|R
40|$|The {{variability}} of thermal expansion coefficients during the molding of plastics causes {{the development of}} <b>frozen</b> thermal <b>stresses</b> in the molded parts. Also, the distribution of thermal expansion coefficients of the material in the molded part {{plays an important role}} in controlling shrinkage and warpage. In turn, the distribution of linear thermal expansion coefficients (LTECs) depends on the distributions of crystallinity and orientation in the part. In the case of fibre reinforced polymers, the distributions of fibre concentration and orientation are also important. In this project, a model has been proposed for estimating the LTEC of fibre reinforced plastics as a function of crystallinity, matrix orientation, and fibre concentration and orientation. Also, extensive data have been obtained regarding the LTEC of polypropylene with and without fibre reinforcement. Extruded pellets and injection molded parts were considered.

The details of the relaxation process need not be specified at the outset, although the relaxation process {{is characterized by a}} relaxation time and by an equilibrium and a frozen sound speed in a propagation region which is otherwise in equilibrium. Propagation is described in terms of a D'Alembertian characterized by the frozen sound speed relaxing toward one characterized by the equilibrium sound speed, while the source is interpreted in terms of a <b>frozen</b> Lighthill <b>stress</b> tensor relaxing toward the equilibrium stress tensor.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a recently developed method of measuring <b>frozen</b> elastic <b>stresses</b> in micro components and devices. The approach bases on stress release at the component surface by {{focused ion beam}} (FIB) milling. Stresses are deduced from the experimentally determined deformation field around the FIB milling pattern, applying reasonable stress hypotheses and appropriate modeling of the stress release field. Because of the local nature of ion milling and the limited material volume affected by deformation, the method suites to very local stress measurement. Commonly, spatial resolution is achieved in a range from submicron to some tens of microns. Residual stresses in membrane type MEMS structures have been measured and results are reported. A broader group of potential applications is expected for non-membrane structures in micro-/nanosystems or their packaging. Possible approaches for those cases are discussed, considering comparison of measured deformation fields with either analytical solutions of the mechanical problem or with finite element simulations...|$|R

Thirty-eight <b>frozen</b> <b>stress</b> models were analysed and it was found that a two degree taper for 5. 5 threads from the loaded face of the nut reduced the maximum normalised tensile stress in the bolt by 41 per cent from 5. 17 to 3. 07. It was observed that if the angle of taper was too large the stress concentration produced at the junction of the parallel and tapered threads could negate the beneficial effects of the taper geometry. ...|$|E
40|$|Six {{photoelastic}} <b>frozen</b> <b>stress</b> {{models of}} I S 0 nut-bolt connections loaded in pure tension were studied. Four {{of these models}} had modifications to the threads at the load bearing end of the nut. These modifications included tapered truncation of the thread crests and taper of the whole thread form {{for a portion of}} the nut length. The maximum stress in the bolt always occurred within one pitch of the load bearing face of the nut. Truncating threads increased the maximum bolt stresses. Tapering the whole thread form reduced the maximum stress and produced a more uniform load distribution in the bolt. The conditions at the load bearing face of the nut were found to influence the load distribution in the bolt threads more than the stress concentrations in the bolt. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the influence of freezing versus hypertonic stress on the ATPase activity and polypeptide profile of the plasma membrane of nonacclimated winter rye leaves (Secale cereale L. cv Puma). Exposure of leaves to hypertonic sorbitol solutions resulted in a similar extent of injury as did freezing to subzero temperatures that resulted in equivalent osmotic stresses. When isolated with a two-phase partition system of aqueous polymers, the plasma membrane fractions of control, <b>frozen,</b> or hypertonically <b>stressed</b> leaves were of similar purity as judged by the distribution of marker enzyme activities. When assayed in the presence of Triton X- 100 (0. 05 % w/w), ATPase activity was decreased only slightly in plasma membrane fractions isolated from either <b>frozen</b> or hypertonically <b>stressed</b> leaves. In contrast, the specific ATPase activity of the plasma membrane fractions assayed in the absence of Triton X- 100 increased following freezing or hypertonic stress. As a result, the Triton X- 100 stimulation of the ATPase activity decreased significantly from sixfold in control leaves to threefold in lethally stressed leaves and reflects an increase in the permeability of the plasma membrane vesicles. The increased permeability was also manifested as a decrease in H+-transport following exposure to freezing or hypertonic stress. Both freezing and hypertonic exposure at subzero temperatures altered the polypeptide profile of the plasma membrane, but with the exception of one polypeptide, there was no difference between the two treatments...|$|R

40|$|Free {{standing}} silicon membranes {{form the}} basis for many MEMS applications, e. g. for pressure sensors, CMUT's or microheaters. Crystalline silicon is well suited [1, 2] due to its excellent mechanical and piezoresistive properties particularly for pressure sensor applications. SOI-wafer substrates also are particularly suitable for producing free standing membranes, as cavities in the handle substrate of the SOI wafer can be produced by deep reactive ion etching e. g. with the Bosch process with the additional possibility of a selective stopping on the buried oxide. Of great importance for the practical applicability is the absence of mechanical stresses in the layer stack, because the <b>frozen</b> <b>stress</b> can lead to distortions of the membrane and to significant nonlinearities. The control of such mechanical stresses is therefore of great importance. As part of a pressure sensor development project free standing silicon membranes with different geometry were generated by dry etching (DRIE) on basis of bonded SOI-wafers (BSOI) or with thin film SOI-wafers with an additional epitactically grown silicon layer. The prepared membranes were characterized by means of interference microscopy and the measured deflection has been compared to theoretical calculations...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{approach to}} the problem of rib-reinforced cover plate design is outlined. Exact tractable methods for calculating the deflections of radially ribbed plates are not available. Outlines of formal mathematical treatment which use several approximations are presented to highlight the theoretical difficulties. The technique of Fizeau interferometry was employed to study the deflections of a series of laterally loaded ribbed plates of varying proportions. From the results, values of the rigidity of the plates were found together with the best combination of parameters to ensure optimum stiffening with a minimum of localized curvature for plates of fixed total weight. The nature and character of the localized curvatures developed in an over-stiffened ribbed plate was revealed by photographic records obtained by means of the Salet-Ikeda slope-contouring technique. It was concluded that, for optimum design on a basis of rigidity of plates of given total weight, 40 per cent of the total weight of a ribbed plate should be in the ribs or webs and 60 per cent in the basic plate or flange. Localized curvature with attendant stress concentrations were found not to be serious under such a degree of stiffening. <b>Frozen</b> <b>stress</b> photoelastic studies have been initiated to elucidate stress distributions {{in the vicinity of the}} ribs...|$|E
40|$|We {{reconsider the}} steady planar flow of an Oldroyd-B fluid within a small {{distance}} r of a sharp reentrant corner of angle π/p, 1 / 2 ≤ p < 1. Previous theoretical studies {{of this problem}} {{have been unable to}} resolve a boundary layer near the downstream wall. For a range of angles π/p, including the benchmark problem p = 2 / 3, and for several non-zero solvent viscosities, we have solved the equations for the downstream boundary layer numerically and additionally found asymptotic results for a <b>frozen</b> <b>stress</b> limit and for high solvent viscosities. For each angle and viscosity we find a one-parameter family of attached ‘potential ’ flows, for each of which the stress is proportional to r 2 p− 2 and the velocity proportional to rp(3 −p) − 1 as proposed by Hinch [J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 50 (1993) 161]. The limiting member of the family has zero shear stress on the upstream wall. The stress is that of a purely elastic neo-Hookean solid in the interior of the flow, with boundary layers on both the upstream and downstream walls having the similarity structure proposed by Renardy [J.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was begun on {{the feasibility of}} utilizing castable, thermosetting plastics in experimental stress analysis by means of either photoelasticity or electrical strain gages imbedded in the plastic. The {{first phase of the}} study was the development of a casting technique that would give a stress free casting suitable for photoelastic work. This was considerably complicated by the inherent shrinkage which occurs during the polymerization of the plastic. A good method was found for casting solid models, and a workable method was devised for casting hollow section models. The second phase constituted the development and evaluation of the optimum physical properties of a resin known as Castolite. The results were encouraging with the exception that the strain creep was excessive. The rate of creep, however, is slow and it is possible to use the material for two dimensional photoelasticity with results comparable to those obtained from other photo-elastic materials. The desirable features are a very low optical creep, stress-strain and stress-fringe number curves that are linear for constant loading time, no time-edge stress effects, chemical stability under high temperatures, modulus of elasticity of 600, 000 psi, and a fringe value of 175 psi per in-fringe in tension. An additional feature is the ability to bond two or more cured plastic pieces together with the liquid plastic itself. The strength of the bonded area is equal {{to the rest of the}} structure.
