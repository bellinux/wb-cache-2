50|$|Hour wheel - which {{fits over}} {{the shaft of}} the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion,</b> and whose shaft holds the hour hand. The hour wheel rotates once for every 12 {{rotations}} of the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{mainspring}} that powers the watch, {{a spiral}} ribbon of spring steel, is inside a cylindrical barrel, with the outer {{end of the}} mainspring attached to the barrel. The force of the mainspring turns the barrel. The barrel has gear teeth around the outside that turn the center wheel once per hour â€” this wheel has a shaft that goes through the dial. On the dial side the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> is attached with a friction fit (allowing it to slide when setting the hands) and the minute hand {{is attached to the}} <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion.</b> The <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> drives a small 12-to-1 reduction gearing called the motion work that turns the hour wheel and hand once for every 12 revolutions of the minute hand.|$|R

50|$|Minute wheel - Its pinion {{drives the}} hour wheel. During setting, this {{is driven by}} the {{intermediate}} wheel in the keyless work and it turns both the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> and the hour wheel, moving the hands.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> - a pinion with {{a hollow}} shaft that fits {{friction}} tight over the center wheel shaft, projects through the face, {{and holds the}} minute hand. While the timepiece is not being set, this is turned by the center wheel, and drives the minute wheel. While being set it is turned by the setting mechanism, in modern clocks a setting knob {{on the back of}} the clock. In watches during setting this is turned by the minute wheel, which is turned by the keyless work. In older clocks the setting was done by opening the face and manually pushing the minute hand, which rotated the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> directly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{motion work}} is the small 12-to-1 {{reduction}} gear train that turns the timepiece's hour hand from the minute hand. [...] It {{is attached to the}} going train by the friction coupling of the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion,</b> so the minute and hour hands can be turned independently to set the timepiece. It is often located {{on the outside of the}} movement's front plate, just under the dial. It consists of: ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the trio}} of women came to <b>free</b> <b>cannon,</b> Biranha took up a fight with Sara, unaware she wielded an ancient and {{powerful}} weapon known as the Witchblade. Sara defeated him, leaving him for dead under piles of ice. Meanwhile, Sara fought Biranha's mother, Vana, in the chamber where Taras and Cannon were being worked on. A reflected blast from Vana destroyed the water chamber that Taras was in, also killing taras. In her grief Vana used all her power in one suicidal final move, wiping out the whole base with hundreds of large, sharp icicles. Aspen's group managed to <b>free</b> <b>Cannon</b> and exit the base just in time however.|$|R
50|$|Center {{or second}} wheel - which turns once per hour. Its pinion is turned by the teeth on the {{mainspring}} barrel in watches and spring driven clocks, {{and by the}} weight pulley in weight driven clocks. Its arbor projects {{through a hole in}} the face and drives, via a friction coupling, the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion,</b> which carries the minute hand. It also drives the pinion of the third wheel. In wrist watches with centre seconds, that is with the seconds hand pivoted coaxially with the minute and hour hands, this wheel is positioned off centre to allow the fourth wheel to be placed at the centre of the movement. In this arrangement the wheel is called the second wheel, because it is still the second wheel in the train but no longer at the centre of the movement.|$|R
50|$|Breeze {{detergent}} {{began with}} an advertising campaign in seventeen newspaper, covering six markets. The Federal Advertising Agency was responsible for advertising coordination. In 1956 abox of king size Breeze was offered with a <b>free</b> <b>Cannon</b> Mills Company bath towel and a fifty cent voucher for buying, in Albuquerque, New Mexico.|$|R
50|$|A {{separate}} {{set of gears}} {{called the}} keyless work winds the mainspring when the crown is rotated, and when the crown is pulled out a short distance allow the hands to be turned to set the watch. The stem attached to the crown has a gear called the clutch or castle wheel, with two rings of teeth that project axially from the ends. When the stem is pushed in, the outer teeth turn the ratchet wheel {{on top of the}} mainspring barrel, which turns the shaft that the inner end of the mainspring is attached to, winding the mainspring tighter around the shaft. A spring-loaded pawl or click presses against the ratchet teeth, preventing the mainspring from unwinding. When the stem is pulled out, the inner teeth of the castle wheel engage with a gear which turns the minute wheel. When the crown is turned, the friction coupling of the <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion</b> allows the hands to be rotated.|$|R
5000|$|Slava's own {{mechanical}} movements feature two mainspring barrels coupled {{together with}} an idler gear. There are many versions of the movement including manual wind 2414 and 2428 (double date)and self-winding 2416 and 2427 (double date). The movements are quite sensitive to shocks due to thin balance staff. Other frequent problems include premature wear of rotor bearing and the clutch driving the hands (not a typical <b>cannon</b> <b>pinion).</b> Also the date indicator malfunctions are common. The movements are thus considered unreliable, especially compared to other Russian calibres. Earlier the 2nd Moscow Factory produced movements derived from an old pre-war French movement, the Lip [...] "T-15" [...] (also some Poljot movements were derived from this French brand), and produced under license (brands Pobeda and Start). In addition to that, for relative brief periods, Slava also produced its own electronic movements using tuning fork and quartz systems. Some Slava watches were produced under Sekonda brand names.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Sara Pezzini and Lara Croft were working {{together}} to find Lara's missing friend, Cannon. Clues lead them {{to the same place}} Aspen happened to be, as Biranha tries to capture Aspen. Biranha and his men kidnap Aspen and Sara, bringing the two back to their Arctic hideout. They were unaware Lara was following close behind. Lara helped the two girls escape, however they quickly return to the base to <b>free</b> <b>Cannon.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Vana's {{experiment}} {{comes to}} a saddening end when Cannon absorbs all of Taras and turns into a horrible abomination, a mere shadow of a man that can barely speak. Vana intends to kill this haunting image of Cannon, believing her son fully lost, until Taras' mind bleeds through, forcing Cannon to say, [...] "I learned to walk before I could crawl". Realizing Taras is still in Cannon's body, Vana tries to undo the experiment, hopefully getting things right this time. As this is going on, Lara sneaks in and frees Aspen and Sara. The trio of women leave the base only to return, realizing they must <b>free</b> <b>Cannon</b> at all costs.|$|R
50|$|When they {{debuted in}} Vigilante #5, Henry Cannon and Marschall Saber were {{a pair of}} assassins {{who wanted to be}} <b>free</b> agents. <b>Cannon</b> was {{employed}} by a mob boss called Rinaldi, while Saber worked a boss named Liebowitz. With the cooperation of District Attorney Marcia King, the pair set out to kill each other's bosses, knowing full well that King would intervene on their behalf.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, a <b>free</b> minigame called <b>Cannon</b> Soccer (or Cannon Fodder - Amiga Format Christmas Special) was {{included}} on the coverdisk of the Amiga Format Christmas issue. It was essentially two bonus levels of Cannon Fodder in which the soldiers fought hordes of Sensible Soccer players in a snowy landscape. The levels were titled [...] "Land of Hope and Glory", and [...] "It's Snow Time".|$|R
50|$|For {{some time}} Parliament had been {{concerned}} {{about the cost of}} maintaining the Tangier garrison. By 1680 the King had threatened to give up Tangier unless the supplies were voted for its sea defences, intended to provide a safe harbour for shipping. The fundamental problem was that {{in order to keep the}} town and harbour <b>free</b> from <b>cannon</b> fire the perimeter of the defended area had to be vastly increased. A number of outworks were built but the siege of 1680 showed that the Moroccans were capable of isolating and capturing these outworks by entrenchments and mining.Although the attempt by Sultan Moulay Ismail of Morocco to seize the town had been unsuccessful, a crippling blockade by the Jaysh al-Rifi ultimately forced the English to withdraw. In 1683, Charles gave Admiral Lord Dartmouth secret orders to abandon Tangier. Dartmouth was to level the fortifications, destroy the harbour, and evacuate the troops. In August 1683 Dartmouth, as Admiral of the Fleet and governor and captain general in Tangier, sailed from Plymouth. He was accompanied by Samuel Pepys, who wrote an account of the evacuation.|$|R
5000|$|The book {{continued}} to be praised in the 1990s and 2000s. Book critic Eden Ross Lipson included it in her 2000 list of the best children's books, and said it [...] "skillfully blends themes of nature, courage, curiosity, and independence". Librarians and authors Janice DeLong and Rachel Schwedt listed the book {{as one of a}} [...] "core collection for small libraries" [...] of the contemporary fiction section. Author Charles Wohlforth, writing in 2004, agreed that it was a classic of contemporary children's literature. By 1998, the book had been translated into numerous foreign languages, and visitors to the <b>Cannon</b> <b>Free</b> Library in Delhi, New York, often asked to see the abandoned farm where the novel was set. (The abandoned farm does not actually exist; the Gribley farm is entirely fictional.) ...|$|R

She {{receives}} her {{power from the}} stone in her mask which gives her Green Lantern-like abilities that enable her to form shields, create energy constructs, fire power blasts and create a full-body field that enables her to fly and travel through deep space. While her origins are never elaborated upon of which version she's based on, the show's creators have confirmed she {{is intended to be}} Carol Ferris. In the episode [...] "Injustice For All", Star Sapphire is invited to join Lex Luthor's Injustice Gang to plot the destruction of the Justice League. She is initially repelled by the idea of working with [...] "common criminals" [...] but seems to warm to {{the amount of money that}} Luthor promises each of them (which also keeps her from quitting after their initial plan fails). In the Injustice Gang's final battle with the Justice League, she is defeated by Green Lantern. In the episode [...] "Fury", Star Sapphire is later recruited to the Injustice Gang's second incarnation led by Aresia to destroy the men of the world. When Aresia reveals the group's agenda, she is initially shocked, but ultimately joins enthusiastically. [...] While aligned with this Injustice Gang, she successfully tricks Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl into believing that she still wants to live in a world with men by luring the two women into a trap that subdues both them and Hippolyta. Later on, she and Aresia, along with Tsukuri, flee with Hippolyta aboard Aresia's plane. Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl pursue them and she is knocked out of the fight when Wonder Woman wrenches one of the plane's laser <b>cannons</b> <b>free</b> from its housing and hurls it at her from behind which plunges her into the sea. In the episode [...] "Hereafter", Star Sapphire is among the several supervillains from the mayhem that reigns in Metropolis shortly after Superman's supposed death at the hands of a group of supervillains but is again defeated by Green Lantern.|$|R
