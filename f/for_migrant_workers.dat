As such, they face [...] "arbitrary arrests, unfair trials and harsh punishments" [...] and may falsely be accused of crime. Amnesty International reports that those charged are often unable to follow the court proceedings, as they are often unable to speak the language and are not given interpreters or legal counsel.

After a worker is convicted and sentenced to death, in many cases the worker's home government is not notified. When the country's representatives are notified, it is often difficult for them to argue for a commutation of sentence. Efforts by the Indonesian government in 2011, for example, required the victims' families to grant clemency and be given diyya ("blood money") in the millions of riyal before the Saudi government would consider the case. , the majority of foreign workers held on death row in Saudi Arabia come from Indonesia.|$|E
