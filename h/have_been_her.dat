5|$|As First Lady, {{she became}} influential. She stirred {{controversy}} after {{an assassination attempt}} against her occurred on 7 December 1972, when an assailant tried to stab her with a bolo knife but was shot by the police.The motive appeared to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> role in her husband's presidency but human rights dissidents believed it was staged by the government.|$|E
60|$|In {{her heart}} {{she felt a}} vague {{tenderness}} and pity for her first husband, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> lord. He <b>was</b> so wrong when he died. She could not bear it, {{that he had never}} lived, never really become himself. And he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> lord! Strange, it all <b>had</b> <b>been!</b> Why <b>had</b> he <b>been</b> <b>her</b> lord? He seemed now so far off, so without bearing on her.|$|R
50|$|A very {{important}} station in <b>her</b> life <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> meeting in 2009 with the legendary pianist Martha Argerich, who after an audition, became her mentor and inspiration. Since then, Theodosia <b>has</b> <b>been</b> under <b>her</b> guidance.|$|R
50|$|One {{step towards}} this {{strategy}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> {{founding of the}} collective AFFRM.|$|R
5|$|On {{the basis}} of Zenobia's Palmyrene name, Bat Zabbai, her father may have been called Zabbai; alternatively, Zabbai {{may have been the}} name of a more distant ancestor. Historian Trevor Bryce {{suggests}} that she was related to Septimius Zabbai, Palmyra's garrison leader, and he may even <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> father.|$|E
5|$|Rapinoe and {{her sister}} both {{attended}} the University of Portland in Portland, Oregon. The Rapinoe twins almost committed to Santa Clara University before choosing {{to play for the}} Portland Pilots on full scholarships. In 2004, Rapinoe did not play college soccer in what would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> freshman season in order to play in the 2004 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship where the United States placed third.|$|E
5|$|The next month, she tweeted an anti-gun {{message with}} the Season of Glass image of Lennon's bloodied glasses {{on what would}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> and Lennon's 44th anniversary, noting that more than 1 million {{people have been killed}} by guns since Lennon's death in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Scully {{check into}} a motel, where a cow crashes {{through the roof}} of Mulder's room. After the incident, a tearful Sheila confesses that the cow might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> fault. She admits that she's {{experienced}} a strange history of weather-related phenomena, and believes that she can unconsciously control the weather. Mulder assures her otherwise. During the conversation, Hardt overhears that Mootz was drunk {{the night of the}} accident, and is relieved. Immediately, Mootz's rain powers seem to disappear.|$|E
5|$|The expedition's {{survivors}} were suitably honoured {{on their}} return, with polar medals and promotions for the naval personnel. In {{place of the}} knighthood that might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> husband's had he survived, Kathleen Scott was granted the rank and precedence of a widow of a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. In 1922, she married Edward Hilton Young, later Lord Kennet (rendering her Lady Kennet), and remained a doughty defender of Scott's reputation until her death, aged 69, in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Billie Burke {{objected to}} her role being cast with another actress (Myrna Loy) {{since she was}} also an actress under {{contract}} to the studio and could play herself, but the producers concluded that at that point {{she was not a}} big enough star to play herself in The Great Ziegfeld. However, according to Emily W. Leider, Burke was not keen on playing her younger self and says that Billie Burke's biographer stated that Miriam Hopkins would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> first choice to play her part, not Loy. Burke herself worked as technical consultant, and although she did not object to Marilyn Miller performing a number, she was influential in the studio's refusal to give her the higher billing and salary she had demanded, which led to Miller walking away from the film.|$|E

5|$|Furious, already {{partially}} converted {{during the}} war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In {{an attempt to}} minimize air turbulence, she was given no superstructure or island. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard funnel; instead, her boiler uptakes ran {{along the sides of}} the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the flight deck, or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> <b>Her</b> half-sisters, Courageous and Glorious, began their conversions to aircraft carriers as Furious neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since Furious had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.|$|E
5|$|Yorkshire {{police officer}} Ronald Craven (Bob Peck) is {{returning}} {{home with his}} daughter Emma (Joanne Whalley) having picked her up from a meeting of an environmental organisation at her university campus. On the doorstep of their home Emma is shot dead. The police concentrate their effort {{on the theory that}} her murder was a botched attempt on Craven's life by a criminal he had been responsible for convicting. However, as Craven goes through Emma's belongings, he discovers a geiger counter and a gun. He also learns that Emma's body and her possessions are radioactive. Travelling to London to assist with the inquiry, he is contacted by Pendleton (Charles Kay), a polished official “attached to the Prime Minister's office”, who informs him that Emma was known to them as a terrorist and that it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>her,</b> not Craven, who was the gunman's target.|$|E

25|$|Madame Montour {{may have}} had another son, Lewis (or Louis) Montour, whose Indian name was {{apparently}} Tau-weson or Tan Weson.

60|$|Such <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> {{feelings}} {{when she}} protested {{that she would}} not be Augusta Gresham's bridesmaid, and offered to put her neck beneath Beatrice's foot; when she drove the Lady Margaretta out of the room, and gave her own opinion as to the proper grammatical construction of the word humble; such also <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> feelings when she kept her hand so rigidly to herself while Frank held the dining-room door open for her to pass through.|$|R
25|$|The de Camps {{moved to}} Plano, Texas, in 1989, and Sprague de Camp died there on November 6, 2000, {{seven months after}} his wife, on what would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>her</b> birthday, just three weeks before his own 93rd birthday.
