5|$|After the First Crusade's {{capture of}} <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>and</b> victory at Ascalon the {{majority}} of the Crusaders considered their pilgrimage complete and returned to Europe. Godfrey was left with only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend the territory won in the Eastern Mediterranean. Only Tancred of the crusader princes remained with the aim of establishing his own lordship. At this point the Franks held only <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>and</b> two great Syrian cities; Antioch and Edessa but not the surrounding country. Jerusalem remained economically sterile despite the advantages of being the centre of administration of church and state and benefitting from streams of pilgrims.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond's wife, Alice, was {{the second}} {{daughter}} of Baldwin II of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>and</b> Morphia of Melitene. Their only child, Constance, was two when Bohemond died in 1130. Alice tried to secure the regency for Constance for herself, but the Antiochene noblemen preferred her father, Baldwin II of Jerusalem. After Bohemond's death, Roger II of Sicily laid claim to Antioch, but he could never assert it against Constance.|$|E
5|$|Having {{captured}} <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>and</b> the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the crusading vow had hence been fulfilled. However, {{there were}} many who had gone home before reaching <b>Jerusalem,</b> <b>and</b> many who had never left Europe at all. When {{the success of the}} crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope. Many crusaders who had remained with the crusade all the way to Jerusalem also went home; according to Fulcher of Chartres, {{there were only a few}} hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100. Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title King of Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|In 1179, William {{was one of}} {{the delegates}} from <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>and</b> the other crusader states at the Third Lateran Council; among the others were Heraclius, {{archbishop}} of Caesarea, Joscius, bishop of Acre and William's future successor in Tyre, the bishops of Sebastea, Bethlehem, Tripoli, and Jabala, and the abbot of Mount Sion. Patriarch Amalric and Patriarch of Antioch Aimery of Limoges were unable to attend, and William and the other bishops did not have sufficient weight to persuade Pope Alexander III of the need for a new crusade. William was, however, sent by Alexander as an ambassador to Emperor Manuel, and Manuel then sent him on a mission to the Principality of Antioch. William does not mention exactly what happened during these embassies, but he probably discussed the Byzantine alliance with <b>Jerusalem,</b> <b>and</b> Manuel's protectorate over Antioch, where, due to pressure from Rome and Jerusalem, the emperor was forced to give up his attempts to restore a Greek patriarch. William was absent from Jerusalem for two years, returning home in 1180.|$|E

5|$|John of Ibelin, who was {{the leader}} of Emperor Frederick's opponents in the kingdoms of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>and</b> Cyprus, tried to {{convince}} Bohemond to support their cause. John sent his son, Balian, to Tripoli to negotiate with Bohemond, but the elderly Bohemond remained neutral in the conflict. Bohemond died in March 1233, {{a few weeks before the}} pope's confirmation of his treaty with the Hospitallers came to Tripoli. He was regarded as a great jurist by his contemporaries.|$|E

Bohemond's relationship with Armenian Cilicia remained tense, which prevented him from pursuing an active foreign policy until Mleh was dethroned in 1175.|$|E

5|$|The Crusade was {{initiated}} by appeal from Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, who requested western aid to help repel the invading Seljuk Turks from Anatolia. In response, Urban II called the Council of Clermont, and in November, officially declared a crusade.
