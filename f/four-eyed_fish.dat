This species grows to a length of 32 cm TL. This fish {{can be found in}} the aquarium trade. The fish does not actually have four eyes, but instead each eye is split into two lobes by a horizontal band of tissue, with each lobe having its own pupil and separate vision. This allows the fish to see under and above the surface of the water at the same time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Four-eyed</b> <b>fish</b> {{spend most}} of their time at the surface of the water. Their diet mostly {{consists}} of terrestrial insects which are readily available at the surface, however they may consume other foods such as other invertebrates, diatoms, and small fishes.|$|E

50|$|Anablepidae is {{a family}} of {{freshwater}} and brackish water fishes living in brackish and freshwater habitats from southern Mexico to southern South America. There are three genera with sixteen species: the <b>four-eyed</b> <b>fishes</b> (genus Anableps), the onesided livebearers (genus Jenynsia) and the white-eye, Oxyzygonectes dovii.

As examples, the female swordtail and guppy will both {{give birth to}} anywhere from 20 to 100 live young after a gestation period of four to six weeks, and mollies will produce a brood of 20 to 60 live young after a gestation of six to 10 weeks.|$|E
50|$|Fishes {{that live}} in surface waters down to about 200 metres, epipelagic fishes, live in a sunlit zone where visual predators use visual systems which are {{designed}} pretty much as might be expected.

The eyes are positioned on {{the top of the head}}, and the fish floats at the water surface with only the lower half of each eye underwater. The two halves are divided by a band of tissue and the eye has two pupils, connected by part of the iris. The upper half of the eye is adapted for vision in air, the lower half for vision in water. The lens of the eye changes in thickness top to bottom to account for the difference in the refractive indices of air versus water. These fish spend most of their time at the surface of the water. Their diet mostly consists of the terrestrial insects which are available at the surface.|$|E

The compound eyes are remarkable for each being divided into a higher part that is above water level when a beetle is floating passively, {{and a lower}} part that is below water level. In this respect they recall the <b>Four-eyed</b> <b>fish.</b> The middle, and more especially the hind legs are natatory, meaning adapted for swimming; they are greatly flattened and fringed with bristles that fold to aid swimming action. In contrast the front legs are long and adapted for grasping food or prey. In males the front tarsi have suckers, which they need for holding onto slippery females during mating.|$|E
40|$|Historical events, such as {{changes in}} sea level during the Pleistocene glacial cycles, {{had a strong}} impact on coastal habitats, {{limiting}} connectivity and promoting the genetic divergence of various species. In this study, we evaluated the influence of climate oscillations {{and the possibility of}} estuary function as a barrier to gene flow among populations of the <b>four-eyed</b> <b>fish,</b> Anableps anableps. This species is fully estuarine-resident, has internal fertilization, is viviparous and does not migrate across long distances. These features make the <b>four-eyed</b> <b>fish</b> an excellent model for the study of evolutionary processes related to genetic differentiation of species and populations in estuaries. The evolutionary history of A. anableps was inferred from phylogeographic and population analyses using sequences of the mitochondrial DNA Control Region of 13 populations distributed in the Amazon and Northeast Coast of Brazil from Calcoene (Amapa) to Parnaiba (Piaui). The 83 retrieved haplotypes show a pattern of four distinct mitochondrial lineages, with up to 3. 4 % nucleotide divergence among them. The evolutionary reconstruction suggests that these lineages diverged recently in the late Pleistocene/early Holocene after the Atlantic Ocean reaching current levels. Analysis of variability, neutrality and the genetic expansion pattern revealed that the lineages have distinct characteristics, which were shaped by the different geomorphological features of coastal regions combined with sea level oscillations over a very long period of time. Only few neighboring populations show a discreet gene flow. This study may also be helpful for designing new experiments to better understand the geomorphological evolutionary history of the estuaries of the Amazon and the Northeast Coast of Brazil using estuarine-resident species as a model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Jenynsia onca, {{commonly}} known as the one sided livebearer, {{is a member of the}} family Anablepidae. The opsin gene repertoires of J. onca 's close relatives, the <b>four-eyed</b> <b>fish</b> (Anableps anableps) and the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), have been characterized and each found to include one unique LWS opsin. Currently, the relationship among LWS paralogs and orthologs in these species are unclear, making it difficult to test the hypotheses that link vision to morphology or life history traits. The phylogenetic signal appears to have been disrupted by gene conversion. Here we have sequenced the opsin genes of J. onca in order to resolve these relationships. Findings We identified nine visual opsins; LWS S 180 r, LWS S 180, LWS P 180, SWS 1, SWS 2 A, SWS 2 B, RH 1, RH 2 - 1, and RH 2 - 2. Key site analysis revealed only one unique haplotype, RH 2 - 2, although this is unlikely to shift Î» max significantly. LWS P 180 was found to be a product of a gene conversion event with LWS S 180, followed by convergence to a proline residue at the 180 site. Conclusion Jenynsia onca has at least 9 visual opsins: three LWS, one RH 1, two RH 2, one SWS 1 and two SWS 2. The presence of LWS P 180 moves the location of the LWS P 180 -S 180 tandem duplication event back to the base of the Poeciliidae-Anablepidae clade, expanding the number of species possessing this unusual blue shifted LWS opsin. The presence of the LWS P 180 gene also confirms that gene conversion events have homogenized opsin paralogs in fish, just as they have in humans. </p...|$|E
40|$|Mangroves are {{considered}} important as fish nurseries worldwide. Block netting in intertidal mangrove creeks at HW revealed the overwhelming {{significance of the}} factors tide and time of day and their combinations (spring tide at dusk and dawn, neap tide at midday and midnight) in structuring fish assemblages. In contrast to neap tide and daylight when nekton catches were poorest, spring tide and darkness produced the most complex fish assemblage structure when abundant species occurred with increased proportions and more rare species entered. Intertidal fish were juveniles or adults of small species, or juveniles of larger species. Stomach analyses of fish showed that the intertidal movements are usually feeding migrations. Fish were concentrated in the subtidal sections at LW. Pioneer studies with a 200 kHz split-beam sonar beaming horizontally and vertically in a large mangrove channel, revealed that the entire fish community rode the first flood rise to achieve upstream transport and to enter the intertidal zone. Despite low Secchi depths, diel changes in vertical distribution were apparent when fish exploited the water column only at night. The <b>four-eyed</b> <b>fish</b> Anableps anableps entered the intertidal creeks rapidly with the first flood rise. They fed in the submerged mangrove at HW and returned gradually after the ebb current maximum to concentrate again in the subtidal parts of the main channel at LW. The combination of high inundation at daylight (spring tide-dawn) provided optimum foraging conditions for A. anableps while darkness and low inundation was linked to poorest foraging conditions (neap tide-night). The mangrove zooplankton was dominated by copepods. Zooplankton densities were higher at spring than at neap tide. In contrast {{to the number of}} zooplankton species, the densities were lowest at HW and highest at LW. Obviously, the temporal variations in abundance of fish and zooplankton are synchronized by the tide...|$|E
