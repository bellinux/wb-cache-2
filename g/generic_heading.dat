This paper explores strategies used by school boys aged 10 - 11 to subordinate and position boys at the bottom of the pupil hierarchy. The findings are based on data gathered from a year long empirical study (between 1998 and 1999) set in three UK junior schools which were differentiated by the social characteristics of their intake. The research emphasises the role of the body in the construction of masculinity. The hegemonic, or most idealised, form of masculinity at each school was constructed around activity and, in particular, various forms of embodied physicality/athleticism (exemplified through skill, strength, fitness and speed), and boys who did not wish to, or who were unable to, use these resources generally found themselves marginalised and/or subordinated. Many of the subordinated forms were symbolically assimilated to femininity, and the paper proposes that the main strategies of subordination can be summarised under the <b>generic</b> <b>heading</b> of ‘difference’.

The entities can be individuals or firms and the choices can include housing, jobs, production quantities, exports, imports, face-to-face contacts, schools, retail centres and activity centres. The first SI models can be grouped under the <b>generic</b> <b>heading</b> gravity models. Their main characteristic is that they model the behaviour of demand or supply segments, rather than that of individuals and firms. This article traces the development of these models from their inception {{in the early part of}} the twentieth century to the present. The key advances include the replacement of the gravity analogy by the more general concepts of entropy or information theory, a statistical framework commonly used in physics. With the arrival of the regional science paradigm over 50 years ago, a key challenge has been to broaden these models compared to those arising in spatial economics, thus arriving at a more inclusive probabilistic framework. These efforts are discussed here, as well as inclusion of geographical advances, embracing activities as generators of travel, time-geography, recognition of spatial interdependencies, and use of neuro-computing principles.

Incorrect nomenclature and misdiagnoses are commonly experienced by patients with these anomalies. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate evaluation and management, often requiring multidisciplinary specialists. Classification schemes provide a consistent terminology {{and serve as a}} guide for pathologists, clinicians, and researchers. One of the goals of the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) is to achieve a uniform classification. The last classification (1997) stratified vascular lesions into vascular malformations and proliferative vascular lesions (tumors). However, additional disease entities have since been identified that are complex and less easily classified by generic headings, such as capillary malformation, venous malformation, lymphatic malformation, etc. We hereby present the updated official ISSVA classification of vascular anomalies. The general biological scheme of the classification is retained. The section on tumors has been expanded and lists the main recognized vascular tumors, classified as benign, locally aggressive or borderline, and malignant. A list of well-defined diseases is included under each <b>generic</b> <b>heading</b> in the "Simple Vascular Malformations" section. A short definition is added for eponyms. Two new sections were created: one dealing with the malformations of individually named vessels (previously referred to as "truncular" malformations); the second groups lesions of uncertain or debated nature (tumor versus malformation).

40|$|The {{history of}} brain-gut {{peptides}} began almost 40 years ago (longer if you include {{the discovery of}} secretin [1]), when Feyrter [2] described a system of widely distributed gut endocrine cells; followed some years later by Pearse's [3] idea that these cells were derived from the neuroectoderm and could be grouped according to their common cytochemical characteristics—the acronymous APUD (amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation) concept. Though not all endocrine cells are APUD, and many are of endodermal origin, this concept {{has been an important}} stimulus to the discovery of an ever-increasing number of bioactive peptides common to brain and gut [4]; these are now included under the <b>generic</b> <b>heading</b> of regulatory peptides [5]. The ubiquity of these peptides, some of their pharmacological actions, and classification within structurally homologous families, suggest a potential for important physiological effects in systems other than the gastrointestinal tract, such as, the cardio-respiratory and immune systems [6 – 8]. Surprisingly little attention has been given to their possible renal effects. After all, there is an important embryological link between gut and kidney; their respective functions in terms of water and electrolyte movement, and cellular transport mechanisms, are often paralleled. This review will consider the renal effects of several brain-gut peptides and their potential for a role in kidney regulation, including renal cell growth. The renal actions of very few regulatory neuropeptides have been studied systematically and observations on several are scattered throughout the biological literature. We will try to summarize some of these findings, assess their significance and discuss what aspects (and peptides) might be worth pursuing. We will not discuss the more “classical” peptide hormones that affect renal function, such as, parathormone (PTH), arginine vasopressin (AVP), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and angiotensin II (AII), nor the incidental renal effects of other established hormones, such as thyroid, sex and pituitary; these have all reviewed extensively in recent years [9 – 12]. However, we will consider those neuropeptides that have been implicated in renal cell growth.

40|$|Should physics {{students}} take {{a course in}} ethics? A National Science Foundation grant was written by the authors in an attempt (in part) to answer this question. One might first ask, why might physics {{students take}} a course in ethics? There are three reasons that might combine to persuade one of the necessity. First, the formal training can be quite practical and useful in the daily life of a physicist, as discussed below. Second, the National Science Teachers Association suggests an ethical component in the training of high school physics teachers (NSTA Standards for Science Teacher Preparation, available at www. nsta. org). Third, there is increasing pressure from the National Science Foundation (NSF document 96 - 102) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH Guide, V. 21, No. 43, Nov. 27, 1992). As of this writing, there are few ethics courses available purely for physics students. The authors know of only two [...] the one taught by Marshall Thomsen at Eastern Michigan University, and one taught at Evergreen State College in Washington. Other courses are in development, as the idea/necessity is catching on, and many other more focused courses exist (e. g. on specific societal issues). One barrier {{to the development of}} such courses that has come to the authors 2 ̆ 7 attention (and to the attention of others considering such a course) is the lack of a suitable textbook. The aforementioned grant was written, in part, to begin development of a textbook by holding an ethics workshop, the proceedings from which would become the basis of a text. In an attempt to gather information from the physics community to target and address relevant issues for such a course, a survey was sent to over 400 members of the American Physical Society 2 ̆ 7 s Forum on Physics and Society and other physicists who may have an interest in this area.

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for {{determining}} the pose of a human head from its 2 D image. It does not use any artificial markers put on a face. The basic idea {{is to use a}} generic model of a human head, which accounts for variation in shape and facial expression. Particularly, a set of 3 D curves are used to model the contours of eyes, lips, and eyebrows. A technique called Iterative Closest Curve matching (ICC) is proposed, which aims at recovering the pose by iteratively minimizing the distances between the projected model curves and their closest image curves. Because curves contain richer information (such as curvature and length) than points, ICC is both more robust and more efficient than the well-known iterative closest point matching techniques (ICP). Furthermore, the image can be taken by a camera with unknown internal parameters, which can be recovered by our technique thanks to the 3 D model. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed technique is promising and that an accurate pose estimate can be obtained from just one image with a <b>generic</b> <b>head</b> model. 1...|$|R

An individualized 3 D head model is first generated by modifying a <b>generic</b> <b>head</b> model, where a set of MPEG- 4 Facial Definition Parameters (FDPs) has been pre-defined. To animate realistic facial expressions of the 3 D head model, key frames of facial expressions are calculated from motion-captured data.
