40|$|To {{solve the}} problem of high {{humidity}} interfering with the monitoring of organic vapours commonly found in workplace air using the piezoelectric crystal detector, a battery operated <b>fan</b> <b>dryer</b> was incorporated with the P/Z detector to provide a light, sensitive and portable monitor for analysing organic vapours in air. The organic vapour monitor developed is sensitive to analyse organic vapours at ppm levels below the control limits of these vapours. To select a suitable coating for the P/Z crystal detector to be used for diurnal monitoring of organic compounds in indoor air and in factories, eight gas-liquid chromatography coatings was chosen for study. Based on their sensitivity, selectivity, bleeding rate and long term stability towards commonly encountered organic vapours such as 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, chloroform, benzene and toluene, Apeizon grease L was selected as the coating of the P/Z crystal. The optimised analytical parameters are : temperature 22 °C- 43 °C, relative humidity 40 %- 100 %, response time 2 - 30 minutes and linear working ranges 88. 8 ppm- 1880 ppm. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A {{portable}} dehumidified and ventilated {{diffusive sampler}} (DVDS) incorporating three diffusive tubes and a domestic battery-driven <b>fan</b> <b>dryer</b> {{was developed to}} solve the problems of high humidity and stagnant air for environmental monitoring of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Using Tenax GR as adsorbent, thermal desorption and cryogenic on-column focusing prior to capillary GC analysis with flame ionization detection, the 10 most common aromatic and halogenated VOCs were determined with the DVDS, giving linear working ranges 3. 2 μg m- 3 - 770 mg m- 3 for 1 h sampling, sampling rates of 0. 64 - 0. 98 ml h- 1 and RSD of 4 - 6 %. The good repeatability is due to the use of a small-diameter diffusive tube (0. 32 mm id) and reproducible ventilation in the DVDS. The optimized analytical parameters are temperature 10 - 40 °C, relative humidity 0 - 100 %, sampling time 15 - 480 min and storage for up to 21 days. Quality assurance procedures were developed for the calibration and preparation of the DVDS. The reliability of the method was established by parallel determinations at a given field station using both the DVDS and the active sampling method. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s, Dualit {{began to}} develop {{different}} products to add to its portfolio. Still manufacturing for the commercial market, this began {{with the introduction of}} a waffle iron and continued to include sandwich toasters, soup kettles and cocktail shakers. The 1970s saw Dualit Toasters start to become more popular in domestic kitchens, but it wasn’t until the 1980s that demand in this area soared. Dualit diversified its product range to include kitchen appliances such as blenders, juicers and non-kitchen products like pedestal <b>fans</b> and hand <b>dryers.</b> Dualit still produce a comprehensive range of catering products, together with several toaster and kettle collections, a food preparation range and coffee and tea machines.

40|$|Abstract — A forced {{convection}} with desiccant integrated solar dryer {{has been built}} and tested. The main parts are: two flat plate solar air collectors, a drying chamber, desiccant bed and a centrifugal blower. The system is operated in two modes, sunshine hours and off sunshine hours. During sun shine hours the hot air from the flat plate collectors is forced to the drying chamber for drying the product and simultaneously the desiccant bed receives solar radiation directly and through the reflected mirror. In the off sunshine hours, the dryer is operated by circulating the air inside the drying chamber through the desiccant bed by a reversible <b>fan.</b> The <b>dryer</b> is used to dry 20 kg of green peas and pineapple slices. Drying experiments were conducted with and without the integration of desiccant unit. The effect of reflective mirror on the drying potential of desiccant unit was also investigated. With the inclusion of reflective mirror, the drying potential of the desiccant material is increased by 25 % and the drying time is reduced. The drying efficiency of the system varies between 48 % and 59 % and the pick-up efficiency varies between 25 % and 60 %, respectively. Approximately in all the drying experiments 68 % of moisture is removed by air heated using solar energy and the remainder by the desiccant. The inclusion of reflective mirror on the desiccant bed makes faster regeneration of the desiccant material.

Advancements have taken place in the practice of drying since the first world war.

Main objectives of this study were to improve on the design of an existing cabinet grain dryer (to redesign the already existing cabinet grain dryer so as to: (i) Optimize efficiency at low cost (ii) Reduce total time of drying (iii) Produce viable and quality grain.

50|$|Founded in April 1910 by {{inventor}} Frederick J. Osius in Racine, Wisconsin, the Hamilton Beach Manufacturing Company {{took its}} name from two men Osius hired, Louis Hamilton and Chester Beach. He hired Hamilton as the new company's advertising manager, and Beach {{to work as a}} mechanic. Osius did not care for his own name, so he paid Hamilton and Beach $1000 each for the right to use their names instead. The company mostly sold products that Osius had invented and patented, but Chester Beach had invented a high-speed fractional motor in 1905, which the company used in many of its products. Osius designed the agitator implement for the company's first drink mixer, the Cyclone, introduced in 1911. Hamilton and Beach left the company in 1913 to form their own firm, Wisconsin Electric Company. Osius sold Hamilton-Beach to Scovill Manufacturing in 1922 and moved to Millionaires' Row in Miami Beach. The Hamilton Beach drink mixer, with its characteristic spindle and metal container, was found at soda fountains of drug stores throughout North America. Other products included stand mixers (for making batter), <b>fans,</b> and hair <b>dryers.</b> The spindle drink mixer was expanded in the 1930s to enable multiple milk shakes to be processed at once. The original company continues as the Hamilton Beach side of Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc. As of 2012, all of Hamilton Beach's appliances are manufactured by subcontractors in China.|$|R
40|$|In Perry Hoberman 2 ̆ 7 s {{electronic}} garden, {{evocative of}} happier and simpler {{times when the}} American Dream was the 2 ̆ 2 General Electric Home, 2 ̆ 2 the concept of sculpture is being redefined and stretched to its limits. Hoberman, {{in a sort of}} tribute to Michael Faraday 2 ̆ 7 s electronic genius, recycles outdated and, at times, archaic-looking household appliances and tools in our room-sized installation. In this expanded version of the original Faraday 2 ̆ 7 s Garden, which was exhibited in 1990 at Postmasters Gallery in New York City, each of the appliances is activated by walking on electronic footpads on the floor, resulting in a sculpture that seems to have a personality of its own. Quiet and still when left alone, the sculpture invites the audience to meander through. Then, 2 ̆ 2 all hell breaks loose! 2 ̆ 2 Hoberman allows the individual viewer {{to have a sense of}} control and to write his or her own score, using instruments such as hair <b>dryers,</b> <b>fans,</b> mixers, blenders, record players, movie projectors, radios, etc. But as the audience increases, the result is a cacophony of sounds and a chaotic environment. Faraday 2 ̆ 7 s Garden takes 2 ̆ 2 lo-tech 2 ̆ 2 to new heights. It not only makes one rethink the slick, consumer oriented sculpture of the late 1980 s-it also adds to its dimensions. [URL]...|$|R

Results: The result of the improvement on the design of a cabinet grain dryer showed that; (i) It was less costly (ii) It was cheap to maintain since the fan is the only moving component and can hardly become faulty (iii) drying time of the grain was reduced (iv) The machine ergonomic; operation of the machine does not require specialization (v) The machine is safer to operate since the use of gas has been eliminated (vi) Time between two batches was reduced with the introduction of a trolley (vii) Energy for loading or unloading reduced since the trays can be loaded and unloaded outside the cabinet. Conclusion: Drying of grains safer since fire hazards were reduced owing to the use of gas in the previous design. Heater supplied the right quantity of heat and incorporates a fan which supplies right quantity of air needed to distribute this heat evenly to all grains in drying chamber. This made drying faster and grains are moderately dried...|$|R
