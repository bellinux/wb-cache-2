5|$|Humanity {{lives in}} the deepest reaches of {{explored}} space in a vast region known as The <b>Frontier.</b> It contains many well-known and inhabited star systems, but many more worlds remain uncharted. Most people will never travel this far away from normal civilization, but for pioneers, explorers, mercenaries, outlaws, and soldiers - the <b>Frontier</b> offers both adventure and opportunity.|$|E
5|$|In 121 BC, Han forces {{expelled}} the Xiongnu from a vast territory {{spanning the}} Hexi Corridor to Lop Nur. They repelled a joint Xiongnu-Qiang invasion of this northwestern territory in 111 BC. In that year, the Han court established four new <b>frontier</b> commanderies in this region: Jiuquan, Zhangyi, Dunhuang, and Wuwei. The {{majority of people}} on the <b>frontier</b> were soldiers. On occasion, the court forcibly moved peasant farmers to new <b>frontier</b> settlements, along with government-owned slaves and convicts who performed hard labor. The court also encouraged commoners, such as farmers, merchants, landowners, and hired laborers, to voluntarily migrate to the <b>frontier.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Frontiers</b> of Engineering program assembles a {{group of}} {{emerging}} engineering leaders - usually aged 30-45 - to discuss cutting-edge research in various engineering fields and industry sectors. The goal of the meetings is to bring participants together to collaborate, network, and share ideas. There are three <b>Frontiers</b> of Engineering meetings every year: the U.S. <b>Frontiers</b> of Engineering Symposium, the German-American <b>Frontiers</b> of Engineering Symposium, and the Japan-America <b>Frontiers</b> of Engineering Symposium. The Indo-U.S. <b>Frontiers</b> of Engineering Symposium is held every other year.|$|R

5|$|The <b>Frontier</b> Militia {{represents}} the military {{arm of the}} <b>Frontier</b> systems' territorial defense pact. The Militia is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all rising up as 'citizen soldiers' when the need arises. Each brigade within the Militia is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of <b>Frontier</b> territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, the Militia has enough resources to be a real obstacle to the IMC's ambitions on the <b>Frontier.</b> The Militia often claims that direct action against the IMC {{is in the best interest}} of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone on the <b>Frontier</b> sees it that way.|$|E

One aim of <b>Frontiers</b> is to teach [...] "Scientific Habits of Mind", a set of analytical approaches that apply to all disciplines of science. <b>Frontiers</b> is taught as four, 3 week units: two from the physical sciences (for example, Astronomy and Geology) and two from the life sciences (for example, Neuroscience and Biodiversity). Outside of Columbia, <b>Frontiers</b> has evoked widespread interest from colleges and universities seeking to initiate or modify a general education science course.

5|$|Altan Khan {{eventually}} {{made peace with}} China when it opened border cities for trade in 1571, alleviating the Mongol need to raid. This, coupled with Qi and Tan's efforts to secure the <b>frontier,</b> brought a period of relative peace along the border. However, minor raids still happened {{from time to time}} when the profits of plunder outweighed those of trade, prompting the Ming to close all gaps along the <b>frontier</b> around Beijing. Areas of difficult terrain once considered impassable were also walled off, leading to the well-known vistas of a stone-faced Great Wall snaking over dramatic landscapes that tourists still see today.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the siege}} {{consumed}} {{a large part}} of the Caliphate's manpower and resources, it was still capable of launching raids against the Byzantine <b>frontier</b> in eastern Asia Minor during the siege's duration: in 717, Caliph Sulayman's son Daud captured a fortress near Melitene and in 718 Amr ibn Qais raided the <b>frontier.</b> On the Byzantine side, the numbers are unknown. Aside from Anastasius II's preparations (which might have been neglected following his deposition), the Byzantines could count on the assistance of the Bulgars, with whom Leo concluded a treaty that possibly included alliance against the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|At this time, and {{following}} the disastrous Battle of Acheloos in 917, the Byzantines were mostly occupied in the Balkans in a protracted conflict against Bulgaria. Hence, Kourkouas's first task as Domestic of the East was {{the suppression of the}} revolt of Bardas Boilas, the governor (strategos) of Chaldia, a strategically important area on the Empire's northeastern Anatolian <b>frontier.</b> This was quickly achieved and his brother, Theophilos Kourkouas, replaced Boilas as governor of Chaldia. As commander of this northernmost sector of the eastern <b>frontier,</b> Theophilos proved a competent soldier and gave valuable assistance to his brother's campaigns.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} how {{empirical}} production <b>frontiers</b> {{may contribute to}} the incentives of production units. We consider a series of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) <b>frontiers,</b> and we show when these may be incentive efficient {{in the sense that they}} contain all the information that are relevant for optimal incentive provision. The <b>frontiers</b> considered include the so-called constant, decreasing and varying return to scale models, the free disposability and the free replicability models, as well as the increasing and decreasing return to scale models based on a relaxed set of assumptions. Also, we illustrate how to design optimal incentive schemes based on such <b>frontiers.</b> Contents: 1. Introduction, 2. The Incentive Problem, 3.
