The main group of boundaries correspond to the various levels of 2011, 2001, 1991, 1981 and 1971 census geography which are designed to be used for spatial visualisation and analysis of census statistics. Also available are historic boundaries created by the Great Britain Historical GIS Project, held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33288 Great Britain Historical Database, 1841 - 1939. Main Topics : Census Support provides the following facilities: •	Easy Download The most regularly requested Census Support boundaries available as ready to use national datasets.

We propose and analyze a class of estimators which do not require any knowledge about the probability distribution of the sample support and exploit the characteristics of the positive definite matrix space.

40|$|Abstract—Classification Rule Mining (CRM) is a Data Mining {{technique}} for {{the extraction of}} hidden Classification Rules (CRs) from a given database, the objective being to build a classifier to classify “unseen ” data. One recent approach to CRM is to use Association Rule Mining (ARM) techniques to identify the desired CRs, i. e. Classification Association Rule Mining (CARM). Although the advantages of accuracy and efficiency offered by CARM have been established in many papers, one major drawback is {{the large number of}} Classification Association Rules (CARs) that may be generated (up to a maximum of 2 n- 1, where n represents the number of attributes in a database). However, there are only a limited number (k) of CARs that are required to distinguish between classes. The problem addressed in this paper is how to efficiently select all k such CARs. An algorithm is presented, that addresses the above, that operates in binomial time O(k 2 n 2); as opposed to exponential time O(2 n) – the time required to find all k CARs in a “one-by-one ” manner.
