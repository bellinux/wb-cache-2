5000|$|For a {{spinning}} charged solid with a uniform charge density to mass density ratio, the gyromagnetic ratio {{is equal to}} half the <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratio.</b> This implies that a more massive assembly of charges spinning with the same angular momentum will have a proportionately weaker magnetic moment, compared to its lighter counterpart. Even though atomic particles cannot be accurately described as spinning charge distributions of uniform <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratio,</b> this general trend {{can be observed in}} the atomic world, where the intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of each type of particle is a constant: a small half-integer times the reduced Planck constant [...] This is the basis for defining the magnetic moment units of Bohr magneton (assuming <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratio</b> of the <b>electron)</b> and nuclear magneton (assuming <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratio</b> of the proton).|$|R

The electric <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratio</b> of a particle can be measured by observing the radius of curling of its cloud-chamber track in a magnetic field. Positrons, because of the direction that their paths curled, were at first mistaken for electrons travelling {{in the opposite direction}}. Positron paths in a cloud-chamber trace the same helical path as an electron but rotate in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetic field direction due to their having the same magnitude of <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratio</b> but with opposite charge and, therefore, opposite signed <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{we use a}} deep-exposure {{spectrum}} taken by the SUMER spectrometer in a polar coronal hole in 1996 to measure the ion temperatures {{of a large number}} of ions at many different heights above the limb between 0. 03 and 0. 17 solar radii. We find that the measured ion temperatures are almost always larger than the electron temperatures and exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratio.</b> We use these measurements to provide empirical constraints to a theoretical model of ion heating and acceleration based on gradually replenished ion-cyclotron waves. We compare the wave power required to heat the ions to the observed levels to a prediction based on a model of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We find that the empirical heating model and the turbulent cascade model agree with one another, and explain the measured ion temperatures, for <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratios</b> smaller than about 0. 25. However, ions with <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratios</b> exceeding 0. 25 disagree with the model; the wave power they require to be heated to the measured ion temperatures shows an increase with <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratio</b> (i. e., with increasing frequency) that cannot be explained by a traditional cascade model.

40|$|The {{deflection}} {{of interstellar}} dust grains in {{the magnetic field}} near the heliopause has been investigated {{based on the assumption}} that interstellar grains are homogeneous spheres. However, remote observations have shown that interstellar grains are more likely to be composites of a large number of subunits. This has profound significance when interpreting data obtained through in-situ measurements, for the deflection of interstellar grains depends on their <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratio,</b> and aggregates acquire different surface charges from spheres due to their complex structure. In this paper, the charging of aggregates near the heliopause is examined including both plasma charging and secondary electron emission. The results show that aggregates generally have a higher <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratio</b> than spheres, and the small particle effect from secondary electron emission is evident for aggregates consisting of nano-sized particles. A new approach to estimate the aggregate charge with the aid of its structural characteristics is presented.

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the induced electrostatic signals in the fluidized beds, an array of arc-shaped induced electrostatic sensors were attached to the outer wall of a fluidized bed. Combined with cross-correlation method, induced electrostatic voltage signals and correlation velocity of particles were measured simultaneously. It was found that electrostatic charges accumulation restrained the particle motions while the average correlation velocity of particles increased with the amount of injecting liquid antistatic agent. Based on the analyses of induced electrostatic signals, the particle correlation velocity, and the particles <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratio</b> under different charging levels, a predictive model of the average particles <b>charge-to-mass</b> <b>ratio</b> was established.
