5|$|Chrono Cross employs story arcs, characters, {{and themes}} from , a Satellaview side story to Chrono Trigger {{released}} in Japan. An illustrated text adventure, Radical Dreamers {{was created to}} wrap up an unresolved plot line of Chrono Trigger. Though it borrows from Radical Dreamers in its exposition, Chrono Cross is not a remake of Radical Dreamers, but a larger effort to fulfill that game's purpose; the plots of the games are irreconcilable. To resolve continuity issues and acknowledge Radical Dreamers, the developers of Chrono Cross suggested the game <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> parallel dimension. A notable {{difference between the two}} games is that Magus—present in Radical Dreamers as Gil—is absent from Chrono Cross. Director Masato Kato originally planned for Magus to appear in disguise as Guile, but scrapped the idea due to plot difficulties. In the DS version of Chrono Trigger, Kato teases the possibility of an amnesiac Magus.|$|E
5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> break {{between the end}} of concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage {{together}} with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge {{at the back of his}} head, they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E

25|$|Hauerwas {{believes}} {{that there is a}} difference between the concept of death and the criteria for death. The concept of death “involves a philosophical judgment of a significant change that has <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> person” and therefore “is a correlative of what one takes to be the necessary condition of human life, e.g., … the potential for consciousness”. The criteria of death, however, are “those empirical measurements that can be made to determine whether a person is dead, such as cessation of respiration or a flat EEG”. Thus, brain death is a criterion of death that may serve “as a symbol of when it is time to die”. A person must not delay death so long that it is no longer possible to die a good death.|$|E

25|$|The Dunmanway killings, {{also known}} as the Dunmanway murders or the Dunmanway massacre, refers to the killing (and in some cases, disappearances) of {{thirteen}} Protestant men and boys in and around Dunmanway, County Cork, between 26–28 April 1922. This <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> period of truce {{after the end of the}} Irish War of Independence (in July 1921) and before the outbreak of the Irish Civil War in June 1922. All the dead and missing were Protestants, which has led to the killings being described in some sources as sectarian. Six were killed as purported British informers and loyalists, while four others were relatives killed in the absence of the target. Three other men were kidnapped and shot dead in Bandon as revenge for the killing of an IRA officer Michael O'Neill during an armed raid. One man was shot and survived his injuries.|$|E
25|$|On May 15, 1990, Shell Rimula X {{defeated}} Añejo Rum 65, 4–2 {{to win the}} 1990 PBA 1st Conference title. However, it {{sparked a}} controversy in the sixth and {{final game of the}} series when the whole Añejo team walked out with still 2:52 left in the second quarter in favor of the Oilers, 62-47. Back-to-back technical fouls were slapped by referee Rudy Hines on Rey Cuenco led to the walkout. Jaworski and team manager Ber Navarro refused to return to the court, which resulted in the forfeiture of the game, and the championship to Shell. Two days later, the league fined Añejo a whopping 550,000 pesos, the biggest in league history. It was the second time that a forfeiture <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> PBA Finals series since Crispa in Game four of the 1975 series against rival Toyota.|$|E
25|$|Ventura filed a {{defamation}} {{suit against}} Kyle in January 2012.

However, in a motion filed by Ventura, Bill DeWitt, a close friend of Ventura and former SEAL who was present with him at the bar, suggested that Ventura interacted with a few SEALs but was involved in no confrontation with Kyle, and said that Kyle's claims were false. DeWitt's wife also said she never witnessed any fight between Kyle and Ventura.|$|E

25|$|The {{adaptation}} of the third novel followed the book very closely, which caused major structural issues in meshing with the preceding radio series {{in comparison to the}} second novel. Because many events from the radio series were omitted from the second novel, and those that did occur <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> different order, the two series split in completely different directions. The last two adaptations vary somewhat—some events in Mostly Harmless are now foreshadowed in the {{adaptation of}} So Long and Thanks For All The Fish, while both include some additional material that builds on incidents in the third series to tie all five (and their divergent plotlines) together, most especially including the character Zaphod more prominently in the final chapters and addressing his altered reality to include the events of the Secondary Phase. While Mostly Harmless originally contained a rather bleak ending, Dirk Maggs created a different ending for the transmitted radio version, ending it on a much more upbeat note, reuniting the cast one last time.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{protesting the}} strenuous {{nature of the}} players' {{workload}} in this new era, Chappell found himself leading the team to Pakistan {{two weeks after the}} end of the Australian season. Pakistan narrowly won the first Test, then prepared featherbed wickets for the remaining two matches. At Faisalabad, Chappell made 235 and as a protest at the pitch, allowed all eleven Australians to have a bowl in Pakistan's innings – the first time this had <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Test since 1884. Australia lost the series 0–1. Later in the year, Australia played a second Centenary Test, this time to commemorate the first Test played in England, and the match (played at Lords) ended in a draw due to poor weather. One of only four players who played both matches, Chappell scored 47 and 59, but his best remembered contribution to the match was an attempted citizen's arrest (along with England captain Ian Botham) of an MCC member who attacked one of the umpires in a very ill-tempered scene.|$|E
25|$|In one of {{the caves}} on the Kyffhäuser, lives Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor {{surrounded}} by his cavaliers, somewhat {{similar to those of}} Fruela and Bernardo del Carpio. The Covadonga area is also rich with astonishing stories, such as the one which is said to have <b>happened</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shepherd village where today Enol and Ercina lakes are situated. Mary, mother of Jesus, disguised as a pilgrim, is said to have visited that village and asked for food and shelter from every house of that village. She was rudely rejected by every person, except for a shepherd who gave her refuge and warmly shared everything he had. On the following day, as punishment for their lack of hospitality, a flood of divine origin devastated the village, which completely covered everything except the cottage of the good shepherd. In front of him, the mysterious guest started to cry, and her tears became flowers when they reached the floor. Then the shepherd realized that the pilgrim was actually Mary.|$|E

500|$|The {{first was}} in the 1999 Cricket World Cup semi-final, in which a run out in the final over with only one run {{required}} prevented South Africa advancing to the final instead of Australia, who progressed because the latter had a better rank in the previous stage – Super Sixes. The second tied match, in the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa, was {{a case in which}} the Duckworth-Lewis method caused a South African loss against Sri Lanka. With the onset of rain, the South African batsmen achieved the score they believed was required to win the match and then blocked out the last ball of the over to avoid losing wickets, however, the score they believed indicated a win actually indicated the score required to tie the match. This tie meant South Africa could not advance to the Super Sixes stage.
