This thesis is focused on the production of cutting dies produced by company FOR MIX s. r. o. Trenčín. We can consider the cutting die as a typical product of company´s product program. In the practical part of this diploma thesis, there is detail of technological aspects and operating costs for {{wire electrical discharge machining}} technology in specific condition of company FOR MIX s. r. o...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} demands of high surface finish and machining of complex shape geometries, conventional machining process {{are now being}} replaced by non-traditional machining processes. Wire EDM {{is one of the}} nontraditional machining processes which is based on Electrical Discharge Machining Process, which is also called <b>electro-erosion</b> <b>machining</b> process. When the gap voltage is sufficiently large (i. e. reaches the breakdown voltage of dielectric fluid), high power spark is produced, which increase the temperature about 10, 000 degrees Celsius. By this way the metal is removed from the work piece. The selection of optimum machining parameters in WEDM is an important increasing productivity. As Material Removal Rate (MRR) is most important response in WEDM; various investigations have been carried out by several researchers for improving the MRR. In this paper, the Taguchi method has been extensively adopted in manufacturing to improve processes with single performance characteristic to achieve higher Material Removal Rate...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the {{applications}} of powder injection moulding (PIM), the metallic powders {{are the most}} popular material. In our study, three metallic powders with different compositions, particle shapes and particle sizes have been selected as the test materials to produce micro-structured parts using injection moulding process. The combination of three binders (polypropylene, paraffin waxes and stearic acid) with a constant and adapted formulation has been chosen as a binder system. The mixtures obtained by mixing the metallic powders and the binder system with solid loadings ranging from 56 to 64 vol. % have been used as the feedstocks for the next injection moulding. The viscosity of mixture increased with increasing solid loading. These feedstocks were injected using the same injection moulding conditions in the metallic mould structured with pyramidal shape manufactured using <b>electro-erosion</b> <b>machining.</b> The debinding and sintering process have been carried out at different temperatures to eliminate the binders in the injected replica and obtain the final metallic die mould. To analyse the physical properties evolution of the die mould manufactured by PIM and the influence factors (powder nuance, solid loading and sintering conditions), the shrinkage rate, density, roughness of surface, Vickers hardness and mass losses in metallic mould cavities were investigated. The experimental results demonstrate that properly microstructured parts can be obtained using the process chain of injection, debinding and sintering with metallic powders...|$|E
