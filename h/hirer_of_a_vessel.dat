30|$|The draught <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> is <b>a</b> measure {{describing}} the vertical {{distance between the}} waterline and the bottom of vessel hull. Draught, defining the minimum depth <b>of</b> water <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> can operate, {{is an important factor}} for navigating and routing vessels while avoiding shallow water pathways. Length <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> does matter for navigation and marine traffic routing, as well as for calculating fees during vessel registration. Consequently, estimating length <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> effectively from <b>a</b> single image may be very beneficial for maritimeapplications. Gross tonnage is a nonlinear measure calculated based on overall interior volume (from keel to funnel) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel.</b> It is important in determining the number of staff, safety rules, registration fees, and port dues. Summer deadweight defines how much mass a ship can safely carry. It excludes the weight of the ship and includes the sum of the weights of cargo, fuel, fresh water, ballast water, provisions, passengers, and crew [36].|$|R

40|$|Abstract Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) recurs {{in approximately}} 70 % of cases after resection. Vascular invasion by tumor cells {{can be classified}} as gross or microscopic (microvascular invasion [mVI]) and is {{a risk factor for}} recurrence. We examined <b>a</b> large cohort <b>of</b> patients with HCC who were treated by resection to identify features of mVI that correlated with recurrence and survival. METHODS: We reviewed the records of all HCC resections performed at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine between January 1990 and March 2006 to identify those with mVI, established by histologic analysis. The numbers and sizes of <b>vessels</b> invaded, invasion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> with <b>a</b> muscular wall, distance from the tumor, and satellite nodules were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 384 patients who underwent resection for HCC, 131 (34. 1 %) met the entry criteria. The median follow-up period was 28. 9 months. There were 68 recurrences and 54 deaths. In multivariate analysis, invasion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> with <b>a</b> muscular wall predicted recurrence (hazard ratio, 1. 8; P =. 02), and invasion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> with <b>a</b> muscular wall (hazard ratio, 2. 2; P =. 018) and invasion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> that was more than 1 cm from the tumor (hazard ratio, 2. 1; P =. 015) predicted survival. A risk score that assigned points for the presence of each variable correlated with recurrence (P =. 028) and survival (P <. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: A novel classification system that includes invasion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> with <b>a</b> muscular wall and invasion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vessel</b> that is more than 1 cm from the tumor can accurately predict risk of recurrence and survival of patients with mVI after resection of HCC.
