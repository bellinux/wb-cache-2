40|$|Based on Yosida's {{ground state}} of the single-impurity Kondo Hamiltonian, we study three kinds of {{entanglement}} between an impurity and <b>conduction</b> <b>electron</b> spins. First, it is shown that the impurity spin is maximally entangled with all the <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons.</b> Second, a two-spin density matrix of the impurity spin and one <b>conduction</b> <b>electron</b> spin is given by a Werner state. We find that the impurity spin is not entangled with one <b>conduction</b> <b>electron</b> spin even within the Kondo screening length ξ_K, although there is the spin-spin correlation between them. Third, we show the density matrix of two <b>conduction</b> <b>electron</b> spins is nearly same {{to that of a}} free electron gas. The single impurity does not change the entanglement structure of the <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> in contrast to the dramatic change in electrical resistance.

40|$|We derive here a {{stability}} condition {{for a local}} moment {{in the presence of}} an interacting sea of <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons.</b> The <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> are modeled as a Luttinger liquid in which chirality and spin are coupled. We show that an Anderson-U defect in such an interacting system can be transformed onto a nearly-Fermi liquid problem. We find that correlations among the <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> stabilize the local moment phase. A Schrieffer-Wolff transformation is then performed which results in an anisotropic exchange interaction indicative of the Kondo effect in a Luttinger liquid.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{model of the}} "isostructural" γ-α phase transition in Ce {{which is based on}} quadrupolar interactions due to coupled charge density fluctuations of 4 f <b>electrons</b> and of <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons.</b> <b>Conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> are treated in tight-binding approximation. The γ-α transition is described as an orientational ordering of quadrupolar electronic densities in a Pa 3 structure. The quadrupolar order of the <b>conduction</b> <b>electron</b> densities is complementary to the quadrupolar order of 4 f electron densities. The inclusion of <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> leads to an increase of the lattice contraction at the γ-α transition in comparison to the sole effect of 4 f electrons. We calculate the Bragg scattering law and suggest synchrotron radiation experiments in order to check the Pa 3 structure. The theory is capable of accounting for transitions to phases of non-cubic symmetry, but it is not sufficient to describe the magnetic phenomena which we ascribe to the Kondo mechanism. We also present a microscopic derivation of multipolar interactions and discuss the crystal field of γ-Ce. Comment: 19 pages, 4 figures, full version to be published in Eur. Phys. J. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{quantum field}} effect {{transistor}} (QFET) {{is a kind of}} field-effect transistor that takes advantage of quantum tunneling to greatly increase the speed of transistor operation by eliminating the traditional transistor's area of <b>electron</b> <b>conduction</b> which typically causes carriers to slow down by a factor of 3000. The result is an increase in logic speed by a factor of 10 with a simultaneous reduction in component power requirement and size also by a factor of 10.

40|$|Analyzing the {{exchange}} energy of two <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> in a crystal at a many-body approach we find, that {{the exchange}} energy may be negative and, thus, the singlet state may be favorable. A full overlap {{in the real}} space of the wave functions of two <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> leads to a deeper exchange energy. Thus the Pauli Exclusion Principle and the exchange interaction cause a bond between two <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> in the real space. The singlet bond is possible because the singlet electrons are in average closer to positive ions than single electrons. The superconductivity in a metallic crystal occurs only if <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons,</b> before the pairing, are put closely on the Fermi surface in the momentum space. The motion of <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> in the crystal may prevent the formation of Cooper pairs, because the kinetic energy of the motion is usually larger than the binding energy in the pair. The <b>conduction</b> <b>electrons</b> as standing waves have zero momenta, hence their momenta are synchronous; therefore the formation of Cooper pairs is more probable than in case of nonzero momenta. The approach of standing waves explains the inverse isotope effect and many other facts about superconductor...|$|R
