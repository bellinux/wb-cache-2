5|$|In humans, APOA5 is {{expressed}} {{almost exclusively in}} the liver tissue; some minor expressions have also been detected in the small intestine. Nothing {{is known about the}} existence of the potential alternative splicing variants of this gene. In comparison with other apolipoproteins, plasma concentration of APOA5 is very low (less than 1 μg/mL). This suggests that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> catalytic than structural functions, since there is less than one APOA5 molecule per one lipoprotein particle. APOA5 is associated predominantly with TG-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and VLDL) and has also been detected on HDL particles.|$|E
5|$|Pevensey Castle is {{a medieval}} castle and former Roman Saxon Shore fort at Pevensey in the English county of East Sussex.

Built around 290 AD and known to the Romans as Anderitum, the fort appears to have been the base for a fleet called the Classis Anderidaensis. The reasons for its {{construction}} are unclear; long thought to have been part of a Roman defensive system to guard the British and Gallic coasts against Saxon pirates, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> recently been suggested that Anderitum and the other Saxon Shore forts were built by a usurper in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to prevent Rome from reimposing its control over Britain.|$|E

These groups often argue for the recognition of obesity as a disability under the US Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA).

5|$|Unlike the {{straightforward}} {{narrative of}} the attacks on Dál Riata, a number of interpretations have been offered of the relations between Óengus, Eadberht and Æthelbald in the period from 740 to 750. One suggestion is that Óengus and Æthelbald were allied against Eadberht, or even that they exercised a joint rulership of Britain, or bretwaldaship, Óengus collecting tribute north of the River Humber and Æthelbald south of the Humber. This rests largely on a confused passage in Symeon of Durham's Historia Regum Anglorum, and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> recently been suggested that the interpretation offered by Frank Stenton—that {{it is based on}} a textual error and that Óengus and Æthelbald were not associated in any sort of joint overlordship—is the correct one.|$|E

5|$|The park {{is an area}} of rich highveld and montane {{grassland}} flora. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> {{than sixty}} grass species and a large variety of bulbs and herbs. Each of these species has its own flowering time, meaning that veld flowers can be seen throughout the summer. The park also has Afromontane forests and high-altitude Austro-Afro alpine grassland, which is scarce in South Africa. The ouhout (Leucosidea sericea), an evergreen species, is the most common tree in the park. Ouhout is a favourite habitat of beetles and 117 species occur on these trees in the park. The Lombardi poplars and weeping willows in the park are introduced species, but are kept because of their cultural and historic connection with the eastern Free State. Other exotic species in the park, for example wattle and bluegum, are systematically eradicated.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of Newtonian physics such as precise collision physics.|$|E
