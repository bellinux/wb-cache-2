Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be beneficial to cardiovascular health.|$|E
5|$|Cardiomyopathy is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} heart muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead to}} heart failure. The causes of many types of cardiomyopathy are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of cardiomyopathy are described according to how they affect heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy can cause the heart to become enlarged (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), constrict the outflow tracts of the heart (restrictive cardiomyopathy), or cause the heart to <b>dilate</b> and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated cardiomyopathy). HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dilated</b> {{cardiomyopathy}} is a prevalent {{and often}} fatal disease in humans and dogs. Indeed <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy {{is the third}} {{most common form of}} cardiac disease in humans, reported to a ect approximately 36 individuals per 100, 000 individuals. In dogs, <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy is the second most common cardiac disease and is most prevalent in the Irish Wolfhound, Doberman Pinscher and Newfoundland breeds. <b>Dilated</b> cardiomyopathy is characterised by ventricular chamber enlargement and systolic dysfunction which often leads to congestive heart failure. Although multiple human loci have been implicated in the pathogenesis of <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy, the identi ed variants are typically associated with rare monogenic forms of <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy. The potential for multigenic interactions contributing to human <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy remains poorly understood. Consistent with this, several known human <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy loci have been excluded as common causes of canine <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy, although canine <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy resembles the human disease functionally. This suggests additional genetic factors contribute to the <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy phenotype. This study represents a meta-analysis of available canine <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy genetic datasets with the goal of determining potential multigenic interactions relating the sex chromosome genotype (XX vs. XY) with known <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy associated loci on chromosome 5 and the PDK 4 gene in the incidence and progression of <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy. The results show an interaction between known canine <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy loci and an unknown X-linked locus.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare HLA {{distribution}} in familial and non-familial <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy, because a serum marker that could identify families {{at risk of}} developing <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy should be of use in screening for the disease. PATIENTS: 100 patients with <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy. METHODS: 200 first degree relatives from 56 of the proband families were screened for <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy by echocardiography. The HLA profile of the patients with <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy, {{as well as of}} the familial and non-familial subgroups, was compared with that of 9000 normal controls. RESULTS: The familial prevalence of <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy in this patient group was "definite" in 14 of 56 (25 %) and "possible" in 25 of 56 (45 %). The HLA-DR 4 frequency in the 100 patients with <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy was similar to that in the 9000 controls (39 % v 32 %). However, the DR 4 subtype was significantly more common in the 25 probands with a familial tendency to <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy than in the 31 probands with non-familial <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy (68 % v 32 %; P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The present finding supports an HLA linked predisposition to familial <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy. The HLA type DR 4 was significantly more common in familial than in non-familial cases. The DR 4 halotype was associated with two thirds of the families at risk for <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy...|$|R
5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{has many}} counterintuitive and experimentally verified implications. These include the equivalence of mass and energy , length contraction (moving objects shorten), and time dilation (moving clocks run more slowly). The factorγ by which lengths contract and times <b>dilate</b> {{is known as}} the Lorentz factor and is given by , where v is the speed of the object. The difference of γ from 1 is negligible for speeds much slower thanc, such as most everyday speeds—in which case special relativity is closely approximated by Galilean relativity—but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity as v approaches c. For example, a time dilation factor of γ=2 occurs at a relative velocity of 86.6% of the speed of light (v=.866c). Similarly, a time dilation factor of γ=10 occurs at v=99.5%c.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} canal is {{a passage}} through which sperm must travel to fertilize an egg cell after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including cervical caps and cervical diaphragms aim to block or prevent {{the passage of}} sperm through the cervical canal. Cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the Creighton model and Billings method, due to its changes in consistency throughout the menstrual period. During vaginal childbirth, the cervix must flatten and <b>dilate</b> to allow the fetus to progress along the birth canal.

5|$|The {{physiological}} {{responses of the}} epaulette shark to low oxygen are mediated by the nucleoside adenosine. In hypoxic conditions, the heart and ventilation rates drop sharply. The shark's blood pressure falls by half as the blood vessels <b>dilate</b> to deliver more blood to the brain and heart. Unlike in bony fishes and tetrapods, the blood flow rate remains constant {{and there is no}} elevation of blood glucose levels. The brains of sharks only consume a third as much ATP as those of teleosts. The epaulette shark is able to lower this energy demand further by reducing the metabolism of certain areas of its brain, e.g. keeping the sensory nuclei functional while deactivating the motor nuclei. This allows the shark to supply enough ATP to prevent neuron death, while still remaining alert to its environment.|$|E

40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} {{whether there is an}} association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy in a well defined area of north western Greece; such an association has been reported elsewhere.  Design—Evaluation of consecutive patients with chronic HCV infection for the presence of clinical or subclinical manifestations of <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy by history, physical examination, and non-invasive laboratory procedures (ECG, chest x ray, and echocardiography) before the initiation of interferon α treatment; investigation for HCV infection markers in patients with <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy by enzyme and immunoblot assays (antibodies to HCV) and the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (HCV RNA).  Setting—A tertiary referral centre for patients with chronic hepatitis and <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy.  Patients— 102 patients with well defined chronic HCV infection and 55  patients with well established <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy were evaluated.  Main outcome measures—The need for HCV testing in patients with <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy, or follow up for heart disease in patients with chronic HCV infection.  Results—None of the patients with chronic HCV infection had clinical or subclinical evidence of <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy from history and laboratory findings. None of the patients with <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy was positive for antibodies to HCV or viraemic on HCV RNA testing.  Conclusions—The study neither confirms the findings of other investigators, nor indicates a pathogenic link between HCV and <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy. For this reason, at least in Greece, testing for HCV in patients with <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy or follow up for heart disease in HCV patients appears unnecessary. Genetic or other factors could be the reason for this discrepancy if previously reported associations between HCV and <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were not coincidental.    Keywords: hepatitis C virus;  idiopathic <b>dilated</b> cardiomyopathy;  polymerase chain reactio...|$|R
5|$|Shark {{eyes are}} similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, {{including}} similar lenses, corneas and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment {{with the help of a}} tissue called tapetum lucidum. This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. Many sharks can contract and <b>dilate</b> their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions. The shark's field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time. A micro-spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind. The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. The study indicates that an object's contrast against the background, rather than colour, may be more important for object detection.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the utilization rate of <b>dilated</b> eye exams among adults with diabetes, and to examine the differences in receiving <b>dilated</b> eye exams by predisposing, need, and enabling factors. Methods: National survey data from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Univariate, weighted bivariate, and logistic regression analyses were performed. Independent variables include demographic information. The dependent variable is the receipt of a <b>dilated</b> eye exam. Results: Some characteristics of individuals who were more likely to receive a <b>dilated</b> eye exam include adults 65 or older, non-Hispanic Blacks, individuals with a health plan, individuals who had a physical exam within the past year, individuals with some type of formal diabetes education, and individuals earning at least $ 50, 000 annually.
