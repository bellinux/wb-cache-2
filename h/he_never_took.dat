5|$|Hirst's leg injury {{kept him}} out of the England side for the first two Test matches against Australia, {{although}} {{he would have been a}} certain selection had he been fit. He was chosen in the squad for the second match but was left out on fitness grounds. However, Hirst was not particularly successful in the three Tests he played that season, hitting a highest score of 40 not out; as a bowler <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>took</b> more than three wickets in an innings. In the series he scored 105 runs at an average of 35.00 and took 6 wickets at 35.33. England won the series 2–0, mainly due to the all-round efforts of Hirst's Yorkshire teammate Stanley Jackson, who headed the batting and bowling averages for the series.|$|E

5|$|Galland, who {{was born}} in Westerholt, Westphalia became a glider pilot in 1929 before he joined Lufthansa. In 1932, he {{graduated}} as a pilot at the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (German Commercial Flyers' School) in Braunschweig before applying to join the Reichswehr of the Weimar Republic later in the year. Galland's application was accepted, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>took</b> up the offer. In February 1934, he was transferred to the Luftwaffe. In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, he volunteered for the Condor Legion and flew ground attack missions in support of the Nationalists under Francisco Franco. After finishing his tour in 1938 Galland was employed in the Air Ministry writing doctrinal and technical manuals about his experiences as a ground-attack pilot. During this period Galland served as an instructor for ground-attack units. During the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, he again flew ground attack missions. In early 1940 Galland managed to persuade his superiors to allow him to become a fighter pilot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tour}} matches, Loxton {{sometimes}} opened the bowling when Bradman sought to rest Lindwall and Miller {{to save their}} energy for the Tests, and he occasionally batted above the middle-order. Loxton was the most economical, but the least incisive of the bowlers, and <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>took</b> more than three wickets in an innings. He played 22 first-class matches and scored 973 runs at 57.23 with three centuries, and took 32 wickets at 21.71. He was eighth in the run-scoring aggregates, but was productive when given an opportunity, ranking fifth in the Australian averages. Loxton was the eighth-leading wicket-taker; all seven frontline bowlers ahead of him took at least 50 wickets. Noted for his energetic and combative approach, Loxton was twice forced out of action for his troubles; he pulled a groin while searching for extra pace with the ball early in the tour, and {{towards the end of}} the season, he hit a ball into his face and broke his nose.|$|E
5|$|Noted for his sound defence, he was {{a patient}} and dogged batsman, in {{contrast}} to the exciting styles of brothers Merv, Ray and Neil. According to Neil, Mick had a weakness against spin bowling. Harvey was a rare bowler during his first-class career. He bowled only five overs in total, delivering one over in five different matches. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>took</b> a wicket. Altogether, he made 1,716 first-class runs (mostly as an opener) in 37 matches at an average of 27.23. Harvey was also a regular choice for the Queensland baseball team during his career. His daughter Pauline Harvey-Short represented Australia at softball, before becoming a sports administrator. She is a fellow of the Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation, and was a founding member of Womensport Queensland in 1993, serving as the chair of the board from 2007 until 2010.

5|$|The {{diminutive}} Hassett was {{an elegant}} middle-order batsman, {{known for his}} wide range of strokes, timing, quick footwork and strong wrists. However, as his career progressed and his seniority in the Australian team increased, he became a more cautious player who often frustrated spectators with sedate scoring, particularly after World War II. Despite this, Hassett remained an aggressive and adventurous strokemaker in matches for Victoria. He had a poker face, and this benefited him as a captain, as even his teammates sometimes {{found it hard to}} discern his mood or thinking. During his 24 Test matches in charge, he won 14 games and suffered defeat only four times, but it was the last of the four losses that blighted his record. Hassett was a very occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, averaging one over per first-class match. He took 18 wickets in 216 matches, and never took more than two in a single innings. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>took</b> a wicket at Test level and bowled less than 19 overs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tour}} matches, Loxton {{sometimes}} opened the bowling when Bradman sought to rest Lindwall and Miller {{in order to}} conserve their energy for the Tests, such as in both innings of the match against Northamptonshire and the second match against Surrey. In his 22 first-class innings, he batted twice at No.4 and opened in one innings, but he was otherwise invariably in the middle-order between No.5 and No.7.N- Loxton was the most economical of those who bowled more than 70 overs, but also the least incisive, taking a wicket every 67.75 balls, and <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>took</b> more than three wickets in an innings, which he managed on three occasions. He played 22 first-class matches and scored 973 runs at 57.23 with three centuries and took 32 wickets at 21.71. Loxton was eighth in the run-scoring aggregates, but was given less opportunities than the other frontline batsmen who scored more heavily; whereas he had 22 innings, they all had at least 26 innings and tended to bat higher in the order. However, Loxton was productive when given a chance, ranking fifth in the averages. Loxton was the eighth-leading wicket-taker; all seven ahead of him took at least 50 wickets.|$|E
