5|$|It did {{not seem}} to Dietz as if there was any {{relationship}} between critical praise and audience enthusiasm for January films. The best-rated, Disney's 2004 animated musical Teacher's Pet, was a commercial failure, as was 2001's The Pledge. Cloverfield, the third entry, was a success, and behind it Freedom Writers <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> its good reviews to do some modest box office in 2007; however How She Move had flopped that same year.|$|E

5|$|Morgan placed marksmen at {{strategic}} positions, {{who then}} picked off virtually every {{officer in the}} advance company. Morgan and his men then charged, unaware that they were headed directly for Burgoyne's main army. While they succeeded in driving back the advance company, Fraser's leading edge arrived {{just in time to}} attack Morgan's left, scattering his men back into the woods. James Wilkinson, who <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> forward to observe the fire, returned to the American camp for reinforcements. As the British company fell back toward the main column, the leading edge of that column opened fire, killing a number of their own men.|$|E
5|$|Leopard Trek {{came to the}} Tour de France with, per season-long expectations, a squad {{centered}} around overall victory. The leader was probably Andy Schleck, entering as runner-up {{in the past two}} Tours de France and three-times running winner of the young rider classification, an award for which he was no longer eligible. Brother Fränk said his goal was to have Andy win the Tour, with Fränk himself also there on the podium with him. The remaining squad members were Cancellara, Gerdemann, Monfort, Fuglsang, Voigt, O'Grady, and Posthuma. Every rider on the squad <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> the Tour de France before, and all but Monfort, Fuglsang, and Posthuma had previously worn the yellow jersey. Pre-race analysis speculated Cancellara could aim for a few days in the race lead before the course shifted to the high mountains.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hood ordered Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee's corps on a march {{around the}} Union left flank, had Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's cavalry march near Sherman's supply line, and had Maj. Gen. Benjamin Cheatham's corps attack the Union front. However, it took longer than {{expected}} for Hardee {{to get his}} men into position, and, during that time, McPherson had correctly deduced a possible threat to his left flank, and sent XVI Corps, his reserve, to help strengthen it. Hardee's men met this other force, and the battle began. Although the initial Confederate attack was repulsed, the Union left flank began to retreat. About this time, McPherson, who <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> to the front to observe the battle, {{was shot and killed}} by Confederate infantry.|$|E

5|$|On 15 May 1889 a {{demonstration}} train comprising two carriages and two locomotives {{ran along the}} newly completed line from Chesham to Rickmansworth, carrying the subscribers who had funded the extension {{and representatives of the}} local authorities and School Boards covering the areas through which the new line ran. (As no Metropolitan Railway train had yet run through to Chesham on the finished line, the train from Chesham to Rickmansworth was drawn by two locomotives belonging to the contractors who had built the line, rather than by MR engines. A third engine ran ahead of the demonstration train to act as a pilot.) A second train carried the directors of the Metropolitan Railway from London to Rickmansworth, collected those passengers who <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> the demonstration train from Chesham to Rickmansworth, and continued to Chesham.|$|E
5|$|In August 2017, NYC Ferry filed {{plans to}} build four ferry docks: one in Soundview, one in Yorkville, one near Stuyvesant Cove, {{and one on the}} Lower East Side. It also sought to add two more piers to its home port at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The Soundview route was revised so that it would stop at East 34th Street instead of at East 62nd Street, which would no longer be built. That month, Brooklyn {{politicians}} called for docks to be built in Coney Island and Canarsie, owing to the new system's popularity. The Astoria route was projected to carry 1,800 daily passengers upon opening, by which point the service had seen 1.4 million riders. Due to even more ridership demand, three extra ferries were ordered in September 2017, by which time over 2 million people <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> the ferry.|$|E
5|$|Karen Lende O'Connor (born February 17, 1958) is an American equestrian who competes {{in three}} day eventing. Although {{she did not}} come from a family of equestrians, her {{interest}} in horses started at an early age, and she received her first horse for her 11th birthday. O'Connor began competing internationally in the late 1970s, and in 1986 began riding for the US national eventing team. Since then, she <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> in five Olympic Games, three World Equestrian Games and two Pan-American Games, winning multiple medals, including a team silver at the 1996 Olympic Games and a team bronze at the 2000 Olympic Games. She has also posted numerous wins and top-10 finishes at other international events. As of 2013, O'Connor is not competing, having suffered fractures to two thoracic vertebrae during a fall at a competition in October 2012.|$|E

5|$|The Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) cavalry <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> {{through a}} gap on the Mediterranean Sea coast, {{created by the}} {{infantry}} during the Battle of Tulkarm, to capture the two Ottoman armies' main lines of communication and supply north of the Judean Hills, while the infantry battles continued. On 20 September, the Desert Mounted Corps captured Afulah, Beisan and Jenin on the Esdrealon Plain. The next day {{the headquarters of the}} Seventh Army at Nablus, and the General Headquarters (GHQ) of the Yilderim Army Group at Nazareth, were both captured, while Haifa was captured two days later. During a subsequent early morning attack on 25 September, a German rearguard was captured during the Battle of Samakh, which ended the Battle of Sharon. During these operations the greater part of one Ottoman army was captured in the Judean Hills and at Jenin. These and other battles fought during the Battle of Megiddo including the Battle of Nablus and Third Transjordan attack, forced the retreating Ottoman Fourth, and remnants of the Seventh and the Eighth Armies, to {{the eastern side of the}} Jordan River. As they withdrew northwards towards Damascus they were pursued by the Desert Mounted Corps.|$|E
5|$|The Tour de France was {{the main}} {{focal point of the}} season for BMC's leader Evans, and perhaps the team itself. He <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> two Grand Tours each of the past two seasons, and in three of the past four, but in 2011 he focused solely on the Tour. He rode a {{different}} race program in preparation for the Tour than he had in previous years, riding fewer races. Among them were the early-season stage races Tirreno–Adriatico and Tour de Romandie, both of which Evans won, and the Critérium du Dauphiné, where he finished on the podium in second overall. The squad named to the race was chosen with the sole goal of helping Evans win the race overall. It consisted of classics specialists Hincapie and Burghardt with the aim of keeping Evans out of trouble in the flatter stages, climbers Moinard and Morabito to help in the mountains, and strong time trialists Bookwalter and Schär (and Hincapie) for the stage 2 team time trial. Hincapie made his 16th consecutive Tour start, to tie the record held by Joop Zoetemelk, having finished each except the very first.|$|E
5|$|The five UH-1 gunships {{immediately}} strafed Viet Cong {{positions with}} 2.75-inch rockets, {{but failed to}} suppress the enemy fire. After South Vietnamese soldiers had disembarked from the helicopters, one CH-21 was too severely damaged {{to get off the}} ground. A second CH-21 was sent to rescue the crew, but it too was immobilized as soon as it touched the ground. One of the Hueys returned to pick up the crews of the two downed CH-21s. As it prepared to land, the main rotor was struck by enemy gunfire. The aircraft flipped over to the right and crashed. Almost simultaneously, a third CH-21 sustained heavy damage and was forced to land on the rice fields a short distance from the first two helicopters. By 10:30, all the South Vietnamese soldiers who had landed on the field were under heavy fire from inside Ap Bac and refused to move. Sergeant Arnold Bowers, who <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> in the first crashed helicopter, raced back and forth to rescue injured American airmen.|$|E
50|$|A {{conditional}} jockey {{is entitled}} to a reduction, known as an allowance, in the weight carried by his horse, dependent {{on the type of}} race, which varies according to the number of races the jockey has won. A jockey who <b>has</b> <b>ridden</b> fewer than twenty winners can claim an allowance of seven pounds, one who <b>has</b> <b>ridden</b> between twenty and forty winners can claim a five pound allowance and one who <b>has</b> <b>ridden</b> less than seventy-five winners can claim a three pound allowance. This allowance cannot be claimed when riding in races restricted to conditional jockeys and in some other instances, for example the Grand National.|$|R

5|$|After the Saur revolution, Taraki was {{appointed}} Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and retained his post as PDPA general secretary. Taraki initially formed a government {{which consisted of}} both Khalqists and Parchamites; Karmal became Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council while Amin became Minister of Foreign Affairs and a Deputy Prime Minister, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar became a Deputy Prime Minister. The two Parchamites Abdul Qadir and Mohammad Rafi became Minister of National Defence and Minister of Public Works respectively. According to Angel Rasanayagam, the appointment of Amin, Karmal and Watanjar as Deputy Prime Ministers led {{to the establishment of}} three cabinets; the Khalqists were answerable to Amin, the Parchamites were answerable to Karmal, and the military officers (who were Parchamites) were answerable to Watanjar. The first conflict between the Khalqists and Parchamites arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to the military officers who participated in the Saur Revolution. Amin, who had previously opposed the appointment of military officers to the PDPA leadership, switched sides; he now supported their elevation. The PDPA Politburo voted in favour of giving membership to the military officers; the victors (the Khalqists) portrayed the Parchamites as opportunists, implying that the Parchamites <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> the revolutionary wave, but not actually participated in the revolution. To make matters worse for the Parchamites, the term Parcham was, according to Taraki, a word synonymous with factionalism.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, Salzgeber {{announced}} {{that she would be}} selling one of her top-level horses, Wakana, to a student, leaving Herzruf's Erbe as her only horse prepared to compete at the international level. Later that month, Salzgeber removed herself from consideration for competition at the 2011 CHIO Aachen and European Dressage Championships. She {{announced that}} she had decided to take a break from competition and focus more on training and her personal life. In 2012, she {{announced that she}} would not be seeking a spot on the German team for the 2012 Summer Olympics, saying that her training duties had not given her time to properly prepare Herzruf's Erbe. She <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> the horse at competitions during the 2011-2012 winter, and stated that she planned to compete at additional competitions during the winter of 2012-2013. However, in late 2012, the horse was put into a one-year rest period to help him recover from the injuries that had troubled him throughout his career. In October 2013, Salzgeber brought Herzruf's Erbe back into competition, winning a national show in Germany. The pair was successful at subsequent competitions, and in December 2013, it was announced that they had been returned to the German equestrian squad's A-team.|$|E
5|$|On May 8, 2013, Universal Orlando {{announced}} {{the expansion of}} Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Diagon Alley, along with the Hogwarts Express attraction, to be located on the former site of the Jaws attraction. By the end of August 2013, all six passenger cars and both tenders had been spotted in the backstage area, waiting to be assembled on the track. The first of the two trains was installed on the track on October 24, 2013. By the beginning of December 2013, the second train had {{been placed on the}} track. In January, the resort previewed the interior of the Hogwarts Express through a live cast. On December 2, 2013, Orlando Attractions Magazine, an amusement park website, spotted one of the trains being tested for the first time. In mid-March 2014, Universal Orlando Resort released further information about the ride, including concept animations. On June 24, 2014, the resort announced that the Diagon Alley expansion, including the Hogwarts Express, would officially open to the public on July 8, 2014. A week later, Universal Orlando soft-opened the Hogwarts Express, without any announcement. Within a month of the Hogwarts Express' opening, one million riders <b>had</b> <b>ridden</b> the attraction. It had taken approximately {{two and a half years}} to develop.|$|E
