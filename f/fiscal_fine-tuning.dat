It is argued that the effectiveness of fiscal policy as a short run stabilizer {{does not depend on}} the long run multipliers of (balanced budget) fiscal policies. To the extent that activity can be affected by aggregate demand in the short run, there is a case for a fiscal stabilization policy in terms of temporary variations in taxes or public consumption contingent {{on the state of the}} economy. The effectiveness of fiscal policy is supported by empirical evidence. However, an appropriate policy intervention depends both on the nature of the shock and the structure of the economy. There are thus fundamental information problems in pursuing discretionary fiscal policies on top of political economy concerns, and <b>fiscal</b> <b>fine-tuning</b> is not to be recommended. Automatic stabilizers do not to the same extent suffer from these problems, but their strength is not by design but the net result of other policy considerations. Hence, there is a need to consider the structure and size of automatic stabilizers. shocks, insurance, adjustment failures, rules, discretion and fiscal policy...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} postwar years, during {{the heyday of}} <b>fiscal</b> <b>fine-tuning,</b> {{monetary}} policy was not widely considered a particularly interesting or important topic. The predominant view was that the main function of monetary policy was to “stimulate ” debt-financed purchases by keeping interest rates low. Inflation was first considered a useful lubricant to be traded for lower unemployment, and inflation could be reduced only by tolerating high unemployment. In the late sixties and early seventies, when the shrinking dollar proved less popular than expected, inflation was routinely described by a thermal metaphor (“overheating”), and regarded as an endemic problem to be endlessly “fought ” by using fiscal policy (a surtax) and incomes policy (wage-price controls), but never monetary policy. In reality, the steadily accelerating inflation from 1965 to 1970 was not due to massive “guns and butter ” budget deficits, as an historical hoax maintains, but to careless monetary policy. The deficit in 1967 was no higher {{than it was in}} 1998, as a share of GDP, and inflation did not reach 4 percent until after the surtax of mid- 1968 when money growth briefly accelerated. As Karl Brunner and Alan Meltzer (1997 : 69) later observed, “The reason for increasing money growth, in Keynesian analysis, was to get a proper mix of monetary and fiscal policy. ” The Tobin-Mundell Debate When the “proper mix ” of higher tax rates and faster money growth produced only stagflation, mainstream macroeconomics grudgingly took some interest in money by patching together a Keynesianneoclassical synthesis. James Tobin called this the “funnel ” theory: That is, the government could pour either fiscal or monetary stimulu...|$|E
