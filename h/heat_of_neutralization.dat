40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{the spray}} polymerization of sodium acrylate were investigated. The technique {{in which the}} heat of polymerization was used for solvent removal showed better energy efficiency than the solution or emulsion polymerization methods for preparing sodium polyacrylate. The monomer solution was injected into the nozzle of the spray machine via a venturi effect to siphon up the solution. Two siphon tubes feeding through two control valves into a mixing chamber before the spray operation resulted in separate feeds of a sodium hydroxide solution and a mixture of acrylic acid, water, and a catalyst. These two feeds generated the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>neutralization</b> of sodium acrylate. This heat raised {{the temperature of the}} monomer solution to the reaction temperature, thereby initiating the exothermic polymerization reaction. Theoretical calculations of these energy sources were compared with the energy required to give a dry product. The results revealed that the energy cost for spray polymerization was 4783. 5 kJ kg- 1, whereas the energy cost was 7830. 4 kJ kg- 1 for the conventional system. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> and <b>neutralization</b> {{treatments}} on solubility, water vapour permeability and antimicrobial activity of chitosan (Ch) and chitosan/chitooligosaccharide (ChO) -based films. ChO films showed stronger antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia liquefaciens and Lactobacillus plantarum than Ch films, indicating that this effect is attributed {{to the presence of}} chitooligosaccharides (COS) in the films. Heat and neutralization treatments decreased significantly the solubility of chitosan films and gave rise to a sharp loss in their antimicrobial activity. The incorporation of COS in chitosan films increased the inhibitory effect against the studied microorganisms without affecting significantly the water vapour permeability of the films. Thus, it is possible to get a more insoluble chitosan film with high antimicrobial activity by means of incorporation of COS combined with heat or neutralization treatments.

40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) neutralization occurs when specific antibodies, mainly those {{directed against the}} envelope glycoproteins, inhibit infection, most frequently by preventing the entry of the virus into target cells. However, the precise mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>neutralization</b> remain unclear. Previous studies, mostly with cell lines, have produced conflicting results involving either the inhibition of virus attachment or interference with postbinding events. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>neutralization</b> by immune sera and compared the inhibition of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) infection by HIV- 1 primary isolates (PI) with the inhibition of T-cell line infection by T-cell line-adapted (TCLA) strains. We followed the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>neutralization</b> to determine at which step of the viral cycle the antibodies act. We found that <b>neutralization</b> <b>of</b> the TCLA strain HIV- 1 MN/MT- 4 required an interaction between antibodies and cell-free virions before the addition of MT- 4 cells, whereas PI were neutralized even after adsorption onto PBMC. In addition, the dose-dependent inhibition of HIV- 1 MN binding to MT- 4 cells was strongly correlated with serum-induced neutralization. In contrast, neutralizing sera did not reduce the adhesion of PI to PBMC. Postbinding inhibition was also detected for HIV- 1 MN produced by and infecting PBMC, demonstrating that the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>neutralization</b> depends on the target cell used in the assay. Finally, we considered whether the different mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>neutralization</b> may reflect the recognition of qualitatively different epitopes on the surface of PI and HIV- 1 MN or whether they reflect differences in virus attachment to PBMC and MT- 4 cells...|$|R
