25|$|Another {{method of}} manual {{calibration}} requires {{a pair of}} high-quality headphones patched into the input signal before any processing (such as the pre-fade-listen of the test program <b>input</b> <b>channel</b> of the mixing console, or the headphone output of the CD player or tape deck). One can then use this direct signal as a near-perfect reference with which to find any differences in frequency response. This method may not be perfect, {{but it can be}} very helpful with limited resources or time, such as using pre-show music to correct for the changes in response caused by the arrival of a crowd. Because this is still a very subjective method of calibration, and because the human ear is so dynamic in its own response, the program material used for testing should be as similar as possible to that for which the system is being used.|$|E

2500|$|Dan Dugan {{showed his}} first [...] "Adaptive Threshold Automatic Microphone Mixing System" [...] in 1974 at the 49th Audio Engineering Society (AES) meeting in New York, and {{was granted a}} patent for a control {{apparatus}} for sound reinforcement systems which sensed ambient sound level in the environment of a theater to control each microphone's individual level. In 1976, Dugan was granted a patent for an automatic microphone mixing process whereby the total gain of the system remains constant. He began manufacturing his first automixer system, the Model A, based on his two patents. Dugan built 60 units, with the first, hand-assembled one taken to Bell Labs to be installed in their conference room for Harvey Fletcher. The algorithm was simple and effective: Each individual <b>input</b> <b>channel</b> is attenuated by an amount, in dB, equal to the difference, in dB, between that channel’s level and {{the sum of all}} channel levels. Dugan licensed the system to Altec who released several automixer models including the 1674A, -B and -C series and the 1684A, all focusing on speech applications. (The 1684A became an Electrovoice product and is currently administered by their Commercial division.) The earliest Altec product implementation was regarded as inferior within the commercial audio contractor industry, and other manufacturers began to design their own automixer products.|$|E
2500|$|The mix {{of all the}} {{different}} signals and channels (e.g., mics for lead vocals, backup vocals, saxophone and drum kit and signals for bass, guitar, keyboards, or mics {{in front of the}} bass, guitar and keyboard speaker cabinets) to the stereo master faders on the console. Mixing consoles also have additional [...] "sends", also referred to as auxes or aux sends (an abbreviation for [...] "auxiliary send"), on each <b>input</b> <b>channel</b> so that a different mix can be created and sent elsewhere for another purpose. One usage for aux sends is to create a mix of the vocal and instrument signals for the monitor mix (this is what the onstage singers and musicians hear from their monitor speakers or in-ear monitors). Another use of an aux send is to select varying amounts of certain channels (via the aux send knobs on each channel), and then route these signals to an effects processor. A common example of the second use of aux sends is to send all of the vocal signals from a rock band through a reverb effect. While reverb is usually added to vocals in the main mix, it is not usually added to electric bass and other rhythm section instruments.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{the audio}} {{engineer}} has {{made all the}} adjustments to a signal (e.g., the lead vocalist's singing through a microphone), such as equalization, adding effects, and so on, the signal is then electronically routed to {{a section of the}} mixing console known as [...] "bus", also called a [...] "mix group", [...] "subgroup" [...] or simply [...] "group". A group of signals may be routed through an additional bus before being sent to the main bus to allow the engineer to control the levels of several related signals at once. [...] For example, all of the different microphones for a drum set might be sent to their own bus so that the volume of the entire drum set sound can be controlled with a single fader or a pair of faders, rather than the audio engineer having to adjust all of the different drums and cymbals' mic volumes. A bus can often be processed just like an individual <b>input</b> <b>channel,</b> allowing the engineer to process a whole group of signals at once. Once again using the drum kit example, the use of bus-processing can enable the sound engineer to run all of the drum kit through an audio compressor effect to reduce unwanted signal peaks, rather than having to route all of the 10 or more mic signals on the drum kit individually.|$|E

40|$|Cavity {{combiners}} {{have been}} put forward for high power combining due to their advantages of larger combining ability, variable <b>input</b> <b>channels</b> and less power loss. For a high power cavity combiner, {{it is better to}} keep the power loss ratio in a reasonable range, because large power loss would lead to strict requirements on the cooling system. A combiner with variable <b>input</b> <b>channels</b> is convenient for outputting different power levels according to practical demands. In this paper, a method for designing a variable-channel high-power cavity combiner is proposed, based on the relation between input and output coupling coefficients obtained by analyzing the equivalent circuit of the cavity combiner. This method can put the designed cavity combiner in a matching state and keep its power loss rate in a reasonable range as the number of <b>input</b> <b>channels</b> changes. As an example, a cavity combiner with 500 MHz and variable <b>input</b> <b>channels</b> from 16 to 64 is designed, and the simulation results show that our proposed method is feasible.
