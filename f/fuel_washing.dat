40|$|We {{compared}} post-harvest {{processing of}} {{two species of}} Ulva (chlorophyta) using 36 washing time-by-temperature combinations. We quantified the yield of crystallized salt after evaporation of the washing water as a target product and characterized the composition of salts and processed biomass, with the additional aim of improving {{the composition of the}} processed biomass for production of fertilizer, feed or <b>fuel.</b> <b>Washing</b> of biomass of Ulva ohnoi and Ulva tepida effectively reduced its mineral content with concomitant production of crystalline salts with Na:K ratios of 1. 1 - 2. 2 and a maximum of 19 % soluble fiber (ulvan). The maximum yield of salt was 29 % of the biomass for U. ohnoi and 36 % for U. tepida. Salts from both species have potential for human health applications and functional foods. Washing increased the energy content of the biomass from both species by 20 - 50 % to a maximum of 18 MJ kg- 1 and protein contents by 11 - 24 % to a maximum of 27. 4 %. The production of seaweed salt is therefore a novel first step in a cascading biorefinery model for the utilization of macroalgal biomass which simultaneously improves the quality of the processed biomass for production of fertilizer, feed or fuel. © 2016 Elsevier B.

40|$|Raw biomass washing {{prior to}} {{pyrolysis}} treatment has been employed {{to mitigate the}} ash-related problems encountered during resultant biochar combustion. However, wide-spread application {{of this approach is}} limited by high energy consumption and low washing efficiency. In the present study, the biochar washing instead of raw biomass washing was attempted to overcome aforementioned problems, and <b>fuel</b> qualities of <b>washed</b> biochars were investigated for the first time. The results showed that major ash forming metals can be efficiently removed by all tested washing agents (de-ionized water (DW), acetic acid (AA) and citric acid (CA)), especially for acid washing agents AA and CA. As a consequence, the ash content of the biochars decreased, and the slagging and fouling issues were dramatically mitigated. Due to metal removal, the washed biochars exhibited improved combustion properties, especially for the biochars derived from agricultural biomass. In addition, noticeable decreases in nitrogen and sulfur contents were observed following washing treatment, suggesting the additional benefit of reducing emissions of nitrogen and sulfur pollutants during washed biochar combustion. Compared to raw biomass washing prior to pyrolysis, the significantly increased <b>washing</b> efficiency and <b>fuel</b> quality and decreased hydrophilicity of the biochars indicate that pyrolysis combined with subsequent biochar washing is more suitable to produce solid fuel biochars with high fuel quality from different source of waste biomass.

Preliminary co-fire test results indicate that the blending of lignin and bio-solids with the Colbert coal blend generally reduces NO{sub x} emissions, increases the reactivity of the coal, and increases the ash deposition rate on superheater surfaces. Deposits produced from the fuel blends, however, are more friable and hence easier to remove from tube surfaces relative to those produced from the baseline Colbert coal blend.

40|$|Combustible biomass dusts {{are formed}} at various {{handling}} stages, and accumulations of these dusts can occur on hot surfaces of electrical and mechanical devices and can pose fire risks. This study evaluates the ignition characteristics of dust from {{two types of}} biomass commonly used in the U. K. power stations: herbaceous miscanthus and woody pine. The ignition risks of the individual biomass and their blends in two different weight ratios, 90 wt % pine to 10 wt % miscanthus and 50 wt % pine to 50 wt % miscanthus, were investigated. Biomass–biomass blends represent the power plant scenario where a number of biomass are fired under daily operation, and thus, dust sedimentation could consist of material blends. The influence of washing pretreatment (particularly to remove catalytic potassium) on the ignition behavior of these dusts was investigated. Fuel characterization via proximate and ultimate analyses was performed on all fuels and combustion characteristics via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The risk of self-ignition propensity of both untreated and washed biomass was ranked graphically using the activation energy (Ea) for combustion and the temperature of maximum weight loss (TMWL) determined from the derivative TGA (DTG) curve. It {{was found that the}} TMWL and Ea of washed biomass were higher than those of the untreated biomass, implying a lower self-ignition risk. Similar analyses were performed on untreated and washed blends, and comparable results were observed. The ignition characteristics were studied following the British Standard test methods for determining the minimum ignition temperature of a 5 mm dust layer on a heated surface. It was found that the washed individual biomass and their blends revealed slightly higher dust ignition temperatures than their respective untreated counterparts, a 20 and 10 °C difference for individual biomass and blends, respectively. The effect of washing on the ignition delay time was more obvious for pine than for miscanthus, but the time difference between the untreated and washed biomass never exceeded 4 min for all biomass and blends. The biomass pretreatment method of washing did change the combustion and self-ignition characteristics of biomass dust, and there was evidence of potassium being leached from the <b>fuels</b> upon <b>washing</b> (particularly miscanthus). This is considered the main reason for the increase in the minimum ignition temperature.

40|$|Environmental {{preservation}} concerns, {{coupled with}} those of energy supply security, are leading to a push for alternative fuels that are both green and sustainable. Therefore, biomass, which is a renewable low carbon energy source, is being increasingly utilized worldwide. The use of biomass in thermochemical conversion is not without problems, {{some of which are}} related to the inherent alkali metal content present in these types of fuels. The work conducted for this thesis mainly deals with topics related to thermal degradation kinetics of biomass and the influence of alkali metals on these kinetics, as well as their effects on the thermal behaviour of the fuel. Torrefaction is also studied with respect to kinetics studies, and the effects of mineral content. Thermal degradation was studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and kinetic models were evaluated to address two questions; first, what method of data analysis is appropriate for extracting reliable kinetic data from TGA experiments? Second, what kinetics are most suitable for high heating rate situations such as those present in pulverized fuel power stations? It was found that for low heating rate experiments (10 Klmin), the global first-order reaction kinetic models that tend to yield low activation energies (E), such as the reaction rate constant method, work well. High E kinetics can also work well at low heating rate, but only if the reaction is assumed to be due to the sum of a number of individual steps. For example, those derived when assuming the biochemical components degrade independently, or using the functional group approach. For higher heating rates (> 103 Kls) high E kinetics predict conversion well, and this can be rationalized since primary cracking reactions will dominate under these conditions. However, at heating rates of 105 Kls and temperatures of 1500 QC (i. e., flame conditions), a compensation on the rates is seen and the choice of rate parameters is less critical. Two sets of kinetic data, E = 178. 7 kJ/mol, A = 2. 2 x 1013 S- 1 and E = 48. 7 kJ/mol, A = 6. 84 x 103 S-I, both predict conversions in keeping With the available experimental data. The effects of alkali metals (K, Na, Cs) on thermal degradation kinetics of SRC willow in pyrolysis, combustion were studied using TGA, and single particle burning in a methane-air flame. The results revealed that all three metals had a strong and similar catalytic effect on pyrolysis and combustion. Combustion under flame conditions also showed a stark contrast between the strongly catalyzed degradation of samples in the presence of alkali metals, and the uncatalysed degradation of mineral-free samples. As with the low heating rate results, at flame conditions, the metal-impregnated samples behaved similarly to each other, implying that a similar thermal degradation. mechanism is followed when woody biomass contains any of the alkali metals. A mathematical expression directly linking the inherent potassium and sodium content of SRC willow to its thermal degradation kinetics was developed through modifying a Langmuir-Hinshelwood relation and applying it to pyrolysis data. This relation yields a maximum reaction rate and a metal saturation constant {{that can be used to}} predict a reaction rate of willow based on the pyrolysis temperature and the concentration of either of the metals in the biomass sample. I. e. the maximum reaction rate constant of 3. 26 x 10 - 3 (S-I) and the potassium saturation constant of 0. 56 wt% can be used to derive the pyrolysis reaction rate of any willow sample with a known potassium concentration. Similarly, a maximum reaction rate of 3. 27 x 10 - 3 (S-I) and a sodium saturation constant of 0. 36 wt% can be used to derive a reaction rate for any willow sample with a known sodium concentration. Ab initio (Density Functional Theory method) modelling was employed to explore the chemical mechanisms involved [...] Cellobiose was used as a model for cellulose. The cellobiose structure was first optimized at the HF level, and then at the B 3 L YP DFT level with a 6 - 31 G(d) basis set and the structure frequency was checked to ensure the system was at ground state. The models showed that that both metal ions form multiple interactions with the hydroxyl and ether bonds in the cellulose structure. Structures with metal chelated at the C 6 position in the ring have interactions with four oxygen atoms, while metals at the C 2 position have interactions with only two oxygen atoms, although inter-molecular chelation between cellulose chains has not been considered. Structures are more stable when potassium or sodium can coordinate to more oxygen groups. Nevertheless, in all the structures investigated, chelation of potassium or sodium causes a change in the conformation of the rings (twisting) which may activate the structure towards cracking. The final area of investigation in this thesis is in torrefaction, a mild pyrolysis process. Torrefied biomass has many advantages over untreated biomass, but its ashcharacteristics remain similar to the parent biomass. In this thesis, inherent metals were removed prior to torrefaction. Impact on ash behaviour of this resultant fuel and the torrefaction process itself are reported. More specifically, the work examined the effects of altered mineral content (through a chemical fractionation procedure involving successive washings of the fuel in water, ammonium acetate, and hydrochloric acid), on the torrefaction, of four biomass fuels (SRC willow, Miscanthus, eucalyptus, and wheat straw), as well as on the pyrolysis and the ash behaviour of the torrefied material. Washing prior to torrefaction significantly reduced the ash content of the fuels, and ameliorated the ash fusion temperatures. The pyrolysis reaction rates of the HCI treated and torrefied fuels were found to be the highest, presumably due to the changes in the biomass structure caused by the acid. The results suggest that water washing is the most useful pre-treatment for the preparation of torrefied <b>fuels.</b> <b>Washing</b> with ammonium acetate or HCI would not be feasible because of the small advantage gained, the high costs induced, and the environmental implications. The significance of the impact of these changes in composition and reaction rates depends on the end application, power station or domestic heating. In the case of power station applications, washing with water reduces the ash content, and improves the ash melting behaviour of the remaining ash, which may be advantageous particularly in the case of straw; the slight increase in N would not be significant because of the normal NOx reduction methods used in power stations. In domestic applications the reduction of ash is not so important but the increase in N may be a significant disadvantage. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Mosquitoes pose {{a serious}} threat to the economy, health status, and {{biosecurity}} of countries around the world. Mosquitoes kill an average of 700, 000 people per year. The global expansion of air, sea, and land transport networks has greatly enhanced the spread of mosquitoes internationally. In the Pacific, the number of mosquito-borne diseases occurring has been on the rise in recent years, possibly as a result of human-mediated dispersal of larvae and adult mosquitoes. The Kingdom of Tonga has had numerous outbreaks of dengue fever and chikungunya virus in recent years. Previous research has catalogued species occurrences and distributions throughout Tonga. However, it is unknown whether new species have arrived in Tonga, and if distribution of previously found species has changed since the last comprehensive survey in 2006. Present research aims to update the literature by conducting a mosquito survey at 84 sites across the four islands of Tongatapu, Pangaimotu, ‘Oneata, and ‘Eua to record the distribution and occurrence of mosquito larvae. Nine mosquito species were collected: Aedes aegypti Linnaeus, A. albopictus Skuse, A. tongae Edwards, A. horrescens Edwards, A. vexans nocturnus Theobold, Culex annulirostris Skuse, C. albinervis Edwards, C. quinquefasciatus Say and C. sitiens Wiedemann. The collection of A. albopictus is the second time that this species has been recorded in Tonga. Moreover, the spatial extent of this species throughout Tonga was far greater than previously recorded. A major outcome of this survey has been the creation of an identification key for the mosquito larvae species of Tonga. This key should increase the accuracy of positive mosquito larvae identifications in Tonga. Mosquitoes were more frequently collected in artificial (e. g., used car tyres, fuel drums, containers) than natural (e. g., pools, ponds, tree holes) habitats. Car tyres, water containers, <b>fuel</b> drums, fridges, <b>washing</b> machines, and ponds were the most common habitats in which mosquito larvae were found. Aedes aegypti, A. albopictus, and C. quinquefasciatus were the three most common mosquito species collected, whereas A. tongae, A. horrescens, A. vexans nocturnus, C. annulirostris, C. sitiens, and C. albinervis were less frequently found. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated that habitat volume had a significant positive effect on the presence of A. albopictus and A. tongae, whereas conductivity had a significant positive effect on the presence of C. annulirostris. Additionally, the volume by temperature interaction {{was a significant predictor of}} species presence for A. aegypti, A. albopictus, and C. annulirostris (as habitat volume increases, the effect of temperature went from neutral to negative). This suggests that larger, cooler habitats favour colonisation by these species. The number of artificial habitats (particularly used car tyres) present may have significantly increased since previous studies. Management should therefore focus on implementing community-run mosquito projects aimed at reducing the number of artificial habitats capable of being colonised by mosquito larvae. Covering, tipping out water, and infilling these habitats with soil to prevent mosquito oviposition is a pragmatic and straightforward mosquito control solution. This should immensely reduce the abundance of mosquitoes and may prevent disease outbreak in Tonga...|$|R

Among renewable sources, biomass materials hold a special position because they can, in the short term, substitute or integrate fossil fuels in all of their applications applying comparatively few changes to the existing equipment. Biomass wastes, from agriculture or other processes, are convenient in more respects since their use would not only substitute fossil fuels but it would also valorize waste streams. These materials, however, present several issues that are highly delaying their deployment on a large scale. Three of the most important problems are dealt with in this thesis: the heterogeneous nature of the materials, high amount of ash forming matter containing troublesome compounds such as K, Cl and P, and finally, high content of nitrogen. First of all, many biomass residues contain a higher amount of nitrogen compared with woody biomass or even coal. This high content of fuel [...] N could directly translate into high NOx emissions in combustion conditions or into a high content of nitrogen containing gases such as NH 3 and HCN in the syngas from gasification. Primary measures, such as air staging, can be applied directly in the reactor in order to promote the reduction of NOx and NOx [...] precursors to molecular nitrogen. However, in order to apply such measures and optimize the syngas composition or minimize emissions without relying on expensive catalysts, a detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of fuel [...] N conversion is required. This thesis has as its main purpose to study the release of volatile nitrogen compounds under pyrolysis conditions and the analysis of the emissions of NO under combustion conditions from high [...] N fuels. Secondly, as explained in the first two chapters of this dissertation, the definition of biomass is very broad and it includes materials with extremely different composition and characteristics. Additionally, the interest in exploiting some of these materials, such as manures, for energy conversion has never been high enough to trigger substantial research. As a consequence, fundamental data such as reactivity and products distribution are almost completely lacking for many biowastes. One of the purposes of this thesis is, therefore, to gather extensive fundamental data for potential fuels, which have not yet fully characterized. Finally, some elements such as K, Cl, P and S, contained in biomass materials, are known to cause several problems during boiler operation. At high temperatures alkali silicates with melting temperatures lower than the operating one are formed; these partly molten particles can then create issues like slagging, fouling, loss of fluidization and, when Cl is present, corrosion of the boiler surfaces. Together with specific research on boiler materials and optimization of operating conditions, possible pre [...] treatments used to remove these compounds from the fuel before entering the reactor could greatly enhance the overall process. In this thesis, the effects of a water [...] leaching pre [...] treatment on the fuels' reactivity and product yields during pyrolysis are explored. After a general introduction, Chapter 2 has the purpose of providing the reader with an overview of definitions and concepts that are used {{in the rest of the}} dissertation. The main components of biomass are listed as well as their behavior under thermal conversion conditions. A special focus is given to nitrogen structures, such as proteins and heterocyclic compounds, and the mechanisms of their decomposition under pyrolysis conditions as reported in available literature studies. Finally, an overview of NOx formation mechanisms is given. The materials studied in this work and the setups used are introduced in Chapter 3. The materials are divided into two main categories: agricultural residues, including wheat straw, olive residues and peach stones, and biomass waste streams, including dry distiller's grains, palm kernel cake and chicken manure. All these materials have a high nitrogen content and are not yet fully exploited because of the issues mentioned above. Several different small [...] scale setups have been used in this work depending on the conditions that needed to be study. Chapter 4, then, presents the results of measurements performed on agricultural residues under slow pyrolysis conditions. The measurements were carried out using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) connected with a Fourier Transform InfraRed spectrometer (FTIR). All the fuels presented peaks of reactivity at approximately 330 - 360 °C associated with the decomposition of cellulose. A shoulder was also found at lower temperatures, approximately 290 - 310 °C, and was associated with the pyrolysis of hemicellulose. The main volatile species released resulted to be CO 2 for all the fuels followed by CO and methane. No nitrogen compounds were detected because of too little concentrations in the pyrolysis gases which could not be accurately detected by the FTIR. The kinetic parameters for the pyrolysis reactions were found using a Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM). This analysis revealed a common reaction path for the main structures (cellulose and hemicellulose) among the various fuels. The water [...] leaching pre [...] treatment seemed very effective in removing the troublesome inorganic elements from these fuels. The removed elements, furthermore, had a catalytic effect on the pyrolysis of the fuels; once removed, the samples reacted at higher temperatures and with less reaction paths. Only the peach stones sample, which already had a very low ash content, did not seem to be affected by the treatment. Chapter 5 reports the results of a similar analysis to the previous one, that was performed on different biomass residues: dry distiller's grains with solubles (DDGS) and chicken manure. Also these fuels were found to react with two main peaks at about 280 °C and 330 °C. Accordingly, also the kinetic parameters resulted very similar to the ones of the agricultural residues, clearly indicating a similar decomposition path for common structures. For DDGS and chicken manure, an additional component was found to react at approximately 400 - 430 °C and it was assigned to proteinic structures decomposing. The main volatile nitrogen compounds were found to be NH 3 and HCN for DDGS with traces of HNCO. The manure released more of its fuel [...] bound nitrogen in volatile form and the main compound was found to be HNCO, followed by HCN and ammonia. The water leaching pre [...] treatment, similarly to what was found for the peach stones sample, did not seem to affect substantially the reactivity of the fuels nor their ash composition. The share of fuel [...] N released as light volatiles, however, increased for the <b>washed</b> <b>fuels.</b> Building up on the results of the previous two chapters, Chapter 6 describes the results of fast pyrolysis measurements of DDGS and palm kernel cake. These tests were carried out on a heated foil reactor integrated with an FTIR using much higher heating rates, closer to industrial applications. A numerical model of the reactor has been developed in order to have a better insight into the temperature and velocity profiles in the reactor chamber. The simulations, in combination with non [...] contact temperature measurements, have indicated a significant difference between the expected foil temperature and the actual one. This has been corrected in the experimental campaign, granting a more precise knowledge of the actual conditions. The fast pyrolysis measurements have shown an increased weight loss compared to slow heating rates. CO 2 resulted to be still the main light volatile at temperatures below 900 °C while CO became more relevant at high temperatures due to tar cracking in the hot area around the foil. Compared to low heating rates measurements of the DDGS sample, HCN was the main volatile nitrogen compound while the yield of NH 3 was much lower. The palm kernel cake sample only released detectable yields of HCN, nor ammonia nor HNCO were found. Even at high temperatures, approximately 10 % of the initial N was retained in the char of DDGS. The water leaching pre [...] treatment again did not affect the weight loss behaviour neither the main gaseous product distribution but the yields of light volatile nitrogen compounds increased for the washed samples. After the pyrolysis behaviour of different nitrogen compounds has been analyzed, Chapter 7 presents the results of measurements under combustion conditions for several biomass residues. It is shown that the devolatilization profiles for carbon to CO + CO 2 and fuel [...] N to NO are very similar among very different fuels, implying that a common approach could be taken for their modeling and it could very well be acceptable as a first approximation. Moreover, the conversion of fuel [...] N to NO appeared to follow a decaying trend where the fuels with lower initial N content presented a higher conversion than fuels with higher nitrogen content. Fuels with high nitrogen content, in fact, are likely to release a larger amount of it in volatile form with a consequent larger amount of NHi radicals available for thermal De [...] NOx reactions. Finally, the release of carbon as CO 2 and nitrogen as NO during devolatilization was found to be proportional for temperatures around 800 °C while at 1000 °C almost all of the NO was released during devolatilization. Finally, in Chapter 8 the main conclusions of the work described in thesis are drawn and recommendations for future research are expressed.
