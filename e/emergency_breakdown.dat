40|$|The {{dispatch}} {{of trucks}} and shovel {{has always been}} an important component in the success of open pit mine operations. Dispatch systems have evolved from manual to today automatic with almost no human intervention. Although dispatching systems available today are “pseudo real time ” and efficient, the optimal dispatching is realized over subsets of the fleet when dealing with large fleets. This approach certainly raises the question of optimality. In fact decomposing the fleet into sub-fleets and then optimizing each one does not guarantee optimality for the entire fleet. Moreover the system is not flexible to changes in the operation environment such as <b>emergency</b> <b>breakdowns</b> and anticipated down times. The swarm intelligence approach introduced in this paper is a new technique that uses the behaviour of social insects to model and simulate a dispatching system. Social insects are flexible in that they respond to any change in their environment, particularly those that threaten their survival. This flexibility occurs in response to chemical or physical cues produced in the environment either by the insects themselves or by external influences. Using analogies to these chemical and physical cues, a flexible dispatching system can be developed that can efficiently dispatch trucks of the entire fleet and that can adapt to changes in the truck/shovel/maintenance environment. Simulations of dispatching systems based on those concepts are presented and described...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Fatigue is a {{state of}} {{impairment}} that can include physical and/or mental elements, associated with lower alertness and reduced performance. Fatigue can be defined as a state of impairment that can include physical and/or mental elements, associated with lower alertness and reduced performance. Fatigue can lead to incidents because employees/workers are not alert. Shortly when person with increase in fatigue level, then physical or mental activity becomes more difficult to perform. Sign of the fatigue include tiredness even after sleep, psychological disturbances, loss of energy & inability to concentrate. Basically fatigue is categorized in two part work related fatigue & non work related fatigue. Work related fatigue is similar for different individuals performing the same task. Whereas non-work related fatigue are considerably between individual and is best managed at an individual level. There are several causes of work-related fatigue such as aspect of the task being undertaken (e. g. greater workload within standard shift) two many consecutive night shifts, unplanned work, overtime, <b>emergencies,</b> <b>breakdowns</b> & call-outs, feature of working environment (e. g. noise or temperature extremes). So the fatigue becomes a problem and important issue in the process industry. When employees/workers are fatigued {{they are more likely to}} exercise poor judgment & slow reaction. This can increase risks on site because fatigued employees are less able to respond effectively to changing circumstances. So the aim of this paper is 1.

In order to card this research direction, this paper reviews it given different disturbances including <b>emergency</b> orders, machine <b>breakdown,</b> tardiness of job, and engineering changes. Moreover, currently common advantages and disadvantages of dynamic scheduling algorithm are laid stress on. Accordingly, characteristics and future research direction of it are presented. For different disturbances, corresponding algorithm solutions are categorized and reviewed.

30|$|Traffic {{congestion}} affects {{freight transport}} operations as {{it increases the}} average travel time and the transit time variability [11, 12]. Prior research focused {{on one of these}} aspects or studied the consequences of both effects by explicitly differentiating between ‘recurring daily traffic delay’ or ‘regular congestion’ and ‘non-recurring traffic delay’ or ‘major congestion incidents.’ Regular congestion occurs as vehicle speeds are reduced due to a high volume/capacity ratio on specific corridors at specific times. Non-recurring traffic delays occur when there are incidents such as collisions, medical <b>emergencies,</b> and vehicle <b>breakdowns</b> [12, 13]. The focus of this study is on regular congestion, i.e., the typical road-, weekday-, and time of day-specific exposure of the transport operations throughout the distribution network to traffic congestion. McKinnon et al. [14] present results from a survey intended {{to assess the impact of}} congestion-related unreliability on logistics activities across many industry sectors. Among others, they performed traffic data analyses that confirmed the view expressed by the logistics managers surveyed that most congestion is regular and predictable. Falcocchio and Levinson [13] report research results indicating that recurring bottlenecks are the most common cause of recurring traffic delays, besides poor traffic signal timing.|$|R
40|$|Zimbabweâ€™s {{economic}} meltdown decade of 2000 - 2009 virtually paralyzed all socio-economic sectors including services delivery in urban areas. Economic sanctions {{imposed by the}} West, coupled with the climate change threat have only exacerbated the urban services delivery nightmare, especially the water delivery system. Notwithstanding, not all hope is lost. This study sought to assess the urban domestic water supply challenges and opportunities in Gweruâ€™s Mtapa (or Mutapa) suburb using questionnaires, interviews and direct observations. Questionnaires were self-administered to 56 systematically selected residents of Mtapa Sections 5 and 6, while {{interviews were conducted with}} 3 purposively sampled key respondents who included Gweru Residents Association Organizing Secretary, Councillor for ward 6 which covers Mtapa suburb, and Chief Water Technician responsible for water supply. Results confirm that Mtapa suburb faces serious water supply challenges. Over 50 % of the respondents confirmed that the unreliable water supply situation has affected their use of the toilet and they now live in fear of diarrhoeal diseases due to this unsanitary situation. Over 80 % of the respondents have a negative perception in terms of water service delivery. Women have been largely affected by this situation in that they cannot fetch enough water for all domestic purposes mainly due to the distance to the alternative water sources (boreholes). There are, however, a number of feasible opportunities which can be pursued to improve this poor water supply situation in Mtapa and the city of Gweru in general. The study recommends that Gweru City Council avoids politicizing agreements with international organizations to help reduce the water problems because this will block these organizations from financially and technically helping in service delivery. The study also recommends that City Council resume pumping of water into reservoir tanks so that in cases of <b>emergency</b> or <b>breakdown</b> of pumps, water will be available for domestic use by residents. This can be achieved since there is now the involvement of international organizations for financial assistance...|$|R
40|$|In {{a complex}} {{humanitarian}} <b>emergency,</b> a catastrophic <b>breakdown</b> of political, economic, and social systems, {{often accompanied by}} violence, contributes to long-lasting dependency of the affected communities on external service. Relief systems such as the Emergency Response Units of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies {{have served as a}} sound foundation of field work in humanitarian emergencies. The experiences gained in 1994 and 1999 in the Rwanda and Kosovo emergencies clearly point to the need for individual adjustments of therapeutic standards to preexisting morbidity and health care levels within the affected population. In complex emergencies, public health activities have been shown to promote peace, prevent violence, and reconcile former enemies. In all public health training for domestic or foreign service, a truly democratic and multiprofessional approach will serve as good pattern for field work. Beyond the technical and scientific skills required in the profession, however, political, ethical, and communicative competences are critical in humanitarian assistance. Because of the manifold imperatives of further public health education for emergency assistance, a humanitarian assistance competence training center is proposed. By definition, competence training centers focus on the core competences required to meet future needs, are client-oriented, connect regional and international networks, rely on their own system of quality control and maintain a cooperative management of knowledge. Public health focusing on complex humanitarian emergencies will have to act in prevention not only of diseases and impairments but of political tension and hatred as well...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{probabilistic}} method for evaluating transmission grid security after line shunt faults. The most efficient contributions to system reliability enhancement {{can be found}} in probabilistic methods applicable to real transmission grids. One aim of the research was also to get an estimate of the Finnish 400  kV transmission grid reliability. The method developed in this thesis takes into account the effect of the following issues: frequency of line faults, fault location on the line, protection system, different substation structures, failure rates of substation components and the dynamic behaviour of the power system after different contingencies. Mathematical modelling and computational methods were used in this research. Statistical analyses for the estimation of initiating events such as line faults were made. A failure mode and effect analysis was made for substation components using both the Finnish 400  kV device-failure database and expert judgments. Reliability analyses for substation post-fault operations were made with event and fault trees. Different event tree end states (fault duration and circuit breaker trips) were then simulated with a power system dynamic analysis program using a particular load flow and grid topology. The dynamic analysis results were classified as secure, alert, <b>emergency</b> and system <b>breakdown.</b> A special alert case 'partial system breakdown' was also classified. The event trees were then reanalysed, now focusing on the power system states rather than the substation consequences. The method was applied to the Finnish transmission system and some quantitative estimates for grid reliability were obtained. Several grid-level importance measures (Fussell-Vesely, risk decrease factor, risk increase factor and sensitivity of parameters) for substation components and model parameters, as well as estimates of the total and partial system breakdown frequencies, were calculated. In this way, the relative importance of the substation components regarding the total and partial system breakdown was reached. Contributing factors to partial and total system breakdown after line faults were also found and ranked. On the basis of the results, some recommendations for improving the transmission grid reliability, in terms of maintenance planning and investments, were made. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The defended {{thesis is}} the result of a {{partnership}} enters on one hand the group Parisot, and particularly the corporation Parisot Furnishes, and on the other hand the team of research technological TRACILOG of the Center of Research in Automatic of Nancy. The consumption typology in terms of goods and of services evolved during the last years, with notably the emergence of e-business. If even then the consumers satisfied themselves weakly differentiated products down with costs, the tendency is at personalization, implying an increase of the variety and requirements of the final customer in terms of costs, quality, functionalities and delays. The production systems generally were conceived to be effective in a context of production of mass: they must evolve to adapt itself to this new typology of the market. They must improve their flexibility to be able to reply to the various ones ask customers. It is necessary for them to be equally reactive, in order to satisfy quickly the customers. At last, the business in his global nature one must become agile, able itself to reconfigure according to the evolutions of his environment or of his market (Nof and Al, 2006), (Koren and Al, 1999). The industries that produce big series of customised products, and particularly the furniture industry, undergo equally this evolution: the number of references does not stop increasing and the volumes by reference diminish. The one of the major issues for the Parisot Meubles company consists of improving flexibility of an industrial tool initially sized to produce important quantities of products with a weak differentiation, in order to reply to the requirements of the customers, so in terms of product diversification that of quality, costs and delays. The investments in production infrastructures being recent and important, the perspectives of flexibilisation have first to lean on an evolution of the structures of piloting. The centralized and hierarchical systems, originally developed to respond to a market of mass consumption, do not allow the agility of the production system. Indeed, if such architectures are rated efficient, many authors (Duffie et al, 1986) (Valckenaers et al, 1997) have stressed their lack of robustness to perturbations (commercial management of <b>emergencies,</b> <b>breakdowns,</b> ruptures of 'supply) and rigidity (difficulty of reconfiguration when introducing new products for example). This has led many companies to turn to strategies Steering type Just in Time, based on a production driven by customer demand and a flight control system of physical flow field, usually at the using labels (paper) kanban (Monden, 1981). They provide solutions satisfying the constraints of responsiveness, these systems do not provide optimal management of flows, and make it complicated by the difficulty to have an overview of the situation. In order to improve the agility of production systems, research activities have focused in recent years to hybrid control systems combining a system of centralized decision predictor with a medium or long term and a distributed system where decisions are taken in real time to the flow over a short term. The quality and complementarity of both approaches, centralized and distributed, promises considerable benefits for hybrid architectures that would reconcile the capacity of global optimization of hierarchical systems with the responsiveness and robustness potential heterarchical systems. Moreover, recent developments in technology INFOTRON (RFID, wireless communications networks [...] .) provide the tools for the implementation of automated steering. It is realistic to imagine that the "product information" to ensure the synchronization of the flow of physical objects and the process flow of software objects of the information system representing the process. Mac Farlane (MacFarlane et al, 2003) showed that the instrumentation of the product and increasing the visibility inherent allow input for both systems of production management systems for emerging (Figure 4). First, collecting real-time data on the flow of products and production system used to power tools effectively centralized (APS, ERP, MES), particularly consumer data in order to ensure consistency and overall optimization of the production process. The automatic identification technologies can solve the problem of synchronization of physical flows and information from Plössl in 1985 (Plössl, 1985). The instrumentation of the product is also a sure way to maintain the link-information and material to improve visibility on the physical flow. The availability of information on both the process and the product itself leads to an improvement in the visibility (or observability) in the space of states of the controlled transaction (MacFarlane et al, 2003). Auto ID is a complement to information from sensors directly to the process. The possibility of accurate information in real time on the identity, status and product specifications to help reduce delays and the risk of errors in the management of stocks of raw material, production operations and management finished products. It becomes realistic to imagine the "active" participant in decisions about production, and seen as the linchpin of the flight control system, ensuring the synchronization and consistency between a centralized system to ensure the overall optimization of production at the enterprise level and all the decision-making centers distributed over the execution of the production. As stated by Valckenaers in (Morel et al, 2007) : "These recent and ongoing developments finally promised to deliver the best of both worlds: the ability of centralized planning older solutions and the ability to cope with the real-factory dynamics of the self -organizing multi-agent systems. In particular, (Thomas et al, 2008) shows the relevance of the concept of control by the product in a production-driven just-in-time, allowing to maintain a global vision system and ensure the consistency of local decisions. Current issues in the field are therefore the proposed modeling frameworks and development of agile production system, proof of concept and the efficiency of such systems on an industrial scale and the transfer application on real world industry. Within the CRAN, the project team "system controlled by the Product" considering whether to allocate the proceeds an active role in the organization, ensuring the link between the performance of production and the center "business" of the company. Our work was conducted jointly with the thesis of Rémi Pannequin (Pannequin, 2007) whose purpose was to demonstrate the validity of the concept of active, developing a multi-platform control agents by the product architecture and emulation and with the thesis of Hind El Haouzi (to be defended in 2008), which exploits this concept to synchronize the flow of a main line with assembly lines (feeders) in a production unit. Compared to these two theories, our contribution is based on the physical flows infotronisation to assist in the management of different points of decoupling relative to a goal, in a context of high-volume production batches. Our work aims to explore new opportunities provided by the identification technologies in the management of workflow, and especially the automatic identification technologies in a production system controlled by kanban. Specifically, as part of a thesis CIFRE, we address the problem of flow management products within the company Parisot Meubles. During this thesis, we studied the production system as a whole (physical system and steering system), to identify industrial problems pilot production to Parisot Meubles. Of these industrial problems, we have induced a more general search. Then we could validate the proposals by the application in real industrial cases. This work has focused on a study of the opportunities provided by new information technologies on the procedures of production and the proposal of a decision support steering flow on the ground. The proposed architecture relies on the flow infotronisation kanban, which become "kanban assets and ensure interoperability and synchronization between a centralized system of decision-making and different decision-making distribution entities, to coordinate all decisions. These proposals have been validated through an architecture emulation, allowing the use of a flight control system under real conditions. In addition, some proposed structures have been validated in the real production system. The contributions of this thesis work based on: • The proposal of an architecture evaluation emulation control systems of production on an industrial scale, and the method of construction. • The proposal of a system of aid to the management of the production to ensure the overall coherence of the decision system.
