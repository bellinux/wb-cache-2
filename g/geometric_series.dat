A 19th-century reaction against such liberal summation methods resulted in the definition that still dominates today: the sum of a series is defined to be the limit of the sequence of its partial sums.

We clarify our main problem, which is to construct a kind of <b>geometric</b> composition <b>series</b> of projective embeddings. The concept of "geometric composition series" is an analogy in Algebraic Geometry with Jordan-Hölder series in Group Theory. We present two of the candidates for the construction problem. To approach this problem, we show several results and new tools for handling higher obstructions appearing in infinitesimal liftings.

Assume for current purposes that a proportion z prop=0.25 (25%) of pay was being saved.

It may be appropriate to regard this as being the necessary lump sum to fund 36,000 of annual supplements to any employer or government pensions that are available.
