The {{attack on}} this fortified town proceeded along similar lines to that on Bardia, with the 16th Infantry effecting a break-in of the position, {{but this time}} the 19th Infantry Brigade was to carry out the <b>exploitation</b> <b>phase.</b> Robertson's contribution to the plan was to increase its tempo, so that the attack would be carried through without pause, the exploitation being carried out before the initial break-in was complete. Robertson accepted the surrender of the fortress commander, Generale di Corpo d'Armata Petassi Manella, and later Admiral Messimiliano Vietina, the Italian naval commander. Comments by [...] "a sunburnt red-headed Australian brigadier" [...] made headlines in Britain, where senior officers rarely spoke to the media, but did not endear Robertson to his critics, who felt that his ego was out of control.

40|$|The {{detection}} of conspicuous image domains (ROI - Regions of Interest) {{is an early}} signal near operation {{in the process of}} automated detection and recognition of MMO used in ATR (Automatic Target Recognition) algorithm chains. For this purpose the ROI detection has to be fast and reliable. It is used as an efficient data reduction device to speed up subsequent <b>exploitation</b> <b>phases</b> without loss of relevant information. Usually two complementary error classes are distinguished: class alpha (an interesting image domain was not detected) and class beta (an irrelevant image domain (clutter) has been labeled), P errors lead to an increased analysis workload in subsequent <b>exploitation</b> <b>phases.</b> In unfavorable cases much too many image domains are labeled and hence the ROI detection is ineffective. a errors are even more problematic since omissions cannot be compensated in subsequent evaluation. The quality (efficiency and effectiveness) of the MMO detection restricts the ultimate achievable system performance and hence determines the possible application fields (e. g. on-board or ground based ATR).

This paper introduces a self adaptive scheme for tuning the DFO parameters and suggests a methodology involving self-adaptive DFO (SADFO) for performing multilevel segmentation of digital images. The multilevel segmentation problem is formulated as an optimization problem and solved using the SADFO. The method optimizes the threshold values through effectively exploring the solution space in obtaining the global best solution. The results of real life and medical images illustrate the performance of the suggested method...|$|R

The objective is to minimize the cumulative regret and Bayes risk. When the set of arms corresponds to the unit sphere, we prove that the regret and Bayes risk is of order Θ(r √ T), by establishing a lower bound for an arbitrary policy, and showing that a matching upper bound is obtained through a policy that alternates between exploration and <b>exploitation</b> <b>phases.</b> The phase-based policy is also shown to be effective if the set of arms satisfies a strong convexity condition.

30|$|There exist no large {{differences}} in the average percentage of each operator among the last three search phases: 51 – 100, 101 – 150 and 151 – 200 evaluations. That is, the average percentages of mutation, crossover, random generation and re-evaluation (operator) are in [8, 16], [46, 51], [3, 12] and [24, 38], respectively. This observation may suggest the necessity of totally different search strategies between the early exploration phase and the other <b>exploitation</b> <b>phases</b> for the Levy and Rastrigin functions. For comparison, we show experimental results for the Sphere function in Table  10. An interesting observation in Table  10 is a relatively larger percentage of random creation in the first 50 evaluations (i.e., 15.8  %). It seems that the designed algorithms search for good starting points by randomly generating solutions in the early search phase. However, even in the first 50 evaluations, mutation is mainly used in Table  10 for the Sphere function with no local minima.|$|R
30|$|We launch Prime+Probe and Flush+Reload {{attacks from}} our {{attacker}} VM on specific cache addresses (acquired during the profiling phase of our previous experiments) and deploy PokerFace {{on the victim}} VM. During our experiments, we encrypt a large file using AES on the victim. It {{is important to note}} that a single address is the lowest granularity at which the profiling and <b>exploitation</b> <b>phases</b> can proceed. The attacker can slow down his attack rate by increasing the interval between targeting different addresses, but he/she cannot slow down the process on a single address since the behaviour of the victim needs to be regularly monitored. However, for the attack to be practically successful, monitoring one single address is insufficient. From the histograms in Fig.  5, we can see that at least 5 - 10 addresses need to be simultaneously monitored to roughly distinguish key presses. Hence, in our experiments, we monitor 5 addresses as a minimal representation of practical attacks.|$|R

40|$|International audienceTraditional {{automatic}} tuning systems {{are based on}} an exploration-exploitation tradeoff that consists of: learning {{the behavior of the}} algorithm to tune on several benchmarks (exploration) and then using the learned behavior for solving new problem instances. On NP-hard algorithms, this vision is questionable because of the potential huge runtime of the exploration phase. In this paper, we introduce QTuning, a new {{automatic tuning}} system specially designed for NP-hard algorithms. Like traditional tuning systems, QTuning uses benchmarks. But, during the learning process, new benchmark entries can always be introduced or existing ones removed. Moreover, the system mixes the exploration and <b>exploitation</b> <b>phases.</b> The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} formulate the learning process in QTuning within an active learning framework. The framework is based on a classical observation made in optimization: namely, the efficiency of random search in regret minimization.

40|$|Cycles of {{demographic}} and organizational change are well documented in Neolithic societies, but {{the social and}} ecological processes underlying them are debated. Such periodicities are implicit in the “Pecos classification,” a chronology for the pre-Hispanic U. S. Southwest introduced in Science in 1927 which is still widely used. To understand these periodicities, we analyzed 29, 311 archaeological tree-ring dates from A. D. 500 to 1400 {{in the context of}} a novel high spatial resolution, annual reconstruction of the maize dry-farming niche for this same period.
