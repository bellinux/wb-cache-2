40|$|This paper {{highlights}} some marked {{findings of}} TAPs {{in the study}} of <b>translation</b> <b>units</b> to date. Based on this review, a series of TAP experiments are carried out to reanalyze the concept of <b>translation</b> <b>unit</b> from English into Chinese, a remotely connected language pair. We suggest that {{there are two types of}} translation units: Subjective <b>Translation</b> <b>Unit</b> (STU) and Objective <b>Translation</b> <b>Unit</b> (OTU) and that <b>translation</b> <b>unit</b> is a dynamic linguistic entity offering indexing function. On the one hand, the selection of STUs and OTUs is indicative of the underlying translation competence of translators. On the other hand, throughout the process of translation, there is a floating selection of <b>translation</b> <b>units</b> which is to say the initial <b>translation</b> <b>unit</b> chosen, be it lexical or sentential or other linguistic units, does not stay throughout. Instead it varies dynamically with parameters such as short-term memory and text comprehension among other factors...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that texts are not {{translated}} word by word but in larger units which are, {{from the perspective}} of the target language, more or less monosemous. This dissertation argues that <b>translation</b> <b>units</b> are the smallest such units, and that they can be identified in parallel corpora. It aims to show that these <b>translation</b> <b>units</b> and their target language equivalents can be extracted from parallel corpora and can be re-used to facilitate new translations. The concept of <b>translation</b> <b>units</b> and their equivalents will enable translators to translate competently into languages other than their native language, something not sufficiently supported by traditional bilingual dictionaries. For my exploratory study presented here, I will use the Hong Kong Legal Document Parallel Corpus (HKLDC). This dissertation starts with the definition of the concept of the <b>translation</b> <b>unit</b> and its equivalent and goes on to describe a method of extracting <b>translation</b> <b>unit</b> candidates. These candidates are then validated by further analysis. It will also test the hypothesis that each complete <b>translation</b> <b>unit</b> has only one translation equivalent. Finally, by comparing the translation equivalents extracted from the corpus with those provided by traditional dictionaries, this dissertation will argue that parallel corpora, as the repository of the <b>translation</b> <b>units</b> and <b>translation</b> equivalents, can, by complementing traditional translation aids, facilitate translation. ...|$|R
