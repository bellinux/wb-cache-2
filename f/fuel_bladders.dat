500|$|During {{inspections}} in 1995 and 1996, cracks at the WS23 location {{were found}} on many aircraft, {{most of them in}} line with updated predictions from 1993. However, two of these were classified as [...] "near-critical" [...] size, well beyond predictions. In August 1998, Grumman produced a new plan to address these issues and increase life span to 16,000 hours. This resulted in the [...] "HOG UP" [...] program, which commenced in 1999. Over time, additional aspects were added to HOG UP, including new <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders,</b> changes to the flight control system and inspections of the engine nacelles. In 2001, the cracks were reclassified as [...] "critical", which meant they were considered repairs and not upgrades, which allowed bypassing normal acquisition channels for more rapid implementation.|$|E
500|$|On 5 January 2015, the Navy and Marines {{signed a}} {{memorandum}} of understanding (MOU) to buy the V-22 for the COD mission, and was confirmed in the Navy's FY 2016 budget. Initially designated HV-22, four aircraft would be bought each year from 2018–2020. It incorporates an extended-range fuel system for an [...] unrefueled range, a high-frequency radio for over-the-horizon communications, and a public address system to communicate with passengers; the range increase comes from extra <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> through larger external sponsons, the version's only physical difference from other Osprey variants. Its primary mission is long-range aerial logistics, but other conceivable missions include personnel recovery and special warfare. In February 2016, the Navy officially designated it as the CMV-22B. The Navy's program of record originally called for 48 aircraft, but it later determined that only 44 were required. Production of the CMV-22 will begin in FY 2018 and start deliveries in 2020. Bell and Boeing have pitched the V-22 as a Navy platform for various missions, such as communications, electronic warfare, or aerial refueling; the Navy has a known gap in tactical aerial refueling. Other roles include search and rescue and anti-submarine warfare.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{prolonged}} operations {{outside of}} Phuoc Tuy {{during the first}} half of 1968 had placed considerable strain on the Australian logistic system. Australian logistic resupply arrangements for Operation Toan Thang I had been modelled on the experience of Operation Coburg, and again required the Vung Tau-based 1 ALSG to be split in order to provide a forward logistic element at the US base at Long Binh. A forward task force maintenance area had also been established, first at Bearcat and then later at FSB Coral. Re-supply by road had continued daily from Long Binh to Bearcat, while following the move to Coral re-supply was primarily by air due to the threat of possible interdiction. Movement from unit echelons in the forward maintenance area was also undertaken by helicopter. Units in the field received one fresh meal each day, with the other two meals based half on the American C ration and half on the Australian combat ration. Although the supply of fuel and ammunition was generally satisfactory, stocks had run dangerously low on one occasion during heavy fighting at FSB Coral due to the calculation of usage rates based on previous operations, requiring an emergency night-time resupply by Chinook while the base was under attack. Re-supply of water had also been particularly difficult due to unavailability of a permanent water point. Ultimately water had to be delivered by air from Long Binh at a rate of [...] per day using rubber <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{station was}} moved in 1975 {{to the newly}} {{constructed}} Buckminster Fuller geodesic dome [...] wide by [...] high, with [...] steel archways. One served as the entry to the dome {{and it had a}} transverse arch that contained modular buildings for the station's maintenance, <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders,</b> power plant, snow melter, equipment and vehicles. Individual buildings within the dome contained the dorms, galley, rec, post office and labs for monitoring the upper and lower atmosphere and numerous other complex projects in astronomy and astrophysics. The station also included the Skylab, a box-shaped tower slightly taller than the dome. Skylab was connected to the Dome by a tunnel. The Skylab housed atmospheric sensor equipment and later a music room.|$|E
2500|$|From 1967 to 1975, {{the bulk}} of VMGR-152’s {{missions}} were directly in support of action in Southeast Asia. Detachments typically lasted five days, and operated out of Da Nang Air Base. [...] In addition to aerial refueling and Marine Logistic (MarLog)cargo missions, VMGR 152 'GVs' dropped flares in support of ground troop operations at night. [...] At its peak, the squadron was flying 900 missions a month and continued this high tempo of operations well into 1967. On 10 February 1968 a VMGR-152 KC-130F was hit by groundfire during landing at Khe Sanh, Quang Tri province. The <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> on board were set alight and the airframe burned out on the runway, {{with the loss of}} six on board.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> {{are most}} useful in {{situations}} where critical infrastructure has been compromised or does not exist. Benefits of using a flexible storage system like <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> is their ability to be transported and set up quickly. GMA Cover Corp. advertises that their pillow shaped bladders are foldable at less than 5% of the total volume. [...] Other unique characteristics of <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> are their high resistance to climatic conditions, which makes them useful for use in disaster zones and wartime desert operations.|$|E
50|$|Serling notices {{inconsistencies}} {{between the}} testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario (Matt Damon), the medic, praises Walden strongly. However, Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward {{and that he}} led the crew in combat and improvised the <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> weapon. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and unconscious throughout. Furthermore, {{the crew of the}} Black Hawk claim that they heard firing from an M16, but Ilario and Monfriez deny they had one.|$|R
5000|$|Some Abrams were {{disabled}} by Iraqi infantrymen in ambushes employing short-range antitank rockets, {{such as the}} Russian RPG-7, {{during the}} 2003 invasion. Although the RPG-7 is unable to penetrate the front and sides, the rear and top are vulnerable to this weapon. Frequently the rockets were fired at the tank tracks. [...] Another was put out of action in the Battle of Baghdad after being struck by numerous medium caliber weapons, including 12.7mm rounds which ruptured a <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> stored on an external rack.

50|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>{{bladders}}</b> or fuel storage bladders are collapsible, flexible storage bladders (also {{known as}} tanks) that provide temporary or long term storage for industrial liquids (e.g. fuels). These pillow shaped tanks {{are designed for}} large volume liquid transport, industrial chemicals, potable water, sludge, and fuel storage. Standard fuel bladder tanks sizes range from 100 gal to 200,000 gal capacities and larger and custom fuel storage bladders and cells are available, although at sizes exceeding 50,000 gal there is an increased spill risk. To {{minimize the risk of}} leakage, {{and for the sake of}} containing a catastrophic spill, all <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> should be housed in secondary containment. The use of <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> without precautionary measures is risky and should not be undertaken. The fines involved with fuel spills are well known and the EPA has set clear guidelines for the use of secondary containment concerning <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders.</b>|$|E
50|$|High end <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> {{are made}} of {{elastomer}} coated fabrics manufactured by homogeneous vulcanization in one operation. The fabrics ensure the mechanical resistance. Coating and design engineering grant chemical properties and water tightness.|$|E
50|$|Later, Serling is {{assigned}} to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) {{should be the first}} woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and when the survivors were rescued the next day, Walden was reported dead.|$|R

5000|$|The DPV {{was built}} by Chenowth Racing Products, Inc. The German Volkswagen Kübelwagen was the first {{military}} Light Utility Vehicle based on the Volkswagen Beetle which uses rear-wheel rather than four-wheel drive for mobility. Volkswagen components were also {{the basis for the}} postwar dune buggy, and its layout is used in the DPV with rear-mounted air-cooled [...] Volkswagen engine. This makes the lightweight vehicle capable of accelerating from 0 to 30 mph (0-50 km/h) in only four seconds and able to travel at speeds of up to 80 mph (130 km/h). With its standard 21 gallon (79.5 litre) fuel tank, the DPV has a range of about 210 miles (338 km). An optional <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> can extend the range to over 1,000 miles (1,610 km).

50|$|EGMME {{had been}} {{certified}} as a pesticide by the EPA, {{but as the}} requirement changes raised the certification costs, DEGMME has no official pesticide certification. DEGMME is a potent solvent, and at high concentrations can damage <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> and filters. Long-term storage of FSII-fuel mixtures is therefore not recommended.|$|E
50|$|High end <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders</b> offer a {{high degree}} of {{protection}} of the stored liquids, ensuring the contents never come in contact with air. This ensures that there is no risk of evaporation or explosion due to gas formation. In order to prevent liquid contamination, a neutral barrier film is added to the fuel bladder's inner side.|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{introduction}} the AW119 Koala {{has developed a}} reputation as one of the safest helicopters in its class. Nicknamed [...] "Volvo of light helicopters" [...] by operators and technicians, it has proven a forgiving platform when exposed to extreme conditions and operational tempos. The AW119 incorporates a level of system redundancy unparalleled in its class; a few examples being: duel hydraulic pumps driven directly by its main rotor transmission on opposite sides, two separate stability augmentation systems, electronic engine control system coupled with a direct throttle control linkage to fuel metering unit and mechanical governor allowing for a MANUAL mode, two fuel tank boost pumps in addition to engine driven fuel pump, two heading GMU sensors, two independent VHF systems available, and primary and secondary GPS sources. A high-inertia rotor system coupled with a robust box structure and separated <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> tank setup has contributed greatly to crash survivability.|$|R

50|$|Reactivated as a Tactical Air Command troop carrier squadron, 1953. Performed Troop Carrier {{missions}} using {{tactical transport}} aircraft until 1971 when inactivated. In 1965 the squadron received twelve modified C-130E-(I)s for special operations use and began training {{with the new}} airplanes in early 1966. The C-130E-(I)s were assigned to Detachment One, 779th Troop Carrier Squadron. The 779th tactical airlift squadron was placed on alert shortly after the USS Pueblo was captured by North Koreain January 1968.They were deployed to Tachikawa, Japan shortly thereafter. After a few days at Tachikawa they were deployed to Cam Ranh Bay Viet Nam where they flew supply and troop transport during the TET offensive. While at Cam Ranh enemy rockets were fired at the base from the overlooking hills striking fuel drums and a <b>fuel</b> <b>bladder</b> but no damage was don to the C-130s parked nearby. In Early April 1968 they returned to Pope AFB, NC and were replaced in Cam Ranh Bay by the 778th tactical Airlift Squadron also from Pope AFB, NC.

50|$|The early {{tanks were}} of welded {{aluminium}} structure with the sealing material applied as a composite layer on the outside. A major problem with welded aluminium tanks is weld decay and metal fatigue in the seams due to vibration in service.

50|$|A wet wing is an {{aerospace}} engineering technique where an aircraft's wing structure is sealed {{and used as}} a fuel tank. Wet wings are also called integral fuel tanks. By {{eliminating the need for}} <b>fuel</b> <b>bladders,</b> aircraft can weigh less and the wing root bending moment caused by the lift generated by the wings in flight is decreased. This offers further reduction in weight by allowing structural components to be designed lighter as the components do not need to support larger forces.|$|E
