40|$|With the {{election}} of Leung Chun-ying as the fourth chief executive (CE) of the Hong Kong Special Admininstration Region (HKSAR), the people of Hong Kong are keen {{to have a new}} government with policy visions and leadership. This public expectation is running high because Hong Kong has been suffering from a seris of critical and deep-seated socio-economic problems: the polarization of wealth, low social mobility, the subtraction of public (government) services, and so on. The inability of the HKSAR governments to address these problems {{has its roots in the}} governing system in general and the institutional design for selecting the CE and forming the executive in particular. This chapter therefore first examines the <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>functions</b> of the executive of the HKSAR, and then the way the CE and the executive govern, and their interaction with the Legislative Council (Legco) in terms of general policy-making and budgetary decision-making processes.

40|$|The sudden {{resignation}} of Tung Chee-hwa {{as chief executive}} (CE) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) in March 2005 surprised Hong Kong. Donald Tsang, the former chief secretary for administration, won the CE by-election on 16 June 2005. He was then appointed by the Central People’s Government (CPG) and assumed office on 21 June 2005. Handpicked by former President Jiang Zemin, Tung had earned {{the trust of the}} CPG. Unfortunately, the performance of Tung’s government was regarded by many of his fellow citizens as far from satisfactory. The reasons for the under-performance were various. The 1997 Asian financial crisis provided too much of a challenge and burden for the newly-formed HKSAR government. Tung himself, underprepared and ill-equipped to lead the executive, found it hard to mount a prompt and effective response to the crisis. The institutional design for selecting the CE and forming the executive was also flawed. This chapter therefore examines the <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>functions</b> within the executive branch of the HKSAR. How the CE and the executive govern, and their interaction with the Legislative Council in terms of general policymaking and budgetary decision-making processes, are also discussed.

40|$|Policy {{documents}} {{derived from}} the South African Constitution and the South African Schools Act clearly state that all learners are entitled to support, thus enabling them to reach their full potential. Support should be rendered effectively at school level within a well-established <b>and</b> <b>functioning</b> Institutional Level Support Teams (ILST). Institutional Level Support Teams (ILSTs) at primary schools within the Uitenhage District seem to be problematic, since parents, {{the school and the}} community do not realise that they should work interrelated with each other to enhance the effective <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>functioning</b> of the ILST. The main aim of this study is, therefore, to formulate guiding principles for the effective <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>functioning</b> of Institutional Level Support Teams. A qualitative research design using a phenomenological strategy was deemed appropriate for this study, as the researcher wants to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} phenomenon under study. The researcher used a combination of convenience sampling, as well as purposive and judgement sampling. The sample group included educators, members of the Institutional Level Support Teams, Institutional Level Support Team co-ordinators, School Principals, community members and members of the District Based Support Team (DBST). Data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews, participant observations and questionnaires. Tesch’s eight step data analysis process was employed to identify possible common themes. The findings indicated that the stakeholder component of the social system representing learners, parents, schools and the community, do not provide sufficient support to learners experiencing learning challenges and therefore ILSTs are not functioning optimally presently [...] Therefore the researcher provided supportive guiding principles to parents, the school and the community, for the effective <b>establishment</b> <b>and</b> <b>functioning</b> of the ILST, based on Bronfenbrenner’s eco-systemic theory, which is the theoretical framework of this stud...|$|R
