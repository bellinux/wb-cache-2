25|$|Current {{variants}} of the DSG will still <b>downshift</b> {{to the lowest}} possible gear ratio when the kick-down button is activated during full throttle whilst in manual mode. In Manual mode this kick-down is only activated by an additional button {{at the bottom of}} the accelerator pedal travel; unless this is pressed the DSG will not <b>downshift,</b> and will simply perform a full-throttle acceleration in whatever gear was previously being utilised.|$|E
25|$|Downshifting {{is similar}} to up-shifting but in reverse order, and is slower, at 600milliseconds, due to the engine's Electronic Control Unit, or ECU, needing to 'blip' the {{throttle}} so that the engine crankshaft speed can match the appropriate gear shaft speed. The car's computer senses the car slowing down, or more power required (during acceleration), and thus engages a lower gear on the shaft not in use, and then completes the <b>downshift.</b>|$|E
25|$|To change up a gear, {{the lever}} is pushed forward (against a spring pressure) towards the +, {{and to change}} down, the lever is pulled {{rearward}} towards the −. The DSG transmission can now be operated with the gear changes being (primarily) determined by the driver. This method of operation is commonly called tiptronic. In the interests of engine preservation, when accelerating in Manual/tiptronic mode, the DSG will still automatically change up just before the redline, and when decelerating, it will change down automatically at very low revs, just before the engine idle speed (tickover). Furthermore, if the driver calls for a gear {{when it is not}} appropriate (e.g., requesting a <b>downshift</b> when engine speed is near the redline) the DSG will not change to the driver's requested gear.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>downshifting</b> is {{fundamentally}} based on {{dissatisfaction with the}} conditions and consequences of the workplace environment, {{the most common form}} of <b>downshifting</b> is work (or income) <b>downshifting.</b> The philosophy of work-to-live replaces the dominant social ideology of live-to-work. Reorienting economic priorities shifts the work-life balance away from the workplace.|$|R
5000|$|Career <b>downshifts</b> {{are another}} way of <b>downshifting</b> {{economically}} and entail lowering previous aspirations of wealth, a promotion or higher social status. [...] Quitting a job to work locally in the community, from home or {{to start a business}} are examples of career <b>downshifts.</b> Although more radical, these changes do not mean stopping work altogether.|$|R

25|$|The Insight’s Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{provides}} infinite ratios to {{keep the}} engine operating within its most efficient range. Forward gear ratios are infinitely variable between 3.172–0.529 and reverse gear ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted {{behind the steering wheel}} allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated gear ratios for full control over acceleration and engine braking. Since the CVT’s gear ratios are continuously variable the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or <b>downshift</b> into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor to stay in their most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed gear ratios. The CVT’s variable gear ratios allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{final drive ratio}} for {{vehicles}} equipped with the 7-speed automatic has been (numerically) reduced from 3.69 to 3.36, the new 7-speed automatic has much lower first through fourth gear overall ratios than the old 5-speed automatic and the 6-speed manual in the 6MT cars (which retain the old 3.69 final drive ratio). Giving it closer gear ratios in all gears, to match engine rpm better with power demand, brings better acceleration while overdrive ratios in 6th and 7th gears reduces highway cruising rpm and improves fuel mileage. The new 7-speed automatic retains the Drive Sport (DS) shift mode and <b>Downshift</b> Rev Matching (DRM) feature of the previous 5-speed automatic. Paddle shifters are standard on G37S models equipped with the 7-speed automatic. The new engine/transmission combo did add some weight the car (3,590lb. for the G37 vs. 3,508 for the G35 in identical trim).|$|E
500|$|Debuting in late 2009 for the 2010 model year, {{the revised}} LS 460 and LS 460 L {{included}} restyled {{front and rear}} fascias, side mirror turn signals, and new wheel designs.

The standard cabin received additional chrome trim, an optional DVD entertainment system behind the center armrest, and in certain markets, an all-digital instrument panel with night vision capability. The LS 460 Sport—a performance variant equipped with a sport-tuned air suspension, Brembo brakes, forged wheels, paddle shifters, body kit, and a unique interior—was added. The Sport model received the Sport Direct Shift transmission, {{also found in the}} Lexus IS F, with <b>downshift</b> rev-matching capability and manual mode. A new interior customization program, [...] "L-Select", also became available for LS customers in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Another {{aspect of}} <b>downshifting</b> {{is being a}} {{conscious}} consumer or actively practicing alternative forms of consumption. Proponents of <b>downshifting</b> point to consumerism as a primary source of stress and dissatisfaction because it creates a society of individualistic consumers who measure both social status and general happiness by an unattainable quantity of material possessions. Instead of buying goods for personal satisfaction, consumption <b>downshifting,</b> purchasing only the necessities, {{is a way to}} focus on quality of life rather than quantity.|$|R
40|$|Something puzzling yet {{profound}} {{is occurring}} in consumer-driven societies: {{an increasing number of}} individuals {{from all walks of life}} are pursuing lower consumption practices and embracing simpler lifestyles.

40|$|Using {{the data}} {{collected}} {{as part of a}} Quality of Life (QoL) survey in the Brisbane-South East Queensland region (SEQ) of Australia, this paper examines differences in satisfaction levels between downshifters and non-downshifters, and identifies socio-economic predictors of the <b>downshifting</b> phenomenon. Almost 30 % of survey respondents are classified as downshifters. Multivariate Analysis of Covariance reveals significant differences between downshifters and non-downshifters in a number of life-satisfaction domains, although {{the degree to which they}} were satisfied with their life before <b>downshifting</b> is unknown. Analysis of Covariance shows that downshifters reported a significantly lower level of satisfaction than non-downshifters, especially with respect to satisfaction with the amount of money available to them, independence or freedom, and employment. Multivariate logistic regression analysis reveals that post-secondary education and employment were positively associated with <b>downshifting,</b> while age was significantly associated with <b>downshifting.</b> It is argued that if <b>downshifting</b> is associated with lower levels of satisfaction, intervention may be required to initiate programs to engage downshifters more fully in the workforce by facilitating more flexible work arrangements and an improved working environment...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the second}} year of production, the Acura TL was given {{slightly}} more features, including a 5-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. The added gear allowed for slightly better fuel economy and acceleration when compared to the previous 4-speed automatic transmission with SportShift. With this model, if the driver forgets the 1-2 shift the computer will take over when in sport mode and do the 1-2 up and down shifts, unlike the 4-speed 1999 model. In many vehicles, the 5-speed automatic transmission failed: as the third clutch pack wore, particles blocked off oil passages and prevented the transmission from shifting or holding gears normally. The transmission would slip, fail to shift, or suddenly <b>downshift</b> and make the car come to a screeching halt, even at freeway speeds. This problem was highlighted in the Los Angeles Times in September 2002. Consumer Reports took note and gave the TL and CL the black spot, the worst rating for transmission reliability.

A class-action lawsuit was settled to extend the transmission warranty for U.S.A. owners or entities to 7.75 years for all models made from 1998 to 2002 and some 2003 models by VIN; however, Canadian owners warranties were not extended.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{an analysis of}} pulse shapes produced by a delta-function disturbance of the equilibrium state of a relativistic electron beam propagating through a constant-amplitude helical magnetic wiggler field. Pulse shapes are determined by using the rel-ativistic pinch-point techniques developed by Bers, Ram, and Francis.

The <b>downshifted</b> instability may be convective or absolute, depending upon the beam density and momentum spread. Parameter regimes in which the <b>downshifted</b> instability is con-vective are investigated. It is found that momentum spreads sufficiently large to suppress the absolute instability reduce the growth rate of the upshifted pulse to negligible values. Pulse shapes computed by using the Raman and Compton approximations are compared with exact pulse shapes. It is found that the Raman approximation should be applied to the <b>downshifted</b> regime for most systems of practical interest. 1...|$|R
40|$|Record high {{housing costs}} {{contribute}} to time stress and poor work-life balance for many Australian families. Yet {{the significance of}} housing in relation to both family life and work-life balance is frequently overlooked in both research and policy arenas. Using <b>downshifting</b> as a case study, this paper addresses this significant knowledge gap. 'Downshifting' refers to the voluntarily reduction of income and consumption to improve life quality. Around a quarter of Australians of working age are estimated {{to have made a}} voluntary decision to change their lives in ways that reduce their incomes and spending (other than retirement). Family life is consistently identified in Australian research as the key motivator for <b>downshifting</b> yet remarkably, the relationship between <b>downshifting</b> and family life remains unexplored. At the same time, housing represents the largest single consumer item for most Australian households, yet no previous study has systematically examined <b>downshifting</b> and housing outcomes. This paper presents findings of a dedicated qualitative study of 25 Australian downshifter families in which the relationships between <b>downshifting,</b> housing and family life are explored. Focusing on the lived experiences and strategies of downshifter families, the paper first identifies the family values and priorities of families who have <b>downshifted,</b> before examining how these values and priorities influence patterns of income and expenditure, housing consumption and home life. Findings are discussed in the context of wider debates about work-life balance and draw attention to the significant disjuncture between housing policy on the one hand, and work-life balance discourse on the other...|$|R
