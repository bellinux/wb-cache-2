40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the method of}} the discretization of the gear tooth flank in involute segments for the determination of conjugate gear tooth profiles. Instead of following a point-to-point analytical approach {{to the problem of}} determining the path of contact and the geometry of the <b>generating</b> <b>rack</b> and the mating wheel, the actual tooth flank is considered to be composed of infinitesimal local involutes and therefore a closed solution can be achieved. Due to its simplicity, the method is faster than the standard theory of gearing and this is particularly useful in problems requiring iterative calculations of the tooth geometry such as gear optimization. The method is implemented on modified involute as well as loboid gears used in lobe pumps and it is verified against existing theories. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{teeth of}} {{ordinary}} {{spur and helical}} gears are generated by a (virtual) rack provided with planar generating surfaces. The resulting tooth surface shapes are a circle-involute cylinder {{in the case of}} spur gears, and a circle-involute helicoid for helical gears. Advantages associated with involute geometry are well known. Beveloid gears are often regarded as a generalization of involute cylindrical gears involving one additional degree-of-freedom, in that the midplane of their (virtual) <b>generating</b> <b>rack</b> is inclined with respect to the axis of the gear being generated. A peculiarity of their generation process is that the motion of the generating planar surface, seen from the fixed space, is a rectilinear translation (while the gear blank is rotated about a fixed axis); the component of such translation that is orthogonal to the generating plane is the one that ultimately dictates the shape of the generated, envelope surface. Starting from this basic fact, we set out to revisit this type of generation-by-envelope process and to profitably use it to explore peculiar design layouts, in particular for the case of motion transmission between skew axes (and intersecting axes as a special case). Analytical derivations demonstrate the possibility of involute helicoid profiles (beveloids) transmitting motion between skew axes through line contact and, perhaps more importantly, they lead to the derivation of designs featuring insensitivity of the transmission ratio to all misalignments within relatively large limits. The theoretical developments are confirmed by various numerical examples...|$|E

40|$|An {{optimisation}} {{procedure for}} twin screw compressor design is described, {{which is based}} on an analytical algorithm for rotor profile generation combined with a differential model of the fluid flow and thermodynamic processes within the machine. Rotor profiles are <b>generated</b> from a <b>rack</b> which have both stronger female rotor lobes and higher displacement. Compressors thus designed have higher delivery rates and better efficiencies than those using more well known profiles. Some optimization issues of the rotor profile and compressor ports are discussed, using a 5 / 6 - 106 mm screw compressor to illustrate the results. It is shown that the optimum rotor profile, compressor speed, oil flow rate and inlet temperature may differ significantly when compressing different gases or vapours...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{surface of}} a gear with ring-involute teeth <b>generated</b> by a <b>rack</b> cutter with ring-involute teeth is {{a new type of}} gear. This paper {{describes}} a method developed from gear theory for deriving a pinion and a gear with ring-involute teeth. A gear with ring-involute teeth is regarded as an envelope to the family of rack cutter surfaces when the pinion and gear rotate for a cycle. Using a developed mathematical model, the investigation on the undercutting analysis of the proposed gear is studied. Here the kinematic errors are investigated according to the obtained geometric modelling of the designed gear meshing when assembly errors were present. Stress analysis for the proposed gear was performed. F inally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the geometric model of a gear with ring-involute teeth and a gear ratio of 3 : 2...|$|R
40|$|Dependency on {{deterministic}} design techniques without {{attention to}} inherent process variations and uncertainties in gear design and manufacturing processes {{can lead to}} unreliable results and affect {{the performance of a}} gearing system. A better understanding of the impact of uncertainty associated with the system input on the system output can be achieved by including reliability techniques to accomplish a reliable design methodology. This emerged the need to consider the probabilistic behavior of the stress distribution on the gear tooth during the design phase. The present effort reports on the application of the SSI theory {{within the context of a}} “Design for Reliability” approach in support a detailed gear design methodology for the evaluation the tooth-root strength with FEM-based verification. The SSI theory is formulated to predict the effect of the root fillet <b>generated</b> by a <b>rack</b> or hob tool with and without protuberance on the gear system reliability. The results obtained from the probabilistic analysis strongly agreed with the FEM’ results across a range of different gear tooth fillet profiles. A quantitative assessment of the investigated gear sets showed the highest tooth-root stress was associated with the lowest tip radius of the generating tool. This approach helps with making the decision by quantifying the impact of stress and strength variations during the gear design stage...|$|R
40|$|Fortlax is an {{air-cooled}} {{data center}} in Norrbotten. The potential of future investments in data centers is prosperous, but sustainability is {{an increasingly important}} factor. It is important {{to make sure that}} the data centers are sufficiently cooled while too much forced cooling leads to economical losses and a waste of energy. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a CFD model of a server room at Fortlax data center that accurately predicts the temperature and flow field. The goal is to develop the CFD model in order to evaluate different cooling systems and also improve the placement of the server racks. Most of the server racks are only half full at the moment, but the heat load is supposed to increase in the near future. Therefore, it has been assumed that all the server <b>racks</b> <b>generate</b> full heat load. The commercial CFD software ANSYS CFX 16. 0 has been used to perform the simulations. The current cooling system with the current placement of the server racks resulted in some insufficiently cooled server racks. The performance of the cooling system was significantly improved when the hard-floor configuration was replaced by a raised-floor configuration. The design strategy based on hot/cold-aisles has become the standard when raised-floor configurations are used. However, the raised-floor configuration with parallel rows of server racks turned out to be the setup that performed best based on the performance metrics that were used to evaluate the results in this thesis...|$|R
