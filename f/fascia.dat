5|$|If the plantar <b>fascia</b> {{continues}} to be overused {{in the setting of}} plantar fasciitis, the plantar <b>fascia</b> can rupture. Typical signs and symptoms of plantar <b>fascia</b> rupture include a clicking or snapping sound, significant local swelling, and acute pain in the sole of the foot.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The structural breakdown of the plantar <b>fascia</b> {{is believed to be}} the result of repetitive microtrauma (small tears). Microscopic examination of the plantar <b>fascia</b> often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E
5|$|Originally, plantar {{fasciitis}} {{was believed}} to be an inflammatory condition of the plantar <b>fascia.</b> However, within the last decade, studies have observed microscopic anatomical changes indicating that plantar fasciitis is actually due to a noninflammatory structural breakdown of the plantar <b>fascia</b> rather than an inflammatory process.|$|E
40|$|Descriptions of the <b>fasciae</b> of {{the lower}} half of the face and of the {{adjacent}} cervical <b>fasciae</b> have long been puzzling and descriptively much too complex. For this reason, medical students, young medical and dental practitioners, and at times even senior surgeons frequently do not understand the anatomy of the cervicofacial <b>fasciae,</b> which plays such an important role in the spread and subsequent final localization of primary intraoral infections. This article attempts to simplify the descriptions of these <b>fasciae,</b> in particular, their sites of origin and insertion...|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 12.5-15.5 mm {{for males}} and 15.5 mm for females. The forewings are white with a conspicuous buff costa. There are five brownish grey, weakly lunulate transverse <b>fasciae,</b> consisting of indistinct sub-basal, antemedial, postmedial and two subterminal <b>fasciae</b> with the greatest distance between antemedial and postmedial <b>fasciae.</b> The hindwings {{are similar to the}} forewings in colour and pattern.|$|R
25|$|The TFL flap {{reconstruction}} {{includes the}} tensor <b>fasciae</b> latae muscle and is nourished by the ascending {{branch of the}} lateral circumflex femoral artery. The tensor <b>fasciae</b> latae muscle {{is located at the}} lateral upper leg.|$|R
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{surrounded}} by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal <b>fascia,</b> which also surrounds the kidneys. A weak wall of connective tissue called septum separates the glands from the kidneys. The adrenal glands are directly below the diaphragm, and {{are attached to the}} crura of the diaphragm by the renal <b>fascia.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{axillary}} arch may insert {{into the}} tendon of the pectoralis major muscle, the <b>fascia</b> of the coracobrachialis muscle, or the <b>fascia</b> covering the biceps brachii muscle. Insertion into the pectoralis major muscle proper, the long {{head of the}} biceps brachii muscle, the coracoid process, the pectoralis minor muscle, the axillary <b>fascia</b> and to the bone at {{the crest of the}} greater tubercle of the humerus inserting distal to the insertion of the pectoralis major muscle have all been reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar <b>fascia</b> is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the <b>fascia</b> extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} toes, and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fasciae</b> {{are similar}} to ligaments and tendons as they have {{collagen}} as their major component. They differ in their location and function: ligaments join one bone to another bone, tendons join muscle to bone, and <b>fasciae</b> surround muscles or other structures.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 12 mm. The wings have brown subterminal and double postmedial <b>fasciae,</b> the proximal postmedial and subterminal <b>fasciae</b> reduced to rows of spots. There is one brown medial spot on the anal margin of the forewings.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16 mm. The forewings are grey-whitish, sprinkled with ochreous-fuscous scales, {{which tend to}} form three moderate transverse <b>fasciae.</b> The hindwings are light fuscous, with two darker fuscous transverse <b>fasciae</b> and a fine line of fuscous scales along the hindmargin.|$|R
5|$|Conditions of the {{subcutaneous}} fat are those affecting {{the layer of}} adipose tissue that lies between the dermis and underlying <b>fascia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Disruptions in the plantar fascia's normal {{mechanical}} movement during standing and walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) {{are thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} plantar fasciitis by placing excess strain on the calcaneal tuberosity. Other studies have also suggested that plantar fasciitis is not actually due to inflamed plantar <b>fascia,</b> but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the plantar <b>fascia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Normally the plantar <b>fascia</b> {{has three}} {{fascicle}}s {{with the central}} fascicle thickest at 4mm, the lateral fascicle at 2mm and the medial at less than a millimeter in thickness. In theory, the likeliness of fasciitis increases with increasing thickness of plantar <b>fascia</b> at the calcaneal insertion, with thickness of more than 4.5mm being somewhat useful on ultrasound and 4mm on MRI. Findings on imaging such as plantar aponeurosis thickening, however, may be absent in symptomatic individuals or present in asymptomatic individuals thereby limiting the utility of such observations.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 21 mm. The fore- and hindwings are white and highly lustrous. The forewings with the <b>fasciae</b> pale brownish grey. There are broad sub-basal, antemedial, double postmedial and weakly marked narrow subterminal <b>fasciae.</b> The hindwings are as the forewings.|$|R
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 10 mm. The ground colour, costa and fringe are creamy-white, the forewings with the brown subterminal and terminal <b>fasciae</b> reduced to spots between the veins. The hindwings have the postmedial, subterminal and terminal <b>fasciae</b> as the forewings.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15.5-18.5 mm {{for males}} and 15.5-18.5 mm for females. The costa of the forewings is pale buff and there are five brownish grey weakly lunulate <b>fasciae,</b> consisting of sub-basal, antemedial, postmedial and double subterminal <b>fasciae</b> all tending to converge towards the forewing apex.|$|R
5|$|In Thailand, {{the hybrid}} Camry has been {{available}} since 2009. Its unique and differs it from other Camry hybrids because the petrol version of the Thai Camry is built using the Aurion <b>fascia,</b> the hybrid version also makes use of the same body.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th or early 19th century {{it was given}} a Flemish Bond brick face and the rear was {{extended}} with a catslide roof. A slate-roofed, single-level extension {{was added to the}} south prior to 1867. The front ground floor was remodelled sometime between 1900 and 1930, with a doorcase removed and a <b>fascia</b> and cornice added. Later in the 20th century, single-storey extensions were added to the north in the 1960s, and also to the rear (both with flat roofs) and the south, including a uPVC conservatory. The front of the building was also modelled, with a wider front door, <b>fascia</b> sign and plinth added across both the original frontage and the extensions, dividing the architectural features of the ground and first floors. A large amount of the pre-1840 fabric of the building, including first floor joinery, survives into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 {{range of}} Naim {{equipment}} has aluminium chassis and sleeves; the <b>fascia</b> is die-cast zinc. Inside, circuit boards float, and the rear-mounted mains switch and IEC socket are decoupled to reduce microphony. Techradar {{noted that the}} XS, launched in late 2008, is the first Naim device to use a new bayonet PCB-mounting technique to float the circuitry.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 15.5 mm. The dorsal {{surface of the}} wings and the fringe are heavily speckled with greenish yellow scales, particularly on the <b>fasciae</b> and wing margins. The ventral surface of all wings is more evenly speckled with dark lemon and the <b>fasciae</b> are absent.|$|R

5|$|The Chevrolet Volt is a plug-in {{hybrid car}} {{manufactured}} by General Motors, also marketed in rebadged variants as the Buick Velite 5 in China, Holden Volt in Australia and New Zealand, {{and with a}} different <b>fascia</b> as the Vauxhall Ampera in the United Kingdom and as the Opel Ampera {{in the remainder of}} Europe.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, Cabral {{endured a}} plantar <b>fascia</b> tear while waterskiing {{and did not}} compete in cross country. He did not compete in the steeplechase until his sophomore season at Princeton. In his second time running the event, he won at the 2010 Penn Relays. That year he was the Ivy League outdoor 10,000 meter and steeplechase {{champion}} and the indoor runner-up in the 3000 meters and 5000 meters. He finished second at the NCAA championships {{with a time of}} 8:38.90.|$|E
5|$|SS V-Series Special Edition: {{following}} the 2009 cancellation of Pontiac brand in North America, the Pontiac G8 front-end <b>fascia</b> and other trimmings were fitted to approximately 1,500 Commodore SS Vs. Unveiled at the 2009 Deniliquin ute muster on 2 October, sales began in November. Unlike the G8 {{which was only}} offered as a sedan, Holden issued utility, sedan and Sportwagon body variants of the Special Edition. Due to {{the popularity of the}} Pontiac-inspired SS V, Holden announced on 14 January 2010 that production would be extended until March 2010.|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of the <b>fasciae</b> of the neck is their ability to define spaces, which may limit to some degree the spread of most infections and some tumors. "nFascia has been variously described in the literature {{as a collection of}} fat and fibrous tissue that seems to equate with a "fat layer" a thin but firm well-defined layer of fibrous tissue such as an aponeurosis. "nThe interest in the <b>fasciae</b> and spaces of the neck stems from early anatomic investigations was pe-formed by surgeons who were seeking ways to pre-dict the spread of infection. "nThey believed correctly that knowledge of such routes of spread would allow them to approach and drain abscesses more effectively. "nWith the utilization of CT and MR imaging, it has been noted that the growth of some tumors appears to be restricted by certain <b>fasciae</b> and knowledge of the anatomy of these <b>fasciae</b> allows one to predict such growth patterns. "nOnce the often complex anatomy of these <b>fasciae</b> is mastered, one can achieve {{a better understanding of the}} spread of both infections and some tumors in the neck...|$|R

5|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for heel pain is extensive and includes pathological entities including, {{but not limited}} to the following: calcaneal stress fracture, calcaneal bursitis, osteoarthritis, spinal stenosis involving the nerve roots of lumbar spinal nerve 5 (L5) or sacral spinal nerve 1 (S1), calcaneal fat pad syndrome, hypothyroidism, seronegative spondyloparthopathies such as reactive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, or rheumatoid arthritis (more likely if pain is present in both heels), plantar <b>fascia</b> rupture, and compression neuropathies such as tarsal tunnel syndrome or impingement of the medial calcaneal nerve.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve passes {{between the}} {{piriformis}} muscle and coccygeus (ischiococcygeus) muscles {{and leaves the}} pelvis through {{the lower part of}} the greater sciatic foramen. It crosses over the lateral part of the sacrospinous ligament and reenters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic foramen. After reentering the pelvis, it accompanies the internal pudendal artery and internal pudendal vein upwards and forwards along the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa, being contained in a sheath of the obturator <b>fascia</b> termed the pudendal canal, along with the internal pudendal blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid sits {{near the}} front of the neck, lying against and around the front of the larynx and trachea. The thyroid {{cartilage}} and cricoid cartilage lie just above the gland, below the Adam's apple. The isthmus extends from the second to third rings of the trachea, with the uppermost part of the lobes extending to the thyroid cartilage, and the lowermost around the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. The thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an outer layer. The outer layer is continuous with the pretracheal <b>fascia,</b> attaching the gland to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, via a thickening of the <b>fascia</b> to form the posterior suspensory ligament of thyroid gland also known as Berry's ligament. This causes the thyroid to move up and down with swallowing. The inner layer extrudes into the gland and forms the septae that divides the thyroid tissue into microscopic lobules. Typically four parathyroid glands, two on each side, lie on each side between the two layers of the capsule, {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15.5-16.5 mm {{for males}} and 15-15.5 mm for females. The forewings are white with the costa pale buff proximally. There are five brownish grey, weakly lunulate <b>fasciae,</b> consisting of subbasal, antemedial, postmedial and two subterminal <b>fasciae</b> which are more distinct on the hindwings than on the forewings.|$|R
