5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain walked down the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to {{check to see if}} they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E

5|$|The Corinthians {{gained a}} corner kick early on, and Cardiff cleared. This was {{followed}} up by a further {{attack by the}} amateurs, but R.G. Jenkins' shot went straight to Tom Farquharson in the Cardiff goal. Cardiff attacked twice in quick succession; both chances were squandered. A.H. Chadder, Frank Hartley and Jenkins moved up-field for Corinthian with some passing movement and played the ball through for Claude Ashton, but he shot wide of the post. Three corners followed for Cardiff, which were each stopped by Russell in goal for Corinthian stopped each chance. A few minutes later Len Davies headed the ball down to the feet of Ferguson, but the Cardiff player fired the ball wide of the goal despite being only a few <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> goal line. Just before half time, Cardiff won a direct free kick; Fred Keenor hammered the ball into a wall of Corinthian players.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{was born}} March 17, 1986, in Longview, Texas. He has an older sister, Jennifer. While {{he was in}} high school, his parents divorced. Davis {{attended}} Longview High School, playing shortstop on the school's varsity baseball team and pitching as well before graduating in 2004. He was originally chosen by the New York Yankees as the third-to-last pick of the 2004 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft (1,496th overall in the 50th round). However, he did not sign and opted to attend Navarro Junior College in Texas instead, beginning in 2005. At Navarro, he was used as a third baseman and first baseman. He was once again drafted, by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, in the 2005 MLB draft, however he did not sign. He was named a pre-season JUCO All-American by Baseball America in 2006, earning Region XIV East Zone Most Valuable Player honors. That year with Navarro, he hit 17 home runs, one of which hit a retail building 100 <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 380 sign on the outfield fence. Davis was then drafted again, this time by the Texas Rangers in the fifth round of the 2006 MLB draft.|$|E

50|$|The {{dimensions}} {{of an official}} touchtennis court are 12 m × 5 m for singles and 12 m × 6 m for doubles. However, variances of up to a metre are tolerated on all lines {{in order to make}} the game more accessible and varied. Mini red/10 and Under Tennis dimensions are perfectly suitable. Players can also utilize a badminton court by lowering the net and taping a new service line 1 <b>foot</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> badminton service line towards the baseline.|$|R

25|$|Because the Tube map ignores geography, it {{does not}} {{accurately}} depict the relative orientation and distance between stations.

50|$|In the New England region, {{baked beans}} are flavored either with maple syrup (Northern New England), or with {{molasses}} (Boston), and are traditionally cooked with salt pork in a beanpot in a brick oven for {{six to eight}} hours.

Today, baked beans can be made in a slow cooker or in a modern oven using a traditional beanpot, Dutch oven, or casserole dish.|$|R

25|$|In 1994, Malone {{signed with}} the Spurs, where he {{was used as a}} back-up center to superstar David Robinson. The 1994–95 NBA season was his last in the NBA, and at that time, he was the only {{remaining}} active former ABA player. During the final game of his NBA career, against the Charlotte Hornets, he hit a buzzer-beating three-point shot from the opposing free throw line, eighty <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> goal. It was only the eighth three-pointer of his career. He played 17 games for the Spurs.|$|E
25|$|In Game 6, Pippen {{made the}} {{signature}} play of his career. Midway {{in the third}} quarter, Pippen received the ball during a Bulls fast break, charging toward the basket. As center Patrick Ewing jumped up to defend the shot, Pippen fully extended the ball out, absorbing body contact and a foul from Ewing, and slammed the ball through the hoop with Ewing's hand in his face. Pippen landed several <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> basket along the baseline, incidentally walking over a fallen Ewing. He then made taunting remarks to both Ewing and then Spike Lee, who was standing courtside supporting the Knicks, thus receiving a technical foul. This extended the Bulls' lead to 17; they won 93–79.|$|E
25|$|After {{ordering}} his {{engineers to}} begin rebuilding the bridge, Jackson directed Col. Thomas T.

A Union artillery shell exploded only a few <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> generals mounted on horseback, although neither was injured. Jackson saw that Union artillery and infantry was reinforcing the position, and that Federal sharpshooters would play havoc with his engineers on the bridge.

25|$|The only {{recorded}} {{evidence of}} his pitching speed stems from 1958, when Dalkowski was sent by the Orioles to Aberdeen Proving Ground, a military installation. Here, using a radar machine, he was clocked at , a fast but not outstanding speed for a professional pitcher. However, several factors worked against Dalkowski: he had pitched a game the day before, he was throwing from a flat surface instead of from a pitcher's mound, {{and he had to}} throw pitches for 40minutes at a small target before the machine could capture an accurate measurement. Further, the device measured speed from a few <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> plate, instead of 10 feet from release as in modern times. This cost Dalkowski approximately 9 MPH, not even considering the other factors.|$|E
25|$|The three INLA men {{rushed through}} the {{turnstile}} leading to A wing's exercise yard.

The van was ordered to stop by the armed INLA men, however, the driver, John Park, thinking {{that he and the}} other officer were about to be taken hostage, intended to accelerate through the partially opened gates in a bid to escape. He was prevented from doing so when the gates were automatically shut. The other prison officers stationed at the forecourt gates had spotted the men on the roof, and assuming there was a prison escape in progress, activated the alarm system. The van was ten <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gates when it came to a halt. Neither of the two prison officers inside the van was armed.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{had made}} it back to the National Championship {{for the second year in}} a row after losing their best player and {{eventual}} NBA star Gordon Hayward of the Utah Jazz. They were able to come back into the post season trying to play the cinderella team that they were the previous year. They were seeded as the #8 spot when in fact they had played and won in some very important games that impressed the college basketball sports world. The Butler basketball team was able to pull off upset after upset, game winning shot after game winning shot. Matt Howard made the game winning free throw against The University Pittsburgh after they were losing by one and Matt was fouled 86 <b>feet</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> basket. That wouldn’t be the final of their close calls for this tournament, nor was it their first. Their first game they won by two points, then the close call with Pittsburgh, followed up by an exciting game which led to overtime against Florida in which Butler was able to come out victorious with the win.|$|E
