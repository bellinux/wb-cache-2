50|$|From 1826 to 1828, Petzval {{studied at}} the Institutum Geometricum in Buda, and earned an {{engineering}} diploma in 1828. In the same year, he joined the graduate degree program of the university, and became the self-appointed adjunct chair for the Physics Department (in 1831). From 1828 to 1835, Petzval simultaneously worked as an urban engineer {{for the city of}} Buda—particularly as a specialist in <b>flood</b> <b>abatement</b> and sewers—and studied mathematics, mechanics and practical geometry. He authored an unrealized plan to build a navigation channel around Buda. In 1830, his dam computations saved the city from an inundation caused by the flooding of the Danube. After he received his Ph.D. in 1832, he taught as an associate professor at the university. During this period, he also received a degree in mathematics. In 1835, he was appointed a university professor in higher mathematics.|$|E

Until recently, there has been a limited amount of readily available guidance on choosing <b>flood</b> <b>abatement</b> protection. FM Approvals, a division of FM Global, one of the world’s largest business property insurers, working together with the Association of State Floodplain Managers and the US Army Corps of Engineers have developed a National Flood Barrier Test Program after recognizing the urgent demand for reliable <b>flood</b> <b>abatement</b> products to mitigate potential losses.

40|$|This study characterises the {{abatement}} {{effect of}} large dams with fixed-crest spillways under extreme design flood conditions. In contrast to previous studies using specific hydrographs for {{flow into the}} reservoir and simplifications to obtain analytical solutions, an automated tool was designed for calculations based on a Monte Carlo simulation environment, which integrates models that represent the different physical processes in watersheds with areas of 150 ? 2000 km 2. The tool was applied to 21 sites that were uniformly distributed throughout continental Spain, with 105 fixed-crest dam configurations. This tool allowed a set of hydrographs to be obtained as an approximation for the hydrological forcing of a dam and the characterisation of {{the response of the}} dam to this forcing. For all cases studied, we obtained a strong linear correlation between the peak flow entering the reservoir and the peak flow discharged by the dam, and a simple general procedure was proposed to characterise the peak-flow attenuation behaviour of the reservoir. Additionally, two dimensionless coefficients were defined to relate the variables governing both the generation of the flood and its abatement in the reservoir. Using these coefficients, a model was defined to allow for the estimation of the <b>flood</b> <b>abatement</b> effect of a reservoir based on the available information. This model should be useful in the hydrological design of spillways and the evaluation of the hydrological safety of dams. Finally, the proposed procedure and model were evaluated and representative applications were presente...|$|E
50|$|The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD), {{originally}} {{known as}} the Sanitary District of Chicago is a special-purpose district, chartered to operate in northern Illinois since 1889. Although its name may imply otherwise, {{it is not a}} part of the City of Chicago's local government, but an independent agency of state government with an elected Board of Commissioners. MWRDGC's main purpose is the reclamation and treatment of wastewater and <b>flood</b> water <b>abatement</b> in Cook County to protect the health and safety of citizens and of area waterways. Perhaps its most notable achievement is the reversal of the flow of the Chicago River in 1900.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Floods and ensuing damage {{have always}} been a problem for man. Initial {{reaction}} to the frequent destruction was to avoid siting permanent domiciles on flood-prone lands. As a result of increasing population and pressure for development, flood control structures were built. Instead of reducing flood losses, however, flood control projects encouraged development of more hazardous zones by giving {{a false sense of security}} to flood plain occupants. In the 1960 's Congress began to evaluate alternatives to <b>flood</b> control and <b>abatement</b> projects in an attempt to retard and eventually eliminate further flood losses. In 1968 it sought to resolve the problems of aid to flood victims and reduce the increasing losses by enacting the National Flood Insurance Act (NFIA). If implemented the Act will furnish assistance to flood victims through insurance policies and reduce further losses by establishing a mandatory set of minimum standards for land use on flood plains. This study analyzes the problems and issues of implementing the NFIA in Oregon between enactment of the law in 1968 and June 1972. The study reveals that extensive revisions of local ordinances will be necessary if participating governments are to meet the minimum standards of the Federal Insurance Administration. The four standards most commonly omitted in the regulations promulgated by local governments are those pertaining to: fill in the floodway, raising utilities above the 100 -year flood level, providing adequate drainage, and considering neighboring flood plain programs. A sample of flood plain occupants suggests that the availability of flood insurance and the potential flood hazard of an area are, not widely known. In sum, the implementation of the NFIA proceeded slowly between enactment in 1968 and the summer of 1972. Even where it was accepted by local governments, the ordinance would not restrict flood plain use to the degree Congress intended...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{resources}} such as land, air, and water lay a critical foundation for the sustainable development of an urban community. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) {{is one of the}} most developed and rapidly developing regions in China, with abundant natural resources in water, intertidal zones, aquatic products, and a significant coastal estuary habitat. The PRD also covers two Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macao) and two Special Economic Zones (Shenzhen and Zhuhai), critically positioning it domestically and abroad. However, the increasing development of the economy has put pressure on the security of its water resources. These resources have sharply deteriorated in the PRD as the result of a mass and unordered overuse of water and soil resources and the lack of coordinated efforts among different functional departments. Various problems related to the water environment (such as flooding, rapid development of the deposition, water pollution, saltwater intrusion, and waterway atrophy) have directly threatened the social stability, sustainable development of the economy, and the supply of water in the region. To date, the population affected by a shortage of high-quality water has reached 16 million due to pollution of the water supply source in Guangdong province. At this time, the water pollution in the PRD has resulted in ever-increasing economic and environmental losses. Pollution coverage includes Hong Kong, Macao, and Guangdong and, because governmental functions and scientific technologies among these regions differ, there is little in the way of efficient, cooperative efforts to fully make use of their individual advantages to protect the water environment in the PRD. Moreover, the diversity and complexity of the problems even interfere with the abilities of functional departments within one region (e. g., <b>flood</b> prevention, pollution <b>abatement,</b> and channel maintenance) to make decisions and formulate protection policies using advanced spatial technologies such as remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS). Consequently, the water environment in the PRD lacks unified and synergistic operations, and water resource protection is restricted to satisfying the demands of economic development and the requirements of sustainable development. To date, it is clear that cooperation amongst Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao should be strengthened. More research is also essential, specifically regarding the reduction of gross pollution emissions by 8 to 10 percent. In addition, the water environmental protection of the PRD has engaged with the Integrative Planning of the Environmental Protection in the PRD (2009 - 2020). This emphasizes strengthening the regional collaborative linkages, constructing an integrative platform of environmental monitoring, and realizing the shared and collaborative management of environmental information among different departments. With this in mind, the study on constructing a unified and synergistic system for water environment analysis in the PRD area are proposed as interdisciplinary and comprehensive research using multiple methods and fields. Based on the analysis of the fusion techniques of multisource, multi-date, and isomerous images, a database for integrating remote sensing monitoring data of water quality and quantity, actual measurement data, and relevant basic geographical data (watercourse data, section data, and a Digital Elevation Model) will be developed. Combining the research on general analytical methods and models, the capsulation mechanism of analytical methods and models will be designed. Lastly, using GIS integration techniques, an integrative monitoring demonstrative platform of water quality and quantity will be developed to assist collaborative research and decision making among the functional departments of the three regions. The goal is to promote the sustainable use of the water resources in the PRD, to achieve sustainable economic development and to increase the informatization of the PRD region. The construction of the system consists of four parts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This study {{provides}} a framework for assessing the social and environmen-tal benefits and public education outcomes associated with the U. S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management’s Community Assistance and Hazardous Fuel Programs in California. Evaluations of fire hazard mitigation programs tend to focus primarily {{on the number of}} acres treated and treatment costs associated with mitigation without adequately assessing the benefits of these treatments. While some evaluations account for the value of protected structures or the avoided costs of sup-pression, few account for the ecosystem service value of protected natural capital. Examples include the water purification and <b>flood</b> <b>abatement</b> functions of wetlands, the hydrologic regulation functions of forests, and the recreational value of various natural landscapes. The total economic value approach to environmental assessment used in this study includes both the market-based and nonmarket values that are at risk from wildfire, particularly ecosystem goods and services. Using a decision support methodology, the data allows the BLM to more effectively quantify and account for the social and environmental benefits derived from fire mitigation treatments. Sug-gestions are provided for how this approach could effectively be scaled up and used at a national, regional, or Statewide level to analyze the efficacy of all BLM programs. Although this approach is currently compatible with BLM current reporting system, the assessment provides recommendations on how to augment the evaluation system so that future program elements or “system ” elements that enable (or prevent) communi-ties to take part in raising awareness and taking action for themselves are evaluated at the broader BLM program level for the Community Assistance and Hazardous Fuel Programs in California...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{historical}} hindsight, this paper shows that sea-level rise {{has played a}} fundamental {{role in the development of}} the low-lying environment of the Netherlands. It was beneficial in morphological terms during the mid-Holocene, but from Roman times, it has been a threat to the coastal zone evolution and human habitation. Collective human response started to play a role in coastal evolution as early as the ninth century, while its influence started to become a major factor during the nineteenth and twentieth century. Throughout its history, Dutch society has always been receptive to new technologies, approaches, and policies in its dealings with the many water-related challenges. The success of concerted human response explains why the water boards were successful as the first democratic institutions in the Netherlands. Development of technology and increasing financial means (the Dutch Golden Age) gave rise to increasingly viable <b>flood</b> <b>abatement</b> measures and reclamation projects, which took place on increasingly larger scales. This culminated in large-scale works such as the closure of the Zuiderzee and the Delta Project in the twentieth century. During this project, a turning point in thinking emerged; while flood protection remained a top priority, human interventions were considered in a broader, more holistic context with natural values being weighed against socioeconomic interests. In the face of the challenges of the twenty-first century, policy and management approaches as well as science and technology approaches need to be adapted further in accordance to the principles of working with nature in a trans-disciplinary way. The success of this adaptation will to a large extent determine the viability of the Dutch society as a whole...|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} and restoration of wetlands is {{widely seen as}} a critical tool for replacing ecosystem functions lost by historic wetland destruction. However, {{studies have shown that}} these wetlands often take hundreds of years to achieve the functions for which they are restored. We used controlled field-scale manipulations in four recently restored depressional freshwater wetlands in western New York to investigate the impact of organic amendments of differing lability on the soil and vegetative development during the first 3 yr. Results showed that the addition of soil amendments to wetland plots stimulates development of key soil properties that are critical for wetland functioning. In particular, initial increases in soil C and decreases in bulk density in topsoil and biochar amended plots were still present 3 yr after restoration. Plant biomass recovered quickly and had reached levels of comparable natural wetlands within 2 yr, irrespective of amendments. Amendments did not influence plant diversity. Site differences, however, did influence plant diversity and different sites hosted different numbers and types of species. Two years after restoration, both desirable native wetland species and undesirable weedy species had colonized each site. Results of this research reveal that organic amendments can improve key soil properties critical for wetland functioning. The strength of treatment effects and the development of the plant community, however, are highly influenced by initial site conditions. These results confirm the importance of focusing on both hastening soil development via amendments and careful site selection in restoration design. Abbreviations: BD, bulk density; CEC, cation exchange capacity; SOM, soil organic matter. Although they cover less than 2 % of earth’s surface, wetlands perform more ecosystem services (e. g., water purification, aquifer recharge, climate regulation, long-term C storage, <b>flood</b> <b>abatement,</b> and habitat provision) per hectare than any other ecosystem type (Aselmann and Crutzen...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Taking {{advantage}} of a favorable physical system but also risking the hazards of flooding, man has long occupied flood plain land. He has attempted to adjust rivers to his needs {{in order to reduce}} flood loss, but the rising cost of flood protection accompanied by an increase in flood damage potential warrants that a course of human adjustment be undertaken on occupied flood plains. The flood plain of the Willamette River between Albany and Corvallis, Oregon provides an opportunity to study the resource use of a flood plain in a relatively youthful stage of economic development, having the physical as sets and limitations of most flood plains. By studying the physical system and changing resource utilization of this flood plain, an evaluation has been made of the present and possible future use of its resource base. Land use has evolved from a primitive stage of hunting, fishing, and gathering to intensive agricultural endeavors with some residential and commercial development. Resource utilization during the same period has changed from a dependence on the flora and fauna for food and clothing to a dependence on the soil and climate, flood protection, markets, labor, and so forth. The change has been towards a more intensive, higher valued use of the land with more sophisticated land management practices. A relatively satisfactory arrangement of land use presently exists on the Albany-Corvallis flood plain; however, present land use practices in the study area reflect a rational use of flood subjected land primarily because the pressures of industrial and commercial development have not yet been heavily felt. Residential expansion, however, has taken place at an alarming rate. Many of the human adjustments suggested by Gilbert White in his flood plain studies at the University of Chicago are applicable to a future course of orderly occupance for the Albany-Corvallis flood plain. One of the more applicable local forms of adjustment is the directing of flood plain use which involves land elevation, land use regulation, structural modifications, flood insurance, relief, and better warning systems. The construction of engineering works for <b>flood</b> <b>abatement</b> represents the traditional form of river adjustment in the Willamette Basin. The building of storage dams upstream of the study area has lowered the height of the flood crest but has also given many flood plain dwellers a feeling of false security. Channel improvements and bank revetments are the main form of river adjustment in the study area, and they help to reduce the danger of crop drowning and to control bank erosion...|$|E
40|$|Wetlands are {{productive}} transitional lands between terrestrial {{and aquatic}} systems. They provide social, {{economic and cultural}} values, while providing valuable services such as carbon storage, water purification, <b>flood</b> <b>abatement</b> and biodiversity support. While wetlands only cover ~ 3 % of the globe, they contribute up to 40 % of these global renewable ecosystem services. Worldwide degradation of wetlands through urbanisation, conversion to agriculture and flood management schemes {{has resulted in a}} 50 % loss of the worlds original wetlands, with New Zealand being one of the most extreme examples of this with > 90 % of the original extent of wetlands being lost. Wetlands unique hydrology results in distinct plant zonation and community composition and seedling survival is the primary factor that influences stand structure and community composition. However, restoring degraded wetlands is challenging because the alterations to the hydrology through filling or diverting water will impact the effect of physical, chemical and biotic environmental variables on native plant establishment. The use of facilitation in restoration through successional planting using nurse trees, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is common in restoration, however research into the effectiveness of these techniques in wetland systems is lacking. This thesis is comprised of two studies with aims to determine the factors that had the biggest impact on the survival and growth of kahikatea and totara in Wairio wetland and inform future restoration. Wairio wetland has large isolated remnant kahikatea trees, so my first study focused on how these established trees and a connection to fungal hyphae networks influenced the survival and growth of newly planted saplings. One sapling of each species was planted at the dripline of the remnant tree, and another sapling of each species was planted 2 metres from that point. Out of the 16 remnant kahikatea trees used, 8 were ‘disturbance’ plots where saplings were planted in 35 μm mesh bags that excluded roots but fungal hyphae could penetrate, in slotted pots which were turned every 3 months. In the 8 remaining ‘undisturbed’ plots, saplings were planted into the ground. I assessed the influence of distance and disturbance on sapling survival and growth using a chi-square test of independence and general linear models. Results showed that kahikatea trees survived better than totara overall. The survival of totara was significantly reliant on a close proximity to the remnant kahikatea, and a connection with mycorrhizal networks. Kahikatea had greater biomass than totara, however they suffered strong conspecific competition with the remnant trees, with kahikatea saplings planted at the dripline having 51. 28 g greater biomass with regular disturbance of AMF mycelium. Kahikatea trees are light demanding species, and therefore growing under the canopy of a parent tree has a negative impact on kahikatea saplings growth. Knowing that kahikatea and totara trees respond differently to nurse trees and AMF, my second study focused on how nurse effects and AMF association changes with chemical, physical and environmental stressors. The survival and growth of 5 -year-old kahikatea and totara trees, with or without a nurse across 10 blocks in Wairio wetland were analysed. At each tree, soil moisture and root available nutrients were measured and soil cores were taken to determine gravimetric soil moisture, reduction-oxidation reaction (redox), pH, soil carbon content and I counted the presence of AMF spores in two size classes. I assessed tree survival and growth against these variables using a chi-squared test of independence and general linear models. The results of this study showed that kahikatea survived better than totara trees in the very wet blocks, where no other species survived. Totara trees survived in the upland sites of the wetland and had better growth than kahikatea trees. Moreover, totara trees grew 24 cm taller {{in the presence of a}} nurse tree, and were strongly positively associated with spore number. Nurse trees further benefitted totara trees by increasing plant available soil nitrate and potassium by almost double...|$|E
