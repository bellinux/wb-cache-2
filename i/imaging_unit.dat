Up to now mostly all projection systems {{are based on}} reflective and/or transmissive microdisplays like digital micromirror devices (DMDs), nematic liquid crystals displays (LCDs) or liquid crystal on silicon displays (LCOS). But the size of necessary light source and illumination optics is a strong limitation for the miniaturization of the projection system itself or for system integration. Here we propose to use a high-brightness OLED-microdisplay as active element for image or pattern generation, giving the possibility to realize compact projection or <b>imaging</b> <b>units.</b> Optical parameters of the microdisplays are determined to get input data for optical system design. Based on these experimental results specially adapted optical systems are designed.

30|$|Pierre Schnyder, head of {{radiology}} at CHUV in Lausanne (Switzerland), described self-referral {{politics as}} representing {{the cornerstone of}} turf wars [2], with interventional radiology being especially at risk. The possibility of controlling specific <b>imaging</b> <b>units</b> or <b>imaging</b> technologies offers an attractive alternative for self-referring clinicians, but it may stimulate detrimental competition for patients, space, and resources. Moreover, internal competition among specialists interested in imaging {{may result in a}} deterioration of normally collegial relationships. There is also evidence that self-referral of imaging services often leads to overuse of services and creates unjustified health care expenses [1]. It is also suggested that “the accuracy of imaging procedures is compromised because many self-referring physicians do not have any comparable imaging training or expertise” [1]. Additional knowledge in understanding the acquisition and display processes of medical images is not something that can be acquired as a sideline to the practice of another medical specialty.|$|R
