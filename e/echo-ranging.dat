The minesweeper experienced her first enemy contact on 20 February while escorting [...] from Bermuda to Norfolk, Virginia when an escorting aircraft dropped a smoke bomb 2,500 yards astern. Picking up suspected submarine wake noise with her <b>echo-ranging</b> equipment, Sentinel attacked on two contacts within a 25-minute period. There {{was no evidence}} of damage to the enemy, except for some dark brown or black matter which appeared after the second starboard depth charge exploded.|$|E
50|$|The {{next two}} decades saw the {{development}} of several applications of underwater acoustics. The fathometer, or depth sounder, was developed commercially during the 1920s. Originally natural materials {{were used for the}} transducers, but by the 1930s sonar systems incorporating piezoelectric transducers made from synthetic materials were being used for passive listening systems and for active <b>echo-ranging</b> systems. These systems were used to good effect during World War II by both submarines and anti-submarine vessels. Many advances in underwater acoustics were made which were summarised later in the series Physics of Sound in the Sea, published in 1946.|$|E
5000|$|After {{conducting}} minesweeping {{operations in}} the Pearl Harbor channel and other Hawaiian waters, Vireo underwent upkeep at Pearl Harbor between 10 and 13 February 1942. Following local operations near Honolulu and Pearl Harbor, she made brief runs to Johnston Island and the port of Hilo. In April and May 1942, after another brief stretch around Pearl Harbor, Vireo conducted local patrols out of Hilo, sometimes in company with [...] to conduct magnetic, acoustic, and mechanical minesweeping operations; and to patrol harbors with her <b>echo-ranging</b> and listening gear. From 23 to 24 April, Vireo, in company with Crossbill and , conducted a search for survivors of a downed Army plane off Pepeekeo Point, near Hilo, and found one body before she abandoned the task.|$|E
5000|$|In July 1915, the British Admiralty {{set up the}} Board of Invention and Research to {{evaluate}} suggestions from the public as well as carrying out their own investigations. Some 14,000 suggestions were received about combating submarines. In December 1916, the RN set up its own Anti-Submarine Division (from which came the term [...] "Asdic") but relations with the BIR were poor. After 1917 most ASW work {{was carried out by}} ASD. In the U.S., a Naval Consulting Board was set up in 1915 {{to evaluate}} ideas. After American entry into the war in 1917, they encouraged work on submarine detection. The U.S. National Research Council, a civilian organization, brought in British and French experts on underwater sound to a meeting with their American counterparts in June 1917. In October 1918, there was a meeting in Paris on [...] "supersonics", a term used for <b>echo-ranging,</b> but the technique was still in research {{by the end of the}} war.|$|E
5000|$|On 5 October, she escorted Arkansas (BB-33) into New York {{and joined}} the screen for Texas (BB-35) for nine days of {{exercises}} in shore bombardment and other drills before joining convoy UGS-21 which sailed from Norfolk, bound for North Africa. Thompson served as an escort, keeping ships in the channel as they plodded out to sea and prodding them to close up and keep in formation, while her <b>echo-ranging</b> gear was alert for prowling submarines off Chesapeake Bay. One day out, 16 October, (UGS.21 sailed from Hampton Roads on the 5th November and therefore I believe {{this to be the}} 6th November) the wind and sea rose, presaging a heavy storm which served to scatter parts of the convoy and cause Thompson to note in her log numerous times, [...] "telling stragglers to close up." [...] After the transatlantic voyage, Thompson was released from escort duty on 31 October to proceed to Casablanca, French Morocco.|$|E
5000|$|Along with [...] and , Plunger {{was part}} of the first US Navy {{offensive}} operation of World War II. Her orders sent her to Kii Suido, a principal entrance into the Inland Sea and an important funnel to industrial bases in the area. The three boats took two important technological devices into enemy waters: the Mark VI magnetic exploder for their Mark 14 torpedoes, and the primitive SD radar set. Shortly after White arrived on station, Plunger was seen by a Japanese destroyer which came on using powerful <b>echo-ranging</b> sonarâ€”or [...] "pinging." [...] Hearing the pinging was a jolt. The submarine force had not known for certain, until now, that the Japanese had such gear. The Japanese not only had it, they knew how to use it. The destroyer found Plunger and unleashed twenty-four close depth charges. It was a vicious, determined attack, the first for both the hunter and the hunted in Empire waters. It jarred the boat and crew severely. White was thankful that he had put back into Pearl Harbor to repair the weakness in the hull. Had he not, Plunger might not have survived.|$|E
5000|$|Around 1400 on 6 June, Japanese {{submarine}} I-168 fired torpedoes at {{the nearly}} helpless targets. Hammann, mortally hit, broke {{in two and}} sank alongside the towering carrier, which also took two torpedoes. As the destroyer sank, her depth charges all went off at once, causing tremendous shock waves which convulsed swimmers {{in the water and}} violently wrenched the old tug. Vireo freed herself from the carrier by cutting the towing cable with an acetylene torch and then doubled back to commence rescue operations. Up her sides clambered carriermen and destroyermen alike, while she maneuvered near the carrier's canting stern to take on board members of the salvage party who had chosen to abandon the carrier from there. She then proceeded to secure alongside the wounded flattop in the exact spot where Hammann had met her doom. Yorktown rolled heavily, her heavy steel hide pounding the lighter former minecraft's hull with a vengeance as the ships touched time and time again during the rescue operations. This mission completed, battered Vireo stood away from the sinking carrier, which sank shortly after dawn on the 7th. Vireo's troubles, however, had only begun. Underwater explosions from Hammann's depth charges had severely jostled the tug's rudder. As a result, it jammed as Vireo was entering the shipping channel at Midway harbor on 8 June, and she ran aground on a coral head, carrying away her <b>echo-ranging</b> gear and flooding her sound room. Repeated attempts to free herself only resulted in another grounding, so Vireo lay-to and called for a tow. After arriving at Midway Island {{at the end of a}} towline from YMT-12, following another brush with a coral head which irreparably damaged the rudder, Vireo soon got underway for Pearl Harbor, this time behind [...] Reaching Hawaiian waters on 17 June, she entered the navy yard at Pearl Harbor for emergency repairs which lasted from 18 to 30 June. Following this, she remained at the Pearl Harbor yard for a complete overhaul and drydocking.|$|E

40|$|Computerized seismic {{prospecting}} is an <b>echo-ranging</b> technique usually targeted at accurate mapping {{of oil and}} gas reservoirs. In seismic surveys an impulsive source, often an explosive charge, located at the earthâ€™s surface generates elastic waves which propagate in the subsurface; these waves are scattered by the earthâ€™s geological discontinuities back to the surface, where an array of receivers registers the reflected signals. The data recorded are then processed in a complex sequence of steps. Among them, seismic migration and stacking velocity estimation represent two characteristic components of the process solving the inverse problem of recovering the structure and the physical parameters of the earthâ€™s geologic layers from echo measurements. A complementary tool in relating seismic data to the earthâ€™s inhomogeneities is provided by seismic numerical models, which assume a subsurface structure and compute the seismic data which would be collected in a field survey, by solving the direct problem of exploration geophysics. This paper describes a vectorized and parallelized implementation of a two-dimensional seismic elastic model on the IBM 3090 VF Vector Multiprocessor. An implementation of a parallel seismic migration algorithm is then described, The paper also reports performance data for a vectorlparallel implementation on the IBM 3090 of some typical seismic velocity estimation algorithms. The three problems chosen are representative of a wide class of geophysical computations, and the results summarized in this paper show their suitability for efficient implementation on the IBM 3090 Vector Multiprocessor; combined vector/parallel speedups in the range 15 - 25 are in fact observed.

40|$|The {{directivity}} index {{which is currently}} used for characterizing the directional properties of transducers, refers primarily {{to their ability to}} radiate sound power. When transducers are used in echo ranging, the {{directivity index}} is, theoretically at least, of minor interest. Of greater interest is the ability of the transducer to discriminate between the echo from a target at which it is pointed, and the reverberation returned to it from this and other directions. This discrimination is measured by other quantities, called reverberation indices. One of these concerns volume, the other surface or bottom reverberation. The purpose of the present work was to study the relations between the three indices. Conclusions drawn from a study of typical projector patterns are as follows: 1. The volume reverberation index and the surface reverberation index of a projector are linearly related to the directivity index, provided that the directivity pattern is reasonably similar to that of a circular piston in an infinite baffle. This condition is found in the <b>echo-ranging</b> projectors studied when they are operated at 24 kc without domes. However, the directivity index does not provide a reliable measure of the reverberation indices when the projector pattern has abnormally strong side lobes. 2. Neither projector housing studied has appreciable effect on reverberation indices. 3. The echo: reverberation ratio depends almost entirely on the shape of the main lobe of the composite directivity pattern between zero and - 6 db. As a result, the reverberation indices of a transceiver can be determined by measuring the width of its directivity pattern at - 6 db. Half of this angle will be termed the half-width of the pattern. 4. Since the reverberation indices can be so readily calculated from the half-width, it is recommended that this quantity be specified in describing a transducer. The directivity index usually, but not always, can be calculated from the half-width to within 3 db...|$|E
