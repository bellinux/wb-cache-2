5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they would have a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> through {{a thick layer of}} fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E
5|$|Several years earlier, Alaska {{politicians}} had {{speculated that}} Gravel {{would have a}} <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> both renominated and elected when his first term expired, given that he was originally elected without a base party organization and {{tended to focus on}} national rather than local issues.|$|E
5|$|At {{various times}} during the program, NASA {{managers}} and personnel found themselves limited in terms of resources and manpower, particularly as Phase Two geared up, and had a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> anywhere with NASA administration. One particular area of contention was with crew assignments to missions. Many astronauts allege that the method of selection prevented the most skilled people from performing roles they were best-suited for.|$|E

As of June 8, the state Senate was {{expected}} to consider the bill the following week, but the bill, according to news reports, would face a <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> passed in the state Senate. Gov. Roy Cooper has said he supports the legislation.|$|R

50|$|The key {{struggle}} {{is the relationship}} of the two men to Martha. Yorick develops a relationship with Martha quickly. Ondrej, a virgin, has a <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> close to Martha, not withstanding prodding by Yorick. In an odd move, Yorick has himself arrested and is sent to jail for a year during which time Martha and Ondrej's relationship develops.|$|R
5|$|All whales have a {{thick layer}} of blubber. In species that live near the poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators would have a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators would have a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} begins {{nine months after}} the pilot episode. After Pete and Jenny's baby is born in Episode 1, the couple have a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> any sleep. Pete has {{to cope with the}} death of his father in Episode 4. Adam and Rachel decide to rent a house together. He is horrified to {{discover}} in Episode 2 that she is married to another man. While he is staying with Pete and Jenny, Rachel has sex with her visiting husband (Lennie James)—who leaves soon after—and is pregnant by Episode 6. Just as hers and Adam's relationship is recovering, she tells him that he might not be the father, and that she is moving to London until the birth. Karen and David have recently hired Ramona as a nanny to their young son Josh. At her publishing job, Karen edits the novel of a renowned author (Denis Lawson), whom she becomes attracted to. She plans to sleep with him on a book tour but is humiliated when she finds out he is not attracted to her. David tries to sleep with Ramona to get back at Karen, which causes friction between the couple. They seek guidance counselling to repair their marriage.|$|E
50|$|Whereas Mar-Vell and Rick {{formed a}} strong {{friendship}} during their time together, Genis-Vell and Rick {{have a much}} <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> along. Genis' alien (and immature) perspective make him unfathomable to Rick's jaded-sidekick sensibilities. Their ability {{to see and hear}} what the other is experiencing lead to awkward situations with Rick's wife, Marlo Chandler, and Genis' many amorous partners. Eventually, however, they become good friends.|$|R

5000|$|An August 2012 {{report by}} UNRWA of the blockade's effects and general trends in Gaza {{forecasted}} that the region's population growth would outpace developments in economic infrastructure. In its press release, UN humanitarian coordinator Maxwell Gaylard said, [...] "Gaza will have {{half a million}} more people by 2020 while its economy will grow only slowly. In consequence, the people of Gaza will have an even <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> enough drinking water and electricity, or sending their children to school." ...|$|R
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, {{but has a}} <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> started as she is afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints {{are already in the}} computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E
25|$|All {{dolphins}} have a {{thick layer}} of blubber, thickness varying on climate. This blubber can help with buoyancy, protection to some extent as predators would have a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> through {{a thick layer}} of fat, and energy for leaner times; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. Calves, generally, are born with a thin layer of blubber, which develops at different paces depending on the habitat.|$|E
25|$|Much {{consolidation}} {{occurred in}} the financial services industry since, {{but not at the}} scale some had expected. Retail banks, for example, do not tend to buy insurance underwriters, as they seek to engage in a more profitable business of insurance brokerage by selling products of other insurance companies. Other retail banks were slow to market investments and insurance products and package those products in a convincing way. Brokerage companies had a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> into banking, because {{they do not have a}} large branch and backshop footprint. Banks have recently tended to buy other banks, such as the 2004 Bank of America and Fleet Boston merger, yet they have had less success integrating with investment and insurance companies. Many banks have expanded into investment banking, but have found it hard to package it with their banking services, without resorting to questionable tie-ins which caused scandals at Smith Barney.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{believe that}} the doors were small so prisoners would have a <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> out, {{minimizing}} {{an attack on a}} security guard. Others have explained the small doors forced the prisoners to bow while entering their cell. This design is related to penance and ties to the religious inspiration of the prison. The cells were made of concrete with a single glass skylight, representing the [...] "Eye of God", suggesting to the prisoners that God was always watching them.|$|R

Although some commentators have suggested that the Court's ruling is [...] "unlikely to have any broad or long-term impact", others have stated that the Court's ruling [...] "means that REITs like Americold will have a much <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> (or keeping) their cases in federal court." ...|$|R

25|$|In the post-SummerSlam wedding reception, Roberts {{and his new}} ally, The Undertaker, {{made their}} {{presence}} known by hiding a live snake {{in one of the}} newly married couple's wedding presents; Elizabeth was frightened when she opened the gift box, and the Undertaker blindsided Savage by knocking him out with the urn. Sid Justice ran off both Roberts and The Undertaker. Savage, still unable to compete due to his WrestleMania VII loss to the Ultimate Warrior, immediately began a public campaign to have himself reinstated as an active wrestler to gain revenge on Roberts; however, WWF President Jack Tunney refused. Meanwhile, Roberts cut a series of promos berating Savage. The feud began to boil over during a television taping for WWF Superstars of Wrestling October 21 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, when Roberts cut an in-ring promo to goad Savage – who was providing TV commentary – into the ring. After he was lured into the ring, Roberts attacked Savage, eventually tying Savage into the ropes before getting a live king cobra to bite his arm, according to Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts on the Pick Your Poison DVD that the snake was holding on with the fangs and that Jake had a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> the snake off Randy. Sid Justice was originally supposed to be the victim of the snake bite, but due to a biceps injury, Savage accepted to be snake bitten.|$|E
500|$|Tot Mitică offers other glimpses {{into the}} character's {{financial}} problems, showing him complaining {{that he has}} been [...] "pulling the devil's tail"—using a traditional proverb to indicate that he has had a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> by. To this, he adds that the devil would be suing him for injuries. He claims {{that he is going to}} spend his vacation in the mountains, and elaborates that he is talking about the pawnbroking institution known as muntele de pietate (from the French for [...] "Mountain of Piety"; see Mont de Piété). Mitică enters a restaurant to order only things which he knows are free ("a toothpick, a match, a glass of water and a newspaper"). In other such sequences of events, he is shown eating in a pub as a means to [...] "defend himself from death", and borrowing money which he promises not to return.|$|E
500|$|Scouts for the {{professional}} football teams described Walker as a [...] "Big physical receiver, who uses his size to muscle {{the ball away}} from defenders...Lacks explosive speed, but has exceptional body control and balance." [...] In another scouting report he {{was described as a}} [...] "Striding-type runner who is not quick or sudden. Dominates average defensive backs but has a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> separation vs. a good corner" [...] In direct questioning during interviews, Walker confessed that he never had run a 40-yard dash and did not practice straight line speed. Thus, there was some consensus {{that he did not have}} the speed to play wide receiver in the National Football League and that he did not work on his speed. It was also said that he [...] "Lacks soft hands and will do a lot of double-catching and body-catching. Has a lot of drops for a featured No. 1 receiver." ...|$|E
50|$|The Knicks had a <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> to {{the playoffs}} than the Spurs did.

Instead, New York fired general manager Ernie Grunfeld and allowed Van Gundy to lead the team {{to the playoffs}}, with the team barely {{qualifying}} as the #8 seed.

[...] Mann also observed that [...] "Chief Justice John Roberts has not yet assigned any major opinions to Sotomayor, and this case leaves that pattern intact." [...] Amy Howe also wrote that the Court's ruling [...] "means that REITs like Americold will have a much <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> (or keeping) their cases in federal court." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....in retrospect, {{it looks}} like where the {{movement}} was beginning to slide into predictability, even if both singers {{are more or less}} in command of their talents here. Though still {{at the peak of his}} popularity, Waylon had begun to slip slightly creatively starting with the very good, but not great, Are You Ready for the Country, which suggested that he was having a little <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> a full album of consistently great material together. The patchwork nature of this album suggests that he still had the problem, but since it was divided into three solo songs apiece and five duets, this plays to his strengths, because the limited number of new songs doesn't give him room to stumble." ...|$|R
500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E

Referee Jersey Joe Walcott, a former World Heavyweight Champion himself, had a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> Ali to go to a neutral corner.

2500|$|Unemployment reached 25 {{percent in}} the worst days of 1932–33, but it was {{unevenly}} distributed. Job losses were [...] less severe among women than men, among workers in nondurable industries (such as food and clothing), in services and sales, and in government jobs. The least skilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates, as did young people who had a <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> their first job, and men {{over the age of}} 45 who if they lost their job would seldom find another one because employers had their choice of younger men. Millions were hired in the Great Depression, but men with weaker credentials were never hired, and fell into a long-term unemployment trap. The migration that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities in the 1920s suddenly reversed itself, as unemployment made the cities unattractive, and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{women have}} lower {{personal}} financial assets than men. This means {{that for a}} given opportunity and equally capable individual, women must secure additional resources compared to men in order to exploit the opportunity; because, they control less capital. The question of whether women have a <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>getting</b> finance than men for the same business opportunity has developed into its own sub-field. One possible issue in raising outside capital is that 96% of senior venture capitalists are men {{and may not be}} as understanding of female-centric businesses. However, the situation seems to be improving. A study by Babson College showed that in 1999, fewer than 5% of venture capital investments went to companies with a woman on the executive team.
