25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>grabs.</b> We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of this terrible tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E

50|$|Deviationist doctrine, {{according}} to Unger, represents {{an attempt to}} bridge doctrine with empirical social theory and ideological conflict. Such an expanded form of doctrine fights over the terms of social life, and refuses to accept that established forms of society reflect any practical or psychological necessities. Everything <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>grabs.</b> Such doctrine aims to point out how biased, power-ridden and makeshift legal materials have gained a semblance of necessity {{that they should not}} be granted. In brief, deviationist doctrine encourages theorists to transform society by taking an ideal from one part of social life, and extending it into an area from which it had previously been excluded. This has the advantage of allowing the theorist to draw upon a rich collective history of ideas and institutions that have helped to articulate the ideal in the past, and can now be marshaled to defend its extension into a new area of social life.|$|E

5000|$|AllMusic {{reviewer}} Thom Jurek states [...] "For {{the most}} part, it is a spare and lovely beauty of an album, with few surprises {{save for the}} elegance that Sakamoto performs these indelible pieces with". PopMatters John Garrett noted [...] "An important selling point for Playing the Piano is how Ryuichi Sakamoto takes the opportunity to “cover himself”, so to speak. His soundtrack work <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>grabs</b> {{as well as a}} fantastic pre-Yellow Magic Orchestra composition called “Thousand Knives”. The advantage of this is that Sakamoto boils these pieces down to their skeletal form, presenting them to the listener in a way that’s probably close to how he was writing them all these years ago". Sputnikmusic stated [...] "This album {{is a testament to the}} fact that a truly wonderful song needs nothing else to make it special. Although not every song shines, every one of them has something unique about it. That makes this album grand. Only one piano creates true emotion, and unique songs".|$|E
