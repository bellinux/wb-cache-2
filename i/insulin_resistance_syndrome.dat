40|$|In this thesis, {{different}} aspects of the <b>insulin</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>syndrome</b> in relation to plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) activity are investigated in a longitudinal population-based study. Participants were men investigated at ages 50 and 70 with follow-up data on mortality. High PAI- 1 activity was associated with low insulin sensitivity, high concentrations of serum triglycerides, high body mass index and high waist/hip ratio, independently of each other and of potential confounders. Low birth weight predicted high blood pressure, insulin resistance, truncal obesity and high PAI- 1 activity but not the abdominal obesity or dyslipidaemia present in the <b>insulin</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Increased physical activity level between 50 and 70 years of age, in the absence of active intervention, was associated with improved glucose, insulin, proinsulin and lipoprotein metabolism. Insulin and proinsulin seemed to be important factors that mediate much of the association between a sedentary lifestyle and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The reported dietary intake of both mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids was positively associated with PAI- 1 activity, whereas saturated fatty acid intake displayed no association. The associations present between PAI- 1 activity and the fatty acid proportions in serum cholesterol esters were partly influenced by factors related with the <b>insulin</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>syndrome.</b> This thesis provides further knowledge to the epidemiological view of the interrelations of the <b>insulin</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>syndrome,</b> PAI- 1, birth weight, and lifestyle factors as physical activity and dietary habits.

METHODS: A total of 811 non-diabetic relatives from 278 pedigrees of northern European extraction in which there was a sib-pair with Type 2 diabetes were recruited and studied at the six Diabetes UK Warren Type 2 diabetes centres. Heritability estimates were calculated, allowing for key covariates (age, sex, BMI and recruitment centre). Values greater than 0. 10 were considered statistically significant in comparison to zero. RESULTS: Fasting glucose concentration and homeostasis model assessment of pancreatic beta cell function (HOMA %B) had the highest heritability estimates of 0. 72 and 0. 78 respectively. Heritability estimates for the features of the <b>insulin</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>syndrome</b> (BMI, WHR, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum lipids and homeostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity [HOMA %S]) were also high. The heritability estimate for fasting glucose was markedly higher in the present study (0. 77 vs 0. 21 adjusted for age and sex; p< 0. 001) than in a comparable study of families from the same background population but with no increased susceptibility to diabetes.

METHODS: Longitudinal study of 1856 and 1529 alcohol drinking {{men and women in the}} French DESIR study (Data from an Epidemiological Study on the <b>Insulin</b> <b>Resistance</b> <b>syndrome),</b> aged 30 to 64 years. RESULTS: In men, fasting glucose, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and HDL-cholesterol were positively associated with average alcohol consumption while there was no association with insulin or triglycerides concentrations. A change in alcohol intake was positively associated with HDL-cholesterol concentration and systolic blood pressure at follow-up. These effects of alcohol could not be attributed specifically to the intake of wine. In women, while the alcohol HDL-cholesterol relation was similar to that found in the men, the only significant effect of average alcohol intake was an increase in systolic blood pressure, with a spurious decrease in blood pressure related to a 3 -year increase in alcohol intake.

In this paper, we report the case of patient with type B <b>insulin</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>syndrome</b> who presented with frequent severe fasting hypoglycemia and acanthosis nigricans.

40|$|Strategies {{aimed at}} primary {{prevention}} provide an outstanding opportunity {{for reducing the}} onset and burden of cardiovascular (CV) disease. Lipid abnormalities, including high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), elevated triglycerides {{and low levels of}} high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), are associated with an increased risk of CV events, thereby serving as contributors to this process. By consensus, lowering LDL-C, generally with statin therapy, is the primary target of lipid-lowering therapy. However, statin therapy may be insufficient for patients with mixed dyslipidemia, especially those with <b>insulin</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>syndromes.</b> While the addition of niacin, fibrate or omega- 3 fatty acids may be useful in this setting, outcomes data are lacking. Therefore, data from ongoing prospective studies will hopefully resolve this issue and facilitate identification of optimal strategies to augment CV risk reduction...|$|R
