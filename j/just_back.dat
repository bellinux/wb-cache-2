5|$|However, the city's levee {{and flood}} walls {{designed}} and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers breached in over fifty locations. Storm surge breached the levees of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal ("MR-GO") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint Bernard Parish, the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major levee breaches in the city included breaches at the 17th Street Canal levee, the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded. There were three major breaches at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the Lower Ninth Ward, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal levee was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the London Avenue Canal breached in two places, on the upper side <b>just</b> <b>back</b> from Robert E. Lee Boulevard, and on the lower side a block in from the Mirabeau Avenue Bridge. Flooding from the breaches put {{the majority of the}} city under water for days, in many places for weeks. Many roads and buildings were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.|$|E

25|$|On 3 February the Japanese {{opened a}} series of air attacks on ABDA bases on Java, and the 19th BG was again caught on the ground, losing five of its B-17s in a raid on Singosari, four {{of them on the}} ground. On 20 February, <b>just</b> <b>back</b> from a mission to bomb the {{invasion}} force at Bali, seven B-17s of the 19th BG were caught on the ground at Pasirian Field in southeastern Java by Zero strafers while re-arming and five more were destroyed. Although 38 of the more capable B-17E Flying Fortresses and a dozen LB-30 Liberators incrementally reinforced both heavy bombardment groups of the FEAF, losses were severe and the slow rate of reinforcement was unable to keep pace. Despite dispersal and elaborate camouflage, a lack of antiaircraft artillery and poor warning/communication systems resulted in the loss of 65 FEAF aircraft on the ground alone.|$|E

When Charles discovers what has happened while he was away at college, he beats Mary Anne and reports to the sheriff that LeRoi beat and raped her. The town forms a lynch mob and the governor is set to attend. Feeling some remorse for what he had brought about, Charles confesses to the sheriff that he had beaten Mary Anne and that she never had been raped. The sheriff, unwilling to cancel due to the visit of the governor, allowed the lynching to proceed anyway.|$|E

500|$|In 1958, Achebe {{sent his}} novel to the agent {{recommended}} by Gilbert Phelps in London. It {{was sent to}} several publishing houses; some rejected it immediately, claiming that fiction from African writers had no market potential. Finally it reached the office of Heinemann, where executives hesitated until an educational adviser, Donald MacRae, <b>just</b> <b>back</b> in England after a trip through West Africa, read the book and forced the company's hand with his succinct report: [...] "This is the best novel I have read since the war".|$|E
500|$|This {{would cause}} {{problems}} for the studio, Universal and partner MGM. [...] "The studio is <b>just</b> <b>back</b> from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment," [...] said Kevin Misher, Universal's President of Production. Misher added that, [...] "It {{was one of those}} moments when you sit down and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance? A character who is replaceable?' Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?" [...] Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in Hannibal had [...] "negative attributes" [...] and [...] "betrayed" [...] the original character.|$|E
500|$|In February 1948, the {{president}} submitted {{a civil rights}} agenda to Congress that proposed creating several federal offices devoted to issues such as voting rights and fair employment practices. This provoked a storm of criticism from southern Democrats in the runup to the national nominating convention, but Truman refused to compromise, saying: [...] "My forebears were Confederates... but my very stomach turned over when I had learned that Negro soldiers, <b>just</b> <b>back</b> from overseas, were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten." [...] Tales of the abuse, violence, and persecution suffered by many African-American veterans upon their return from World War II infuriated Truman, and were {{a major factor in}} his decision to issue Executive Order 9981, in July 1948, requiring equal opportunity in the Armed Forces.

[...] The umpire Ellison started the race at 2:20p.m. whereupon Oxford made the better start, rating 40 strokes per minute, and taking a slight lead. [...] Maintaining the higher stroke rate, the Dark Blues passed Craven Steps with a canvas-length lead in a record time. [...] Taking {{advantage}} of the bend in the river, Cambridge first drew level before holding a quarter-length lead by the time the crews passed the Mile Post. [...] By Harrods Furniture Depository the lead was <b>just</b> <b>back</b> to a canvas before a mistake in the steering from Oxford's cox Watson on the approach to Hammersmith Bridge saw Cambridge leading by a few feet.

[...] By Chiswick Eyot the Light Blues held a three-length lead which they extended to over five lengths by Chiswick Steps.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{her return}} to London, Lloyd {{introduced}} [...] "Listen With the Right Ear", which was an intended follow-up to [...] "Oh You Wink the Other Eye". Shortly after her return, she sailed to France, to take up an engagement in Paris. Her biographer Daniel Farson thought that she received [...] "greater acclaim than any other English comedienne who had preceded her". She changed the lyrics to some of her best-known songs for her French audience and retitled them, [...] "The Naughty Continong"; [...] "Twiggy Vous"; [...] "I'm <b>Just</b> <b>Back</b> from Paris" [...] and [...] "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris". At Christmas in 1893, she returned to London to honour her final Drury Lane commitment, starring as Polly Perkins in Robinson Crusoe.

500|$|For {{their second}} and final album with Arista, Brothers of the Road (1981), they collaborated with a [...] "name producer" [...] (John Ryan, of Styx and the Doobie Brothers), who pushed the band {{even harder to}} change their sound. [...] "Straight from the Heart" [...] was the album's single, which became a minor hit but heralded the group's last {{appearance}} on the top 40 charts. The band, considering their post-reunion albums [...] "embarrassing", subsequently broke up in 1982 after clashing with Clive Davis, who rejected every producer the band suggested for a possible third album, including Tom Dowd and Johnny Sandlin. [...] "We broke up in '82 because we decided we better <b>just</b> <b>back</b> out or we would ruin {{what was left of}} the band’s image," [...] said Betts. The band's final performance came on Saturday Night Live in January 1982, where they performed [...] "Southbound" [...] and [...] "Leavin'." [...] The members regrouped occasionally in the intervening years; in 1986, Betts and Allman toured together, with each opening for one another and collaborating for a set. Allman's solo career began looking up when he released his first solo album in over a decade in 1987, I'm No Angel. The title track became a surprise hit on radio, garnering heavy airplay.|$|E
