The principle difficulty is finding a closed-form expression for the probability density function (PDF) of a sum of L (i. e., diversity order) random fading amplitudes. In this paper, we develop an alternative, direct technique to evaluate the exact performance of EGC diversity systems (expressed {{in terms of a}} single or double finite-range integrals) in Rayleigh, Rician and Nakagami fading channels. Our new approach relies on the use of Parseval’s theorem to transform the error integral into the frequency domain. Since the Fourier transform of the PDF is the characteristic function (CHF), which is available in this case, our solution is general and exact. The CHF method also circumvents the need to perform an L-fold convolution integra! which is usually encountered in the calculation of the PDF of the sum of the received signal amplitudes.

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a tight {{approximate}} {{expression of the}} output SNR PDF by generalizing the approximate CDF convolution derived in [16] to non-identical Weibull random variates (RVs).

30|$|Antenna {{diversity}} {{is one of}} the most practical, effective, and widely employed technique in wireless communication receivers to reduce the effects of fading and to provide increased signal strength at the receiver. Different techniques are known to combine the signals received from multiple diversity branches. The most popular diversity techniques are equal-gain combining (EGC), maximal-ratio combining (MRC), selection combining (SC), and a combination of MRC and SC, called generalized-selection combining (GSC). The SC receiver chooses the branch with the strongest instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while MRC provides optimal performance, at the expense of implementation complexity, since it requires knowledge of all channel parameters. In <b>EGC</b> <b>receiver,</b> the signals in all branches are weighted with the same factor, irrespective of the signal amplitude. Moreover, co-phasing of all input signals is needed to avoid output signal cancellation. The performance of EGC and MRC diversity receivers has been extensively conducted in many previous works for several well-known fading statistical models, such as Rayleigh, Rice, and Nakagami—assuming independent or correlative fading [1 – 6]. The Weibull distribution is a well-known model for describing multipath fading channels in both indoor and outdoor radio propagation environments. In [7], novel analytical expressions for the joint probability density function (PDF), moment generating function (MGF), and cumulative distribution function (CDF) are derived for the multivariate Weibull distribution. The presented theoretical results are applied to analyze the performance of several diversity receivers such as SC, EGC, and MRC techniques operating under correlated Weibull fading channels (WFC). For these diversity receivers, several useful performance criteria such as moments of output SNR, including the amount of fading (AoF), and outage probability (OP) are analytically derived. Moreover, the average symbol error probability (ASEP) for several coherent and noncoherent modulation schemes is studied using moment generating function (MGF) approach. In [8], capitalizing on the general α- μ fading model simple and precise closed-form approximations to the PDF and CDF of the sum of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) Weibull variates are derived. These approximations find applicability in several wireless communications issues such as signal detection and combining, linear equalizers, intersymbol interference, and phase jitter [8]. Considering related works, C. Sagias et al. [9, 10], have presented a moments-based approach to analyzing the performance of dual-branch EGC and MRC receivers, operating under either independent or correlated, but not necessary identically distributed WFC. In this respect, significant performance criteria, such as average output SNR, AoF, and spectral efficiency at low power regime, are extracted in closed-forms, using the moments of the output SNR for both independent and correlative fading cases. Using the same approach of the moment, El Bouanani [11 – 14] has generalized this idea to L-branches over independent and not necessary identically distributed (i.n.i.d) Weibull fading channels for both MRC and EGC receivers. Consequently, he has derived some performance criteria such as AoF, MGF, average capacity (AC), and ASEP in closed forms. In [15], we have generalized the same idea to derive the approximate expressions of MRC performance criteria over correlated WFC.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — To {{compute the}} optimal bias in equal-gain combin-ing (<b>EGC)</b> <b>receivers</b> with unequal energy constellations such as M-ary pulse {{amplitude}} modulation (M-PAM) andM-ary square quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM), the estimation of the instantaneous fading gain magnitude in each diversity branch is needed, thus defeating the usefulness of EGC. In this paper, we present an exact analytical equation, which can be efficiently used to compute a suboptimal value for the bias, both forM-PAM and M-QAM constellations. The proposed suboptimal bias minimizes the symbol error probability, and depends on the statistics of the fading gain magnitudes and not on their instantaneous values. For the case of large number of branches, where the central limit theorem can be applied, the proposed equation for the computation of the suboptimal bias is derived in closed-form. Moreover, an approximate simple closed-form expression for the suboptimal bias is obtained, suitable for the high signal-to-noise ratio region.

An analytic expression of the signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) is derived for the VSF-OFCDM with CFO for the case of maximal ratio combining (MRC) and equal gain combining (<b>EGC)</b> <b>receivers.</b> Numerical results show that, when the total spreading factor is fixed, a system with higher frequency domain spreading factor is more sensitive to CFO than that with lower frequency domain spreading factor. Also, for high Eb/No, EGC has better bit error rate performance than MRC due to the greater interference amplification present in MRC which compounds the effect of the loss of orthogonality. Due to the adverse impact of the CFO on VSF-OFCDM systems, we propose a correction scheme based on the maximum likelihood principle. We then use a gradient algorithm to estimate and minimize the effect of CFO in a tracking mode.

The KG distribution has been recently considered as a generic and versatile distribution for the accurate modeling of {{a great variety of}} short term fading in conjunction with long term fading (shadowing) channel conditions. For this relatively new composite fading model, expressions for important statistical metrics of maximal ratio combining (MRC), equal gain combining (EGC), selection combining (SC) and switch and stay combining (SSC) diversity receivers are derived. Using these expressions and by considering independent but not necessarily identical distributed fading channel conditions, performance criteria, such as aver-age output signal-to-noise ratio, amount of fading and outage probability are obtained in closed form.

It is therefore important to develop a method for the differential diagnosis of SM 1 (invasion depth &le; 500 &micro;m) from SM 2 / 3 cancers (invasion depth &gt; 500 &micro;m), of which the latter cannot be treated with ESD. To aid in differential diagnosis, a prospective study was conducted to establish a new diagnostic method for more accurate differential diagnosis by measurement of lesion depth using endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) as a preoperative diagnostic modality. Patients and methods: The lesions of 92 EGC patients were examined by EUS prior to ESD or surgery to identify and measure the area with the most thickened submucosal layer.

This paper explains two different methods based on data fusion and in particular on fusion between different frequencies. It is shown that improvement is possible if and when the multipath can be considered independent for two frequencies properly spaced in the frequency domain. A theoretical analysis has been carried on together with computer simulation. The signal channel model has been developed with Galileo in mind to show how data fusion techniques can be applied exploiting the frequency diversity. The receiver modules taken into account are the Equal Gain Combining (EGC) and the Adaptive Gain Combining (AGC). Starting from the statistical model of a classical DLL code-tracking system, {{a theoretical}} model for both EGC and AGC is derived. To verify the correctness of the theoretical model, a simulation environment has been set up, with the possibility of varying different parameters. The multipath model is referred to an urban environment. Resells are shown both for <b>EGC</b> and AGC <b>receivers.</b> Correct decision probability in the considered cases has confirmed the results in the simulated cases...|$|R
