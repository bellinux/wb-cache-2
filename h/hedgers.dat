25|$|Controversy about {{currency}} speculators {{and their}} effect on currency devaluations and national economies recurs regularly. Economists, such as Milton Friedman, have argued that speculators ultimately are a stabilizing influence on the market, and that stabilizing speculation performs the important function of providing a market for <b>hedgers</b> and transferring risk from those people who don't wish to bear it, to those who do. Other economists, such as Joseph Stiglitz, consider this argument to be based more on politics and a free market philosophy than on economics.|$|E
25|$|Proponents {{of naked}} credit default swaps say that short selling in various forms, whether credit default swaps, options or futures, has the {{beneficial}} effect of increasing liquidity in the marketplace.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{components}} that should be incorporated {{in the price of}} an uncolateralized derivative. We assume that one counterparty will act as the derivatives <b>hedger</b> while the other will act as the investor. Therefore, the derivative's price will reflect the replication costs from the <b>hedger's</b> perspective, which will not be equal to the replication price from the investor's perspective. We will also assume that the <b>hedger</b> only has the incentive to hedge the changes in value that the derivative experiences while the <b>hedger</b> remains not defaulted. We assume that both the investor's and the <b>hedger's</b> credit curves are stochastic, so that the <b>hedger</b> is not only concerned with the default event of the investor (but not of his own), but also with spread changes of both counterparties. We conclude that CVA and FVA (funding value adjustment, which include both funding cost and benet) are the only components to be incorporated in the price of financial derivatives. Of course, since we will follow pure hedging arguments, every pricing term can be hedged under reasonable assumptions. The hedging of both components will not only leave the <b>hedger</b> immune to both spread changes and the default event of the investor, but also to spread changes of the <b>hedger.</b> The latter will imply that the debt structure of the <b>hedger</b> will remain unchanged when the new derivative transaction is traded. ...|$|R

Kennedy II, by 2012, {{prices on}} the oil {{commodity}} market had become influenced by [...] "hedge funds and bankers" [...] pumping [...] "billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges, chasing {{a limited number of}} barrels and driving up the price". The problem started, according to Kennedy, in 1991, when just a few years after oil futures began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Goldman Sachs made an argument to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that Wall Street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate <b>hedgers</b> and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades.|$|E
2500|$|Futures traders are {{traditionally}} placed {{in one of}} two groups: <b>hedgers,</b> who have an interest in the underlying asset (which could include an intangible such as an index or interest rate) and are seeking to hedge out the risk of price changes; and speculators, who seek to make a profit by predicting market moves and opening a derivative contract related to the asset [...] "on paper", while they have no practical use for or intent to actually take or make delivery of the underlying asset. In other words, the investor is seeking exposure to the asset in a long futures or the opposite effect via a short futures contract.|$|E

Thus, the <b>hedger</b> {{is more likely to}} call the note, reducing the expected duration of the note. In this situation, the <b>hedger</b> has to partially unwind the hedges done at the inception of the PRDC note. For example, the hedge would have to pay swaps in the foreign currency. If FX spot moves in a correlated fashion with the foreign currency swap rate (that is, foreign currency swap rate increases as FX spot increases), the <b>hedger</b> would need to pay a higher swap rate as FX spot goes up, and receive a lower swap rate as FX spot goes down.

Now and again, an Englishwoman employs a high-caste Mussulman nurse, and in the offices of that hire women are apt to forget the differences of colour, and to speak unreservedly as twin daughters under Eve's curse. The nurse tells very strange and awful things. She has, and this the Mormons count a privilege, been born into polygamy; but she loathes and detests it from the bottom of her jealous soul.

6000|$|It {{will be well}} {{to notice}} briefly, however, how the {{principle}} applies to the two Anti-Semitic arguments already considered. The first is the charge of usury and unproductive loans, the second the charge either of treason or of unpatriotic detachment. The charge of usury is regarded, not unreasonably, as only a specially dangerous development of the general charge of uncreative commerce and the refusal of creative manual exercise; the unproductive loan is only a minor form of the unproductive labour. It is certainly true that the latter complaint is, if possible, commoner than the former, especially in comparatively simple communities like those of Palestine. A very honest Moslem Arab said to me, with a singular blend of simplicity and humour, [...] "A Jew does not work; but he grows rich. You never see a Jew working; and yet they grow rich. What I want to know is, why do we not all do the same? Why do we not also do this and become rich?" [...] This is, I need hardly say, an over-simplification. Jews often work hard at some things, especially intellectual things. But the same experience which tells us that we have known many industrious Jewish scholars, Jewish lawyers, Jewish doctors, Jewish pianists, chess-players and so on, is an experience which cuts both ways. The same experience, if carefully consulted, will probably tell us {{that we have not}} known personally many patient Jewish ploughmen, many laborious Jewish blacksmiths, many active Jewish <b>hedgers</b> and ditchers, or even many energetic Jewish hunters and fishermen. In short, the popular impression is tolerably true to life, as popular impressions very often are; though it is not fashionable to say so in these days of democracy and self-determination. Jews do not generally work on the land, or in any of the handicrafts that are akin to the land; but the Zionists reply that this is because it can never really be their own land. That is Zionism, and that has really a practical place in the past and future of Zion.|$|E
60|$|Another {{class of}} tramp is a man, the most {{valuable}} part of whose stock-in-trade is a highly perplexed demeanour. He is got up like a countryman, and you will often come upon the poor fellow, while he is endeavouring to decipher the inscription on a milestone-- quite a fruitless endeavour, for he cannot read. He asks your pardon, he truly does (he is very slow of speech, this tramp, and he looks in a bewildered way all round the prospect while he talks to you), {{but all of us}} shold do as we wold be done by, and he'll take it kind, if you'll put a power man in the right road fur to jine his eldest son as has broke his leg bad in the masoning, and is in this heere Orspit'l as is wrote down by Squire Pouncerby's own hand as wold not tell a lie fur no man. He then produces from under his dark frock (being always very slow and perplexed) a neat but worn old leathern purse, from which he takes a scrap of paper. On this scrap of paper is written, by Squire Pouncerby, of The Grove, 'Please to direct the Bearer, a poor but very worthy man, to the Sussex County Hospital, near Brighton'--a matter of some difficulty at the moment, seeing that the request comes suddenly upon you in the depths of Hertfordshire. The more you endeavour to indicate where Brighton is--when you have with the greatest difficulty remembered--the less the devoted father can be made to comprehend, and the more obtusely he stares at the prospect; whereby, being reduced to extremity, you recommend the faithful parent to begin by going to St. Albans, and present him with half- a-crown.

50|$|The economists John Maynard Keynes and John Hicks {{argued that}} in general, the natural <b>hedgers</b> of a {{commodity}} are {{those who wish to}} sell the commodity at a future point in time. Thus, <b>hedgers</b> will collectively hold a net short position in the forward market. The other side of these contracts are held by speculators, who must therefore hold a net long position. <b>Hedgers</b> are interested in reducing risk, and thus will accept losing money on their forward contracts.

Thus, if speculators are holding a net long position, it must be the case that the expected future spot price is greater than the forward price.|$|E

30|$|The {{issue of}} {{valuation}} {{at time t}} is also important when we ask the following question: at which exit price a contract entered into by the <b>hedger</b> at time 0 can be unwound by him at time t.

Accordingly, the gained value p^g_t (x,C) for 0 <t<T would be the amount of cash, which the <b>hedger</b> {{would be willing to pay}} to another trader who would then take the <b>hedger’s</b> position from time t onwards.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the diﬀerent {{components}} that should be incorporated {{in the price of}} uncollateralized derivatives. We do so by putting special focus on the hedge-ability of every term. In order to reﬂect the most realistic situation, we assume stochastic credit spreads for both counterparties. In such a framework, the counterparty acting as the <b>hedger</b> will be concerned about market risk (movements in the price of the underlying asset), both sources of the credit risk of the investor (spread changes and default event) and also his own credit risk. Regarding his own credit risk, we assume that the derivatives <b>hedger</b> has no incentive to hedge the change in value of the derivative upon his own default, since the <b>hedger</b> will not be exposed to this change in value. Nevertheless, we assume that the <b>hedger</b> has a strong incentive to hedge the changes in the derivative’s price due to changes in his credit spread curve, which is a source of risk that the derivatives <b>hedger</b> will be exposed to during the replication process. We also suggest a hedging strategy for this risk factor (spread changes of the investor) as we do for the other (market risk, spread changes and default event of the issuer). We conclude that under these assumptions CVA (a unilateral version of it that does not depend on the <b>hedger’s</b> funding curve) and FVA (a funding adjustment that does only depend on the investor’s default indicator and not on the <b>hedger’s)</b> are the only components to be incorporated in the price of ﬁnancial derivatives. ...|$|R
