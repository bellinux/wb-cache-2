During the rendering, we interpolate the precomputed caustic patterns based on a given light direction. One of the applications of our technique is to render approximate caustics under environment illumination.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for estimating lighting sources from a single image of a scene that is illuminated by near point <b>light</b> sources, <b>directional</b> <b>light</b> sources and ambi-ent light. We propose to employ a pair of reference spheres as light probes and introduce the difference sphere that we acquire by differencing the intensities of two image regions of the reference spheres. Since the effect by <b>directional</b> <b>light</b> sources and ambient light is eliminated by differencing, the key advantage of considering the difference sphere is that it enables us to estimate near point light sources including their radiance, which {{has been difficult to}} achieve in previ-ous efforts where only distant <b>directional</b> <b>light</b> sources were assumed. We also show that analysis of gray level contours on spherical surfaces facilitates separate identification of multiple combined light sources and is well suited to the dif-ference sphere. Once we estimate point light sources with the difference sphere, we update the input image by elim-inating their influence and then estimate other remaining light sources, that is, <b>directional</b> <b>light</b> sources and ambient light. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the entire algo-rithm with experimental results. 1...|$|R

40|$|The effects {{produced}} in an image by cast shadows {{can be quite}} complex, especially when light comes from all directions. This {{makes it difficult to}} recover the illumination from a scene and recognize objects from the images. In this paper, we show that such images can be well approximated using much simpler lighting represented by a combination of low frequency spherical harmonics, and a small number of directional sources. Therefore, the illumination of the scene can be recovered by summing the spherical harmonic lighting and a small number of <b>directional</b> <b>light</b> sources. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have successfully tested it by using sets of synthesized images rendered by <b>directional</b> <b>light</b> sources or environment maps with different objects...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a simple method for decomposing the linear texture space of a facial {{appearance}} model into two linear subspaces, one for inter-individual variability and another for variations caused by directional changes of the lighting conditions. The approach used is to create one linear subspace from individuals with uniform illumination conditions and then filter a set of images with various <b>directional</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions by projecting corresponding textures on the previously built space; the residues are further used to build a second subspace for <b>directional</b> <b>lighting.</b> The resulted subspaces are orthogonal, so the overall texture model can be obtained by a simple concatenation of the two subspaces. The main advantage of this representation is that two sets of parameters are used to control inter-individual variation and separately intra-individual variation due to changes in illumination conditions...|$|E
