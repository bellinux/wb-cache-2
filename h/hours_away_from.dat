5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long <b>hours</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E

25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of war between Norway and Nazi Germany following the German invasion of Norway increasing numbers of German prisoners fell into Norwegian hands in the fighting that followed. While many of these were soon liberated by the advancing German forces, the situation for those captured in Northern Norway was different. The Germans fighting at Narvik were on the defensive against superior Norwegian and Allied forces. Prisoners taken during the fighting were sent behind Allied lines, outside {{the reach of the}} Wehrmacht. After having first interned the German prisoners at various locations around the region the decision was made by the Norwegian 6th Division command to establish a central prisoner of war camp at the small and isolated island of Skorpa in Kvænangen in Troms county.

25|$|News grows even grimmer as Weidling {{reports to}} Hitler {{there are no}} {{reserves}} left, and Mohnke reports that the Red Army is only 300 to 400 metres from the Reich Chancellery.

After Hitler leaves the conference room, Weidling firmly asks if it is truly possible for Wenck to attack; the generals all {{agree that it is}} impossible, but still resolve to never surrender. After midnight, Hitler dictates his last will and testament to Traudl, before marrying Eva Braun. Hitler orders Goebbels to leave Berlin, but Goebbels refuses. The following morning, Weidling reports that not only was Wenck not able to attack, all of their remaining armies are now incapable of any meaningful action, and that the Reich {{is no more than a}} few <b>hours</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> total defeat. Finally accepting that there is no hope, Hitler decides to kill himself before he can be captured.|$|E
25|$|Bligh then {{resumed his}} station with the Channel Fleet, patrolling off the French ports. On 3 February 1810 {{he came across}} the French ship Confiance, a former frigate that had been {{purchased}} by the merchants of the Île de France to transport their goods back to France. At the time Bligh had been sailing in company with the 74-gun , and under the orders of her captain, Henry Hotham. On 1 February Hotham had ordered Bligh to follow him into Quiberon Bay, but Valiant was unable to weather the point, nor could she make progress in the light winds the following day. She was therefore still off Belle Île on 3 February, when the Confiance came in sight. Confiance had evaded British blockaders and cruisers during the entirety of her voyage, having escaped pursuit fourteen times in her 93-day passage from the Indian Ocean. Hampered by light winds, {{she was unable to}} escape the Valiant, and finally surrendered to her just a few <b>hours</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> reaching safety in a French port. Her cargo was valued at £800,000, of which Bligh received £14,041.|$|E
