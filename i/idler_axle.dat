2500|$|... "A1-1A" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks under the unit. Each truck has one powered axle and one <b>idler</b> <b>axle,</b> with the powered axles to the outside.|$|E
2500|$|... "1A-A1" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks (or wheel assemblies) under the unit. Each truck has one powered axle and one <b>idler</b> <b>axle,</b> with the idler axles to the outside. Examples include Budd RDC Diesel MU (DMU) cars.|$|E
2500|$|... "1B-1B" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks with a leading <b>idler</b> <b>axle</b> in front of two powered axles. [...] This {{arrangement}} was used to upgrade the B-B arrangement of two EMC 1800 hp B-B locomotives owned by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1938, for greater stability at speed.|$|E
2500|$|... "2+C-C+2" [...] {{means there}} are two sets of axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a guiding truck with two <b>idler</b> <b>axles,</b> and inboard of this, and hinged to it, is a truck with three powered axles. The GE steam turbine-electric {{locomotives}} of 1939 were notable examples of this arrangement.|$|R
2500|$|... "2-B+B-2" [...] {{means there}} are two sets of {{articulated}} axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two <b>idler</b> <b>axles,</b> and inboard of it are two powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The PRR DD1 and DD2 electric locomotives used this arrangement.|$|R
2500|$|... "B-2" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks. The [...] "B" [...] truck is under {{the front of the}} unit, and has two powered axles. The [...] "2" [...] truck is under the back of the unit, and has two <b>idler</b> <b>axles</b> in a row. Examples include the three {{lightweight}} RP-210 locomotives built by Baldwin in 1956 and 1957 for use with Pullman-Standard Train-X equipment.|$|R
2500|$|... "B-1" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks. The [...] "B" [...] truck is under {{the front of the}} unit, and has two powered axles.

2500|$|... "1-D" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks. The [...] "1" [...] truck is under {{the front of the}} unit, and has one <b>idler</b> <b>axle.</b> [...] The {{remaining}} 4 axles are rigidly mounted to the frame behind this lead truck [...] The only known examples are a series of diesel locomotives built and owned by the Texas Mexican Railway.|$|E

2500|$|... "2-B+B+B+B-2" [...] {{means there}} are two sets of {{articulated}} axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two <b>idler</b> <b>axles,</b> and inboard of it are two powered axles, hinged to yet another set of two powered axles.

2500|$|... "2-D+D-2" [...] {{means there}} are two sets of {{articulated}} axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two <b>idler</b> <b>axles,</b> and inboard of it are four powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge.

2500|$|... "A1A-2" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks.

2500|$|... "A1A-A1A" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks under the unit. Each truck has two powered axles, with an <b>idler</b> <b>axle</b> between them. This spreads {{the weight of the}} {{locomotive}} more evenly spread over the track and counteracts the tendency of trucks to oscillate at high speeds, which is a problem with two axle trucks. The idler wheels may be smaller than the powered wheels.|$|E
2500|$|... "B-A1A" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks. The [...] "B" [...] truck is under {{the front of the}} unit, and has two powered axles. The [...] "A1A" [...] truck is under the back of the unit, and has one powered axle, one <b>idler</b> <b>axle,</b> and one more powered axle.

2500|$|The AAR system counts axles {{instead of}} wheels. Letters refer to powered axles, and numbers to {{unpowered}} (or idler) axles. [...] "A" [...] refers to one powered axle, [...] "B" [...] to two powered axles in a row, [...] "C" [...] to three powered axles in a row, and [...] "D" [...] to four powered axles in a row. [...] "1" [...] refers to one <b>idler</b> <b>axle,</b> and [...] "2" [...] to two idler axles in a row. A dash ("") separates trucks, or wheel assemblies. A plus sign ("+") refers to articulation.|$|E
2500|$|The power car, 9908 Silver Charger, was unique. It {{utilised}} {{a single}} new EMC 567 V-12 engine developing 1,000hp, {{rather than the}} pair used in the contemporary EMC E3. It had one Martin Blomberg-designed E-unit A1A passenger truck at the front, with powered outer axles and a center <b>idler</b> <b>axle,</b> and an unpowered trailing truck, giving it the unusual wheel arrangement of A1A-2. This made it mechanically half of an E3. The back half of the power car was a baggage area. [...] This made it similar to special power-baggage units built by EMD for the Colorado Springs section of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific [...] "Rocky Mountain Rocket", though the latter had a carbody and E-3/E-6 styling by EMD. [...] The [...] "Silver Charger" [...] was the last power unit built by Budd with the unique [...] "Zephyr"/"Flying Yankee" [...] shovelnose styling.|$|E

50|$|The {{layout of}} the bipolars was unusual as well. The {{locomotive}} carbody consisted of three sections. A small center section contained a boiler for heating passenger cars, while the larger end sections contained the locomotive's electrical equipment and operator cabs in distinctive round-topped hoods. The locomotive's frame was split into four sections, hinged at the joints, with the two middle sections attached to the end sections of the locomotive body. There were twelve sets of driving wheels, plus a single <b>idler</b> <b>axle</b> at each end, for a 1B-D+D-B1 wheel arrangement. All buffering forces were transmitted through the locomotive frame.|$|E
