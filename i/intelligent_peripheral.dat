50|$|Zilog was {{the first}} company entirely {{dedicated}} to microprocessors started by Federico Faggin and Ralph Ungermann in November 1974. F. Faggin was Zilog's President and CEO {{until the end of}} 1980 and he conceived and architected the Z80-CPU and its family of programmable peripheral components. He also co-designed the CPU whose project leader was M.Shima. The Z80-CPU was a major improvement over the 8080, yet it retained software compatibility with it. Much faster and with {{more than twice as many}} registers and instructions of the 8080, it was part of a family of components that included several <b>intelligent</b> <b>peripherals</b> (the Z80-PIO, a programmable parallel input-output controller; the Z80-CTC, a programmable counter-timer; the Z80-SIO, programmable serial communications interface controller, and the Z80-DMA, programmable direct memory access controller). This chip family allowed the design of powerful and low-cost microcomputers with performance comparable to minicomputers. The Z80-CPU had a substantially better bus structure and interrupt structure than the 8080 and could interface directly with dynamic RAM, since it included an internal memory-refresh controller. The Z80 was used in many of the early personal computers as well as in game consoles such as the ColecoVision and Game Boy. The Z80 is still in volume production in 2017 as a core microprocessor in various systems on a chip.|$|R

40|$|In {{distributed}} communication networks several nodes interact {{to carry}} out services. New telecommunication networks support a variety of services, much different from traditional telephony. Each service has its own so called load profile, {{which means that the}} amount of capacity needed to complete a service varies. The services may also have different priorities and quality of service requirements. This thesis discusses overload control strategies for distributed communication networks. Further, a number of overload control schemes that carry out a certain strategy are developed and examined. The main objectives of the overload control schemes are to efficiently protect a resource from overload, to maintain a high throughput and to ensure a fair distribution of the resource's capacity among the services. Two network architectures are examined; the Intelligent Network (IN) and the Telecommunication Information Networking Architecture (TINA). For IN, the thesis concentrates on the overload control of Service Control Points (SCPs), Service Switching Control Points (SSCPs) and <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Peripherals</b> (IPs). These nodes are examined with both simulation and analytical methods. For TINA, a performance simulation model is developed. Further, the overload control of TINA networks is discussed. The thesis also analytically analyses a feedback queuing system with control theoretic methods. A transfer function for the system is developed when a modified PD controller is used in the overload control...|$|R
40|$|Processing of unmodified {{applications}} on distributed {{storage and}} compute resources {{can be achieved}} by presenting the application with a virtual machine interface that abstracts access to the resources. This approach decouples the problem of mapping an application to available resources into two independent problems, (a) writing, compiling or translating the application to the virtual machine interface, and (b) building an efficient implementation of the virtual machine on top of the resources. The key challenges with this approach are: (a) how should the underlying resources be virtualized, and (b) at which layer of system software should the virtualization be implemented. The resolution of these two issues, depends on the characteristics of the applications to be supported, and the target distributed resources. ^ In this thesis, the above virtualization approach is investigated in the context of three specific target systems. ‘Software-extended-machine-architecture’ is an abstract interface at the ISA-level, to exploit resources at <b>intelligent</b> <b>peripherals</b> within a node, that can be implemented via the compiler framework and application runtime system. The abstract ISA consists of the ISA of the main CPU extended by a soft ISA to program devices. SCODE, a proposal for a soft ISA that expresses the fine grained data-parallelism in general-purpose applications demonstrates the applicability of the proposed approach to exploit resources at intelligent streaming data devices within a node. The ‘delegated process’ abstraction at the OS-level, enables sequential distributed processing of multiprogramming workloads across closely coupled nodes managed as independent systems. An implementation in the Linux kernel demonstrates the viability of the approach by enabling systems that are out of memory to support memory-intensive workloads by borrowing memory and compute resources from remote machines. The ‘abstract job’ interface in the grid-middleware level, provides grid applications with a single system image to grid resources. Implementations in deployed grid-computing environments, PUNCH and In-VIGO, demonstrate the portability and scalability of the proposed interface by allowing the incorporation of new types of heterogeneous platforms with little effort and overhead. Successful application of the proposed virtualization approach in the above distinct scenarios provides evidence for its general applicability. ...|$|R
40|$|Proceeding of: IEEE 35 th International Carnahan Conference on Security Technology, London, UK, 16 - 19 october 2001 In {{the last}} years, many new <b>intelligent</b> full-featured <b>peripherals</b> that assist {{information}} systems have appeared. Those peripherals, such as printers, copiers, PDA organizers, Web cameras, etc. {{usually have a}} very friendly way of configuration and management (via [URL] ftp or telnet servers) and offer more networked services everyday. Their computation, memory and networking capabilities have also increased in the last years. Nowadays, {{many of them are}} comparable to workstations and run complete operating systems such as Linux or Solaris. All those factors imply that these devices could represent a real threat to the security of information systems. This problem is even worse because most of those peripherals have been considered inoffensive and not many administrators are aware of their security risks. The most representative example is printers, which have been traditionally considered totally harmless devices. At the present time, that idea is difficult to defend because many security incidents related with networked printers have arisen in the last years. System and security administrators have traditionally focused their efforts in fortifying servers and hosts only, but it seems that this view is not enough for assuring security nowadays.

40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Electrical Engineering) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1991 The {{main reason}} for this project was "import replacement", as all our {{existing}} Point of Sale and Electronic Equipment had to be imported from Japan. After the Government I s steps to curb imports by placing extremely high levies on imported goods, {{it was decided to}} produce a completely local product.

The"concept is to use a HOST computer controlling a differential communications line with a maximum of 255 terminals which are all individually addressable. Each individual terminal would in turn control an internal differential communications line, called PNET, which is an acronym for "Peripheral Network".

Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of a typical measurement and control system based on the 224 OA Measurement and Control Processor. Analog and digital interfaces plug into the 2240 A to interface to various sensors, switches, controls, and actuators (see Fig, 2). The processor's communication link to the computer is the Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus, or HP-IB, Hewlett-Packard's implementation of IEEE standard 488 - 1975 (ANSI standard MC 1. 1). Careful design of message protocol and data formats makes the 224 OA compatible with virtually any computer, calculator, or intelligent terminal that supports the HP-IB. Using standard HP-IB cables, the 224 OA can be located up to 20 metres (65 feet) from the computer or other controller. For remote applications, the HP-IB can be brought to the 224 oA by any of a variety of multidrop, point-to-point, or telephone line interfaces.

The chip receives positioning instructions through the bus and subsequently drives the stator coils so the two-phase stepper motor moves to the desired position. The on-chip position controller is configurable (OTP or RAM) for different motor types, positioning ranges and parameters for speed, acceleration and deceleration. Micro-stepping allows silent motor operation and increased positioning resolution. The advanced motion qualification mode enables verification of the complete mechanical system in function of the selected motion parameters.

An integrated sensorless stall detection stops the motor when running into stall. This enables silent, yet accurate position calibrations during a referencing run and allows semi-closed loop operation when approaching the mechanical end-stops.
