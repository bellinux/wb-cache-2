5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the {{majority}} of women were still wearing highly structured undergarments. <b>Girdles</b> were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady the challenges of feminism, fashions and the sexual revolution. The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose {{and the rise of the}} miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their <b>girdles.</b> The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Girdling,</b> {{also called}} {{ring-barking}} is the complete {{removal of a}} strip of bark (consisting of cork cambium or [...] "phellogen", phloem, cambium and sometimes going into the xylem) from around the entire circumference of either a branch or trunk of a woody plant. <b>Girdling</b> results {{in the death of}} the area above the <b>girdle</b> over time. A branch completely <b>girdled</b> will fail and when the main trunk of a tree is <b>girdled,</b> the entire tree will die, if it cannot regrow from above to bridge the wound. Among the causes of <b>girdling</b> are human practices, including forestry, horticulture, and vandalism. Foresters use the practice of <b>girdling</b> to thin forests. <b>Girdling</b> can also be caused by herbivorous mammals feeding on plant bark and by birds and insects, both of which can effectively <b>girdle</b> a tree by boring rows of adjacent holes.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effects of different <b>girdling</b> techniques on the growth, development and quality of red wax apple fruits (Syzygium samarangense). Selected horticultural parameters were monitored at one week interval during the growth period from December 2008 to October 2010, using I, C, V shaped, 50 %, and 100 % <b>girdling.</b> <b>Girdling</b> was applied 2 weeks before flowering. The {{results showed that the}} C-shaped <b>girdling</b> technique produced the best results with regard to the fruit setting and chlorophyll content in comparison to the control and the other <b>girdling</b> techniques employed. Furthermore, C-shaped <b>girdling</b> enhanced faster fruit growth producing the best final fruit length and diameter. In addition to significantly increased yield, juice percentage, leaf dry matter, biomass and TSS content of fruits. It was also observed that 50 % <b>girdling</b> decreased fruit dropping. V-shaped <b>girdling</b> also increased the number of bud and reduced bud dropping compared to control. 1 -shaped <b>girdle</b> fruits produced the highest amount of K+ content in fruit juice compared to other treatments. The color development of the fruit peel in 100 % <b>girdling</b> was also the highest among the treatments. From this study, it can be concluded that C-shaped <b>girdling</b> applied two weeks before flowering produced better fruit growth, yield and quality of red wax apple fruits under field conditions...|$|R

5|$|Compared {{with most}} sauropods, a {{relatively}} large amount of juvenile material is known from Apatosaurus. Multiple specimens in the OMNH are from juveniles of an undetermined species of Apatosaurus; this material includes partial shoulder and pelvic <b>girdles,</b> some vertebrae, and limb bones. OMNH juvenile material is from at least two different age groups and based on overlapping bones likely comes from more than three individuals. The specimens exhibit features that distinguish Apatosaurus from its relatives, and thus likely belong to the genus. Juvenile sauropods tend to have proportionally shorter necks and tails, and a more pronounced forelimb-hindlimb disparity than found in adult sauropods.|$|E
5|$|Ficus aurea is {{a fast-growing}} tree. As a hemi{{epiphyte}} it germinates in {{the canopy of}} a host tree and begin life as an epiphyte before growing roots down to the ground. F. aurea is also a strangler fig (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots fuse and encircle the host tree. This usually results {{in the death of}} the host tree, since it effectively <b>girdles</b> the tree. Palms, which lack secondary growth, are not affected by this, but they can still be harmed by competition for light, water and nutrients. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, F. aurea trees regenerated from root suckers and standing trees.|$|E
40|$|Stem or trunk <b>girdling</b> is a {{technique}} used in physiological studies and in horticultural practice for interrupting carbon flow through the phloem {{to other parts of}} the plant without influencing water flow in the xylem. Trunk <b>girdling</b> in peaches is practiced primarily to stimulate fruit growth but it also tends to decrease shoot vigour for a period of time after <b>girdling.</b> Water flow through the trunk or branches of peach trees is thought to be primarily dependent on the most recently formed ring of xylem and vegetative growth is closely related to stem water potential and stem hydraulic conductance. The aim of the present work was to determine whether vigour reduction due to <b>girdling</b> was correlated with a reduction in midday stem water potential during the period of time between <b>girdling</b> and the subsequent healing of stem tissue. 'Springcrest' peach trees were <b>girdled</b> on two different dates. Fruit yield and size, water sprout growth, proleptic shoot growth and stem water potential were measured. Early and late <b>girdled</b> trees yielded larger fruits and fewer and shorter water sprouts in comparison with control trees. Midday stem water potential declined significantly after <b>girdling</b> and gradually recovered until the time of fruit harvest. These results suggest that the vigour reduction of <b>girdled</b> trees is related to a decrease of midday stem water potential caused by <b>girdling.</b> Early tree <b>girdling</b> increased the reduction in midday stem water potential and shoot growth compared with the later <b>girdling</b> treatment. These results point out that even though <b>girdling</b> only removes bark and phloem tissue it can apparently affect water flow in xylem...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, {{together}} with bony {{elements such as}} bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and clavicles (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to hold in the guts and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia {{may have been involved}} in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles. The pelvis and shoulder <b>girdles</b> are arranged differently from those of lizards, as is the case with other parts of the internal anatomy and its scales.|$|E
5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb <b>girdles</b> and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
5|$|Coelurus {{is known}} {{from most of}} the {{skeleton}} of a single individual, including numerous vertebrae, partial pelvic and shoulder <b>girdles,</b> and much of the arms and legs, stored at the Peabody Museum of Natural History; however, the relative completeness of the skeleton was not known until 1980. The fossils were recovered from Reed's Quarry 13 at Como Bluff, Wyoming. Additionally, two arm bones possibly belonging to this genus are known from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah. It was not a large dinosaur. Its weight has been estimated at around , with a length of about 2.4meters (7.9ft) and a hip height of 0.7meters (2.3ft). From reconstructions of the skeleton, Coelurus had a relatively long neck and torso due to its long vertebrae, a long slender hindlimb due to its long metatarsus, and potentially a small slender skull.|$|E

5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. While women sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that <b>girdles</b> were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E
5|$|Sumptuary laws {{regulated}} {{the food}} that one consumed and the clothes that one wore according to status and social class. Clothing was made of hemp or cotton cloths, restricted to a colour standard of black and white. Trousers were the acceptable attire for peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants might choose to wear more ornate clothing and male blouses that came down below the waist. Acceptable apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by social ranking system. However, {{as time went on}} this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each official was able to display his awarded status by wearing different-coloured traditional silken robes that hung to the ground around his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of <b>girdles</b> that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{influential}} factor shaping this new class was the competitive nature of scholarly candidates entering civil service through the imperial examinations. Although not all scholar-officials came from the landholding class, sons of prominent landholders had better access to higher education, and thus greater ability to pass examinations for government service. Gaining a scholarly degree by passing prefectural, circuit-level, or palace exams in the Song period {{was the most important}} prerequisite in being considered for appointment, especially to higher posts; this was a departure from the Tang period, when the examination system was enacted on a much smaller scale. A higher degree attained through the three levels of examinations meant a greater chance of obtaining higher offices in government. Not only did this ensure a higher salary, but also greater social prestige, visibly distinguished by dress. This institutionalized distinction of scholar-officials by dress included the type and even color of traditional silken robes, hats, and <b>girdles,</b> demarcating that scholar-official's level of administrative authority. This rigid code of dress was especially enforced during the beginning of the dynasty, although the prestigious clothing color of purple slowly began to diffuse through the ranks of middle and low grade officials.|$|E
40|$|Heat <b>girdling</b> is {{a method}} to {{estimate}} the relative contribution of phloem vs xylem water flow to fruit growth.

5000|$|<b>Girdling</b> is {{also used}} as a {{technique}} to force a fruit-bearing plant to bear larger fruit. A farmer would place a <b>girdle</b> (bark removal) at base of a large branch or at the trunk. Thus, all sugars manufactured by the leaves have no sinks but the fruit, which grows to above the normal size. For grapes <b>girdling</b> or cincturing is {{used to make the}} grapes large and sweeter on the grape canopy and are sold as <b>girdled</b> grapes. Flowering and fruit setting is a problem on some trees; <b>girdling</b> may improve yield in the same way. The [...] "damage" [...] done by <b>girdling</b> restricts the movement of nutrients to the roots, thus the carbohydrates produced in the leaves do not go to the roots for storage. <b>Girdling</b> temporarily stops tree growth. Root pruning, an ancient Asian practice, and other controlled damaging, such as driving nails into the trunk or beating the branches and trunk, produce results that are similar to <b>girdling.</b> <b>Girdling</b> is commonly used on grape, avocado, apple, litchi, mango, citrus and other trees. <b>Girdling</b> is normally only done to healthy trees that did not yield well the previous year. Care must be used not to damage sapwood that may kill the tree or vine. Trees normally heal in four to five weeks after cincturing. Painting the cut can protect against fungus and pests.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Limitations in the {{techniques}} used to separate root-derived and soil-organic-matter (SOM) -derived respiration have hampered {{the understanding of}} forest carbon cycling. Tree <b>girdling</b> {{is considered to be}} a robust approach with little disturbance to the root–soil system. Using this approach, we tried to separate root-derived respiration from SOM-derived respiration under Acacia crassicarpa and Eucalyptus urophylla plantations in South China. We found that <b>girdling</b> reduced soil respiration and temperature sensitivity of respiration (Q 10) under both plantations compared to controls, but the intensity of <b>girdling</b> effects was species specific. Six months after <b>girdling,</b> live fine root biomass was lower than the control in A. crassicarpa but not in E. urophylla. Soil microbial biomass (Cmic) under A. crassicarpa was increased by <b>girdling</b> 17 days after treatment, but decreased thereafter. In contrast, there was no difference in Cmic between <b>girdled</b> and control treatments under E. urophylla. <b>Girdling</b> significantly decreased soil or-ganic carbon (SOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) under A. crassicarpa, but not under E. urophylla. We ascribe differences in <b>girdling</b> effects on belowground carbon between the two species to differences in resprouting traits...|$|R

5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Brancasaurus brancai is GPMM A3.B4, stored at the University of Münster. It originates from a clay pit {{near the city}} of Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. The specimen was discovered in July 1910 by workers in the clay pit, who dug it out using pickaxes; in doing so, they damaged the specimen (in particular, the pubis had been broken into 176 pieces), and left behind a number of small fragments that were later personally collected by paleontologist Theodor Wegner, who in 1928 described the specimen in detail. The skeleton is fairly complete, consisting of various parts of the skull, most of the vertebrae, several isolated ribs and gastralia, parts of the pectoral and pelvic <b>girdles,</b> both humeri, one femur, and various foot bones from the flippers.
