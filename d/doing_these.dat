5|$|On {{his last}} day, after oversleeping, Homer {{attempts}} {{to do all}} the things on his list. He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder to make a video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing some of the things on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E
5|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{programs have}} received resistance from {{some people in}} Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (the three countries with remaining polio cases). There is distrust surrounding vaccines in Pakistan as in 2011 the CIA organized a fake vaccination program {{in order to help}} find Osama Bin Laden. Additionally, some people believe that the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims. In 2015, the World Health Organization announced a deal with the Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control. However, on September 11, 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and says that the group will continue to keep <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> kinds of attacks. This resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the three remaining countries.|$|E

Going clear back to Ashley and his 8th inning performance in 1974, disc dogs have performed at countless football, basketball, baseball and soccer halftimes. They are many times found in amusement parks, county fairs and pet festivals of all kinds. There are a very small handful of trainers who even make a living <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> shows.|$|E
25|$|The critic Diana Postlethwaite {{wrote of}} this period for Martineau: Being homebound is {{a major part of}} the process of {{becoming}} feminine. In this interior setting she (Martineau) is taught the home arts of working, serving, and cleaning, as well as the rehearsals for the role of mothering. She sees her mother... <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> things. They define femininity for her.Her illness caused her to literally enact the social constraints of women during this time.|$|E
25|$|Gemini's {{objective}} was {{the development of}} space travel techniques to support the Apollo mission to land astronauts on the Moon. It performed missions long enough {{for a trip to}} the Moon and back, perfected working outside the spacecraft with extra-vehicular activity (EVA), and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking. With these new techniques proven by Gemini, Apollo could pursue its prime mission without <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> fundamental exploratory operations.|$|E

25|$|Singer's {{ideas have}} contributed to the rise of {{effective}} altruism. He argues that people should not only try to reduce suffering, but reduce it in the most effective manner possible. While Singer has previously written at length about the moral imperative to reduce poverty and eliminate the suffering of nonhuman animals, particularly in the meat industry, he writes about how the effective altruism movement is <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> things more effectively in his 2015 book, The Most Good You Can Do. He is a board member of Animal Charity Evaluators, a charity evaluator used by many members of the effective altruism community which recommends the most cost-effective animal advocacy charities and interventions.|$|E

25|$|For juries {{to fulfill}} their role of {{analyzing}} {{the facts of the}} case, there are strict rules about their use of information during the trial. Juries are often instructed to avoid learning about the case from any source other than the trial (for example from media or the internet) and not to conduct their own investigations (such as independently visiting a crime scene). Parties to the case, lawyers, and witnesses are not allowed to speak with a member of the jury. <b>Doing</b> <b>these</b> things may constitute reversible error. Rarely, such as in very high-profile cases, the court may order a jury sequestered for the deliberation phase or for the entire trial.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Heap {{was asked}} to perform at POP!Tech in Camden, Maine (US). There she {{performed}} selections from her then forthcoming album Ellipse. After her set and an encouraging plea for another performance later in the conference by the audience and organisers, Heap agreed. Having nothing else prepared though, she decided to improvise a song on the spot with parameters (tempo, key) suggested by the audience. After the show, Heap was asked by a Poptech attendee if she would give the newly created piece of music to his charity. A ‘lightbulb’ moment occurred in Heap’s head and she saw the potential in <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> improvised pieces for local charities at each show during the tour she would soon begin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article {{reviews and}} categorizes {{empirical}} studies related to instructional technology that {{were published in}} three prominent journals: Educational Technology Research and Development, Instructional Science, and the Journal of Educational Computing Research from the year 2000 through 2004. Four questions guided this review: 1) What instructional technology research topics have been conducted? How <b>do</b> <b>these</b> topics fluctuate over the five years? 2) What types of research methods have been applied? How <b>do</b> <b>these</b> research methods fluctuate over the five years? 3) What data collection methods are prevalent in instructional technology research? How <b>do</b> <b>these</b> data collection methods fluctuate over the five years? and 4) In what settings have instructional technology research been conducted? How <b>do</b> <b>these</b> settings fluctuate over the five years? Based on these findings, we discuss current research trends and possible implications for which future research in instructional technology research can take...|$|R

500|$|In mid-2007, Hornish drove Penske's No. 27 Dodge Charger in an ARCA Re/Max Series race at Michigan International Speedway. Starting in {{the pole}} position, {{he led the}} first 29 laps of the race before being passed by {{eventual}} winner Erik Darnell and finishing second. After the race, he called the transition to stock cars a [...] "challenge": [...] "I'm a student at this, still trying {{to learn as much}} as I can. A lot of people have asked me what the toughest transition is, coming over here from the IndyCars and <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> stock car races, and really it's the fact I don't get much practice time." ...|$|E
500|$|With 13 {{tropical}} storms, two hurricanes, and {{no major}} hurricanes, activity fell {{far below the}} predictions. Brian McNoldy at the University of Miami noted several reasons why NOAA should not cease seasonal predictions, including the variability of hurricane seasons {{and the value of}} supplementing climatology with seasonal forecasts. Further, McNoldy argued that forecasting a hurricane season [...] "challenges us to better understand how the atmosphere works." [...] On November29, Dr. Phil Klotzbach of CSU noted that [...] " [...] have been <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> forecasts for 30 years and that's probably the biggest forecast bust that we've had." [...] The program, which had already lost contributions from an insurance company in June, was defunded further following the botched season forecasts. However, Gray and Klotzbach were able to issue predictions for the 2014 season.|$|E
500|$|Rogen {{commented that}} he and Goldberg wanted to show with the episode how Hollywood {{generally}} ruins superhero films. He said that [...] "the whole joke is that Homer is cast to play a guy who's an everyman and {{they try to make}} him into this physically fit guy." [...] Rogen also noted that the plot mirrors the situation he was in while working on the film The Green Hornet, when he had to lose weight and do physical training for his role. Show runner Al Jean commented that the writers tried not to repeat the comic book film theme from the [...] "Radioactive Man" [...] episode. Instead they decided to parody the fact that almost every comic book {{has been turned into a}} film. Jean commented that that scene in the episode in which the studio executives [...] "are trying to think up an idea that hasn't been done really is what they are <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> days [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|During the {{production}} of Rocko's Modern Life, Martin Olson, one of the writers, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series: [...] "After watching Joe [...] tear his hair out a lot, dealing with all the problems that came up, I thought I {{would never want to}} produce a show of my own." [...] However, he realized that if he ever did, this would be the best approach: [...] "For all those years it seemed like I was <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> two totally separate things. I wondered what it all meant. I didn't see a synthesis. It was great when [...] all came together in [...] I felt relieved that I hadn't wasted a lot of time doing something that I then abandoned to do something else. It has been pretty rewarding," [...] Hillenburg said in 2002. He claimed that he finally decided to create a series as he was driving to the beach on the Santa Monica Freeway one day.|$|E
500|$|The {{remaining}} {{songs were}} reviewed less widely. [...] "Jar of Hearts" [...] was praised by Mullins as an [...] "absolutely beautiful performance", and Fallon {{said it was}} [...] "haunting and filmed gorgeously". Kubicek wrote, [...] "it's nice to just hear her sing a song", and also stated that the two songs Rachel sang in the episode were [...] "two of [...] favorite songs from the entire season". Benigno gave it a [...] "B", his lowest grade of the night, and asked the show to [...] "stop <b>doing</b> <b>these</b> numbers": [...] "We get it. She's in pain and she can sing. Move on." [...] He gave [...] "I'm Not Gonna Teach Your Boyfriend How to Dance With You" [...] an [...] "A", and questioned why it had taken so long for Criss to receive numbers independent of the Warblers. Kubicek wrote that it was [...] "Blaine doing what Blaine does best: fun bubblegum pop", but Gonzalez was surprised {{that she did not}} love it and gave it a [...] "B", as she [...] "really missed the backing of Blaine's Warbler cohorts." ...|$|E

[...] She also added, [...] "The more successful we became, the more glamorous and fashionable the clothes became. We set fashion trends in the 80s. Those shoulder pads did get a bit wild. They had to make doors bigger in the end." [...] In an interview with The Telegraph, she said: [...] "It was kind of exciting. I played this neurotic, psychotic, alcoholic weirdo.
