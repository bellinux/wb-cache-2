2500|$|Owing {{to a large}} {{error in}} the factory head bolt torque {{specifications}} (likely owing to switching away from using an asbestos head gasket {{in lieu of a}} copper one), all of these engines had severe problems with blown <b>head</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Toyota never issued a recall for any of the affected vehicles. The problem could be easily fixed by replacing the head gasket and torquing the head bolts to [...] of torque. However, owing to the lack of a recall or appropriate service bulletin, the head gasket problem would recur in another 75,000 miles or so if the gasket was replaced and the bolts were retorqued to the erroneous service manual specifications of [...] With the head bolts torqued correctly, the engines were otherwise extremely durable.|$|E
2500|$|The 196 OHV {{requires}} more periodic maintenance than newer-model engines. The head bolts must be re-torqued (retightening process) regularly. Factory service manuals recommend that head bolt torque be checked every [...] and to re-torque them every [...] With modern <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> this service interval {{can be extended}} to re-torque the bolts every , or every other year. The cause of the headbolts loosening over time {{is believed to be}} thermal expansion and contraction of the head due to the rather heavy design. The head expands and contracts by as much as 0.020" [...] in height during normal operation, this loosens the bolts over time and eventually will cause the seal between head and block to fail. This maintenance is also imperative to prevent the engine from overheating (the first sign of a blown head gasket) and warping or cracking the head. The cast-iron liners in the aluminum block version can also shift if the head bolts are not properly torqued and the engine is allowed to overheat. Good replacement heads and aluminum blocks for these engines are now difficult to find.|$|E
50|$|For 2001 Toyota started fitting factory MLS (multi-layer steel) <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> {{and other}} metal gaskets layered with Viton to engines, {{including}} the 5S-FE. MLS <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> require cylinder head and cylinder block resurfacing on older engines to ensure proper sealing; consequently, the MLS head gasket did not supersede the old composite head gasket.|$|E
50|$|A poorly {{maintained}} {{cooling system}} could {{also lead to}} overheating and, especially with the higher stressed turbo engines, <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> problems.The <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> problem has been treated with {{the adoption of a}} multi-layer steel <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> which replaces the fiber one.|$|R
50|$|The {{condition}} of a <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> is typically investigated by checking the compression pressure with a pressure gauge, or better, a leak-down test, and/or noting {{any indication of}} combustion gases in the cooling system on a water-cooled engine. Oil mixed with coolant and excessive coolant loss with no apparent cause, or presence of carbon monoxide or hydrocarbon gases in the expansion tank of the cooling system can also be signs of <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> problems. A good sign of <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> failure on water-cooled engines {{is the presence of}} a substance that resembles mayonnaise in the oil, often to be seen on the dipstick, or oil filler cap. However, the presence of this substance is not conclusive proof of <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> failure, since oil could mix with the coolant via other routes.|$|R
5000|$|Occasionally, the {{compression}} in the cylinder {{will cause a}} leak to form in the gasket and the gasket {{will have to be}} replaced, or severe damage can take place (a [...] "blown" [...] <b>head</b> <b>gasket).</b> This problem has been exacerbated by the use of aluminum rather than iron cylinder heads; while lighter than iron, aluminum has a much greater thermal expansion rate, which in turn causes a great deal more stress to be placed on the <b>head</b> <b>gasket.</b> Engine makers have responded to this by adding a non-stick coating such as Teflon {{to the surface of the}} <b>head</b> <b>gasket.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fretting {{examples}} include wear of drive splines on driveshafts, wheels at the lug bolt interface, and cylinder <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> subject to differentials in thermal expansion coefficients.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft engines at {{this time}} were {{beginning}} to use high supercharging pressures, increasing the stress on their <b>head</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Engines such as the Rolls-Royce Buzzard used monobloc heads for reliability.|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} a {{significant}} (greater than 10%) difference between cylinders, that may be an indication that valves or cylinder <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> are leaking, piston rings are worn, or that the block is cracked.|$|E

5000|$|RPO LB7 (engine code [...] "1") {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2001 and continued until early-2004. It is a 32-valve design with high-pressure common-rail direct injection and an experimental composite design cylinder head. The most common issue with the LB7 is injector failure, so common that a special policy bulletin was issued (#04039B). Fuel leaked and entered the crankcase, causing oil dilution. Early on, customers came forward complaining of severe overheating, and in some situations, blown <b>head</b> <b>gaskets.</b> Initially GM denied it was a problem, but after being sued by a consumer group, GM relented and included overheating and blown <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> as a warranted item.|$|E
50|$|Wills Rings are {{expensive}} {{in comparison to}} other seals, such as elastomer O-rings or metallic foil <b>head</b> <b>gaskets.</b> A typical comparison is one ring costing approx. $50 each, around {{the price of a}} high-performance head gasket for a four-cylinder engine.|$|E
50|$|Some wasserboxers were {{plagued by}} water jacket gasket {{failures}} (often erroneously {{referred to as}} <b>head</b> <b>gaskets)</b> due to several design issues.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a piezoelectric sensor {{to pick up}} compression oscillations from combustion engines and its force-fitted clamped arrangement {{in the region of}} the cylinder <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> between the cylinder block and the cylinder head, characterized by the following features: the piezoelectric component (4) is secured permanently to a fixed axial housing wall (2 a) within a housing (2) whose thickness is definable; said housing wall (2 a) is located in a directly or indirectly elastic clamping arrangement against one of the sealing surfaces of the cylinder block (20) or cylinder head (21) adjacent to the cylinder <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> (11). The sensor (1) can be supported, preferably by its housing wall (2 a), in a recess (23) in one of the sealing surfaces of the cylinder block (20) or the cylinder head (21) adjacent to the cylinder <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> (11) and is thus arranged extending through the cylinder <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> (11) and a groove (24) ...|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{although}} pre-production engines cast by {{an outside}} foundry performed well, those fitted to production cars were made very poorly in house by a plant troubled with industrial unrest and poor quality control. Poor manufacturing standards also {{gave rise to}} head warpage, and <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> that restricted coolant flow, which also led to overheating.|$|E

5000|$|... Ford/International used four Torque to Yield (TTY) {{cylinder}} head bolts per cylinder for the 6.0s and 6.4s. TTY bolts offer {{some of the}} most precise clamping force available, but can be problematic. In certain situations (Oil cooler/EGR cooler failure, high boost/load levels brought on by improper use of aftermarket programmers) TTY bolts can be stretched beyond their torque mark by increased cylinder pressures. This has never been addressed by Ford {{due to the fact that}} other malfunctions or abuse must occur to stretch the bolts. Some in the aftermarket will replace the factory bolts with head studs in an attempt to protect the <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> from future failure. If this is done without addressing the underlying issue, the <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> may fail again bringing along a cracked or warped {{cylinder head}}. In contrast, the Powerstroke 7.3s and 6.7s have 6 head bolts per cylinder while the IDI 7.3s and 6.9s have five.|$|E

50|$|In service, {{the unit}} {{proved to be}} a {{somewhat}} mixed bag; some owners reported excellent reliability and long engine lives, others complained of overheating, frequent blowing of <b>head</b> <b>gaskets,</b> cylinder head cracks (cracks between the valve seats are common and do not represent danger if the cracks do not exceed specifications), premature wear of the bottom and top end bearings, low oil pressure etc.|$|E
50|$|There are two engine options, the 1.8T and the 2.5 V6, both revised Rover K-Series engines {{called the}} N-Series, with {{stronger}} <b>head</b> <b>gaskets,</b> both meeting strict Euro IV emissions regulations. Changes to the electrical system {{have been made}} to improve the engine's ignition system and also to support the wider range of equipment, which includes front headrest mounted DVD players for rear passengers, and a reversing camera.|$|E
50|$|The highest {{performance}} is achieved with fuel of 30% or more nitro content. At least 20% oil (50/50 castor/synthetic) is recommended. Acceptable performance {{can be had}} without nitromethane, although the engine will be very sensitive to needle adjustments {{making it more difficult}} to operate. With high Nitromethane (nitro) fuel {{it may be necessary to}} lower the compression by installing up to six or more additional <b>head</b> <b>gaskets.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Raising the {{compression}} ratio {{by reducing the}} size of the combustion chamber, which makes more efficient use of the cylinder pressure developed and leading to more rapid burning of fuel, by using larger compression height pistons or thinner <b>head</b> <b>gaskets,</b> or by using a milling machine or [...] "shaving" [...] the cylinder head. High compression ratios can cause engine knock unless high octane fuels are used.|$|E
5000|$|This {{combined}} with the early practice of installing the head gasket with plastic locating dowels, which subsequently melted when the engines overheated, allowed the <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> to [...] "walk." [...] A redesigned head gasket, which consists of a multiple layer metal gasket or [...] "MLS" [...] {{used in conjunction with}} steel locating dowels, is alleged to significantly reduce the chance of a head gasket failure.|$|E
50|$|Some {{fire hydrant}} {{manufacturers}} recommend lubricating the head mechanism and restoring the <b>head</b> <b>gaskets</b> and O-rings annually {{in order that}} the fire hydrant perform the service expected of them, while others have incorporated proprietary features to provide long-term lubrication of the hydrant's operating mechanism. In any case, periodic inspection of lubricants is recommended. Lubrication is generally done with a food-grade non-petroleum lubricant to avoid contamination of the distribution system.|$|E
50|$|Ricardo {{undertook}} {{an investigation}} on the behalf of SAIC {{into the well}} known and documented <b>Head</b> <b>Gasket</b> issues of the Rover K Series and to remedy the problems with engine. The improvements included a redesigned head and case, as well as changing the manufacturing process and quality of material. No <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> issues has been recorded and thanks to Ricardo, the SAIC Kavachi {{is seen as the}} ultimate version of the Rover K Series.|$|R
50|$|These are all vital, {{but must}} never {{be allowed to}} intermix. Apart from sealing the cylinder, the <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> also seals water and oil {{conduits}} between the head and block. Any connectivity between them will cause engine failure, or significant problems like burning oil (smoke from the exhaust). Blue exhaust smoke may be indicative of oil burning. White exhaust smoke is an indicator of coolant burning, another sign of <b>head</b> <b>gasket</b> wear.|$|R
5000|$|Leak-down {{testing is}} a static test. Leak-down tests {{cylinder}} leakage paths. Leak-down primarily tests pistons and rings, seated valve sealing, and the <b>head</b> <b>gasket.</b>|$|R
