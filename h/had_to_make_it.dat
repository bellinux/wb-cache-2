5|$|On 17 December, {{orders for}} the {{complete}} evacuation of the peninsula were issued. The regiment started leaving the next day, when six officers and 155 other ranks left for Lemnos before dawn. Those left behind <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> appear that the trenches were fully occupied. At 21:30 {{two thirds of the}} remainder were evacuated. Other smaller parties left the trenches between 01:40 and 02:05, when the last officer and eleven other ranks moved down to the beach and were evacuated. The surviving 375 men of the regiment camped on Lemnos until transport was available to take them back to Egypt. Their involvement in the Gallipoli Campaign had cost the regiment a total of 640 casualties.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he then <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> {{back inside the}} ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match. Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang, but Crush {{reversed}} the attack. He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage {{made it back to}} the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, Crush tried to throw salt in Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to a pulley. Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.|$|E
25|$|In the evening, Crosby did {{the whole}} show before an {{audience}}. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but {{we would have to}} take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> up out of two or three parts. This ad lib way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.|$|E

25|$|Also in 13BC, {{his father}} {{returned}} to Rome and was promptly sent to Pannonia to suppress a rebellion. Agrippa arrived there that winter (in 12BC), but the Pannonians {{gave up their}} plans. Agrippa returned to Campania in Italy, where he fell ill and died soon after. The death of Gaius' father made succession a pressing issue. The aurei and denarii issued in 13-12BC made clear the Emperor's dynastic plans for Gaius and Lucius. Their father was no longer available to assume the reigns of power if the Emperor were to die, and Augustus <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> clear who his intended heirs were in case anything should happen.|$|E

She described what her album is about and then she sent me some CDs of what type of stuff's been inspiring her to make the record, and {{it happened to be}} a lot of stuff that I grew up on in the early '70s, 'cause I'm 40. Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, Esther Williams, all kinds of different things.

500|$|Due to its low budget, Becoming Jane {{was filmed}} on a [...] "tight" [...] {{schedule}} of eight weeks from March to May 2006. Jarrold observed however that because Ecosse {{was not a}} film studio, he had more creative freedom. Bernstein stated of filming, [...] "We recreated a world that Jane Austen lovers can recognise and associate with. But hopefully we can also take them into areas and places like the boxing club, the cricket game and the fair that do not feature in Jane Austen's fiction. They are sort of seedy and dangerous areas that are not normally associated with Austen." [...] Jarrold found filming [...] "very difficult. We <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> work in the locations that we had as efficiently as possible." [...] Filming outdoors was often so cold that Hathaway turned blue and had difficulty saying her lines; Automated Dialogue Replacement in post-production helped correct this by re-dubbing her lines.|$|E

500|$|The {{localization}} team faced {{some issues}} when localizing the character Jean Armstrong: in the Japanese version, he {{is portrayed as}} an okama character, {{which at the time}} of the game's development was a general word for effeminate men, often implying homosexuality, but also used for biologically male persons who do drag or speak like women, regardless of their sexuality and gender, and even including trans women. Because of this, they only had a vague concept of [...] "gay", and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> understandable for English-speaking players. Hsu looked through all information that is given about Jean in the game, and came to the conclusion that he is a gay cis man who likes to perform non-passing drag. Looking back at the game in 2014, Hsu said that she still thought Jean caused confusion due to the general public having a less informed and nuanced understanding of gender and sexuality {{at the time of the}} game's release.|$|E
500|$|Legal {{historian}} John Phillip Reid {{has written}} that {{the emphasis on the}} political philosophy of the Declaration has been misplaced. The Declaration is not a philosophical tract about natural rights, argues Reid, but is instead a legal document—an indictment against King George for violating the constitutional rights of the colonists. [...] Historian David Armitage has argued that the Declaration was strongly influenced by de Vattel's The Law of Nations, the dominant international law treatise of the period, and a book that Benjamin Franklin said was [...] "continually {{in the hands of the}} members of our Congress". Armitage writes, [...] "Vattel made independence fundamental to his definition of statehood"; therefore, the primary purpose of the Declaration was [...] "to express the international legal sovereignty of the United States". If the United States were to have any hope of being recognized by the European powers, the American revolutionaries first <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> clear that they were no longer dependent on Great Britain. [...] The Declaration of Independence does not have the force of law domestically, but nevertheless it may help to provide historical and legal clarity about the Constitution and other laws.|$|E
500|$|John [...] "DJ" [...] Desjardin {{served as}} the visual {{supervisor}} for Man of Steel, with Weta Digital, MPC, and Double Negative providing the visual effects for the film. Zack Snyder wanted the film to [...] "appear very natural because there’s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> as easy as {{possible for them to}} do so." [...] Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a [...] "documentary-style" [...] film. [...] "We had to think about what that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action," [...] said Desjardin. [...] "So {{for a lot of the}} previs we did, we’d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the Battlestar Galactica rules for the space cams that Gary Hurtzel [...] developed for that miniseries, where we want to make sure if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense. Unless the action is so over the top, like in the end where Superman is beating up Zod—we had to break it a bit." ...|$|E

500|$|Nimoy {{approached}} ILM {{early in}} development and helped create storyboards for the optical effects sequences. Many shots used matte paintings to extend backgrounds and create establishing shots without {{the cost of}} building a set. Matte supervisor Chris Evans attempted to create paintings that felt less contrived and more real—while the natural instinct of filmmaking is to place important elements in an orderly fashion, Evans said that photographers would [...] "shoot things that [...] are odd in some way" [...] and end up with results that look natural instead. The task of establishing the location and atmosphere at Starfleet Headquarters fell to the matte department, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> feel like a bustling futuristic version of San Francisco. The matte personnel and Ralph McQuarrie provided design input. The designers decided to make actors in the foreground more prominent, and filmed them on a large area of smooth concrete runway at the Oakland Airport. Elements like a shuttlecraft that thirty extras appeared to interact with were also mattes blended to appear as if they were sitting by the actors. Ultimately the artists were not satisfied with how the shot turned out; matte photography supervisor Craig Barron believed that there were too many elements in the scene.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Nas {{released}} his tenth studio album Distant Relatives, a collaboration with Damian Marley that reinvigorated the rapper creatively. He soon became distracted by tax problems and an expensive, highly publicized divorce {{from his wife}} Kelis months before their son's birth, events that influenced his direction for Life Is Good. His songwriting on the album was also influenced by adjusting back to life as a single man. Nas also wanted to write more original subject matter rather than another album [...] "about how you {{came up in the}} hood and how you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> out of the hood". Although he did not find his album [...] "quite so much about the marriage or the divorce", Nas likened Life Is Good to Marvin Gaye's 1978 album Here, My Dear, which was written by Gaye in response to his own deteriorating marriage and released as a financial settlement. For Life Is Goods album cover, a photo was taken of Nas in a polished white suit, sitting in a night club's VIP lounge, appearing forlorn, and holding over his knee Kelis' actual green wedding dress, which he said was the only item she left him. When writing the album, Nas also reflected on aging and maturation, fatherhood, and his 20-year experience in hip hop music. Nas discussed the album's personal subject matter in an interview for Billboard: ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2009, Somma {{took part}} in a trial with Queens Park Rangers and played in a {{pre-season}} fixture as a winger. After his trial at QPR, Somma {{took part in}} a trial at Leeds United, and earned an extended spell at the club. He scored in a pre-season friendly against Newport County and also scored in friendlies against Newcastle United and Hull City, and signed a permanent contract with the club in September 2009 on a one-year deal, with an option in the club's favour to extend the contract for a further season.

2500|$|Of {{filming the}} moment in which Rebecca pushes Paul, Hall said [...] "The way Stefan Dennis (who plays Paul) and I {{interpreted}} it and acted it was we had to satisfy ourselves {{that it was one}} of those random and instantaneous mistakes people make. When we worked on the scene we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> look like she had a moment of fury that caused her to do that." [...] Hall knew that viewers would be surprised at Rebecca being the culprit and she herself was surprised by the fan's reactions. Some women questioned how Rebecca could do such a thing to Paul, even though he cheated on her and lied to her. Hall thought that someone could get [...] "so fed up" [...] that they made a rash decision that is not something they thought they could ever do. In September 2010, Rebecca's confession and explanation for the night she pushed Paul was broadcast. The episode initially saw Declan Napier (Erin Mullally) admit to Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) that he was responsible to protect his mother. Hall added that [...] "the ramifications of Rebecca pushing Paul over the mezzanine are far-reaching".|$|E

2500|$|Chilean presidents {{were allowed}} a maximum term of six years, {{which may explain}} Allende's haste to restructure the economy. Not only was a major {{restructuring}} program organized (the Vuskovic Plan), he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a success if a socialist successor to Allende {{was going to be}} elected. In the first year of Allende's term, the short-term economic results of Minister of the Economy Pedro Vuskovic's expansive monetary policy were highly favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in GDP, accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). However, by 1972, the Chilean escudo had an inflation rate of 140%. The average Real GDP contracted between 1971 and 1973 {{at an annual rate of}} 5.6% ("negative growth"); and the government's fiscal deficit soared while foreign reserves declined. The combination of inflation and government-mandated price-fixing, together with the [...] "disappearance" [...] of basic commodities from supermarket shelves, led to the rise of black markets in rice, beans, sugar, and flour. The Chilean economy also suffered as a result of a US campaign against the Allende government. The Allende government announced it would default on debts owed to international creditors and foreign governments. Allende also froze all prices while raising salaries. His implementation of these policies was strongly opposed by landowners, employers, businessmen and transporters associations, and some civil servants and professional unions. The rightist opposition was led by the National Party, the Roman Catholic Church (which in 1973 was displeased with the direction of educational policy), and eventually the Christian Democrats. There were growing tensions with foreign multinational corporations and the government of the United States.|$|E
