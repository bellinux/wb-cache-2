The effects of array aperture on localization are analyzed by using array response (array manifold). Besides array aperture, {{the frequency of}} acoustic source and the variance of signal power are simulated to demonstrate how to optimize localization performance, which is carried out by introducing frequency error with the proposed method. The proposed method for 5 [*]mm array aperture is validated by simulations and experiments with MEMS microphone arrays. Different types of acoustic sources can be localized with the highest precision of 6 degrees even {{in the presence of}} wind noise and other noises. Furthermore, the proposed method reduces the computational complexity compared with other methods...|$|E

The interview questions were related to the Health Belief Model and thus focused on perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barriers, perceived benefits and self-efficacy of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use. Descriptive qualitative analysis was then applied to analyse themes from the interviews. Results: Ten barriers and nine facilitators to <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> use in New Zealand were found.

It {{has been reported}} that about 31 % of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> users reject their own <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> because of annoyance towards background noise. The reason for dissatisfaction can be located anywhere from the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> microphone till the integrity of neurons along the auditory pathway. Objectives: To measure spectra from the output of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> at the ear canal level and frequency following response recorded at the auditory brainstem from individuals with hearing impairment. Methods: A total of sixty participants having moderate sensorineural hearing impairment with age range from 15 to 65 years were involved. Each participant was classified as either Good or Poor <b>Hearing</b> <b>aid</b> Performers based on acceptable noise level measure. Stimuli /da/ and /si/ were presented through loudspeaker at 65 dB SPL. At the ear canal, the spectra were measured in the unaided and aided conditions. At auditory brainstem, frequency following response were recorded to the same stimuli from the participants. Results: Spectrum measured in each condition at ear canal was same in good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers and poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers. At brainstem level, better F 0 encoding; F 0 and F 1 energies were significantly higher in good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers than in poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers. Though the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> spectra were almost same between good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers and poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers, subtle physiological variations exist at the auditory brainstem. Conclusion: The result of the present study suggests that neural encoding of speech sound at the brainstem level might be mediated distinctly in good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers from that of poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers. Thus, it can be inferred that subtle physiological changes are evident at the auditory brainstem in a person who is willing to accept noise from those who are not willing to accept noise...|$|R
