5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} (a sudden worsening of symptoms) {{is commonly}} triggered by infection or environmental pollutants, or sometimes by other {{factors such as}} improper use of medications. Infections {{appear to be the}} cause of 50 to 75% of cases, with bacteria in 25%, viruses in 25%, and both in 25%. Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and outdoor air quality. Exposure to personal smoke and secondhand smoke increases the risk. Cold temperature may also play a role, with exacerbations occurring more commonly in winter. Those with more severe underlying disease <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> exacerbations: in mild disease 1.8 per year, moderate 2 to 3 per year, and severe 3.4 per year. Those with many exacerbations have a faster rate of deterioration of their lung function. Pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) can worsen symptoms in those with pre-existing COPD. Signs of PE in COPD include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection.|$|E
25|$|Power outage {{duration}} {{is a measure}} of the reliability of supply to the distribution networks. This measure decreased for most regions in Honduras from 2001. However, in 2005, a general increase in the interruption duration happened. The total duration of interruptions per connection (36 hours per year in 2005, compared to 24 hours in 2004, but 135 hours in 1999 in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch) is about twice as high as the average for Latin America and the Caribbean (14 hours per connection in 2005). However, the frequency of such interruptions has been higher in other countries, meaning that Honduras has a few long outages, while other countries <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> shorter ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{recollection}} of dreams is extremely unreliable, {{though it is}} a skill that can be trained. Dreams can usually be recalled if a person is awakened while dreaming. Women tend to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> dream recall than men. Dreams that are difficult to recall may be characterized by relatively little affect, and factors such as salience, arousal, and interference play a role in dream recall. Often, a dream may be recalled upon viewing or hearing a random trigger or stimulus. The salience hypothesis proposes that dream content that is salient, that is, novel, intense, or unusual, is more easily remembered. There is considerable evidence that vivid, intense, or unusual dream content is more frequently recalled. A dream journal can be used to assist dream recall, for personal interest or psychotherapy purposes.|$|E

Sediments however had higher {{concentrations of}} aldrin than fish samples except in M. senegalensis. Sediment samples also <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> detection of pesticides than fish samples. This contrast to findings made by Caldas et al. (1999) in which fish samples from Paranoa Lake of Brasilia in Brazil <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> detections of OCP residue than did sediment samples from the same lake. Kuranchie-Mensah et al. (2011) reported much higher mean concentrations of aldrin and p,p′-DDE in sediments at Nsawam in Ghana from the Densu river basin than the levels determined in this study.|$|R
25|$|In {{line with}} the {{salience}} hypothesis, there is considerable evidence {{that people who have}} more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better recall. There is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall. Specifically, people who have vivid and unusual experiences during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence better dream recall. People who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as openness to experience, daydreaming, fantasy proneness, absorption, and hypnotic susceptibility, tend to show more frequent dream recall. There is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming and waking experience. That is, people who report more bizarre experiences during the day, such as people high in schizotypy (psychosis proneness) <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> dream recall and also report more frequent nightmares.|$|E
25|$|All five {{lines of}} the Oslo Metro, {{numbered}} 1 through 5, run through the Common Tunnel. Most services have a 15-minute headway, which is increased to 30 minutes in the late evening and early on Sundays. Two lines <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> service. Line 2, which runs on the Furuset Line, has its headway reduced to 7.5 minutes and runs the entire tunnel. Line 3 on the Østensjø Line also has extra trains that terminate at Stortinget giving a 7.5 minute frequency {{on the east side}} of the tunnel. Line 5 trains run once around the Ring Line before continuing to their final destinations and therefore make two passes through the tunnel on a complete journey. Travel time from Majorstuen to Tøyen takes eight minutes. The tunnel is the bottleneck of the metro, with a capacity for 24 trains per hour in each direction west of Stortinget, and 28 east of Stortinget.|$|E
25|$|Ulcerative colitis {{patients}} typically {{present with}} rectal bleeding, diarrhea, tenesmus (urgent desire {{to evacuate the}} bowels but {{with the passage of}} little stool), and lower abdominal pain. The severity of disease at clinical presentation is important in determining the appropriate therapy. Patients with mildly active disease will have fewer than 4 bowel movements daily and no signs of toxicity. Individuals with moderate-severity UC <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> bowel movements with bleeding. Approximately 70% of patients with ulcerative colitis will have moderately active disease at presentation. Patients with severely active disease will have signs of toxicity with fever, tachycardia, and anemia. Patients with fulminant or toxic colitis or toxic megacolon often have more than 10 bowel movements in a day, continuous bleeding, abdominal distention and tenderness, and radiologic evidence of edema and, in some cases, bowel dilation. These people most often require immediate colectomy because 10% have perforated colon at the time of surgery.|$|E

2500|$|Narcotics Anonymous is {{fundamentally}} {{made up of}} NA Groups. An NA Group is a number of NA members who meet regularly; usually {{at the same time}} and place each week. Some Groups <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> meetings but are considered to be part of a single Group. Groups have one primary purpose, to carry the message to the addict who still suffers. Groups are largely independent from one another and members of NA are encouraged to choose a [...] "home group" [...] to belong to, a group they attend regularly and where they will be missed if they are absent. Each Group elects any number of leaders, or [...] "trusted servants", to serve the needs of the Group they made include: a Group Secretary, a Group Treasurer, a Group Chairperson, a Group Service Representative (GSR) and an alternate GSR. This election process is carried out by the Group Conscience which is a business meeting made up of the members of the Group who strive for consensus-based decisions. With each group being autonomous, without affecting NA as a whole, the responsibilities of trusted servants vary from meeting to meeting. These responsibilities or [...] "group policies" [...] are contrived through the group's business meeting by inviting a Higher Power to guide each individual recovering addicts' decision, also known as a group conscience. An example of one specific trusted servants responsibilities are, [...] "The secretary is responsible for opening the meeting, choosing someone to chair the meeting, making sure coffee gets made, etc. He or she also arranges for purchasing supplies and keeping group records. The treasurer keeps financial records and pays the group's bills. The GSR attends the Area Service Committee meetings and represents the group to the ASC. The alternate GSR assists the GSR and prepares to replace the GSR when need be." ...|$|E

It is {{generally}} believed at Bedford, that, after Bunyan was imprisoned, his family removed from Elstow to Bedford, {{in order that}} they might <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>frequent</b> access to him; and that, on his release, he made his abode there. His humble dwelling was much like that of his father at Elstow, most unassuming; just such a cottage as a poor wounded sinner would {{feel at home in}} when visiting his pastor for advice. The late Rev. J. Geard, of Hitchin, in his Diary, says--'July 17, 1774. I preached, for the first time, at Bedford, to the successors of good Mr. Bunyan's congregation, and the next day called at the house where he used to live, and went into the room that tradition reported was his study. This house, though it had been the habitation of so truly great a man, was now let for about 40s. per annum.' Allowing for the difference in the value of money, Bunyan would have now paid 16s. a-year rent for his humble abode. It will be always matter of regret, that it was not purchased and preserved by the members of the 'Old Meeting,' when it was offered them before its destruction; we procured, however, a drawing of it, which is here engraved. The cottage was in the parish of St. Cuthbert, in the street opposite the meeting-house, and here Bunyan lived, while he was pastor, from 1681 to 1688.|$|E
