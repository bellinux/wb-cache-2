40|$|Water {{flowing through}} sediments at Gale Crater, Mars created environments that were likely habitable, and sampled basin-wide {{hydrological}} systems. However, many questions remain about these environments and the fluids that generated them. Measurements {{taken by the}} Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity of multiple fracture zones can help constrain the environments that formed them {{because they can be}} compared to nearby associated parent material (Figure 1). For example, measurements of altered fracture zones from the target Greenhorn in the Stimson sandstone can be compared to parent material measured in the nearby Big Sky target, allowing constraints to be placed on the alteration conditions that formed the Greenhorn target from the Big Sky target. Similarly, CheMin measurements of the powdered < 150 micron fraction from the drillhole at Big Sky and sample from the Rocknest <b>eolian</b> <b>deposit</b> indicate that the mineralogies are strikingly similar. The main differences are the presence of olivine in the Rocknest <b>eolian</b> <b>deposit,</b> which is absent in the Big Sky target, and the presence of far more abundant Fe oxides in the Big Sky target. Quantifying the changes between the Big Sky target and the Rocknest <b>eolian</b> <b>deposit</b> can therefore help us understand the diagenetic changes that occurred forming the Stimson sedimentary unit. In order to interpret these aqueous changes, we performed reactive transport modeling of 1) the formation of the Big Sky target from a Rocknest eolian deposit-like parent material, and 2) the formation of the Greenhorn target from the Big Sky target. This work allows us to test the relationships between the targets and the characteristics of the aqueous conditions that formed the Greenhorn target from the Big Sky target, and the Big Sky target from a Rocknest eolian deposit-like parent material...|$|E

The first is that the wind preferentially transports spherical, rounded sand grains, and this can result in the isolation and accumulation of such grains in an <b>eolian</b> <b>deposit</b> after a relatively short transport distance. The second is that eolian abrasion can greatly increase the roundness of sand grains during their transport over a distance of less than 160 kin.

Releative to Na-, K-, Mg-, and Fe-perchlorate, the thermal decomposition of Ca-perchlorate in laboratory experiments released O 2 in the temperature range (400 - 500 degC) closest to the O 2 release temperatures observed for the Rocknest material.

This study investigates the magnetic mineralogy, magnetic concentration and magnetic grain size distribution of Jiaxian Red Clay with multimagnetic methods. Our results indicate that the magnetic properties of Jiaxian Red Clay {{are similar to those of}} the Quaternary loess-palaeosol sequences, and ultrafine ferrimagnetic grains produced during pedogenesis are responsible for an increase in susceptibility, therefore the χ enhancement mechanism of Red Clay is similar to that of the overlying loess-palaeosol sequences. This paper explores χ variations in the Red Clay sequence through spatial and temporal analysis. The susceptibility variation of six sites along a NNE to SSW transect correlate to palaeoclimatic cycles, so χ can be used to trace the summer palaeomonsoon intensity from a spatial perspective. However, a simple loess-derived calibration function cannot be used to quantitative reconstruct the palaeomonsoon intensity variations thought time. An adjusted calibration function for palaeosols from Red Clay sequence needs to be developed, so that χ can be used to quantitative reconstruct palaeomonsoon intensity.

40|$|Although <b>eolian</b> <b>deposits</b> {{are known}} to record the {{dominant}} winds, secondary conditions such as wind reversals during wintertime can also be observed in the petrographic composition and facies succession. Thus, <b>eolian</b> <b>deposits</b> are used here as a local paleoclimatic proxy. The spatial distribution of the depositional facies, early diagenetic imprints, and early fracture network of a coastal Pleistocene eolian ridge in southeastern Tunisia is described using a small-scale GIS model. Facies analysis indicates that coastal dune systems record seasonal cycles. The fracture density and directions are strongly inXuenced by the depositional facies type. Laminated facies present a higher fracture density compared to more homogeneous facies and show only one major fracture direction, while the more homogeneous facies display a bimodal distribution. Such a diVerence between these two groups is explained by the heterogeneous distribution of the early calcite cement within the laminated facies. No tectonic activity or overlying strata have aVected the Pleistocene dunes under study. Therefore, the mechanism responsible for the fractures could only {{be related to the}} own weight of the eolianite and to its internal or underlying lithologic heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|Mostly {{stabilized}} late Holocene eolian sands on the Southern High Plains of the United States {{were studied}} {{to determine their}} origins and to assess whether present dune stability depends more strongly on sediment supply, sediment availability, or transport limitations. Geomorphic, sedimentological, and geochemical trends indicate that late Holocene dunes formed under westerly paleowinds, broadly {{similar to those of}} today. Mineralogical and geochemical data indicate that the most likely source for the sands is not the Pecos River valley, but the Pleistocene Blackwater Draw Formation, an older, extensive <b>eolian</b> <b>deposit</b> in the region. These observations suggest that new sand is supplied whenever vegetation cover is diminished {{to the extent that the}} Blackwater Draw Formation can be eroded, in agreement with modern observations of wind erosion in the region. We conclude, therefore, that Southern High Plains dunes are stabilized primarily due to a vegetation cover. The dunes are thus sediment-availability limited. This conclusion is consistent with the observation that, in the warmest, driest part of the region (where vegetation cover is minimal), dunes are currently active over a large area. Geochemical data indicate that Southern High Plains dunes are the most mineralogically mature (quartz rich) sands yet studied in the Great Plains, which suggests a long history of eolian activity, either in the dune fields or during deposition of the Blackwater Draw Formation...|$|E

The MSL team has two methods available to collect, process and deliver samples to onboard analytical laboratories, the Chemistry and Mineralogy instrument (CheMin) and the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument suite. One approach obtains samples by drilling into a rock, the other uses a scoop to collect loose regolith fines. Scooping was planned to be first method performed on Mars because materials could be readily scooped multiple times and used to remove any remaining, minute terrestrial contaminants from the sample processing system, the Collection and Handling for In-Situ Martian Rock Analysis (CHIMRA).

40|$|The {{formation}} of sombric horizons (dark horizons in the subsoil) {{is still not}} understood. In order to improve {{our understanding of the}} {{formation of}} sombric horizons we studied these soils in southern Brazil from various perspectives. The lateral configuration and grain size distribution excluded the possibility that the sombric horizon is a paleosol covered by an <b>eolian</b> <b>deposit</b> or colluvium. Micromorphology showed intense biological activity, indicating strong bioturbation. The absence of clay and OM coatings indicates that the sombric horizon in the study area was not formed by illuviation. Considering changes with depth, phytoliths and δ 13 C isotopes clearly showed that the OM from the sombric horizon had a larger contribution from grasses, while a larger contribution from black carbon (BC) was evidenced by the molecular composition. A larger contribution from grasses and BC both correspond to drier climatic conditions. However, similar depth trends for δ 13 C and PAHs were found in the reference profile (without sombric horizon), in agreement with climatic change but not explaining the different morphology. The molecular composition and C/N ratio showed that the profiles differed in degree of decomposition, with the OM in the soils that contained a sombric horizon being more decomposed than that in the reference profile. The sombric horizon is thus a remnant of an earlier phase of soil formation under a drier climate, which is made visible by differences in decomposition of OM related to subsequent more humid conditions. Stronger decomposition in the profiles with a sombric horizon may be related to better drainage, explaining their occurrence in the highest positions within the landscape and suggesting a topographic control...|$|E
40|$|Fluvial and eolian {{successions}} {{of oxygen}} isotopes stage 3 are compared with global (GCM) and regional climate (RCM) modeling experiments {{of the stage}} 3 and last glacial maximum climate in Europe. Differences in precipitation between stage- 3 stades and interstades were minor, which is confirmed by the fluvial successions. The fluvial response to climate variation is non-uniform, and in southern Europe more pronounced than in northern Europe. The model simulations indicate a strong western winter circulation over Europe during stage 3, which {{is supported by the}} <b>eolian</b> <b>deposits</b> data. Wind speeds in the last glacial maximum simulation appear modest compared with those of stage 3, which contrasts with the abundance of <b>eolian</b> <b>deposits.</b> This suggests that during glacial climates the stabilizing effect of vegetation determines eolian sedimentation rates, rather than wind speed.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} from Gale Crater, Mars document past aqueous alteration {{both in the}} formation of the Stimson sandstone unit, as well as {{in the formation of}} altered fractures within that unit. Geochemical and mineralogical data from Curiosity also suggest Fe-rich amorphous weathering products are present in most samples measured to date. Here we interpret conditions of possible past weathering in Gale Crater using a combination of field, laboratory, and modeling work. In order to better understand secondary Fe-rich phases on Mars, we are examining formation of weathering products in high Fe and Mg and low Al serpentine soils in the Klamath Mountains, CA. We have isolated potential weathering products from these soils, and are analyzing them using synchrotron XRF and XRD as well as FullPat for a direct comparison to analyses from Gale Crater. In order to interpret the implications of the persistence of potential secondary Fe-containing phases on Mars, we are also measuring the dissolution rates of the secondary weathering products allophane, Fe-rich allophane, and hisingerite. Ongoing dissolution experiments of these materials suggest that they dissolve significantly more rapidly than more crystalline secondary minerals with similar chemical compositions. Finally, to quantify the specific conditions of past aqueous alteration in Gale Crater we are performing reactive transport modeling of a range of possible past environmental conditions. Specifically, we are testing the conditions under which a Stimson unit-like material forms from a parent material similar to Rocknest or Bagnold eolian deposits, and the conditions under which observed altered fracture zones form from a Stimson unit-like parent material. Our modeling results indicate that the formation of the Stimson unit is consistent with leaching of an <b>eolian</b> <b>deposit</b> with a solution of pH = 6 - 8, and that formation of the altered fracture zones is consistent with leaching with a very acidic (pH = 2 - 3) high sulfate solution containing Ca.

40|$|The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) {{instrument}} detected {{at least}} 4 distinct CO 2 release during the pyrolysis {{of a sample}} scooped from the Rocknest (RN) <b>eolian</b> <b>deposit.</b> The highest peak CO 2 release temperature (478 - 502 C) {{has been attributed to}} either a Fe-rich carbonate or nano-phase Mg-carbonate. The objective of this experimental study was to evaluate the thermal evolved gas analysis (T/EGA) characteristics of a series of terrestrial Fe-rich carbonates under analog SAM operating conditions to compare with the RN CO 2 releases. Natural Fe-rich carbonates (< 53 microns) with varying Fe amounts (Fe(0. 66) X(0. 34) - to Fe(0. 99) X(0. 01) -CO 3, where X refers to Mg and/or Mn) were selected for T/EGA. The carbonates were heated from 25 to 715 C (35 C/min) and evolved CO 2 was measured as a function of temperature. The highest Fe containing carbonates (e. g., Fe(0. 99) X(0. 01) -CO 3) yielded CO 2 peak temperatures between 466 - 487 C, which is consistent with the high temperature RN CO 2 release. The lower Fe-bearing carbonates (e. g., Fe(0. 66) X(0. 34) CO 3) did not have peak CO 2 release temperatures that matched the RN peak CO 2 temperatures; however, their entire CO 2 releases did occur within RN temperature range of the high temperature CO 2 release. Results from this laboratory analog analysis demonstrate that the high temperature RN CO 2 release is consistent with Fe-rich carbonate (approx. 0. 7 to 1 wt. % FeCO 3). The similar RN geochemistry with other materials in Gale Crater and elsewhere on Mars (e. g., Gusev Crater, Meridiani) suggests that up to 1 wt. % Fe-rich carbonate may occur throughout the Gale Crater region and could be widespread on Mars. The Rocknest Fe-carbonate may have formed from the interaction of reduced Fe phases (e. g., Fe 2 + bearing olivine) with atmospheric CO 2 and transient water. Alternatively, the Rocknest Fe-carbonate could be derived by eolian processes that have eroded distally exposed deep crustal material that possesses Fe-carbonate that may have formed through metamorphic and/or metasomatic processes...|$|E
40|$|We present here bulk {{sediment}} {{major element}} chemistry, Nd and Sr isotope ratios, and detrital apatite fission-track (AFT) and U-Pb zircon ages {{to characterize the}} provenance of the southwestern Taklimakan Desert (northwest China) and the three major rivers draining this region. We establish the spatial and temporal controls on erosion and sediment transport in the modern Tibetan rain shadow. The Hotan River drains the North Kunlun block and is characterized by zircon populations at 160 – 230 Ma and 370 – 520 Ma. The Yarkand River shares these grains with the Hotan, but also has a very prominent zircon population at 40 – 160 Ma, which is common in Karakoram basement, indicating heavy sediment flux from these ranges to that drainage. This implies a strong control on erosion by topographic steepness and precipitation mediated through glaciation. Our zircon data confirm earlier studies that indicated that the Taklimakan sand is derived from both the Kunlun and Pamir Mountains. AFT ages are younger in the Hotan River than in the Kashgar River, which drains the Pamir, and in both are younger than in the Transhimalaya {{and parts of the}} western edge of the Tibetan Plateau. Exhumation is estimated at 1000 m/m. y in the North Kunlun and 500 m/m. y. in the eastern Pamir, which have been exhuming more slowly than the western ranges in the recent past. Holocene aggradation terracing was dated using quartz optically stimulated luminescence methods and is mostly associated with times of fluctuating climate after 4 ka, with phases of valley filling dated at 2. 6, 1. 4, and 0. 4 ka. The heights and volumes of the terraces show that sediment storage in the mountains is not a significant buffer to sediment transport, in contrast to the more monsoonal Indus system directly to the south. South of the Mazatag Ridge a significant <b>eolian</b> <b>deposit</b> accumulated 500 yr ago, but this has been deflated in more recent times. Comparison of the modern river data with those previously measured from Cenozoic foreland sedimentary rocks shows that no sediment similar to that of the modern Yarkand River is seen in the geologic record, which is inferred to be younger than 11 Ma, and probably much less. Uplift of the North Kunlun had started by ca. 17 Ma, somewhat after that of the Pamir and Songpan Garze of northwestern Tibet, dated to before 24 Ma. Sediment from the Kunlun reached the foreland basin between 14 and 11 Ma. North Kunlun exhumation accelerated before 3. 7 Ma, likely linked to faster rock uplift...|$|E

However, while these deposits are widespread along Pleistocene and Holocene low-latitude coasts, older analogs are either extremely rare, or misinterpreted as subaqueous in origin. Medium- to large-scale crossbedded arenaceous limestones of the Pennsylvanian Callville Limestone of southern Nevada, and the correlative Manakacha and Wescogame Formations (Supai Group) and the Permian Pakoon Limestone of western Grand Canyon, although considered marine by earlier workers, contain several diagnostic structures indicative of an eolian origin. They are composed chiefly of thin, inverse-graded laminae produced by the migration and climb of wind ripples. Many are bimodal with the coarse mode never exceeding two millimeters. Sets of cross-strata commonly have irregular upper surfaces produced by differential wind erosion of damp or lightly cemented laminae. Southward-dipping cross-strata in these rocks are the earliest record of a paleowind system that persisted in this region well into Jurassic time. ^ Marine beds that are cyclically interbedded with the <b>eolian</b> <b>deposits</b> did not undergo early lithification.

During low-stands, most quartz-rich beach facies were removed by deflation; that material too coarse to be wind-transported accumulated as laterally-persistent gravel lags.

The profiles were sampled for routine analyses, iron forms, heavy minerals, major and trace elements, and pollen, spores and non-pollen palynomorphs. Undisturbed samples were taken for micromorphological and SEM analyses. Nine soil horizons were sampled for OSL dating. <b>Eolian</b> <b>deposits</b> were dominant or abundant in the first layers of P 1, P 2 and P 3.

Chemical and heavy mineral analyses indicated different possible sources, including bare slopes, alluvial fans and wide channels, coming from the nearby streams that drain the Middle Tuscany ridge and the Mounts of Chianti; marginal contribution of volcanic ashes was only found in P 1. The research demonstrated that wind soil erosion accompanied water erosion and colluvial deposition during the middle Holocene in the Elsa River basin. Pollen spectra, in particular, indicated that soil degradation occurred in an environment showing signs of incipient desertification, resulting from an increase of aridity in a land already strongly influenced by humans.

Dunes are mainly NWSE trending transverse dunes with slip faces in the NE indicating an unimodal wind blown direction from the SW, moving on a smooth paleorelief. Fifty-three manual boreholes drilled in the eolian sands show the subsurface structure of the system with sands (dunes and dry interdunes) and paleosoils (wet interdunes).

Dune movement took place in relation to arid events; meanwhile, {{the development of the}} dune-wetlands system was linked to wet climatic events. Along the wet climates a raised table water existed, which favored the growing of vegetation and the ralentization or stopping of dunes.

Las morfolog&# 237;as de dunas corresponden principalmente a dunas transversas de orientaci&# 243;n principal NW-SE con caras de avalancha al NE por lo que el movimiento de las dunas fue hacia el NE remontando un suave paleorrelieve desarrollado sobre materiales pre-Holocenos. En las proximidades de Cantalejo se han realizado 53 peque&# 241;os sondeos, que han permitido caracterizar la evoluci&# 243;n del sistema. Se pueden reconocer cuatro niveles de paleosuelos, de los cuales tres han sido datados mediante C 14 en: nivel a, 10. 200 a&# 241;os BP; nivel b, 6. 120 a&# 241;os BP; nivel c, 2. 210 - 1. 490 a&# 241;os BP y el cuarto nivel (nivel d) est&# 225; a&# 250;n en formaci&# 243;n.

40|$|AbstractThe {{state of}} Wyoming, {{in the northwestern}} United States, {{produces}} 40 % of the nation’s coal, most of which is transported out of the state. The remainder is used at power plants within Wyoming to generate approximately 7 % of U. S. electricity. Carbon capture and storage from these power stations could significantly reduce U. S. carbon emissions. Wyoming statutes and rules proposed by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality regarding subsurface carbon storage require that CO 2 injection must not affect established or potential drinking water aquifers, oil and gas fields, or other mineral estates. Wyoming has several potential large-scale geologic carbon storage reservoirs that meet these criteria, {{in the form of}} saline aquifers in regional basins and uplifts. The Wyoming Carbon Underground Storage Project has recently been funded by the U. S. Department of Energy and the state of Wyoming to 1) assess the CO 2 storage potential of two possible locations in southwestern Wyoming: The Moxa Arch and the Rock Springs Uplift, 2) develop a system for displaced fluid management, 3) plan monitoring and verification activities, and 4) design infrastructure in preparation for geologic carbon sequestration. The Wyoming Carbon Underground Storage Project represents collaboration between the University of Wyoming, the Wyoming State Geologic Survey, ExxonMobil Corporation, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Baker Hughes Incorporated. The authors are involved primarily in the geologic stratigraphic and structural characterization of the Moxa Arch and Rock Springs Uplift. The Moxa Arch is an anticline that trends from the Uinta Mountains, 200  km north-northwest to the eastern front of the Wyoming fold-and-thrust belt. Potential storage reservoirs on this large geologic structure include the Jurassic Nugget Sandstone, the Mississippian Madison Limestone, and the Ordovician Bighorn Dolomite. The Nugget Sandstone is a heterogeneous and anisotropic <b>eolian</b> <b>deposit</b> that has been extensively exploited for oil and gas at certain locations on the Moxa Arch, which complicates its usage as a repository for carbon dioxide. The Madison Limestone is a proven storage reservoir; ExxonMobil has been injecting CO 2 (up to 25 MMCFD) and H 2 S (up to 65 MMCFD) into the Madison Limestone on the Moxa Arch for seven years at the Shute Creek Gas Plant. The Bighorn Dolomite is stratigraphically complex with large variations in porosity and permeability due to primary burrowing and repeated dolomitization and dedolomitization. Depending on location on the anticline, the Nugget Sandstone lies 3 to 6. 5  km below the surface (- 1 to - 4. 5  km subsea), and the Bighorn Dolomite and Madison Limestone range from 4. 5 to 8  km below the surface (- 2. 5 to - 6  km subsea). The Moxa Arch is structurally uncomplicated; it is a basement-involved anticline formed by a west-vergent Late Cretaceous-age thrust fault, with gently-dipping limbs (0 to 5  degrees). Leakage risk is extremely low because impermeable evaporite (anhydrite) intervals overly the potential reservoirs, and preliminary interpretation of seismic data reveal that few faults exist other than the main thrust. The Naughton Power Plant, a 707  MW coal-fired power station emitting up to 6  Mt of CO 2 per year, lies 30  km west of the crest of the anticline. The Rock Springs Uplift, 100  km east of the Moxa Arch, extends 80  km north from the Wyoming-Utah border. The target storage reservoirs are the Pennsylvanian Weber Sandstone (correlative to the Tensleep Sandstone) and the Mississippian Madison Limestone. The Weber Sandstone exhibits wide variations in reservoir properties (porosity and permeability) due to dune/interdune/intradune facies changes, and appears to have experienced local secondary diagenesis that further reduced porosity. The Madison Limestone is expected to have similar reservoir properties to its lithologic correlative on the Moxa Arch. The Weber Sandstone and Madison Limestone range in depth from 2 to 6  km below the surface (0. 3 to - 4. 5  km subsea), depending on location on the anticline. The Rock Springs Uplift offers challenges for structural analysis. Like the Moxa Arch, the Uplift was formed by a Late Cretaceous-age west-vergent basement-involved reverse fault, but the limbs of the fold are at steeper dips (approximately 15  degrees on the west limb, shallower on the east limb), and these limbs are cut at depth by additional reverse faults. In a hydrocarbon field on the southeastern flank of the uplift {{there is a possibility that}} condensate is migrating from the Weber Sandstone along one of these reverse faults, suggesting that the trap is breached. In addition, a series of east-west trending normal faults cut Cretaceous shales at the surface, possibly with throws that exceed the thickness of the uppermost regional seal. It is necessary to determine if these east-west faults also compromise the Triassic units that could provide a seal above the Weber Sandstone. The Jim Bridger Power Plant (coal-fired) is located on the east flank of the Rock Springs Uplift; it has 2200  MW capacity and emits up to 18  Mt of CO 2 per year. Future U. S. energy demands will draw heavily on Wyoming’s coal-fired power plants, and the state is taking steps to sequester the produced carbon. Wyoming hosts several large geologic traps that if properly risked and evaluated have promise as long-term, stable repositories for anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Based upon our preliminary assessment of the multiple clastic and carbonate receiving formations in the Moxa Arch and Rock Springs Uplift, and the experience of successful injection at ExxonMobil’s Shute Creek Gas Plant, these geologic structures in southwestern Wyoming are among the most promising large CO 2 geologic storage sites in the United States...|$|E

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of {{rare earth elements}} (REEs) and other 28 trace elements were determined in seven grain-size fractions from four loess samples collected from the Tibetan Plateau, the Sichuan Basin and the Chinese Loess Plateau. The results indicate that {{concentrations of}} REEs, except for heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), are almost grain-size independent. However, REEs show clear fractionation with grain size. Middle rare earth element (MREE) depletion increases with decreasing grain size, whereas HREE enrichment increases with decreasing grain size. Excluding REEs and Y, {{most of the other}} trace element concentrations tend to increase with decreasing grain sizes. The trace element geochemistry indicates that the potential sources of <b>eolian</b> <b>deposits</b> from the Sichuan Basin, the Chinese Loess Plateau and the Tibetan Plateau differ from one another. This comparative study confirmed that the eolian materials from the Asian continent are the source of the terrigenous component of the central North Pacific sediments, and the loess from the Chinese Loess Plateau could represent the average composition of eolian dust from the Asian continent. In contrast, the <b>eolian</b> <b>deposits</b> in the Sichuan Basin and in the Tibetan Plateau are mainly of local origin, with short-distance eolian transport. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.
