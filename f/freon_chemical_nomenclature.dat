Prague: Charles University, Faculty of Science, 2016 The bachelor thesis {{is focused on}} the topic of <b>chemical</b> <b>nomenclature</b> for secondary and high school. In the theoretical part, there is an explanation of <b>chemical</b> <b>nomenclature</b> and the norms for this topic in Framework Educational Programme and School Educational Programme. In this part, there is also a comparison of three selected School Educational Programmes. The practical part is focused on mapping educational {{materials in}} the topic of <b>chemical</b> <b>nomenclature</b> using online survey and evaluation of textbooks using the literature search and in advance established criteria. The last part contains the own educational materials for fixing knowledge in the theme...|$|R

40|$|At the National Library of Medicine (NLM), {{a variety}} of {{biomedical}} vocabularies are found in data pertinent to its mission. In addition to standard medical terminology, there are specialized vocabularies including that of <b>chemical</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> Normal language tools including the lexically based ones used by the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to manipulate and normalize text do not work well on <b>chemical</b> <b>nomenclature.</b> In order to improve NLM's capabilities in chemical text processing, two approaches {{to the problem of}} recognizing <b>chemical</b> <b>nomenclature</b> were explored. The first approach was a lexical one and consisted of analyzing text for the presence of a fixed set of chemical segments. The approach was extended with general chemical patterns and also with terms from NLM's indexing vocabulary, MeSH, and the NLM SPECIALIST lexicon. The second approach applied Bayesian classification to n-grams of text via two different methods. The single lexical method and two statistical methods were tested against data from the 1999 UMLS Metathesaurus. One of the statistical methods had an overall classification accuracy of 97 %...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Current {{approaches}} using Artificial Intelligence techniques {{applied to}} chemistry use representations inherited from existing tools. These tools describe chemical compounds {{with a set}} of structure-activity relationship (SAR) descriptors because they were developed mainly for the task of drug design. We propose an ontology based on the <b>chemical</b> <b>nomenclature</b> as a way to capture the concepts commonly used by chemists in describing molecular structure of the compounds. In this paper we formally specify the concepts and relationships of the <b>chemical</b> <b>nomenclature</b> in a comprehensive ontology using a form of relational representation called feature terms. We also provide several examples of describing chemical compounds using this ontology and compare our proposal with other SAR based approaches. ...|$|R
