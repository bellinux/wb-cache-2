The primary purpose of this technical brief is to emphasize {{that there are two}} distinct, albeit related, representations for moment vectors using the <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> These distinct representations are illuminated by exploring connections between the Euler and dual Euler bases, the "nonorthogonal projections" presented in a recent paper by Desroches et al. (2010, "Expression of Joint Moment in the Joint Coordinate System," ASME J. Biomech. Eng., 132 (11), p. 11450) and seminal works by Grood and Suntay (Grood and Suntay, 1983, "A <b>Joint</b> <b>Coordinate</b> <b>System</b> for the Clinical Description of Three-Dimensional Motions: Application to the Knee," ASME J.

40|$|Three {{different}} methods for describing three dimensional joint angles {{are commonly used}} in biomechanics. The <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> and Cardan/Euler angles are conceptually quite different but are known to represent the same underlying mathematics. More recently the globographic method has been suggested as an alternative and this has proved particularly attractive for the shoulder joint. All three methods can be implemented {{in a number of}} ways leading to a choice of angle definitions. Very recently Rab has demonstrated that the globographic method is equivalent to one implementation of the <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> This paper presents a rigorous analysis of the three {{different methods}} and proves their mathematical equivalence. The well known sequence dependence of Cardan/Euler is presented as equivalent to configuration dependence of the <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> and orientation dependence of globographic angles. The precise definition of different angle sets can be easily visualised using the globographic method using analogues of longitude, latitude and surface bearings with which most users will already be familiar. The method implicitly requires one axis of the moving segment to be identified as its principal axis and this can be extremely useful in helping define the most appropriate angle set to describe the orientation of any particular joint. Using this technique different angle sets are considered to be most appropriate for different joints and examples of this for the hip, knee, ankle, pelvis and axial skeleton are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Background: Inverse dynamic {{methods have}} been widely used to {{estimate}} joint loads during manual wheelchair propulsion. However, the interpretation of 3 D net joint moments and powers is not always straightforward. It has been suggested to use <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> (expression of <b>joint</b> moment on anatomical axes) and the 3 D angle between joint moment and angular velocity vectors (propulsion, resistance or stabilization joint configuration) for a better understanding of joint dynamics. Methods: Nine spinal cord injured subjects equipped with reflective markers propelled in a wheelchair with an instrumented wheel. Inverse dynamic results were interpreted using <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems,</b> 3 D <b>joint</b> power and the 3 D angle between the joint moment and joint angular velocity vectors at the three upper limb joints. The 3 D angle was used to determine if the joints were predominantly driven (angle close to 0 or 180 degrees) or stabilized (angle close to 90). Findings: The wrist and elbow joints are mainly in a stabilization configuration (angle close to 90) with a combination of extension and ulnar deviation moments and an adduction moment respectively. The shoulder is in a propulsion configuration, but close to stabilization (angle hardly below 60) with a combination of flexion and internal rotation moments. Interpretation: Stabilization configuration at the joints could partly explain the low mechanical efficiency of manual wheelchair propulsion and could give insight about injury risk at the wrist, elbow and shoulder joints...|$|R

Some studies highlighted how crucial is the role of a correct identification of the skeletal landmarks (SL) for a proper interpretation of joint kinematics. In fact, SLs are required for defining the <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> (JCS) used to describe the joint kinematics and therefore, in order to guarantee reproducible JCSs, reliable SL identifications are essential. However, while the Movement Analysis Community made a remarkable effort in standardizing both segment <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> and JCS definitions, little effort has been produced {{in order to reduce the}} effects of incorrect SL identification. Fully standardized procedures for joint kinematics estimation would allow to build and to make fruitful use of reliable databases...|$|R
40|$|Robot Calibration {{is a term}} {{applied to}} the {{procedures}} used in determining actual values that describe the geometric dimensions and mechanical characteristics of a robot or multibody structure. A robot calibration system must consist of appropriate robot modeling techniques, accurate measurement equipment, and reliable model parameter determination methods. For practical improvement of a robot’s absolute accuracy, error compensation methods are required that use calibration results. Important to robot calibration methods is an accurate kinematic model that has identifiable parameters. This parameterized kinematic model must be complete, continuous and minimal. This work concerns {{to the implementation of}} techniques to optimize kinematic models for robot calibration through numerical optimization of the mathematical model. The optimized model is then used to compensate the model errors in an off-line programming system, enhancing significantly the robot kinematic model accuracy. The optimized model can be constructed in an easy and straight operation, through automatic assignment of <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> and geometric parameter to the robot links.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Three-dimensional data is {{required}} to have advanced knowledge of foot and ankle kinematics and morphology. However, studies {{have been difficult to}} compare {{due to a lack of}} a common <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, we present a means to define a coordinate frame in the foot and ankle and its clinical application. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out ten CT scans in anatomically normal feet and segmented them in a general purpose segmentation program for grey value images. 3 D binary formatted stereolithography files were then create and imported to a shape analysis program for biomechanics which was used to define a coordinate frame and carry out morphological analysis of the forefoot. RESULTS: The coordinate frame had axes standard deviations of 2. 36 which are comparable to axes variability of other <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems.</b> We showed a strong correlation between the lengths of the metatarsals within and between the columns of the foot and also among the lesser metatarsal lengths.

40|$|Subject-specific {{musculoskeletal}} modelling {{is especially}} {{useful in the}} study of juvenile and pathological subjects. However, such methodologies typically require a human operator to identify key landmarks from medical imaging data and are thus affected by unavoidable variability in the parameters defined and subsequent model predictions. The aim {{of this study was to}} thus quantify the inter- and intra-operator repeatability of a subject-specific modelling methodology developed for the analysis of subjects with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Three operators each created subject-specific musculoskeletal foot and ankle models via palpation of bony landmarks, adjustment of geometrical muscle points and definition of <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems.</b> These models were then fused to a generic Arnold lower limb model for each of three modelled patients. The repeatability of each modelling operation was found to be comparable to those previously reported for the modelling of healthy, adult subjects.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of four different anatomic joint models on the detection of changes in lower-limb joint moments due to knee osteoarthritis. Moments during gait were calculated for 44 subjects with moderate osteoarthritis and 44 asymptomatic subjects, then expressed using four joint models: <b>Joint</b> <b>Coordinate</b> <b>System,</b> Plane of Progression, Distal, and Proximal.

40|$|Robot {{workspace}} is the set {{of positions}} a robot can reach. Workspace {{is one of the}} most useful measures for the evaluation of a robot. Workspace is usually defined as the reachable space of the end-effector in Cartesian coordinate system. However, it can be defined in <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> in terms of joint motions. In this paper, workspace of the end-effector is called task workspace, and workspace of the joint motions is called joint workspace. Joint workspace of a parallel kinematic machine (PKM) is focused, and a tripod machine tool with three degrees of freedom (DOF) is taken as an example. To study the joint workspace of this tripod machine tool, the forward kinematic model is established, and an interpolating approach is proposed to solve this model. The forward kinematic model is used to determine the joint workspace, which occupies a portion of the domain of joint motions. The following contributions have been made in this paper include: (i) a new concept so-called joint workspace has been proposed for design optimization and control of a PKM; (ii) an approach is developed to determine joint workspace based on the structural constraints of a PKM; (iii) it is observed that the trajectory planning in the <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> is not reliable without taking into considerations of cavities or holes in the joint workspace...|$|E

As a result, shoulder pain and associated upper limb dysfunctions frequently arise after stroke. This review aimed to provide a systematic overview of available literature on scapular function, i. e. scapular three-dimensional (3 D) kinematics and muscle activity during elevation, in healthy persons, persons with primary shoulder disorders and post-stroke patients. 3 D scapular kinematics have been widely reported in healthy persons and persons with primary shoulder disorders, whereby a general pattern of upward rotation and posterior tilt during elevation has been agreed upon. Results on scapular internal/external rotation are inconsistent. In a post-stroke population, 3 D scapular kinematics are less frequently reported. Scapular muscle activity has thus far been studied to very limited extend and firm conclusions could not be drawn. Although 3 D scapular kinematics and muscle activity registrations are being increasingly used, some general methodological aspects should be considered. While the International Society of Biomechanics already proposed recommendations on the definition of upper limb <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> and rotation sequences, proper result comparison necessitates further guidelines on other methodological aspects, i. e. data collection, processing, analyzing, and reporting. status: publishe...|$|R

As FAI arises with end range of motion activities, measurement errors related to skin movement might be higher than anticipated when using previously reported methods for kinematic evaluation of the hip. We performed an in vitro validation and reliability study of a noninvasive method to define pelvic and femur positions in end range of motion activities of the hip using an electromagnetic tracking device. Motion data, collected from sensors attached to the bone and skin of 11 cadaver hips, were simultaneously obtained and compared in a global reference frame.

Angular RMS differences between the bony and skin sensors in the hip <b>joint</b> local <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> ranged at end range of motion and dependent on the motion under investigation from 1. 91 to 5. 81 A degrees.

40|$|AbstractThe International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) has {{recommended}} a standardization {{of the definition}} of the <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> (JCS) and use of a sequential rotation to describe human shoulder joint rotation. Markers attached {{to the surface of the}} body may move during the process of motion data capture, resulting in an offset from their initial location.

In this research study, we presented a simple marker offset model to quantify the shoulder joint errors for both static poses and dynamic activities. Specific conditions of different offsets and elbow flexion angles were studied. Results showed that the errors should not be neglected when the shoulder elevation angle was near - 90 ° and 90 °, or elbow flexion was very small.

The experimental results showed that the workspace of 7 degrees of freedom redundant space manipulator, which was designed in this paper, changed smoothly.

40|$|Background. To {{describe}} 3 D {{shoulder joint}} movements, the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) recommends using segment <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> (SCSs) on the humerus, scapula and thorax, and <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> (JCSs) on the shoulder. However, {{one of the}} remaining problems is how to define the zero angles when the arm is in an initial reference position. The aim {{of this paper is}} to compare various methods of determining the JCSs of the shoulder that make it possible to define the zero angles of the arm in the resting position. Methods. Able-bodied subjects performed elevation movements in the scapular plane, specifically neutral, internal and external rotations of the humerus. The initial humerus position (at the beginning of the arm movement) and range of motion were analysed for the purpose of clinical interpretation of arm attitude and movement. The following four different JCSs were explored: (1) the standard JCS, defined as recommended by the ISB, (2) a first aligned JCS, where the humerus SCS is initially aligned with the scapula SCS, (3) a second aligned JCS, where the opposite operation is performed and 4) a third aligned JCS, where both the humerus and the scapular SCS are initially aligned with the thorax SCS.

The {{purpose of}} the present work was to assess the {{validity}} of a six-degrees-of-freedom gait analysis model based on the ISB recommendation on definitions of <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> (ISB 6 DOF) through a quantitative comparison with the Helen Hays model (HH) and repeatability assessment. Methods. Four healthy subjects were analysed with both marker sets: an HH marker set and four marker clusters in ISB 6 DOF. A navigated pointer was used to indicate the anatomical landmark position in the cluster reference system according to the ISB recommendation. Three gait cycles were selected from the data collected simultaneously for the two marker sets. Results. Two protocols showed good intertrial repeatability, which apart from pelvic rotation did not exceed 2 °. The greatest differences between protocols were observed in the transverse plane as well as for knee angles. Knee internal/external rotation revealed the lowest subject-to-subject and interprotocol repeatability and inconsistent patterns for both protocols. Knee range of movement in transverse plane was overestimated for the HH set (the mean is 34 °), which could indicate the cross-talk effect. Conclusions. The ISB 6 DOF anatomically based protocol enabled full 3 D kinematic description of joints according to the current standard with clinically acceptable intertrial repeatability and minimal equipment requirements...|$|R

Inherent problems include adequate marker placement, skin movement artifacts or marker occlusion in certain body orientations. In outdoor settings the use of markers may be limited. A possible alternative are marker-less image-based motion tracking systems. The authors have proposed free-form surface patches to estimate segment orientations (1) as well as global and local morphing techniques (2). Further features include an advanced image segmentation method, dynamic occlusion handling and the inclusion of kinematic chains of higher complexity.

Intracortical bone pins with reflective marker triads were inserted under stan-dard local anaesthesia into the calcaneus and the tibia of five healthy male subjects. The three-dimensional rota-tions were determined using a <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> approach. Movement coupling was observed in all test subjects and occurred in phases with considerable indi-vidual differences. Between the shoe and the calcaneus coupling increased after midstance which suggested that the test shoes provided more coupling for inversion than for eversion. Movement coupling between calcaneus and tibia was higher in the first phase (from heel strike to mid-stance) compared with the second phase (from mid-stance to take-Off). This finding is in contrast to previous in-vitro studies but may be explained by the higher verti-cal loads of the present in-vivo study. Thus, movement coupling measured at the bone level changed throughout the stance phase of running and was found to be far more complex than a simple mitered joint or universal joint model...|$|E

40|$|Investigation {{of joint}} {{kinematics}} {{contributes to a}} better understanding of musculoskeletal condition pathologies. However, the most commonly used optoelectronic motion analysis systems cannot determine the movements of underlying bone landmarks with high accuracy because of soft tissue artifact. We are developing a computer-aided tracking and motion analysis with ultrasound (CAT and MAUS) system to track the underlying bone anatomy in a 3 D global coordinate frame for describing joint kinematics. To quantify the rotation and translation of joints, registration is an essential component in our computer-aided tracking pipeline. In this paper, we consider a globally optimal Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm to quantify joint kinematics. We use a global branch-and-bound (BnB) scheme to speed up the search in the entire 3 D motion space. A globally optimal result is guaranteed by iterating the BnB scheme and ICP registration. We collected phantom data for validation and in-vivo data from ten healthy volunteers. The globally optimal ICP registration results have been compared to the results from traditional ICP registration. The overall average rotation angle error is less than 1 °. The registration result is then converted into local <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> defined by the International Society of Biomechanics for joint kinematics description.

40|$|This review {{provides}} an overview of results found in literature on objective measurements of upper limb movements in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP). Seventeen articles were selected following a systematic search. Analysed tasks varied from simple reaching and gross motor functions to complex, fine motor tasks. Spatiotemporal characteristics have been extensively studied and longer movement durations, slower movement speed and reduced trajectory straightness at the affected upper limb, compared to the non-affected side or healthy children, were most frequently reported. Joint kinematics has been far less studied. The limited data confirm the clinical impression of children with HCP using less elbow extension and supination to reach for an object, which is compensated by increased trunk flexion. Increased trunk involvement was also reported during gross motor functions. Although three-dimensional (3 D) movement analysis seems promising to provide additional insights in the pathological upper limb movements observed in HCP, future standardisation of the entire protocol is crucial. No consensus exists on the procedures for data collection, processing, analysing and reporting of results, or what upper limb tasks should be assessed. The International Society of Biomechanics recently proposed recommendations on the definition of upper limb <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> and rotation sequences. These guidelines were not yet applied in these studies. Although the diverse methodological approaches used in the studies complicate the comparison of published results, some general conclusions could be drawn. A further standardisation of the protocol for 3 D upper limb movement analysis will provide the foundation for comparable and repeatable results and eventually facilitate the selection and planning of treatment interventions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective Biomechanical {{effects of}} {{laterally}} wedged insoles are assessed by {{reduction in the}} knee adduction moment. However, the degree of reduction may {{vary depending on the}} reference frame with which it is calculated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to clarify the effect of refer-ence frame on the reduction in the knee adduction moment by laterally wedged insoles. Methods Twenty-nine healthy participants performed gait trials with a laterally wedged insole and with a flat insole as a control. The knee adduction moment, including the first and second peaks and the angular impulse, were calculated using four different reference frames: the femoral frame, tibial frame, laboratory frame and the <b>Joint</b> <b>Coordinate</b> <b>System.</b> Results There were significant effects of reference frame on the knee adduction moment first and second peaks (P < 0. 001 for both variables), while the effect was not significant for the angular impulse (P = 0. 84). No significant interaction between the gait condition and refer-ence frame was found in either of the knee adduction moment variables (P = 0. 99 for all var-iables), indicating that the effects of laterally wedged insole on the knee adduction moments were similar across the four reference frames. On the other hand, the average percen...|$|E

It was published as an Open Access article by Elsevier in Procedia Engineering and it is distributed {{under the terms of}} the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial-No-Derivative 4. 0 Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4. 0). The International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) has recommended a standardization of the definition of the <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> (JCS) and use of a sequential rotation to describe human shoulder joint rotation. Markers attached to the surface of the body may move during the process of motion data capture, resulting in an offset from their initial location. This leads to a change of the JCS and therefore affects the calculated shoulder joint angles. In this research study, we presented a simple marker offset model to quantify the shoulder joint errors for both static poses and dynamic activities. Specific conditions of different offsets and elbow flexion angles were studied. Results showed that the errors should not be neglected when the shoulder elevation angle was near - 90 ° and 90 °, or elbow flexion was very small. Attention should be paid to these errors for such activities especially walking and throwing...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{study was to examine the}} effect of {{different}} reference frames on lower limb joint moments during gait with a view to identifying a recommended convention for clinical purposes. Data were collected from 10 subjects (nine able-bodied adults and one child with diplegic cerebral palsy) whilst walking at a self-selected speed. Calculations utilised a three-dimensional inverse dynamics model. For each joint, moments were expressed in four different reference frames. Three of the frames were orthogonal: laboratory frame; anatomical frame of proximal segment; anatomical frame of distal segment. The fourth reference frame was a non-orthogonal <b>joint</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> (JCS). Significant differences in the joint moment profiles during gait were found with alternative references frames. This was apparent primarily for the transverse plane joint moments for able-bodied adult gait. For the pathological gait pattern presented, there were also marked differences in the frontal plane joint moments and more subtle ones in the sagittal plane. Whilst it is recognised that all possible reference frames for the expression of the net moment vector are mathematically valid, a decision needs to be made as to which one is more clinically useful. It is proposed that the non-orthogonal JCS is most logical on the basis of what, biomechanically, the joint moment actually represents...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative, as well {{objective}} human {{motion analysis}} has {{a prominent role}} in many research fields of biomechanics, such as for gait analysis purposes. Focusing on joints kinematics, several aspects like the kind of movement, the measurements, the post-processing techniques and the adopted human multi body model within the joints approximation have {{to be taken into account}} to ensure a consistency of outcomes both in terms of reliability and repeatability. In particular, both kinematic and dynamic calculations require an accurate method of joints parameters estimation, like centers and axes of rotation, resulting in a different definition of <b>joints</b> <b>coordinates</b> <b>systems</b> and of motion patterns computation, as a consequence. Predictive and functional methods can be used to estimate joints parameters. Considering some drawbacks like the restrictive protocol for markers positioning on precise anatomical landmarks and the following lack of accuracy, which are typical of the former approach, the aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a functional method to simultaneously estimate lower limbs joints parameters during walking. Markers-based stereo photogrammetric motion capture sessions are performed in order to acquire data to be used as input of a functional algorithm. A validation of this latter is provided with a subject-specific multi body model, implemented in OpenSim, properly scaled by means of the estimated joint centers. Moreover, gait kinematics curves are computed by solving an inverse kinematics problem exploiting a global optimization method. A final comparison with the gold standard technique is provided in terms of root mean squared errors and cross-correlation coefficients to evaluate the outcomes consistency for the presented pilot stud...|$|R
40|$|Normal {{and almost}} normal {{surfaces}} are essential tools for algorithmic 3 -manifold topology, {{but to use}} them requires exponentially slow enumeration algorithms in a high-dimensional vector space. The quadrilateral coordinates of Tollefson alleviate this problem considerably for normal surfaces by reducing the dimension of this vector space from 7 n to 3 n (where n is {{the complexity of the}} underlying triangulation). Here we develop an analogous theory for octagonal almost normal surfaces, using quadrilateral and octagon coordinates to reduce this dimension from 10 n to 6 n. As an application, we show that quadrilateral-octagon coordinates can be used exclusively in the streamlined 3 -sphere recognition algorithm of Jaco, Rubinstein, and Thompson, reducing experimental running times by factors of thousands. We also introduce <b>joint</b> <b>coordinates,</b> a <b>system</b> with only 3 n dimensions for octagonal almost normal surfaces that has appealing geometric properties...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{topology}} description and modeling method for reconfigurable modular serial robots. Based on the module division, one kind of 4 times n topology characteristic matrix is established to describe robots configuration. A modeling method for kinematic analysis {{on the basis of}} <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems</b> of modules is put forward. Since the joint modules have several interfaces, many configurations can be constructed. The topology characteristic matrix contains such information as the type of module, the orientation relationship of the joint modules axes, the form and connection of interfaces and the type of link. From the topology characteristic matrix, we can get the connection form and relationship between each module in the robot. A set of rule for describing a <b>joint</b> module-based <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> and transform relationship between the adjacent modules are offered and a kinematics model of the modular serial robot is derived. Hence, the modularization and reconfiguration of analysis software can be implemented. The example analyses show that the topology description and modeling method is correct and valid.
