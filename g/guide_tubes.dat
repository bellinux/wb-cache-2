50|$|In EGW, {{the heat}} of the welding arc causes the {{electrode}} and workpieces to melt and flow into the cavity between the parts being welded. This molten metal solidifies from the bottom up, joining the parts being welded together.

40|$|Abstract. The steam {{generators}} at Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) nuclear power {{stations in the}} UK are potentially life-limiting components. Enhancing the capability to monitor the {{steam generators}} {{has been identified as}} having the potential to provide key evidence in justifying the extension of the generating lifetime of the stations. It has been proposed to install new temperature measuring instrumentation to monitor reactor gas temperature and to provide additional data regarding steam generator operating conditions. The modification will be to introduce thermocouples to the bore of an intact steam generator tube to facilitate temperature measurement at or near to the locations of interest. The modified steam generator tube will be sealed at the feed header upstand. Between the upper surface of the superheater header tubeplate and the wall of the superheater header, the thermocouple bundle and sheath will be contained within a rigid stainless steel <b>guide</b> <b>tube.</b> The <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> will be attached at both ends by welds, each forming a pressure boundary. At the tubeplate a weld will separate the bore of the sealed <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> from the steam space within the superheater header; a weld between the <b>guide</b> <b>tube</b> and the superheater header will separate the steam space within the superheater header from atmosphere outside the header. In order to obtain a better design, three 3 -dimentional finite element models have been created using ABAQUS.

40|$|Ultracold neutron {{transmission}} through <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> {{has been}} investigated. Different polishing processes for straight, circular <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> are tested. A new {{effective way to}} enhance the transmission of the ultracold neutrons through guides is demonstrated. This method involves internally coating stainless steel <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> with deuterated polystyrene using a spinning method, or with Fomblin oil. Results show that the UCN transmission in one metre is increased from about 37 % for the honed only <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> to about 84 % and 88 % when coated internally with deuterated polystyrene or with Fomblin oil respectively. The enhancement in the guide tube surface quality due to the electropolishing process resulted in increasing the UCN transmission rate for the honed tube from 37 % to about 81 %. So coating a honed only tube with deuterated polystyrene or with Fomblin oil gave better transmission rates than electropolishing the tube and not coating it. The transmission measurements are for neutrons with an average axial velocity of about 9. 2 m s"-" 1. This thesis also contains {{a description of a}} new ultracold neutron detector, designed by others, with some work done here to assess its performance. Although the natural boron film used in the detector is supposed to have Fermi potential of about 1. 92 x 10 "-" 7 eV, it has been found to have either a near zero Fermi potential or a tunneling effect for the low energy ultracold neutrons, the same effect observed, by others, in LiF and " 1 " 0 BN and in lithium glass.

40|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) leads to axonal damage and limits {{the ability of}} the brain to {{communicate}} {{with the rest of the}} body. Several bioengineered approaches have been developed for the recovery of SCI. Among these techniques, degradable guidance tubes have shown promising results. However, design of nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> requires several design considerations and has been a significant challenge. To assess the efficacy of a prototypical implanted nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes,</b> it is essential to perform continuous monitoring. In this respect, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most reliable imaging techniques as it offers the ability to achieve extraordinary high temporal and spatial resolution in addition to its non-invasive features. In spite of the excellent image quality of non-enhanced MRI various types of contrast agents have been developed to further enhance the contrast and allow improved visualization. The MRI contrast agents principally work by shortening the T 1 or T 2 relaxation times of protons located nearby. The presented study was intended to evaluate the in vitro degradation of the nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> made of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). PLGA tubes incorporated with different concentrations of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) were scanned by MRI 3 T on weekly basis during the degradation period. Spin-echo (SE) sequence with various echo times (TEs) ranged from 13. 3 to 314. 4 msec was applied. T 2 mapping was computed using in-house algorithm developed in Matlab. Least square fit was used to find the slope of the decay curve by plotting log intensity on the y-axis and echo time on the x-axis. The average T 2 values were calculated. Mass loss and water uptake of the degrading tubes were also measured weekly. Moreover, the micro-structural changes of the tubes were investigated using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). The MRI results showed that the concentration of SPIO affects the signal intensity of the T 2 weighted images reducing the T 2 relaxation time value. Accordingly, a linear correlation between SPIO concentration and T 2 relaxation time was found. At the beginning of degradation, the SPIO nanoparticles were trapped within the polymeric network. Therefore, water penetration was the predominant factor affecting the T 2 relaxation times. At week 5, a significant mass loss was observed. From this stage onwards, the trapped SPIO were released from the polymeric network increasing T 2 relaxation time dramatically. According to SEM images, the size of the pores in PLGA <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> was increased with the degradation. Approaching the end of degradation, shrinkage of the tubes was observed and the degraded nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> were shown to be collapsed. Similar shape variation was observed in T 2 weighted MR images. In summary, this study provided an approach to non-invasive monitoring of degradation behavior of nerve <b>guide</b> <b>tubes</b> using contrast enhancement. The developed technique is of great importance since it opened an insight to non-invasive monitoring of tissue engineered scaffolds for in vivo studies...|$|E
