30|$|Intraplate {{seismicity}} {{occurs in}} the vicinity of stress concentrators within pre-existing zones of weakness, where the faults are intersecting. These stress concentrators are structures where plate tectonic stresses can cause a localized buildup of stresses and, ultimately, earthquakes. These include intersecting faults, buried plutons, and rift pillows. The study of intraplate seismicity is difficult because the occurrence of large earthquakes are rare, and the thickness of the seismogenic layer is narrow. Talwani and Rajendran (1991) pointed out that most intraplate earthquakes occur around the intersections of faults, and, <b>in</b> general, <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intersections themselves or very close to them. Data collected by the local-to-regional network monitoring of small-size earthquakes are vital for understanding intraplate seis-micity (Dunn and Chapman, 2006).|$|R

Design: This was a post hoc analysis of a previously conducted randomized clinical study. Methods: Fifty-nine eyes from 42 patients (17 males and 25 females, aged 72. 6 ± 8. 0 years) with verified or suspected dry eye at 4 weeks after cataract surgery were evaluated. The dry eye patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive DQS or AT for 4 weeks. Tear breakup time (BUT), corneal and conjunctival fluorescein staining scores, and HOAs were analyzed before and after instillation. HOAs were measured consecutively for 10 seconds with a wavefront analyzer. Average HOAs, HOA fluctuations (fluctuation index [FI]) and changes in HOAs (stability index [SI]) were compared within and between the two groups. Results: After 4 weeks of instillation, BUT significantly increased (P= 0. 001) compared with preinstillation values in the DQS group, but <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AT</b> group. This increase in BUT in the DQS group was significantly greater than in <b>the</b> <b>AT</b> group (P= 0. 014). Corneal and conjunctival fluorescein staining scores after instillation significantly improved compared with preinstillation values in the DQS group (P= 0. 018). In HOAs, the cornea aberration changed from an upward curve (a sawtooth pattern) to an almost constant value (a stable pattern) in the DQS group, but <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>AT</b> group. In FI and SI, there were no significant changes in either group; however, FI and SI were significantly lower in the DQS group than in <b>the</b> <b>AT</b> group (both, P= 0. 004). Conclusion: The dry eye patients after cataract surgery had a visual dysfunction in HOAs. DQS is effective to treat dry eye disease after cataract surgery with improvement of visual function.

50|$|Elevens is a {{solitaire}} {{card game}} using a standard 52-card deck. Cards {{are placed in}} a 3x3 grid, and pairs of cards which add up to eleven (5 and 6; 4 and 7; 3 and 8; 2 and 9; Ace and 10) are covered up;face cards (J, Q, K) may be eliminated {{in a set of}} three cards consisting of one Jack, one Queen and one King regardless of suit.If all cards are covered up the game is won; if there are no more pairs of cards that add up to eleven, and there do not exist a Jack, a Queen, and a King, the game is lost.An individual game of elevens is a game of pure chance, except for the small element of skill involved in spotting the pairs; the skill and strategic interest comes <b>in</b> <b>not</b> shuffling <b>the</b> cards <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of each game, but instead collecting them up in order.|$|R

We compare the spatial {{distribution}} and kinematics of the clump stars with predictions from an evolutionary N-body model of a bulge that grew from a disk via bar-related instabilities. The density distribution of the peanut-shaped model is depressed near its minor axis. This produces a bimodal distribution of stars {{along the line of}} sight through the bulge near its minor axis, very much as seen in our observations. The observed and modelled kinematics of the two groups of stars are also similar. We conclude that the split red clump of the bulge is probably a generic feature of boxy/peanut bulges that grew from disks, and that the disk from which the bulge grew had relatively few stars with [Fe/H] < - 0. 5 Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
