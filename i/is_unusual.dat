5|$|Peribsen's name <b>is</b> <b>unusual,</b> in that Set, not Horus, was {{his patron}} deity. This {{goes against the}} Egyptian {{tradition}} of a king choosing the falcon-shaped deity Horus as his royal patron.|$|E
5|$|The {{circle is}} located {{at the bottom of a}} narrow valley. Though this <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> for a {{monument}} of this type, the Dorset Rempstone stone circle was also erected within a valley.|$|E
5|$|The game is open stakes. This <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> {{in modern}} times and almost never allowed in casinos, but {{permissible}} in home games and was common for the time period of the film.|$|E
50|$|The friary <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> {{in having}} two cloisters.|$|R
50|$|Professions which <b>are</b> <b>unusual</b> (Piano Tuners) or {{high risk}} (Scaffolders).|$|R
50|$|The park {{had several}} {{features}} that <b>were</b> <b>unusual</b> among ballparks.|$|R
5|$|Architecturally, {{the castle}} <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> for this period. Its design appears {{somewhat}} backward, particularly {{in comparison to}} the nearby fortification of Harry's Walls, built {{at the same time as}} the castle, but which adopted a more contemporary design that employed bastions. Its closest equivalents are the blockhouses built by Henry VIII on the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Who <b>is</b> <b>unusual,</b> however, in {{that each}} of its 97 missing episodes survives in audio form, {{recorded}} off-air by fans at home. Most episodes are also represented by stills or short video clips. Furthermore, after careful restoration, all 1970s episodes exist in full colour, which {{is not always the}} case for other series.|$|E
5|$|Friday Night Lights <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> {{for using}} actual {{locations}} rather than stage sets and sound stage. These factors together with reliance on filming hundreds of locals as extras, gives the series an authentic feel and look.|$|E
50|$|Soil {{conditions}} <b>are</b> <b>unusual</b> (e.g. {{presence of}} carbonates, shallow gas).|$|R
50|$|Legal {{challenges}} to this right <b>are</b> <b>unusual,</b> {{and not always}} successful.|$|R
5000|$|The {{numerous}} partial exacerbations and remissions <b>are</b> <b>unusual</b> in Chagas disease; ...|$|R
5|$|G. minor <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> {{because it}} {{frequently}} is found with embryonic skeletons of the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have well-developed wings, which suggest {{they would be}} able to fly very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus had a {{flexible}} joint {{in the lower}} jaw that could slide {{back and forth to}} deliver a grasping bite. This cranial specialization <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating flesh, and the neck was slender and flexible.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, {{rainfall}} is {{the only}} effect that these cyclones have on California. Sometimes, the rainfall is severe enough to cause flooding and damage. For example, floods from Hurricane Kathleen devastated Ocotillo, California and killed several people. Precipitation other than rainfall <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> in tropical cyclones, because of their weak updrafts and lack of supercooled water.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Montpelier Lodge <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> {{in its use}} of red brickwork.|$|R
50|$|The Puzzles <b>are</b> <b>unusual</b> as {{some also}} depict the 2nd series figures.|$|R
5000|$|... (SAFE) The groomer {{could have}} been {{eliminated}} but there <b>were</b> <b>unusual</b> circumstances.|$|R
5|$|Irene–Olivia <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> {{in that it}} survived {{passage from}} the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean. Only nine other named storms {{are known to have}} done so. Irene was the first of three Atlantic-to-Pacific {{crossover}} tropical cyclones in the 1970s, all three of which took eastern Pacific names starting with the letter O.|$|E
5|$|Most World Tour stage {{races are}} won by strong climbers. The Eneco Tour <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> because the favourites for overall victory were {{classics}} riders—those who perform {{strongly in the}} Ardennes classics and the cobbled classics that feature {{in the early part}} of the cycling season.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} the Hydrophiinae are able to respire through {{the top of their}} skin. This <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> for reptiles, because their skin is thick and scaly, but {{experiments}} with the black-and-yellow sea snake, Pelamis platura (a pelagic species), have shown this species can satisfy about 25% of its oxygen requirements in this manner, which allows for prolonged dives.|$|E
50|$|The NLTSS {{operating}} system <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> {{in many respects}} and unique in some.|$|R
50|$|The mount design <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> {{in having}} both gunlayers {{on the left}} side.|$|R
50|$|Blue dragons <b>are</b> <b>unusual</b> for {{chromatics}} in {{that they}} keep fairly well-ordered, hierarchical societies.|$|R
5|$|The {{beach at}} Village Bay <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> in that its short stretch of summer sand recedes in winter, exposing the large {{boulders}} {{on which it}} rests. A survey of the beach in 1953 found only a single resident species, the crustacean isopod Eurydice pulchra.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray whale}} {{has been placed}} {{in a family of}} its own as it is {{sufficiently}} different from the right whales and the rorquals. The gray whale is the only benthic feeding baleen whale, filtering small organisms from the mud of shallow seas. They also have a gestation period of over a year, which <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> for baleen whales.|$|E
5|$|This station <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> in {{that its}} {{mezzanine}} is {{split in two}} halves. This is because at this location, Union Turnpike and the Jackie Robinson Parkway cross under Queens Boulevard but over the Queens Boulevard Line tracks; the mezzanine is {{at the level of}} Union Turnpike, one half on either side, with no connection between the two outside of fare control.|$|E
50|$|Noctiluca species <b>are</b> <b>unusual</b> among {{dinoflagellates}} in {{appearing to}} have a diplontic life cycle.|$|R
50|$|These are {{individuals}} (or user-IDs) that <b>are</b> <b>unusual</b> for {{reasons other than}} being eccentric.|$|R
50|$|Both {{of these}} verbs <b>are</b> <b>unusual</b> {{in that they}} do not follow the regular pattern.|$|R
5|$|Z-Trans is {{the mass}} transit system, {{providing}} paratransit and scheduled service {{within the city}} center and to White Sands Mall, Holloman Air Force Base and Inn of the Mountain Gods Resort & Casino in Mescalero. Z-Trans <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> {{in that it is}} privately owned (by Zia Therapy Center, a non-profit), although it does get some local and state subsidies.|$|E
5|$|Zimbabwe <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> in Africa in {{that there}} are a number of ancient ruined cities built in a unique dry stone style. The most famous of these are the Great Zimbabwe ruins in Masvingo. Other ruins include Khami Ruins, Zimbabwe, Dhlo-Dhlo and Naletale.|$|E
5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> {{in that it}} can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
50|$|The synod decrees <b>are</b> <b>unusual</b> {{for their}} {{number and the}} fact they are dated precisely.|$|R
50|$|These {{features}} <b>are</b> <b>unusual</b> among xenarthrans but {{are more}} in line with predatory mammal groups.|$|R
50|$|The show <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> {{for having}} a multiracial cast, unlike most American sitcoms in the 1990s.|$|R
