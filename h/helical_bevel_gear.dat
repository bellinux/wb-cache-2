The tooth profile {{with a double}} circular arc for <b>helical</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> in nutation drives is proposed and then the meshing equation during the nutation process and the universal equation of the crown gear tooth surface with helical double circular arc profiles are obtained based on the gear meshing theory. Further, the modeling for nutation drives with the proposed profile is carried out in a virtual working process...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of transmission errors and bearing contact of spur, <b>helical</b> and spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> was performed. Modified tooth surfaces for these gears {{have been proposed}} in order to absorb linear transmission errors caused by gear misalignment and localize the bearing contact. Numerical examples for spur, <b>helical,</b> and spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> are presented to illustrate {{the behavior of the}} modified gear surfaces to misalignment and errors of assembly. The numerical results indicate that the modified surfaces will perform with a low level of transmission error in nonideal operating environment...|$|R

40|$|A {{description}} is presented {{of the development}} and use of a preprocessor to create a NASTRAN finite element model of a complex spur, <b>helical,</b> or spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> quickly, inexpensively, and accurately. The preprocessor creates a ready to run NASTRAN input deck including the executive, case control, and bulk data sections. It generates nodes and solid elements to model spur, <b>helical,</b> or spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> teeth with integral shafting. Either a complete gear shafting model or a symmetric model is created. The fundamental building block of the gear model is the base layer. The base layer is the mesh configuration of one layer of one tooth segment which is in turn duplicated, translated, and rotated to create the completed model of the gear. Once the base layer is created, the construction of the finite element model is straightforward...|$|R

5000|$|Drive shafts {{have been}} used on {{motorcycles}} since before WW1, such as the Belgian FN motorcycle from 1903 and the Stuart Turner Stellar motorcycle of 1912. As an alternative to chain and belt drives, drive shafts offer long-lived, clean, and relatively maintenance-free operation. A disadvantage of shaft drive on a motorcycle is that <b>helical</b> <b>gearing,</b> spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gearing</b> or similar is needed to turn the power 90° from the shaft to the rear wheel, losing some power in the process.|$|R
40|$|A gear is a {{rotating}} machine part having cut tooth, which mesh with another toothed part {{in order to}} transmit torque. Gears are mainly type like spur gears, helical <b>gears,</b> double <b>helical</b> <b>gears,</b> <b>bevel</b> <b>gears,</b> crown gears, hypoid gears, worm gears, rack and pinion, epicyclic gears etc. The application of these gears fled from tiny wrist watches to huge machinery equipment gears from vital elements of mechanism in many machines such as automobile, aerospace industry, rolling mills, hoisting and transmitting machinery, marine engines, and the like. Parallel and co-planer shaft connected by gears are known as spur gear. Spur gear have straight tooth and are parallel to the axis of the wheel. Spur gears are {{most common type of}} gears. A pair of spur gear tooth in action is generally subjected to two types of cyclic stress: contact stress and bending stress including bending fatigue. Both stress may not attain their maximum values at the same point of contact fatigue. These types of failure can be minimized by analysis of the problem during the design stage and creating proper tooth surface profile with proper manufacturing methods. In this paper using ansys work bench software, bending stress, contact stress and static load on the tooth of spur gear drive is found...|$|R
40|$|Gears {{are used}} to {{transmit}} torque and angular velocity {{in a wide variety}} of applications. There is also a wide variety of gear types to choose from. The simplest type is spur gears, designed to operate on parallel shafts,while others for nonparallel shafts are usually using <b>helical,</b> <b>bevel</b> and worm <b>gears.</b> Design of gearset is base on given parameters, tables, graphs and standard which needs much time for calculating if done manually. Based on that drawback it needs computational design to safe time so that gives more benefit. Computer program 2 ̆ 7 s we made can get accurate design which only has small different compare to conventional design method. Those differents are surface stress for idler-gear mesh and surface stress for pinion-idler mesh. Rounding values in conventional design cause it, while computational design doesnot needs that step...|$|R
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} time-varying (NLTV) {{dynamic model}} of a hypoid gear pair system with time-dependent mesh point, line-of-action vector, mesh stiffness, mesh damping, and backlash nonlinearity is formulated to analyze the transitional phase between nonlinear jump phenomenon and linear response. It is found that the classical jump discontinuity will occur if the dynamic mesh force exceeds the mean value of tooth mesh force. On the other hand, the propensity for the gear response to jump disappears when the dynamic mesh force {{is lower than the}} mean mesh force. Furthermore, the dynamic analysis is able to distinguish the specific tooth impact types from analyzing the behaviors of the dynamic mesh force. The proposed theory is general and also applicable to high-speed spur, <b>helical</b> and spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> even though those types of gears are not the primary focus of this paper...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{right angle}} gear drive design where <b>helical</b> and spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> are being used. Because of the high speed ratio (1800 / 18, input/output), three {{reductions}} were applied. Two helical gear sets {{were used in the}} first and second reductions (one each), and a spiral bevel set was used at the final reduction. The gears were mounted on four shafts, with the first and last shafts (output and input shafts) carrying one gear each straddle mounted, and the second and third shafts carrying two gears each, overhung mounted. The design was based on a criterion that was set for every element and was carried out in sequence; i. e. gears, shafts, bearings and housing. The high speed shaft and the bevel pinion shaft were made one piece with the pinions. The housing was made out of three parts: The main housing, which is to house the <b>bevel</b> <b>gear</b> set and to hold the oil; the high speed housing, which is to house the high speed helical gear set and support the high speed bearings; and the rear cover, which is to house the intermediate gear set (second reduction) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{algorithms}} {{of constructing}} geometrically accurate real computer 3 d models are developed. The special feature of these algorithms {{is that they}} reproduce a technological process of manufacturing components. The examples of constructing spur and <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> sets, <b>bevel</b> <b>gears,</b> Archimedes and globoid gear pairs are given. The accuracy of construction is estimated. The construction inaccuracy doesn’t exceed a part of μm, which enables one to use the models as computer samples for production accuracy control and the algorithms {{as a basis for}} programs of components production {{with the help of the}} programmed control machine tools. The programs for implementation of the suggested algorithms are developed. The programs enable one to vary numerous model parameters and take into consideration teeth forms.

One of {{the main}} {{problems}} with the operation of spiral <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> is related to very severe conditions in the contact of the meshing teeth; therefore, lubrication is very difficult, which {{increases the risk of}} scuffing occurrence. One of the ways to achieve better scuffing resistance is by the deposition of a low-friction coating on the <b>bevel</b> <b>gears</b> teeth.
