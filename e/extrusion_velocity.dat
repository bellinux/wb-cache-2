Polymer melt was shaped in shaping channels and extruded from die-holes from Die-plate and then be diced. The design of shaping channels directly influences the uniformity for polymer-melt extrusion pressure and <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity</b> of different die holes. In this paper, a three-dimensional flow model for polymer flow in Die-plate channel was presented, and then finite element simulation was used to analyze the distribution of <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity</b> in each die-hole. Based on simulation result, a BP neural network model was applied to analyze the relationship between geometry factors of Die-plate, such as length of shaping channels, die hole <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity</b> distribution, and extrusion uniformity. This optimization method can be used in the design of Die-plate to improve effect and quality of actual polymer production and processing...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{extrusion}} {{conditions on the}} tensile properties and texture of AZ 31 B alloy has been investigated by means of optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and tensile tests. It is found that the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), the yield strength (YS) and elongation (EN) of the extruded AZ 31 B alloy are more significantly influenced by extrusion velocities in contrast with temperature. Although the extrusion conditions are different, the { 112 ¯ 0 }[*]〈 011 ¯ 0 〉 texture is the chief texture in the AZ 31 B after extrusion. Moreover, the extrusion textures become scattered with increasing the temperatures at the same <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity.</b> As the <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity</b> is raised at the same temperature, the orientation density of textures increases and the separated textures become relatively concentrated. This leads to the changes of tensile properties at different extrusion conditions...|$|E
40|$|TiAl alloys {{containing}} high Nb {{are significantly}} promising for high-temperature structural applications in aerospace and automotive industries. Unfortunately the low plasticity {{at room temperature}} limits their extensive applications. To improve the plasticity, not only optimizing the opposition, but also refining grain size through equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) is necessary. The equal channel angular extrusion simulation of Ti- 44 Al- 8 Nb-(Cr,Mn,B,Y) (at%) alloy was investigated by using the Deform- 3 D software. The influences of friction coefficient, <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity,</b> and different channel angles on effective strain, damage factor, and the load on the die were analyzed. The results indicate that, with the increasing of friction coefficient, effective strain is enhanced. The <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity</b> has {{little effect on the}} uniformity of effective strain; in contrast it has large influence on the damage factor. Thus smaller extrusion rate is more appropriate. Under the condition of different channel angles, the larger one results in the lower effective strain magnitude and better strain distribution uniformity...|$|E

30|$|The MWCNR structure, {{analytical}} characterization, and functionalization {{are presented}} and discussed {{briefly in the}} results section. The first step {{of this investigation was}} to synthesize agglomerated catalyst. Song et al. [13] proposed that CNTs in bundles grow with different growth rates due to the different <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocities</b> of carbon atoms on the catalyst particles. It is believed that CNT bundles will curve due to the stress induced between the two nanotube walls inside the bundles. To enhance the bending moment of the CNT walls, the agglomerated catalyst was synthesized, which will facilitate the growth of two nanotube walls as far as nearer to each other. This reduction in space between the two nanotube walls promotes the curvy nature of CNTs. In this investigation, it is found that the MWCNRs have grown as tip-growth mode. The growth of CNTs is mostly tip-growth mode in the catalytic CVD process.|$|R

The continuous extrusion and rolling forming was simulated with DEFORM- 3 DT. Influences of <b>extrusion</b> wheel <b>velocity</b> and rolling reduction on the continuous extrusion and rolling forming were analyzed. It was shown that as <b>extrusion</b> wheel <b>velocity</b> increases, torque of extrusion wheel, chamber force and rolling force, will drop; temperature of the billet {{in the area of}} abutment which is highest will increase. As the rolling reduction is increased, torque of the extrusion wheel and force acting on the chamber decrease, while torque and force of the rolls increase. The experimental results showed that a homogeneously distributed and equiaxed grains microstructure can be formed in copper strip billets with an average grain size of about 80  μm, after continuous extrusion.

30|$|Fiber {{manufacturing}} is {{of special}} importance in communication, textile, automotive and building industry. Typical products are glass fibers, filters, insulating material, diapers or textile clothing. There {{are a variety}} of production processes, such a drawing with a take-up wheel, spunbond, meltblowing, rotational or electro-spinning, [1 – 5]. In general, a fluid (polymeric liquid or glass melt) is emerged from a orifice, pulled and stretched by outer forces to form a long thin fiber. The fiber jets can be considered as dynamic slender bodies. Topic of this work are viscoelastic jets. When spun, they might show a die swell effect, i.e. the fluid flow swells after exiting the nozzle and forms out a diameter that is significantly larger than the nozzle diameter. For small <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocities</b> the onion-shape rises directly at the nozzle, whereas for large velocities the swelling may happen away from the nozzle (delayed die swell), see [6, 7]. In industrial processes the forming of a die swell is undesirable since it changes the flow properties of the non-Newtonian fluid and consequently the quality of the resulting fabric. Hence, the understanding and prediction of this phenomenon is of special interest.|$|R

40|$|Extrusion of solid-liquid {{particulate}} pastes is {{a well-established}} process in industry for continuously forming products of defined cross-sectional shape. At low <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocities,</b> the solids and liquid phases can separate due to drainage of liquid through the interparticle pores, termed liquid phase migration (LPM). The effect of wall friction, die shape and extrusion speed on LPM in a cylindrically axisymmetric ram extruder is investigated using a two-dimensional {{finite element model}} of paste extrusion based on soil mechanics principles (modified Cam-Clay). This extends the smooth walled model reported by Patel et al. (2007) to incorporate a simplified Tresca wall friction condition. Three die entry angles (90 °, 60 ° and 45 °) and two extrusion speeds are considered. The extrusion pressure is predicted to increase with the Tresca friction factor {{and the extent of}} LPM is predicted to increase with decreasing ram speed (both as expected). The effects of wall friction on LPM are shown to be dictated by the die shape and ram displacement: there are few general rules relating extruder design and operating conditions to extent of LPM, so that finite element-based simulation is likely to be needed to predict the onset of LPM accurately.

A novel method named the three-point experimental extrapolation was executed to analyze the necessary extrusion pressure in relation to the <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity.</b> This new approach presented a higher analytical accuracy as compared to previous methods. The optimum layout of the 3 D printer was obtained by the comparative analysis of four typical topological constructions. On this basis, three main factors affecting the extrusion pressure of bioceramics materials, namely paste formulation (solvent content), nozzle length-to-diameter ratio, and the <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity,</b> were selected as the control factors, and a series of experiments were performed using the L 27 (313) orthogonal array.

They were carried out at deep waters, from 4800 to 5200 m, and they have allowed characterizing 41 newly discovered submarine structures which occur either as isolated edifices or clustered mounds. These features have circular to elongated shapes with diameters of 2 - 24 km and relief heights of 10 to 250 m, showing different flank slopes of 2 - 50 °. They generally display mounded forms and show morphological elements as ridges, near-circular rock outcrops, depressions and fault scarps together with mass flow and slide deposits located at the vicinity of the edifices. Two types of extrusive features are evidenced by the morphological and seismic data analyses, the first one probably corresponds to high <b>velocity</b> <b>extrusions</b> that reach the seafloor surface and the second one is probably formed by the combination of faulted structures and low <b>velocity</b> <b>extrusions</b> that produce singular domes in the shallower sedimentary records.

40|$|International audienceSevere plastic {{deformation}} by equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) is an ingenious deformation process used to modify texture and microstructure without reducing sample cross-section. The application of single ECAE pass to polypropylene (PP) was meticulously investigated {{at room temperature}} using a 90 ° die-angle tooling. The ECAE-induced deformation behaviour was examined {{in relation to the}} load versus ram-displacement curves. Depending on extrusion conditions, PP displayed various types of plastic flow. For ram velocities beyond 4. 5 mm/min, severe shear bands consisting of successive translucent and opaque bands were observed, accompanied on the top surface by more or less pronounced periodic waves. Although the application of a back-pressure significantly reduced the wave and shear-banding phenomena, slightly inhomogeneous shear deformation was still observed. Shear bands were only suppressed by decreasing <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity.</b> The strain-induced crystalline microstructure was investigated by X-ray scattering. Shear-banded samples exhibited a strong texturing of the (hk 0) planes along the shear direction in the translucent bands whereas perfect crystalline isotropy appeared in the opaque bands. Application of back-pressure and/or reducing ram velocity resulted in uniform texturing along the extruded sample. Yet, texturing changed from single shear to twin-like shear orientation about the shear direction. Mechanical properties changes of the extruded samples due to back-pressure and <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity</b> effects were analyzed via uniaxial tensile tests. The tensile samples displayed multiple strain localizations in shear-banded materials whereas quite homogeneous deformation appeared for non-banded ones. These effects were connected with the crystalline texturing. The results also revealed significant increase in the strain hardening after ECAE.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an easy method of {{extrusion}} freeforming to fabricate microwave electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) crystals. EBG crystals are periodic dielectric structures that can block wave propagation and generate a bandgap. These crystals can be used in high capability antennae, electromagnetic wave semiconductors, microresonators, high-reflectivity mirrors and polarizing beam splitters. Design/methodology/approach – The effects of extrusion process parameters and paste characteristics were investigated. Finally, one-period and two-period woodpile EBG crystals with bandgaps in the frequency region of 90 - 110 ?GHz were fabricated and the bandgap was measured. Findings – The filament diameter is influenced by whether extrusion is carried out with or without a substrate and by the free fall-distance from the nozzle. The quality of lattice structures is dependent on paste flow and properties. A ceramic paste with 60 ?vol. ?% (the fraction of ceramic powder based on solvent-free polymer) was well suited to fabrication. The solvent content also influenced the fabrication. The experimental results show that under ~ 12 per cent solvent mass fraction in the paste and relatively high <b>extrusion</b> ram <b>velocity</b> (more than 0. 014 ?mm/s) at a pressure of 14 ?MPa, samples with high quality were fabricated.

40|$|Extrusion honing is a {{technique}} used for the finish machining of engineering components. The process {{may be used to}} deburr, radius or polish depending on the specific application. Extrusion honing utilises a polyborosiloxane polymer, which is mixed with fine abrasive particles and forced through or around components using an extrusion honing machine to achieve the machining action. It is evident that the machining process is very dependent upon the physical and mechanical characteristics of the polyborosiloxane. However, the process to date has largely been developed empirically, and further developments will require a greater understanding {{of the relationship between the}} characteristics of the polymer and the machining action. The rheology of the C- 11 polyborosiloxane has been investigated using a concentric cylinder, a slit-die and a capillary rheometer. The shear history of the polyborosiloxane prior to testing with the capillary rheometer was found to significantly affect the results produced. At shear strain rates up to 100 s- 1 and a temperature of 30 °C the rheology of the polyborosiloxane has been approximated to a power law equation (K. = 989 KPas; n= 0. 935). At shear strain rates greater than 100 s- 1 the pseudoplasticity of the polyborosiloxane increases significantly. Using this power law equation the velocity, shear strain rate and the shear stress within the polyborosiloxane in an extrusion die has been modelled mathematically. In some cases the extrusion barrel pressure and the mass flow rate through the extrusion die have both been shown to vary considerably during the constant ram <b>velocity</b> <b>extrusion</b> of polyborosiloxane in the capillary rheometer. It is tentatively proposed that such variations in the extrusion barrel pressure during capillary flow are a result of periodic slipping and sticking of the polyborosiloxane to the extrusion die wall. This mechanism is thought to be considerably influenced by the polyborosiloxane temperature, the <b>extrusion</b> ram <b>velocity</b> and the flow passage geometry. It is proposed that the measured variations in the mass flow rate of the polyborosiloxane through the extrusion dies are a result of pressure induced density variations within the extrusion barrel. This mechanism has been mathematically modelled. Temperature profiles within the C- 11 polyborosiloxane have been measured on an extrusion honing machine and the results suggest significant heat generation towards the periphery of the restriction. These results have been used to model mathematically the heat generation and transfer within the polyborosiloxane during operation of the extrusion honing machine. It is proposed that heat generation during extrusion honing is by friction at the medium/workpiece interface and internal shear within the medium. Both of these mechanisms would cause the greatest heat generation towards the periphery of an orifice restriction...|$|R

Membrane tether extrusion is carried out on healthy RBCs and ATP-depleted or -inhibited RBCs. For healthy RBCs, extrusion is slow, constant in velocity, and reproducible through several extrusion-retraction cycles. For ATP-depleted or -inhibited cells, extrusion dynamics exhibit an aging phenomenon through extrusion-retraction cycles: because the extruded membrane is not able to retract properly onto the cell body, each subsequent extrusion exhibits a loss of resistance to tether growth over the tether length extruded at the previous cycle.

The detailed investigation of the calibration unit has shown that most of the heat is removed at the calibrator via the cooling channels and that the contact resistance at the interface is the most important parameter affecting the performance of the unit. Additionally, it was shown that boundary conditions on the calibrator/extrudate outer surfaces have negligible impact. The effect of process and geometrical parameters on the cooling performance can be quite distinct. Often, when a higher reduction of the profile average temperature is imparted, lower temperature homogeneity is also obtained, which is undesirable; exceptions are variations in the <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity</b> and splitting the calibrator into several units...|$|E

As a tool, we used a hydrodynamic membrane tube extrusion technique to characterize the mechanical interaction between the plasma membrane and the underlying cortical cytoskeleton. Cells were anchored on 4. 5 μm beads coated with polylysine (PL) to obtain nonspecific cell adhesion or with an antibody against Ecad to mimic specific Ecad-mediated cell adhesion. We investigated tube length dynamics L(t) over time and through successive extrusions applied to the cell at regular time intervals. A constant slow velocity was observed for the first extrusion, for PL-attached cells. Subsequent extrusions had two phases: an initial high-velocity regime followed by a low-velocity regime. Successive extrusions gradually weakened the binding of the membrane around the tube neck to the underlying cortical cytoskeleton. Cells specifically attached via Ecad first exhibited a very low <b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity</b> regime followed by a faster extrusion regime similar to nonspecific extrusion. This indicates that Ecad strengthens the membrane-cortical cytoskeleton interaction, but only in a restricted area corresponding {{to the site of}} contact between the cell and the bead. Occasional giant “cortex” tubes were extruded with specifically anchored cells, demonstrating that the cortex remained tightly bound to the membrane through Ecad-mediated adhesion at the contact site...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} the Taguchi method and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique which uses mutation (MPSO) and dynamic inertia weight {{to determine the}} best ranges of process parameters (<b>extrusion</b> <b>velocity,</b> eccentricity ratio, billet temperature and friction coefficient at the die interface) for a multi-hole extrusion process. A L 18 (21 × 37) array, signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios and analysis of variance (ANOVA) at 99 % confidence level were used to indicate the optimum levels and the effect of the process parameters with consideration of mandrel eccentricity angle and exit tube bending angle. As per the Taguchi-based MPSO algorithm using DEFORMTM 3 D Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software, the minimum mandrel eccentricity and exit tube bending angles were respectively calculated to be 0. 03 °, which are significantly less than those based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the Taguchi method, respectively. This indicates that the Taguchi-based MPSO algorithm can effectively and remarkably reduce the warp angles of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V extruded products and the billet temperature is the most influencing parameter. The results of this study can be extended to multi-hole extrusion beyond four holes and employed as a predictive tool to forecast the optimal parameters of the multi-hole extrusion process...|$|E
