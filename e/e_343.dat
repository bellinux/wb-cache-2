40|$|The RecX {{protein is}} a potent {{inhibitor}} of RecA activi-ties. We identified several factors that affect RecX-RecA interaction. The interaction is enhanced by the RecA C terminus and by significant concentrations of free Mg 2 ion. The interaction is also enhanced by an N-terminal His 6 tag on the RecX protein. We conclude that RecX protein interacts most effectively with a RecA func-tional state designated Ao and that the RecA C terminus has a role in modulating the interaction. We further identified a C-terminal point mutation in RecA protein (<b>E</b> <b>343</b> K) that significantly alters the interaction between RecA and RecX proteins. Homologous recombinational repair of damaged DNA medi-ated by the bacterial RecA protein is crucial in maintaining {{the integrity of the}} genome (1 – 6). In vitro, the RecA protein pro...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGastric H,K-ATPase is an electroneutral transmembrane pump {{that moves}} protons from the {{cytoplasm}} of the parietal cell into the gastric lumen {{in exchange for}} potassium ions. The mechanism of transport against the established electrochemical gradients includes intermediate conformations in which the transferred ions are trapped (occluded) within the membrane domain of the pump. The pump cycle involves switching between the E 1 and E 2 P states. Molecular dynamics simulations on homology models of the E 2 P and E 1 states were performed to investigate the mechanism of K+ movement in this enzyme. We performed separate E 2 P simulations with one K+ in the luminal channel, one K+ ion in the occlusion site, two K+ ions in the occlusion site, and targeted molecular dynamics from E 2 P to E 1 with two K+ ions in the occlusion site. The models were inserted into a lipid bilayer system and were stable over {{the time course of}} the simulations, and K+ ions in the channel moved to a consistent location {{near the center of the}} membrane domain, thus defining the occlusion site. The backbone carbonyl oxygen from residues 337 through 342 on the nonhelical turn of M 4, as well as side-chain oxygen from <b>E</b> <b>343,</b> E 795, and E 820, participated in the ion occlusion. A single water molecule was stably bound between the two K+ ions in the occlusion site, providing an additional ligand and partial shielding the positive charges from one another. Targeted molecular dynamics was used to transform the protein from the E 2 P to the E 1 state (two K+ ions to the cytoplasm). This simulation identified the separation of the water column in the entry channel as the likely gating mechanism on the luminal side. A hydrated exit channel also formed on the cytoplasmic side of the occlusion site during this simulation. Hence, water molecules became available to hydrate the ions. The movement of the M 1 M 2 transmembrane segments, and the displacement of residues Q 159, E 160, Q 110, and T 152 during the conformational change, as well as the motions of <b>E</b> <b>343</b> and L 346, acted as the cytoplasmic-side gate...|$|E

40|$|Apolipoprotein N-acyl {{transferase}} (Lnt) is {{an essential}} membrane-bound protein involved in lipid modification of all lipoproteins in gram-negative bacteria. Essential residues in Lnt of Escherichia coli were identified by using site-directed mutagenesis and an in vivo complementation assay. Based on sequence conservation and known protein structures, we predict a model for Lnt, which {{is a member of}} the CN hydrolase family. Besides the potential catalytic triad E 267 -K 335 -C 387, four residues that directly affect the modification of Braun's lipoprotein Lpp are absolutely required for Lnt function. Residues Y 388 and E 389 are part of the hydrophobic pocket that constitutes the active site. Residues W 237 and <b>E</b> <b>343</b> are located on two flexible arms that face away from the active site and are expected to open and close upon the binding and release of phospholipid and/or apolipoprotein. Substitutions causing temperature-dependent effects were located at different positions in the structural model. These mutants were not affected in protein stability. Lnt proteins from other proteobacteria, but not from actinomycetes, were functional in vivo, and the essential residues identified in Lnt of E. coli are conserved in these proteins...|$|E
40|$|Human {{concentrative}} nucleoside transporter 3 (hCNT 3) utilizes electrochemical gradients of both Na+ and H+ {{to accumulate}} pyrimidine and purine nucleosides within cells. We have employed radioisotope flux and electrophysiological techniques {{in combination with}} site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes to identify two conserved pore-lining glutamate residues (Glu- 343 and Glu- 519) with essential roles in hCNT 3 Na+/nucleoside and H+/nucleoside cotransport. Mutation of Glu- 343 and Glu- 519 to aspartate, glutamine, and cysteine severely compromised hCNT 3 transport function, and changes included altered nucleoside and cation activation kinetics (all mutants), loss or impairment of H+ dependence (all mutants), shift in Na+:nucleoside stoichiometry from 2 : 1 to 1 : 1 (E 519 C), complete loss of catalytic activity (E 519 Q) and, similar to the corresponding mutant in Na+-specific hCNT 1, uncoupled Na+ currents (<b>E</b> <b>343</b> Q). Consistent with close-proximity integration of cation/solute-binding sites within a common cation/permeant translocation pore, mutation of Glu- 343 and Glu- 519 also altered hCNT 3 nucleoside transport selectivity.

40|$|Abstract Background Mitochondrial {{presequence}} proteases perform fundamental {{functions as}} they process about 70  % of all mitochondrial preproteins that are encoded in the nucleus and imported posttranslationally. The mitochondrial intermediate presequence protease MIP/Oct 1, which carries out precursor processing, {{has not yet}} been established to have a role in human disease. Methods Whole exome sequencing was performed on four unrelated probands with left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), developmental delay (DD), seizures, and severe hypotonia. Proposed pathogenic variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing or array comparative genomic hybridization. Functional analysis of the identified MIP variants was performed using the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the protein and its functions are highly conserved from yeast to human. Results Biallelic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or copy number variants (CNVs) in MIPEP, which encodes MIP, were present in all four probands, three of whom had infantile/childhood death. Two patients had compound heterozygous SNVs (p. L 582 R/p. L 71 Q and p. E 602 */p. L 306 F) and one patient from a consanguineous family had a homozygous SNV (p. K <b>343</b> <b>E).</b> The fourth patient, identified through the GeneMatcher tool, a part of the Matchmaker Exchange Project, was found to have inherited a paternal SNV (p. H 512 D) and a maternal CNV (1. 4 -Mb deletion of 13 q 12. 12) that includes MIPEP. All amino acids affected in the patients’ missense variants are highly conserved from yeast to human and therefore S. cerevisiae was employed for functional analysis (for p. L 71 Q, p. L 306 F, and p. K <b>343</b> <b>E).</b> The mutations p. L 339 F (human p. L 306 F) and p. K 376 E (human p. K <b>343</b> <b>E)</b> resulted in a severe decrease of Oct 1 protease activity and accumulation of non-processed Oct 1 substrates and consequently impaired viability under respiratory growth conditions. The p. L 83 Q (human p. L 71 Q) failed to localize to the mitochondria. Conclusions Our findings reveal {{for the first time the}} role of the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase in human disease. Loss of MIP function results in a syndrome which consists of LVNC, DD, seizures, hypotonia, and cataracts. Our approach highlights the power of data exchange and the importance of an interrelationship between clinical and research efforts for disease gene discovery...|$|R
40|$|Human {{terminal}} deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) was overexpressed in a baculovirus system. The pure recombinant enzyme {{was identical}} in size, activity, kinetic constants, and metal effects to native enzyme. Three amino acids, within either the putative nucleotide binding domain {{and part of}} a DNA polymerase consensus sequence, YGDTDSLF, or a TdT consensus sequence, GGFRRGK, were altered by site-directed mutagenesis. The four mutant forms of terminal transferase were also overexpressed in the baculovirus expression system and purified from Trichoplusia ni larvae by a monoclonal antibody affinity column and compared with wild-type enzyme with respect to thermostabilities, secondary structure, metal effects, and kinetic parameters. Three of the four mutants retained 3 - 16 % of wild-type activity under varying metal conditions, and one of the mutants, D <b>343</b> <b>E,</b> consistently exhibited less than 0. 2 % of wild-type TdT activity with dATP and no activity with dGTP. All mutants had alterations in the Km for dATP. Variations in Km for dGTP were not as consistent.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In the Netherlands, {{budgeting}} systems allocate {{funds to}} finance academic care. For some highly specialized treatments, it is {{felt that the}} costs are not well reimbursed. This study compared hospital reimbursements for head-neck oncology with real costs. To reflect future care costs, costs of required improvements {{in the quality of}} care were also estimated. DESIGN: This study was based on 854 consecutive patients treated between 1994 - 1996 in two university hospitals. Full costs of medical consumption were determined. RESULTS: Costs of diagnosis, treatment and two years of follow-up of patients with a primary head or neck carcinoma summed up to f 47848 (E 21712). For patients with a relapsed carcinoma, this amount was f 61088 (E 27721). After two years, the relapse rate is 40 %. Costs per new patient were therefore calculated as 1 * 47848 + 0. 4 * 61088. The costs of 10 years of follow-up were f 755 (<b>E</b> <b>343)</b> after correction for survival. In total, average costs per new patient were f 73344 (E 33282), which covered costs of treating the primary tumour, costs of treating relapsed tumours in 40 % of all patients and the costs of 10 years of follow-up. The current reimbursement is f 26786 (E 12155). Costs of enhancing quality of care (including enlarging doctor's time) were f 3700 (E 1679) per new patient. CONCLUSIONS: Actual costs of treating head-neck carcinoma are 2. 88 times higher than the hospital reimbursement. The actual costs for this type of highly specialized care are not covered by the reimbursement system, which should therefore be revised...|$|E

Here we report that the Lnt reaction proceeds through an acyl-enzyme intermediate in which a palmitoyl group forms a thioester bond with the thiol of the active site residue C 387 that was cleaved by neutral hydroxylamine. Lnt(C 387 S) also formed a fatty acyl intermediate that was resistant to neutral hydroxylamine treatment, consistent with formation of an oxygen-ester linkage. Lnt(C 387 A) did not form an acyl-enzyme intermediate and, like Lnt(C 387 S), {{did not have any}} detectable Lnt activity, indicating that acylation cannot occur at other positions in the catalytic domain. The existence of this thioacyl-enzyme intermediate allowed us to determine whether essential residues in the catalytic domain of Lnt affect the first step of the reaction, the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, or the second step in which the acyl chain is transferred to the apolipoprotein substrate. In the catalytic triad, E 267 is required for the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, indicating its role in enhancing the nucleophilicity of C 387. <b>E</b> <b>343</b> is also involved in the first step but is not in close proximity to the active site. W 237, Y 388, and E 389 {{play a role in the}} second step of the reaction since acyl-Lnt is formed but N-acylation does not occur.

40|$|The {{chemokine}} receptor CXCR 4 regulates {{cell migration}} during ontogenesis and disease states including cancer and inflammation. Upon stimulation by the endogenous ligand CXCL 12, CXCR 4 becomes phosphorylated at multiple sites in its C-terminal domain. Mutations in the CXCR 4 gene affecting C-terminal phosphorylation sites are {{a hallmark of}} WHIM syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by a gain-of-CXCR 4 -function. To better understand how multi-site phosphorylation of CXCR 4 is organized and how perturbed phosphorylation might affect CXCR 4 function, we developed novel phosphosite-specific CXCR 4 antibodies and studied the differential regulation and interaction of three C-terminal phosphorylation sites in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293). CXCL 12 promoted a robust phosphorylation at S 346 / 347 which preceded phosphorylation at S 324 / 325 and S 338 / 339. After CXCL 12 washout, the phosphosites S 338 / 339 and S 324 / 325 were rapidly dephosphorylated whereas phosphorylation at S 346 / 347 was long-lasting. CXCL 12 -induced phosphor-ylation at S 346 / 347 was staurosporine-insensitive and mediated by GRK 2 / 3. WHIM syndrome-associated CXCR 4 truncation mutants lacking the S 346 / 347 phosphosite and the recently identified <b>E</b> <b>343</b> K WHIM mutant displayed strongly impaired phosphorylation at S 324 / 325 and S 338 / 339 as well as reduced CXCL 12 -induced receptor internalization.

The sponge harbors {{a large number of}} bacterial groups that have been identified using various techniques, including fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Fractionation of dissociated sponge allowed isolation of 25 bacterial species. Based on 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, phylogenetic analysis attributed most of these eubacteria to alpha-Proteobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria, Cytophaga / Flavobacterium / Bacteroidetes (CFB group), and the family Bacillaceae of Gram-positive bacteria. In sequence similarity, five putatively novel species were identified with less than 98 % similarity to other strains in the NCBI database. Tests for antimicrobial activities were performed against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, antitumor indicators Escherichia coli 343 / 591 (with DNA repair deficiency), regular <b>E.</b> coli <b>343</b> / 636 (with different DNA repair capacity), and 10 bacterial isolates exhibited inhibitory bioactivities. Among these strains, three isolates were detected involving function gene NRPS-A domains, which were most closely related to the amino acid sequences of linear gramicidin synthetase and pyoverdine synthetase.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{regulation of}} protein trafficking by calmodulin (CaM) {{is a novel}} concept {{that remains to be}} substantiated. We proposed that KCNQ 2 K+ channel trafficking is regulated by CaM binding to the C-terminal A and B helices. Here we show that the L 339 R mutation in helix A, which is linked to human benign neonatal convulsions, perturbs CaM binding to KCNQ 2 channels and prevents their correct trafficking to the plasma membrane. We used glutathione S-transferase fused to helices A and B to examine the impact of this and other mutations in helix A (I 340 A, I 340 <b>E,</b> A <b>343</b> D, and R 353 G) on the interaction with CaM. The process appears to require at least two steps; the first involves the transient association of CaM with KCNQ 2, and in the second, the complex adopts an “active” conformation that is more stable and is that which confers the capacity to exit the endoplasmic reticulum. Significantly, the mutations that we have analyzed mainly affect the stability of the active configuration of the complex, whereas Ca 2 + alone appears to affect the initial binding step. The spectrum of responses from this collection of mutants revealed a strong correlation between adopting the active conformation and channel trafficking in mammalian cells. These data are entirely consistent with the concept that CaM bound to KCNQ 2 acts as a Ca 2 + sensor, conferring Ca 2 + dependence to the trafficking of the channel to the plasma membrane and fully explaining the requirement of CaM binding for KCNQ 2 function...|$|R

SP-D binds to, agglutinates, and reduces phagocytosis and intracellular growth of M. tb. Species-specific {{variations in the}} CRD amino acid sequence contribute to carbohydrate recognition preferences and have been exploited to enhance the antimicrobial properties of SP-D in vitro. Here, we characterized the binding interaction between several wild-type and mutant SP-D neck + CRD trimeric subunits (NCRDs) and pathogenic and nonpathogenic mycobacterial species. Specific amino acid substitutions (i. <b>e.,</b> the <b>343</b> -amino-acid position) that flank the carbohydrate binding groove led to significant increases in binding of only virulent and attenuated M. tb strains {{and to a lesser}} extent M. marinum, whereas there was negligible binding to M. avium complex and M. smegmatis. Moreover, a nonconserved mutation at the critical 321 -amino-acid position (involved in Ca 2 + coordination) abrogated binding to M. tb and M. marinum. We further characterized the binding of NCRDs to the predominant surface-exposed mannosylated lipoglycans of the M. tb cell envelope. Results showed a binding pattern that is dependent on the nature of the side chain of the 343 -amino-acid position flanking the SP-D CRD binding groove and the nature of the terminal mannosyl sugar linkages of the mycobacterial lipoglycans. We conclude that the 343 position is critical in defining the binding pattern of SP-D proteins to M. tb and its mannosylated cell envelope components...|$|R
40|$|The C 3 -V 4 {{region is}} a major target of {{autologous}} neutralizing antibodies in HIV- 1 subtype C infection. We previously identified a Center for AIDS Program of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) participant, CAP 88, who developed a potent neutralizing-antibody response within 3 months of infection that targeted an epitope in the C 3 region of the HIV- 1 envelope (P. L. Moore et al., PLoS Pathog. 5 :e 1000598, 2009). Here we showed that these type-specific antibodies could be adsorbed using recombinant gp 120 from the transmitted/founder virus from CAP 88 but not by gp 120 made from other isolates. Furthermore, this activity could be depleted using a chimeric gp 120 protein that contained only the C 3 region from the CAP 88 viral envelope engrafted onto the unrelated CAP 63 viral envelope (called 63 - 88 C 3). On the basis of this, a differential sorting of memory B cells was performed using gp 120 s made from 63 - 88 C 3 and CAP 63 labeled with different fluorochromes as positive and negative probes, respectively. This strategy resulted in the isolation of a highly specific monoclonal antibody (MAb), called CAP 88 -CH 06, that neutralized the CAP 88 transmitted/founder virus and viruses from acute infection {{but was unable to}} neutralize CAP 88 viruses isolated at 6 and 12 months postinfection. The latter viruses contained 2 amino acid changes in the alpha- 2 helix of C 3 that mediated escape from this MAb. One of these changes involved the introduction of an N-linked glycan at position 339 that occluded the epitope, while the other mutation (either <b>E</b> <b>343</b> K or E 350 K) was a charge change.

40|$|Asn 792 {{present in}} M 5 of gastric H,K-ATPase is highly conserved within the P-type ATPase family. A direct role in K+ binding was {{postulated}} for Na,K-ATPase {{but was not}} found in a recent model for gastric H,K-ATPase (Koenderink, J. B., Swarts, H. G. P., Willems, P. H. G. M., Krieger, E., and De Pont, J. J. H. H. M. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 16417 - 16424). Therefore, its role in K+ binding and E 1 /E 2 conformational equilibrium in gastric H,K-ATPase was studied by site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Sf 9 cells. N 792 Q and N 792 A, but not N 792 D and N 792 E, had a markedly reduced K+ affinity in both the ATPase and dephosphorylation reactions. In addition, N 792 A shifted the conformational equilibrium to the E 1 form. In double mutants, the effect of N 792 A on K+ sensitivity was overruled by either E 820 Q (K(+) -independent activity) or <b>E</b> <b>343</b> D (no dephosphorylation activity). Models were made for the mutants based on the E 2 structure of Ca(2 +) -ATPase. In the wild-type model the acid amide group of Asn 792 has hydrogen bridges to Lys 791, Ala 339, and Val 341. Comparison {{of the effects of}} the various mutants suggests that the hydrogen bridge between the carbonyl oxygen of Asn 792 and the amino group of Lys 791 is essential for the K+ sensitivity and the E 2 preference of wild-type enzyme. Moreover, there was a high positive correlation (r = 0. 98) between the in silico calculated energy difference of the E 2 form (mutants versus wild type) and the experimentally measured IC 50 values for vanadate, which reflects the direction of the E 2 E 1 conformational equilibrium.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} effects of sodium {{hyaluronate}} and carboxymethylcellulose membrane on collagen and fibroblast formation in bowel suture healing in rats. METHODS: 48 male Wistar rats, weighing 250 to 343 g, were randomized into two groups: group I - bowel suture without applying a biologically absorbable membrane and group II - bowel suture with application of an absorbable membrane. The two groups were divided into subgroups of 3, 14 and 30 days of observation, with 8 rats in each subgroup. All were sacrificed {{after the end of}} the observation period. RESULTS: No morbidity or mortality was observed during the experiment. The amounts of collagen in group I were 23. 4 %, 72. 1 % and 67. 6 % and in group II were 22. 5 %, 52. 5 % and 51. 6 %, for the subgroups of 3, 14 and 30 days, respectively. Comparison between groups showed that the 14 -day (p= 0. 0013) and 30 -day (p= 0. 0587) subgroups had significant variance, with larger collagen zones in animals in which the membrane was not applied. However, with regard to fibroblasts, group I had 2 %, 13 % and 8 % and group II had 2 %, 10 % and 8 %, for the 3 -day (p= 1. 0), 14 -day (p= 0. 3184) and 30 -day (p= 0. 5995) subgroups, respectively, showing no significant variance. CONCLUSION: The use of the biologically absorbable membrane cause a decrease in collagen formation, while not altering the number of fibroblasts, in bowel suture healing in rats, without increased morbidity and mortality. OBJETIVO: Analisar os efeitos da membrana de hialuronato de sódio e carboximetilcelulose, na formação de colágeno e fibroblastos na colorrafia de ratos.

40|$|The {{crucial role}} of two {{reactive}} arginyl residues within the substrate binding domain of human Type I D-myo-inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3) 5 -phosphatase {{has been investigated}} by chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis. Chemical modification of the enzyme by phenylglyoxal is accompanied by irreversible inhibition of enzymic activity. Our studies demonstrate that phenylglyoxal forms an enzyme-inhibitor complex and that the modification reaction is prevented {{in the presence of}} either Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3, D-myo-inositol 1, 3, 4, 5 -tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1, 3, 4, 5) P 4) or 2, 3 -bisphosphoglycerate (2, 3 -BPG). Direct [3 H]Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 binding to the covalently modified enzyme is dramatically reduced. The stoichiometry of labeling with 14 C-labeled phenylglyoxal is shown to be 2. 1 mol of phenylglyoxal incorporated per mol of enzyme. A single [14 C]phenylglyoxal-modified peptide is isolated following alpha-chymotrypsin proteolysis of the radiolabeled Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 5 -phosphatase and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The peptide sequence (i. e. M-N-T-R-C-P-A-W-C-D-R-I-L) corresponds to amino acids 340 - 352 of Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 5 -phosphatase. An estimate of the radioactivity of the different phenylthiohydantoin amino acid derivatives shows the modified amino acids to be Arg- 343 and Arg- 350. Furthermore, two mutant enzymes were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the two arginyl residues to alanine, and both mutant enzymes have identical UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra. The two mutants (i. <b>e.</b> R <b>343</b> A and R 350 A) show increased Km values for Ins(l, 4, 5) P 3 (10 - and 15 -fold, respectively) resulting in a dramatic loss in enzymic activity. In conclusion, we have directly identified two reactive arginyl residues as part of the active site of Ins(1, 4, 5) P 3 5 -phosphatase. These results point out the crucial role for substrate recognition of a 10 amino acids-long sequence segment which is conserved among the primary structure of inositol and phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate 5 -phosphatases.

30|$|Tannase can {{catalyse}} the hydrolysis of ester and depside bond in hydrolysable tannins {{to release}} glucose and gallic acid. Thus, tannase was crucial in the industries of foods, drinks and pharmaceutics (Chamorro et al. 2017; Lekha and Lonsane 1997; Li et al. 2018; Martins et al. 2016). In the past decades, both the high-yield production of tannase {{and the high}} activity conservation were considered as the research priorities. Since the discovery of tannase, its esterase and depsidase activities have been in debate {{for a long time}} (Haslam and Stangroom 1966). However, only few reports described the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity of tannase. In the previous works, our group reported the crystal structure of LP-tan, which was the first tannase 3 D structure (Ren et al. 2013). Based on the apo and complexes structures of LP-tan, the hydrolysis mechanism of tannase was explained. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the esterase and depsidase activities of LP-tan shared the same catalytic site. When LP-tan binding the substrates, two hydrogen-bond binding networks were observed, the first network was formed between the amino acids G 77, A 164, S 163, H 451 and the carboxyl group of galloyl unit of the substrates; the other hydrogen-bonding network was formed between amino acids <b>E</b> 357, K <b>343,</b> P 421 and the hydroxyl groups of the galloyl unit of the substrates (Ren et al. 2013).

A avaliação da ação fotoquímica foi realizada numa câmara isotérmica a 30 ºC. O efeito de absorvedor de W foi estudado utilizando materiais de embalagem feitos com polietileno tereftalato (PET) com e sem benzotriazóis. Estudou-se a estabilidade do óleo de soja e de milho acondicionados nas embalagens sob três condições de iluminação: 1700, 700 e 400 	lux, durante 10 meses mediante análises físicas, químicas e sensoriais.

Optical filters (cut on) and filters of neutral density used. The evaluation of the photochemical effects on the oils was done at 30 ºC. The effect of a UV absorber (benzotriazole) when added to the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resin was also studied. The photo-oxidation of soybean and corn oils stored under were illumination at 1700, 700 and 400 lux for 10 months was evaluated using physical chemical and sensory analyses. The photo oxidative effect per unit of radiant energy was calculated and its value correlated to the wavelength. By determining the transmission curves of the oils, it was observed that the light energy was absorbed in the band of short wavelength. The oxidation rate decreased with increasing the wavelength of the light source. The influence of the wavelength as controlled by the different types of filters on the photo-oxidation was similar for both oils. The decrease in light intensity by the use of neutral density filters caused, an exponential decrease in the oxidation rate of the oils. The addition of a UV absorber to the poliester resin did not produce a significant increase (p < 0. 05) in the stability of the oils. By using the sensory data. The shelf life of the oils in the PET botlles was calculated from exponential equations, as a function of light intensity (lux). It can be concluded that the photo-oxidation of vegetable oil is a complex subject.

Foram utilizadas 40 leitoas mestiças, com peso inicial médio de 29, 4 ± 1, 42 kg, em delineamento de blocos ao acaso com cinco tratamentos (16, 17, 18, 19 e 20 % de PB), quatro repetições e dois animais por unidade experimental. As rações experimentais foram isoenergéticas, com 3400 kcal de ED/kg de ração, e formuladas para satisfazerem às exigências dos animais, exceto em PB. A ração e a água foram fornecidas à vontade até o final do experimento, quando os animais atingiram peso médio de 60, 6 ± 1, 76 kg. O nível de PB da ração influenciou o ganho de peso diário (GPD), que aumentou, e a conversão alimentar (CA), que melhorou linearmente. Apesar do efeito linear dos níveis de PB sobre o GPD e CA, o modelo "Linear Response Platô" (LRP) foi o que melhor se ajustou aos dados, estimando em 18, 78 e 19, 15 %, os níveis de PB a partir do qual o GPD e a CA, permaneceram em um platô. Os consumos diários de proteína e lisina aumentaram linearmente em razão do nível de PB da ração, porém não se observou efeito dos tratamentos sobre os consumos de ração e de energia digestível diários. Concluiu-se que leitoas em crescimento, mantidas em ambiente de conforto térmico, exigem 19, 15 % de PB na ração, correspondendo a um consumo de <b>343</b> <b>e</b> 19, 08 g/dia de proteína e lisina total, respectivamente.

The internal temperature at room was kept during the experimental period in 21. 3 ± 0. 53 °C with relative humidity of 70. 5 ± 5. 11 %. The calculated black globe humidity index (BGHI) in this period was 68. 7 ± 0. 93. Forty crossbred gilts with average initial weight of 29. 4 ± 1. 42 kg were used in an experimental design of randomized blocks with five treatments (16, 17, 18, 19 e 20 % de CP), four replicates and two animals per experimental unit. The experimental isoenergetics rations with 3, 400 kcal of DE/kg, were formulated {{to meet the requirements}} of animals, except to CP. The rations and water were feeding ad libitum to animals, until the final of experimental period when gilts reached the average weight of 60. 6 ± 1. 76 kg. The CP level of ration influenced the average daily weight gain (ADWG) that increases and the feed:gain (F:G) ratio that improved linearly. In spite of linear effect of CP levels on ADWG and F:G ratio the model of "Linear Response Plateau" (LRP) was one that better adjusted to the data estimating respectively in 18. 78 and 19. 15 % the levels of CP occurred a plateau.

40|$|Intracellular and {{intercellular}} polarity {{requires that}} specific proteins be sorted to discreet locations {{within and between}} cells. One mechanism for sorting proteins is through RNA localization. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ASH 1 mRNA localizes to the distal tip of the bud, resulting in the asymmetric sorting of the transcriptional repressor Ash 1 p. ASH 1 mRNA localization requires four cis-acting localization elements and the trans-acting factors Myo 4 p, She 3 p, and She 2 p. Myo 4 p is a type V myosin motor that functions to directly transport ASH 1 mRNA to the bud. She 2 p is an RNA-binding protein that directly interacts with the ASH 1 mRNA cis-acting elements. Currently, the role for She 3 p in ASH 1 mRNA localization is as an adaptor protein, since it can simultaneously associate with Myo 4 p and She 2 p. Here, we present data for two novel mutants of She 3 p, S 348 E and the double mutant S <b>343</b> <b>E</b> S 361 E, that are defective for ASH 1 mRNA localization, and yet both of these mutants retain the ability to associate with Myo 4 p and She 2 p.

40|$|ABSTRACT Gastric H,K-ATPase is an electroneutral transmembrane pump {{that moves}} protons from the {{cytoplasm}} of the parietal cell into the gastric lumen {{in exchange for}} potassium ions. The mechanism of transport against the established electrochemical gradients includes intermediate conformations in which the transferred ions are trapped (occluded) within the membrane domain of the pump. The pump cycle involves switching between the E 1 and E 2 P states. Molecular dynamics simulations on homology models of the E 2 P and E 1 states were performed to investigate the mechanism of K 1 movement in this enzyme. We performed separate E 2 P simulations with one K 1 in the luminal channel, one K 1 ion in the occlusion site, two K 1 ions in the occlusion site, and targeted molecular dynamics from E 2 P to E 1 with two K 1 ions in the occlusion site. The models were inserted into a lipid bilayer system and were stable over {{the time course of}} the simulations, and K 1 ions in the channel moved to a consistent location near the center of themembrane domain, thus defining the occlusion site. The backbone carbonyl oxygen from residues 337 through 342 on the nonhelical turn ofM 4, aswell as side-chain oxygen fromE <b>343,</b> <b>E</b> 795, andE 820, participated in the ion occlusion.

A total of 28 derivatives of paclitaxel were divided into two groups—a training set comprising of 19 compounds and a test set comprising of nine compounds. They were constructed and geometrically optimized using SYBYL v 6. 6. CoMFA studies provided a good predictability (q 2 = 0. 699, r 2 = 0. 991, PC = 6, S.

They showed the steric and electrostatic properties as the major interacting forces whilst the lipophilic property contribution was a minor factor for recognition forces of the binding site. These results were in agreement with the experimental data of the binding activities of these compounds. Five fields in CoMSIA analysis (steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen-bond acceptor and donor properties) were considered contributors in the ligand–receptor interactions. The results obtained from the CoMSIA studies were: q 2 = 0. 535, r 2 = 0. 983, PC = 5, S. E. E. = 0. 452 and F = 127. 884.

40|$|PURPOSE: 1) Diagnose, through optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) exam, {{the occurrence}} of diabetic macular edema in patients with diabetic retinopathy and visual acuity of 20 / 40 or better, by measuring the foveal center point thickness, during one year. 2) Evaluate the edema natural history, during this period, associating the center point thickness with hemoglobin A 1 c and changes in visual acuity. 3) Correlate the obtained results with the control group. METHODS: A prospective study was done, of a sample of 30 patients with diabetic macular edema and visual acuity of 20 / 40 or better. Measurements of the best corrected visual acuity, hemoglobin A 1 c level, biomicroscopy with 78 -diopter lens, fluorescein angiogram and {{optical coherence tomography}} were made. The retinal thickness {{was selected as the}} main variable. Besides descriptive statistics, additional tests were applied to analyze the results and determine the correlation between these variables, such as t-Student, Chi-Square, Tukey and ANOVA. The relation of optical coherence tomography with visual acuity and hemoglobin A 1 c was studied through linear regression. RESULTS: It was found that there is no significant difference between patients and normal individuals, for the variables age and gender. The values of center point thickness found for men were greater than those for women, showing the influence of gender on that thickness. As many as 83. 33 % of the diabetic patients with clinically significant macular edema presented moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), 10 % presented mild NPDR and 6. 66 % severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Patients under combined treatment of insulin and oral hypoglycemiant presented influence on the results of center point thickness (through OCT) and visual acuity. The mean duration of diabetes was 9. 63 years. Values of center point thickness were always found greater for patients than those for normal eyes. Levels of hemoglobin A 1 c did not have influence on the center point thickness data, whereas values of visual acuity were significantly correlated with it. CONCLUSION: This study presents the optical coherence tomography applicability in the detection and semiologic evaluation of diabetic macular edema in patients with visual acuity 20 / 40 or greater, during one year, showing the retinal thickening {{in the early stages of}} diabetic retinopathy. Further, it evidenciated the correlation between the increase in foveal thickness and the reduction in visual acuity. Levels of hemoglobin A 1 c did not influence the center point thickness data. An early detection of clinically significant macular edema leads us to a redefinition of the real meaning of incipient retinopathy and can prevent further significant reduction of vision. OBJETIVOS: 1) Diagnosticar a presença de edema macular diabético em pacientes com retinopatia diabética e acuidade visual igual ou melhor que 20 / 40, pela realização do exame de tomografia de coerência óptica, medindo a espessura foveal central, ao longo de um ano. 2) Avaliar a história natural do edema, ao longo de um ano, associando a espessura foveal central com a hemoglobina glicosilada (HbA 1 c) e alterações na acuidade visual. 3) Correlacionar os resultados obtidos com o grupo controle. MÉTODOS: Estudo prospectivo de uma amostra de 30 pacientes, com edema macular diabético e acuidade visual melhor ou igual a 20 / 40. O estudo contou com 30 olhos como grupo controle. Foram feitas medidas da melhor acuidade visual corrigida, dosagem de hemoglobina glicosilada, biomicroscopia com lente de 78 dioptrias, angiofluoresceinografia e tomografia de coerência óptica. Determinou-se, pelo propósito do estudo, a espessura foveal central como principal variável. Além da estatística descritiva, utilizaram-se testes para análise dos resultados: foi testada a homogeneidade de cada variável pelos testes t-Student, Qui-Quadrado e teste de Tukey; para correlacionar variáveis utilizou-se a análise de variância (ANOVA). A relação entre a espessura foveal central no tomografia de coerência óptica com a acuidade visual e a hemoglobina glicosilada foi estudada através de regressão linear. RESULTADOS: Registrou-se não haver diferença significativa entre casos e controles nas variáveis idade (p= 0, <b>343)</b> <b>e</b> sexo (p= 0, 793). Os valores da espessura foveal central para o sexo masculino foram maiores que no sexo feminino (p< 0, 05) mostrando que a variável sexo interfere nos valores da espessura foveal central. Dos pacientes diabéticos com edema macular clinicamente significativo, 83, 33 % apresentavam retinopatia diabética não-proliferativa moderada, 10 % retinopatia diabética não-proliferativa leve e 6, 66 % retinopatia diabética não-proliferativa grave. Os pacientes em tratamento combinado de insulina com hipoglicemiante oral apresentaram influência nos resultados da espessura foveal central pela tomografia de coerência óptica e na acuidade visual. A duração média do diabetes foi de 9, 63 anos. Registraram-se valores da espessura foveal central pela tomografia de coerência óptica sempre maiores nos pacientes que no grupo controle (p< 0, 001). As medidas da HbA 1 c não influenciaram os valores da espessura foveal central (p= 0, 130) e as medidas da acuidade visual se correlacionaram significativamente com espessura foveal central (p= 0, 02). CONCLUSÃO: Os resultados deste estudo mostraram a aplicabilidade da tomografia de coerência óptica na detecção do edema macular diabético em pacientes com acuidade visual melhor ou igual a 20 / 40, ao longo de um ano, mostrando o espessamento retiniano nos estágios iniciais de retinopatia diabética. Evidenciou-se a correlação entre o aumento da espessura foveal central e a piora da acuidade visual. As medidas da HbA 1 c não influenciaram nas medidas da espessura foveal central. A detecção precoce do edema macular clinicamente significativo leva-nos a redimensionar o real significado da retinopatia incipiente, podendo prevenir perdas acentuadas da visão...|$|R
