50|$|Since the 1990s, the <b>Internet's</b> <b>governance</b> and {{organization}} {{has been of}} global importance to governments, commerce, civil society, and individuals.

These objections have led to the ICANN removing themselves from relationships with first the University of Southern California in 2000, and in September 2009, gaining autonomy from the US government by the ending of its longstanding agreements, although some contractual obligations with the U.S. Department of Commerce continued.
