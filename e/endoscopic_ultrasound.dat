40|$|Sonography is an {{integral}} part of the routine diagnosis of diseases of the head and neck area. Ultrasound plays an important role in particular in the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of head and neck cancer. Sonographic imaging of the larynx, hypopharynx and upper esophagus is often difficult due to the anatomical conditions. Therefore, CT and MRI are performed as the imaging techniques of first choice for diseases of these organs. In addition to the well-established transcutaneous <b>ultrasound,</b> <b>endoscopic</b> endoluminal <b>ultrasound</b> has developed as a promising new technique in recent years. Hollow organs can be displayed in high resolution transcutaneously and endoluminally. Thus, the attending otolaryngologist can use endoscopy and ultrasonography for accurate surgical planning.

5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|While {{abdominal}} imaging can {{be useful}} in the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, direct imaging of the bile ducts is often necessary. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an endoscopic procedure performed by a gastroenterologist or specially trained surgeon, has been widely used for this purpose. Although ERCP is an invasive procedure with attendant risks, its advantages include the ability to obtain biopsies and to place stents or perform other interventions to relieve biliary obstruction. <b>Endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasound</b> can also be performed at the time of ERCP and may increase the accuracy of the biopsy and yield information on lymph node invasion and operability. As an alternative to ERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) may be utilized. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is a non-invasive alternative to ERCP. Some authors have suggested that MRCP should supplant ERCP in the diagnosis of biliary cancers, as it may more accurately define the tumor and avoids the risks of ERCP.|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{determine}} the diagnostic precision of <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasounds</b> (EUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the preoperative staging of gastric cancer. Methods: a prospective, blind study {{was carried out in}} 17 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer (GC) using endoscopic biopsy from November 2002 to June 2003. Patients underwent preoperative MRI and EUS. The reference test used was pathology, and laparotomy for non-resectable cases. Results: MRI (53 %) was better than EUS in the assessment of gastric wall infiltration (35 %). MRI (50 %) was also superior to EUS (42 %) for N staging. After pooling stages T 1 -T 2 and T 3 -T 4 together, results improved for both MRI (67 and 87. 5 %, respectively) and EUS (67 and 62. 5 %, respectively) (p < 0. 05). N staging -lymph node invasion- results were correct in 50 % for MRI as compared to EUS (42 %). In classifying positive and negative lymph nodes EUS was superior to MRI (73 versus 54 %). Conclusions: MRI was the best method in the assessment of gastric wall infiltration. EUS was superior to MRI for T 1 staging, and in the assessment of lymph node infiltration...|$|R
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{options for}} treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts are numerous. We report our experience of combined <b>endoscopic</b> and <b>ultrasound</b> guided percutaneous stenting for pancreatic pseudocysts. Data were prospectively collected for 20 consecutive patients. All patients had undergone a standard technique of combined <b>endoscopic</b> and <b>ultrasound</b> guided percutaneous placement of double J stents, between a pancreatic pseudocyst and the stomach. Patients age ranged between 25 and 84 years. Thirteen of the pseudocysts were due to acute pancreatitis and 7 were due to chronic pancreatitis. The duration of the combined procedure was mean 50 min (range 30 - 95 min). The length of hospital stay was mean 5 days (range 2 - 77 days. Only two patients suffered postoperative complications; one was re-admitted 2 weeks following stenting with acute cholecystitis, the other suffering a perforated duodenal ulcer 3 weeks after stenting. There were two failures early in the series, both due to stent migration, these stents were of a small size, (4. 7 French). Following this the stent size was increased to at least 7 French, no further failures occurred. There was no operative mortality for the series. Follow-up ranged between 6 months and 5 years. We conclude that a combined percutaneous and endoscopic cyst-gastrostomy stent is a safe and effective treatment for patients with suitably placed pseudocysts...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{endocrine}} neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is a hereditary syndrome predisposing to many endocrine and neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Conventional imaging (CI) cannot provide {{satisfactory results}} {{for all the}} different types of MEN 1 -related tumors. Objective of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the role of (68) Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT in MEN 1 compared to CI. Diagnostic performance of (68) Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT for the detection of NET was evaluated as well as the prognostic role of SUVmax. Eighteen patients with genetically confirmed MEN 1 were evaluated by (68) Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, <b>endoscopic</b> <b>ultrasounds,</b> multidetector-row computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and hormone/markers serum measurements. Four MEN 1 -related tumor sites (pancreas, pituitary, parathyroids, adrenals) were considered. Sensitivity and specificity of (68) Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT for the detection of NET were calculated. There was (68) Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT uptake in 11 / 11 patients with pancreatic lesions, in 9 / 12 with pituitary adenoma, in 5 / 15 with parathyroid enlargements, and in 5 / 7 with adrenal lesions. (68) Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT showed sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 100  % in pancreas, 75 and 83  % in pituitary, 28 and 100  % in parathyroids, and 62. 5 and 100  % in adrenals, respectively. Compared with CI, no significant difference in sensitivity for pancreas, pituitary, and adrenals was found, while CI had a better sensitivity for parathyroids (p =  0. 002). On the ROC analysis, progression of pancreatic lesions was significantly associated to SUVmax < 12. 3 (p <  0. 05). (68) Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT is greatly helpful in the work-up of MEN 1 providing a panoramic view of MEN 1 -related lesions.

25|$|Additional {{testing is}} needed to assess how much the cancer has spread (see Staging, below). Computed {{tomography}} (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can evaluate whether the cancer has spread to adjacent tissues or distant organs (especially liver and lymph nodes).

40|$|Abstract Background Upper {{gastrointestinal}} haemorrhage {{is mainly}} caused by ulcers. Gastric varicosis due to portal hypertension can also {{be held responsible for}} upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Portal hypertension causes the development of a collateral circulation from the portal to the caval venous system resulting in development of oesophageal and gastric fundus varices. Those may also be held responsible for upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Case presentation In this study, we describe the case of a 69 -year-old male with recurrent severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding caused by arterial submucosal collaterals due to idiopathic splenic artery thrombosis. The diagnosis was secured using <b>endoscopic</b> duplex <b>ultrasound</b> and angiography. The patient was successfully treated with a laparoscopic splenectomy and complete dissection of the short gastric arteries, resulting in the collapse of the submucosal arteries in the gastric wall. Follow-up gastroscopy was performed on the 12 th postoperative week and showed no signs of bleeding and a significant reduction in the arterial blood flow within the gastric wall. Subsequent follow-up after 6 months also showed no further gastrointestinal bleeding as well as subjective good quality of life for the patient. Conclusion Submucosal arterial collaterals must be excluded by endosonography via endoscopy in case of recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Laparoscopic splenectomy provides adequate treatment in preventing any recurrent bleeding, if gastric arterial collaterals are caused by splenic artery thrombosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract 】 The role {{of surgery}} in stage A-N 2 {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) remains controversial. Most {{important}} prognostic factors are mediastinal downstaging and complete surgical resection. Different restaging techniques exist to evaluate response after induction therapy {{and these are}} subdivided into non-invasive, invasive and alternative or minimally invasive techniques. In contrast to imaging or functional studies, remediastinoscopy provides pathological evidence of response after induction therapy. Although technically more challenging than a first procedure, remediastinoscopy can select patients for subsequent thoracotomy and provides prognostic information. An alternative approach consists of the use of minimally invasive staging procedures as endobronchial or <b>endoscopic</b> esophageal <b>ultrasound</b> to obtain an initial proof of mediastinal nodal involvement. Mediastinoscopy is subsequently performed after induction therapy to evaluate response. In this way, a technically more difficult remediastinoscopy can be avoided. Stage A-N 2 NSCLC represents a heterogenous spectrum of locally advanced disease and different subsets exist. When N 2 disease is discovered during thoracotomy after negative, careful preoperative staging a resection should be performed if this can be complete. Postoperative radiotherapy will decrease local recurrence rate but not overall survival. Adjuvant chemotherapy increases survival and is presently recommended in these cases. Most patients with pathologically proven N 2 disease detected during preoperative work-up will be treated by induction therapy followed by surgery or radiotherapy. In two large, recently completed, phase trials {{there was no difference in}} overall survival between the surgical an...|$|R
