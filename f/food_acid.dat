40|$|Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a spiral-shaped {{bacterium}} that {{is found}} in the gastric mucous layer or adherent to the epithelial lining of the stomach. H. pylori causes more than 90 % of duodenal ulcers and up to 80 % of gastric ulcers. Before 1982, when this bacterium was discovered, spicy <b>food,</b> <b>acid,</b> stress, and lifestyle were considered the major causes of ulcers. The majority of patients were given long-term medications, such as H 2 blockers, and more recently, proton pump inhibitors, without a chance for permanent cure. These medications relieve ulcer-related symptoms, heal gastric mucosal inflammation, and may heal the ulcer, but they do NOT treat the infection. When acid suppression is removed, the majority of ulcers, particularly those caused by H. pylori, recur. Since we now know that most ulcers are caused by H. pylori, appropriate antibiotic regimens can successfully eradicate the infection in most patients, with complete resolution of mucosal inflammation and a minimal chance for recurrence of ulcers. hpfacts. pd...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dental erosion is an {{increasingly}} prevalent problem associated with frequent consumption of acidic foods and beverages. The {{aim of this}} study was to measure the <b>food</b> <b>acid</b> content and the erosive potential of a variety of sugar-free confections. METHODS: Thirty sugar-free confections were selected and extracts analysed to determine pH, titratable acidity, chemical composition and apparent degree of saturation with respect to apatite. The effect of the sugar-free confections in artificial saliva on human enamel was determined in an in vitro dental erosion assay using change in surface microhardness. RESULTS: The change in surface microhardness was used to categorize the confections as high, moderate or low erosive potential. Seventeen of the 30 sugar-free confections were found to contain high concentrations of food acids, exhibit low pH and high titratable acidity and have high erosive potential. Significant correlations were found between the dental erosive potential (change in enamel surface microhardness) and pH and titratable acidity of the confections. Ten of these high erosive potential confections displayed dental messages on the packaging suggesting they were safe for teeth. CONCLUSIONS: Many sugar-free confections, even some with 'Toothfriendly' messages on the product label, contain high contents of food acids and have erosive potential. embarg...|$|E
40|$|Storing {{foods in}} the freezer {{is a great way}} to {{maintain}} their quality, freshness, and nutritional value. The recommended freezer temperature (0 degrees Fahrenheit) will keep food safe to eat indefinitely. Depending on the food, the color, flavor, and texture will eventually deteriorate. Be careful. Harmful bacteria are not killed by freezing temperatures and could begin to grow once the food is thawed. The Colder, the Better Freezers should be kept at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. There are a few extra things you can do in addition to turning down the dial to ensure a cold freezer. Keeping cool is all about air flow, so reduce the number of items {{in the freezer}} and add shelf space. This will allow the air to circulate in the freezer more efficiently for a more thorough freeze. Keep foods away from the back vent. Blocking this vent means blocking the air circulation and a warmer freezer. Packaging Remember these three rules when wrapping for freezer storage: wrap tightly, wrap again, and wrap individual portions separately. Wrapping tightly and double wrapping help to maintain quality and prevent freezer burn. Wrapping individual portions separately lets you remove some of the food to prepare without thawing food that is not needed for your meal. Use only moisture- and vapor-proof materials for storing solid foods. Good choices are polyethylene bags, freezer film wraps, and aluminum foil over a layer of plastic film next to the <b>food.</b> <b>Acid</b> foods may react to the aluminum if in direct contact.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{separate}} measurement of reflux of <b>food</b> and <b>acid</b> into the oesophagus in 37 healthy, ambulant subjects. This was performed by radiolabelling the food and monitoring its reflux with a small directional gamma detector, which was placed externally over the oesophagus, and connected to an ambulatory data recorder. The pH was measured with a conventional oesophageal pH electrode. This method permitted the separate characterisation of <b>acid</b> and neutral (<b>food)</b> components of gastro-oesophageal reflux. The gastric emptying characteristics of the test meal were also monitored by gamma scintigraphy in a separate experiment. The oesophageal pH fell below 4 for 3. 2 + 8. 6 /- 2. 3 % (mean (SD)) of the recording time. Food reflux alone occurred for 17. 8 + 53. 2 /- 13. 8 % of the recording time. Simultaneous <b>food</b> and <b>acid</b> reflux occurred for only 0. 95 + 5. 2 /- 1. 2 % of the time. Not every reflux event detected by a fall in pH was seen as an increase in counts as a result of reflux of food, and vice versa. This poor correlation of <b>food</b> and <b>acid</b> reflux implies incomplete mixing of <b>food</b> and <b>acid</b> in the stomach, and further shows the inadequacy of reflux diagnosis methods that depend on pH detection alone...|$|R

40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of a system based on Carnobacterium maltaromaticum and a colour change indicator, acid fuchsin (CAS number 3244 - 88 - 0, FCM Substance No 01033), used as a time-temperature indicator on the packaging of chilled food. The micro-organism, the indicator and a nutritive medium gel are incorporated in a multilayer plastic sachet glued onto the outer layer of the food package. All the substances constituting the system, {{with the exception of}} acid fuchsin, are authorised as food additives, food colorants or novel food ingredients, or are an enzymatic digest of edible protein sources and yeast edible extract. Specific migration of acid fuchsin was estimated to be less than 7 x 10 - 9 mg/kg <b>food.</b> <b>Acid</b> fuchsin elicited a positive response in a bacterial gene mutation assay and a negative response in an in vitro micronucleus assay. Given the lack of in vivo studies, the genotoxicity potential of acid fuchsin cannot be ruled out. However, the Panel noted that the layer of the plastic sachet in contact with food contact articles behaves as a barrier which prevents any release of its content (including acid fuchsin), and that the sachet is stuck onto the outer layer of the packaging, hence is not in contact with the food. Thus no exposure to the substances constituting the system from the consumption of the packed food is expected under the intended conditions of use. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the substances of the intelligent system, C. maltaromaticum and acid fuchsin, do not raise a safety concern for the consumer when used in a plastic sachet which prevents any migration from the system into food and which is stuck onto the outer layer of the packaging of chilled food...|$|E
40|$|We used {{microdialysis}} {{to monitor}} local gastrin release {{in response to}} <b>food,</b> <b>acid</b> blockade and acute vagal excitation. For the first time, gastrin release has been monitored continuously in intact conscious rats in a physiologically relevant experimental setting in a fashion that minimizes confounding systemic effects. Microdialysis probes {{were placed in the}} submucosa {{on either side of the}} antrum, 3 days before the experiments. The concentration of gastrin in the antral submucosal compartment was 5 - 10 times higher than in serum regardless of the prandial state. The rats were conscious during microdialysis except when subjected to electrical vagal stimulation. Acid blockade (omeprazole treatment of freely fed rats for 4 days), or bilateral sectioning of the abdominal vagal trunks (fasted rats), raised the gastrin concentration in blood as well as microdialysate. The high gastrin concentration following omeprazole treatment was not affected by vagotomy. Vagal excitation stimulated the G cells: electrical vagal stimulation and pylorus ligation (fasted rats) raised the gastrin concentration transiently in both serum and microdialysate. Food intake induced a 2 - to 3 -fold increase in serum gastrin, while gastrin in antral microdialysate increased 10 - to 15 -fold. In unilaterally vagotomized rats, food evoked a prompt peak gastrin release followed by a gradual decline on the intact side. On the vagotomized side of the antrum, the peak response seemed to be reduced while the microdialysate gastrin concentration remained elevated. Thus, unilateral vagotomy surprisingly raised the integrated gastrin response to food on the denervated side compared to the intact side, indicating that vagotomy suppresses an inhibitory as well as a stimulating effect on the G cells. While local infusion of atropine was without effect, infusion of the neuronal blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) (which had no effect on basal gastrin) virtually abolished the food-evoked gastrin response and lowered the high microdialysate gastrin concentration in omeprazole-treated rats by 65 %. We conclude that activated gastrin release, unlike basal gastrin release, is highly dependent on a neural input: 1) Vagal excitation has a transient stimulating effect on the G cells. The transient nature of the response suggests that the vagus has not only a prompt stimulatory but also a slow inhibitory effect on gastrin release. 2) Although vagal denervation did not affect the gastrin response to anacidity, the TTX experiments revealed that both food-evoked and anacidity-evoked gastrin release depends on neural input...|$|E
