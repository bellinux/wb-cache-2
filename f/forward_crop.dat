40|$|AbstractThe Corn Growing Degree Day (Corn GDD) tool is {{a web-based}} product {{that can provide}} {{decision}} support {{on a variety of}} issues throughout the entire growing season by integrating current conditions, historical climate data, and projections of Corn GDD {{through the end of the}} growing season based on both National Weather Service computer model forecasts and climatology. The Corn GDD tool can help agricultural producers make a variety of important decisions before and during the growing season. This support can include: assessing the risk of early and late frosts and freezes that can cause crop damage; comparing corn hybrid maturity requirements and Corn GDD projections to select seed varieties and plan activities such as spraying; guiding marketing decisions based on historical and projected Corn GDDs when considering <b>forward</b> <b>crop</b> pricing (i. e., futures market). The Corn GDD tool provides decision support for corn producers in the central U. S. corn-producing states. Survey results, web statistics, and user feedback indicate that this tool is being actively used by decision makers...|$|E

40|$|Few farmers utilize futures {{and options}} markets to price their crops despite {{significant}} educational efforts. This study seeks to analyze producer hedging behavior {{within the framework}} of the overall marketing behavior. Producer marketing behavior is modeled as a simultaneous choice between cash sales, cooperative marketing and forward contracts, and hedging. A multinomial logit model is used for empirical estimation using data from a survey administered to a sample of cotton producers from across the U. S. The most important factors that explain the use of forward pricing by cotton producers are producer preferences, farm size, use of crop insurance, risk aversion, income from government payments and off-farm income. Risk aversion, off-farm income, crop insurance and some producer perceptions are important in the choice of the form of forward pricing (direct hedging vs. cooperative marketing and <b>forward</b> contracts). <b>Crop</b> Production/Industries, Marketing,...|$|R
40|$|Full-face masks, worn by skilled {{actors in}} the Noh tradition, can induce a variety of {{perceived}} expressions with changes in head orientation. Out-of-plane rotation of the head changes the two-dimensional image characteristics of the face which viewers may misinterpret as non-rigid changes due to muscle action. Three experiments with Japanese and British viewers explored this effect. Experiment 1 confirmed a systematic relationship between vertical angle {{of view of a}} Noh mask and judged affect. A forward tilted mask was more often judged happy, and one backward tilted more often judged sad. This effect was moderated by culture. Japanese viewers ascribed happiness to the mask at greater degrees of backward tilt with a reversal towards sadness at extreme <b>forward</b> angles. <b>Cropping</b> the facial image of chin and upper head contour reduced the forward-tilt reversal. Finally, the relationship between head tilt and affect was replicated with a laser-scanned human face image, but with no cultural effect. Vertical orientation of the head changes the apparent disposition of facial features and viewers respond systematically to these changes. Culture moderates this effect, and we discuss how perceptual strategies for ascribing expression to familiar and unfamiliar images may account for the differences...|$|R
40|$|Crops {{are being}} genetically {{engineered}} {{to produce a}} wide variety of drugs, vaccines and other pharmaceutical proteins. Although these crops may open the door to less expensive and more-readily available drugs, there is concern regarding the potential for contamination of human food and livestock feed, as well as environmental harm. The outlook for the production of pharmaceutical crops in California currently appears mixed. To date, 18 federal permits for field trials involving pharmaceutical or industrial proteins have been approved in California. However, the state’s farming community and general public have thus far rejected pharmaceutical crop production, and a handful of local governments have recently banned the cultivation of genetically modified crops, including pharmaceutical crops. In light of the many pros and cons, three major approaches — the precautionary approach, risk analysis and cost-benefit analysis — could be used to move the debate about pharmaceutical <b>crops</b> <b>forward...</b>|$|R

In a tour on Guangzhou in April 1958, he openly criticized Mao, saying [...] "The Chairman talks {{all the time about}} more, faster, better, and more economical results. That is annoying. What does he want with chanting these liturgies all the time?" [...] On an inspection tour through Gansu in October 1958, Peng observed many of the problems associated with the Great Leap <b>Forward.</b> Mature <b>crops</b> were left to die in the field because all of the young men had been drafted to operate primitive backyard furnaces. When Peng asked an old peasant why no one was collecting the harvest, he received the answer: [...] "unless the centre sends down a great comrade, one cannot stand up against this storm." [...] On the same tour Peng heard complaints that household utensils were being melted down for [...] "steel", and that houses and orchards were cut and torn down in order to provide fuel for the backyard furnaces. In a subsequent tour through his native province of Hunan, later in 1958, Peng observed the same problems associated everywhere with the Great Leap Forward: serious food shortages; hungry children and babies; elders who expressed bitterness and anger; and arrogant, boasting Party cadres who administered local economic reforms. During his inspection tours through China in the fall of 1958, Peng composed a poem that summarized his attitude towards the Great Leap Forward: ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} of cell wall biology is the elucidation of the genes involved the cell wall and their function due to the recalcitrance of the cell wall. Through traditional genetic approaches, many simple yet elegant screens have been able to identify components of the cell wall and their networks. Despite progress in the identification of several genes of the cell wall, there remain many unknown players whose function has yet to be determined. Exhausting the genetic toolbox by performing secondary screens on a genetically mutated background, chemical genetics using small molecules and improved cell wall imaging hold promise for new gene discovery and function. With the recent introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies, it is now possible to quickly and efficiently map and clone genes of interest in Arabidopsis and any model organism with a completed genome sequence.

40|$|Crop {{germplasm}} {{resources are}} {{a key component of}} biodiversity, and can serve as a material basis for crop breeding and agroproduction. For a long time, ununified standards, widely-scattered germplasm storage, and weak information network infrastructure have restricted the sharing and utilization of crop germplasm resources in China. In order to overcome these problems, the concept and architecture of a program called the National Crop Germplasm Resources Infrastructure (NCGRI) were proposed. The NCGRI is a virtual organization which brings together crop germplasm resources from the national long-term genebank, the national duplicate genebank, the national medium-term genebank, the national field genebank, and the national germplasm information center. The principles and methods for establishing a technical standard system were elaborated. Complete with descriptor lists, a data dictionary, and data quality control standards, the group established a technical standard system for 110 crops. A protocol for sample sharing that is driven by information sharing was put <b>forward.</b> The national <b>crop</b> germplasm resources database with 390, 000 accessions and the Chinese Crop Germplasm Resources Information Network ([URL] were established as repositories. Finally five service-modes including routine service, field display services, targeted services, demand for services, and guide services were created...|$|R
40|$|Marketers rely {{on early}} and {{accurate}} yield forecasts to increase industry profitability by improved <b>forward</b> selling strategies. <b>Crop</b> forecasts are required 6 - 7 {{months prior to}} the commencement of harvest. These forecasts need to be updated regularly during the growing season. In this paper, we describe how crop growth models and remote sensing models can be used to provide Queensland Sugar Limited with yield forecast information. An assessment demonstrating how these approaches would have performed in 2 ̆ 7 forecast mode 2 ̆ 7 using historical yields for the Mackay terminal region is presented. Each method has varied strengths and weaknesses. For this region, the remote sensing model has produced more accurate yield forecasts than the crop growth model. However, the remote sensing model cannot be used until later in the growing season. Conversely, an advantage of the crop growth model is that it can be utilized much earlier in the season when marketers have more flexibility in planning. While these desktop models are still under development, and need to be benchmarked against forecasts that have been provided historically by industry, the crop and remote sensing models offer marketers advance knowledge {{about the size of the}} forthcoming crop. This information is invaluable to marketers who manage the forward sales of sugar...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} alternative {{risk management}} strategies {{in terms of}} their effectiveness for three representative Alberta farm operations. Stochastic dynamic simulation methods are used to model financial performance for these farms, and alternative risk management programs are compared {{in terms of their}} ability to stabilize returns, support income and reduce the probability of bankruptcy. The results suggest that government programs such as the Net Income Stabilization Account (NISA) program or the Farm Income Disaster Program (FIDP) in Alberta have some benefits in terms of supporting income levels and reducing the chances of farm failure. Neither program is very effective, however, in stabilizing year to year income or cash flow for the farm operations. As a risk management program, FIDP is more effective than NISA but this improved performance comes at the price of higher government costs. Performance of NISA and FIDP, relative to alternative risk management programs and strategies such as <b>forward</b> contracting or <b>crop</b> insurance, is mixed. In some cases, NISA does not seem to provide benefits beyond those available from other strategies, while FIDP tends to perform better than the alternatives. Finally, while increased debt load weakens firm financial performance, NISA and FIDP still provide some benefits in terms of supporting income and reducing the probability of bankruptcy.

40|$|Based on the {{summarization}} of {{the status}} quo of the research both at home and abroad, the changing trend of the production of the main grain crops, covering the planting structure, seed structure and the trend of the per unit yields of garlic are analyzed. According to the comparative advantage theory, the comprehensive comparative advantages indices, which have been revised, can be used as the main research methods. By using the relevant data from 2000 to 2006, the scale comparative advantage, the efficient comparative advantage and the comprehensive comparative advantages of the main grain crops (wheat, millet, corn, soybean, rice and tuber crops) in each city of Henan Province are measured. The results show that among the main grain crops in Henan Province, only the wheat and the corn have comparative advantages; rice, corn, soybean and potatoes all do not have the scale advantages; the wheat, millet and the potatoes have obvious efficiency advantages while rice, corn and soybean have relatively weak efficiency advantages; wheat and corn have comprehensive comparative advantages, while rich, millet, soy bean and potatoes do not have the comprehensive comparative advantages. Combining with the current specific situation of Henan Province, the general situation faced by the production of main grain crops in Henan Province is analyzed specifically.

40|$|Transgenic cottons {{producing}} Cry toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{provide for}} control of lepidopteran pests and were first commercially grown in Australia, Mexico and the USA in 1996. As of 2007, {{a total of six}} additional countries (Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, India, and South Africa) now grow Bt cotton on a total production area of 14 million hectares. The technology primarily provides highly selective and effective control of bollworms, which are the most damaging pests of cotton worldwide. It is estimated that between 1996 and 2005 the deployment of Bt cotton has reduced the volume of insecticide active ingredient used for pest control in cotton by 94. 5 million kilograms and increased farm income through reduced costs and improved yields by US$ 7. 5 billion, with most of the benefit accrued by farmers in developing nations. Reductions in insecticide use have broadened opportunities for biological control of all cotton pests but most other pest management tactics have remained largely unchanged by the use of Bt cotton. However, several non-target pests have become more problematic in Bt cotton fields in some countries largely due to reductions in insecticide use for target pests. After 11 years of Bt cotton cultivation, control failures due to resistance have not been detected under field conditions. This success can be largely credited to pre-emptive resistance management based on mandated refuges and monitoring programs as well as non-mandated refuge crops and natural refuges which collectively act to dilute any resistant alleles in pest populations. New products are in the pipeline to improve the effectiveness of genetically modified cotton cultivars for resistance to lepidopteran pests, and to address other pest problems in cotton. Debate over food and environmental safety, regulatory oversight, and farming community welfare are likely to continue as the technology moves <b>forward</b> with new <b>crops</b> and new adopting countries...|$|R
40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Crop {{nitrogen}} {{status is}} a major issue for crop yield and quality. It is usually assessed by destructive leaf or petiole tissue analysis. A quantitative nondestructive optical estimation of N sufficiency {{would be a great}} leap <b>forward</b> toward precision <b>crop</b> management. We therefore calibrated three optical indices against leaf nitrogen content: chlorophyll (Chl), epidermal flavonols, and the nitrogen balance index (NBI), which is the ratio of the former two indices. NBI was the best estimator of leaf N content measured by the Dumas or Kjeldahl method with a root-mean-square error smaller than 2 mg of N g− 1 dry weight, followed by Chl (3 mg g− 1) and flavonols (4 mg g− 1). This allowed us to propose the threshold values for the Dualex optical indices that characterize nitrogen supply to grapevines: the first is the threshold below which N supply to the vine can be considered deficient, and the second is the threshold above which N supply is excessive. For a putative optimal N content of 30 mg g− 1 < x < 40 mg g− 1, these thresholds are 30 μg cm− 2 < x < 40 μg cm− 2 for Chl and 11 < x < 18 for NBI at flowering. At bunch closure, for N thresholds of 22 < x < 32, Chl is 29 < x < 37 and NBI is 8 < x < 11, in respective units. These values should be verified and refined in the future for various growth regions and cultivars using the specified protocol. The sample size should be 36 − 60 leaves from a fixed node position, preferably node no. 5 from the tip of the shoot. An alternative {{to the use of the}} NBI would be to discard leaves that are not light exposed by checking their flavonol content and to deduce the N sufficiency directl...|$|R
40|$|The rice-wheat {{cropping}} {{systems of the}} Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) are of immense importance for food security for south Asia. Over the past 40 years the increase in rice and wheat production has kept pace with population growth due to improved varieties, increased inputs, especially fertilisers, {{and the expansion of}} irrigation. However yield stagnation, and possibly yield decline, water scarcity, and water and air pollution are major threats to the sustainability of rice-wheat systems and food security. Therefore the design and implementation of alternative production systems with increased resource use efficiency (especially water) and productivity and reduced adverse environmental impact are urgently required. Bed farming, practised for several decades for crops other than rice in Australia, Mexico and elsewhere, was introduced to the rice-wheat regions of the IGP in the mid 1990 s. Farmer experience and research have shown that bed farming offers significant advantages for productivity and resource use efficiency for wheat and other non-rice crops. More recently, attention has focused on the possibility of also growing rice on beds in the IGP and Australia, with the associated potential benefits of permanent bed systems including reduced land preparation costs and turn around times, increased cropping flexibility, and increased productivity of “upland” crops grown in rotation with rice due to improved drainage and soil structure and improved rotations. The radical shift from ponded rice culture on the flat (with or without puddling and transplanting) to intermittently flooded bed layouts affects a host of interacting factors influencing productivity and resource use efficiency of both rice and crops grown in rotation with rice. These factors range from weeds to nutrient availability to pests and diseases to water dynamics to stubble management options. The potential benefits and disadvantages of permanent bed systems need to be quantified under a range of agroecological conditions, and optimum layouts and management systems need to be identified to maximise potential gains. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) is funding a major new project LWR 2 / 2000 / 89 Permanent beds for rice-wheat and alternative {{cropping systems}} in north west India and south east Australia. This is a collaborative project between Punjab Agricultural University, CSIRO Land and Water and NSW Agriculture, with additional support from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA/FAO) for the work in India, and additional support for the work in Australia from the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation (RIRDC) Rice program, the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) and Coleambally Irrigation Cooperative Ltd and Murray Irrigation Ltd. The major part of the project comprises field comparison of permanent bed and traditional layouts for rice-based cropping systems in Punjab, India and NSW, Australia, with detailed monitoring, in particular focusing on crop growth and development, water and nitrogen dynamics and balances, and options for stubble management. The project also seeks to further develop and refine models for rice-wheat and alternative systems, and apply them to evaluate permanent bed and traditional layouts for a range of agroecological environments, and to identify options for maximizing resource use efficiency and productivity of rice-wheat cropping systems in India, and rice-based cropping systems in Australia. Therefore an early activity in the project vi was a workshop bringing together a small group of international scientists leading in the development and application of crop models including the modelling of crop sequences and twodimensional approaches. The objectives of the workshop were: 1. to review {{the state of the art}} in the modelling irrigated cropping systems (crop sequences as opposed to single crops) and bed geometries (as opposed to “flat” layouts) 2. to workshop conceptualizations of the ways <b>forward</b> in modelling <b>crop</b> sequences and bed layouts, and with particular attention to rice-wheat systems 3. to establish a network of contacts working in these areas to share progress and problems in the future...|$|R
