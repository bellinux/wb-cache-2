5000|$|The {{court in}} People v. Edmonson (1930) also denied claims to an {{apparent}} case of group libel. In this case, {{the defendant was}} accused of libel towards the Jewish community. The judge sided with the defendant, writing that “...such an indictment cannot be sustained under the laws of this State, and that no such indictment as one based upon <b>defamatory</b> <b>matter</b> directed against a group or community so large as [...] "all persons of the Jewish Religion" [...] has ever been sustained in {{this or any other}} jurisdiction.” The judge further said that “when one realizes how many forms of religion might consider themselves libeled and seek legal redress, where our laws so extended, and when we reflect on how our courts might, in such event, find themselves forced into the position of arbiters of religious truth, it is apparent that more would be lost than could be gained by attempting to protect the good name of a religion by an appeal to the criminal law”. In this case, the judge finds that it would be unreasonable to expect courts to take on the responsibility of deciding whether statements towards a religion should or should or should not be considered libel. Though group libel generally favored the Osborne holding prior to the Beauharnais case, there is also a well documented record of United States courts taking a position which more closely resembles that of the Orme and Nutt holding.|$|E
40|$|For {{those who}} {{have never heard of}} calumny and are not sure of the {{difference}} between libel and slander this article explains the basics of defamation. Defamation is a situation in which one person damages another person 2 ̆ 7 s reputation by communicating, in words, writing, photos, video and the like, material about that person. The person whose reputation has been attacked, called the plaintiff, may commence legal proceedings against the 2 ̆ 7 attacker 2 ̆ 7, called the defendant, in order to recover damages and to retrain that person from further attack. The object of defamation law is to balance freedom of expression with the protection of reputation, and to provide effective and fair remedies for persons whose reputations have bee harmed by the publication of <b>defamatory</b> <b>matter.</b> While both civil and criminal defamation exist, civil defamation is the most common and is more relevant for schools. The article discusses how defamation arises; who can sue and be sued for defamation; and defences. The authors conclude that the best strategy for a school is to vigilantly review all material it publishes and act promptly if it is ever made aware of a potentially defamatory situation.

40|$|There {{are many}} ways to damage a reputation. The most obvious way is by words, written or spoken — libel or slander. Centuries of case law, however, {{disclose}} that defamation defendants have been endlessly inventive about the means by which they damage a plaintiff’s reputation. In Falkenberg v Nationwide News Pty Ltd, a married couple in the Sydney suburb of Leichhardt complained about a ‘Far Side’ cartoon published in The Daily Telegraph Mirror, which included their actual home telephone number as the relevant, fictitious one to contact Satan. In Bishop v State of New South Wales, a schoolteacher complained about a theatrical performance by school students suggesting that he was in a sexual relationship with a colleague. In Monson v Tussauds Ltd, the plaintiff, a man against whom a verdict of ‘not proven’ had been returned in a Scottish murder trial, complained about a waxwork dummy of himself, which was on display in the ‘Chamber of Horrors’ in the famous London waxworks, Madame Tussauds, alongside convicted murderers.

40|$|The {{concept of}} ‘publication’, which {{is central to}} {{establishing}} liability in defamation, is conceptually uncertain as to its definition and scope. The uncertainties have been brought into sharp relief in the proliferation of cases concerning the internet. Such cases demonstrate the potentially wide application of ‘publication’ and the inconsistencies as to its meaning. Although these difficulties have long existed, until they are resolved, {{we will continue to}} struggle to apply the concept of ‘publication’, be {{it in the context of}} new or ‘old’ fact-patterns. This article considers the uncertain parameters of the concept of ‘publication’ and, in particular, the relevance of knowledge of the content of the defamatory material in establishing such ‘publication’. One of the problems raised by a wide definition of publication is that it puts pressure on defences to relieve innocent parties from liability, especially parties who have had only a peripheral involvement in the commission of the tort. The article argues that the law of defamation has largely sidelined an analysis of liability of such peripheral players in terms of established concepts of accessorial liability. Recent cases involving internet providers have used the concept of knowledge as one means of restricting the meaning of ‘publication’, thereby providing greater protection to parties who are merely peripheral participants in the communication of <b>defamatory</b> <b>matter...</b>|$|E
40|$|The High Court has {{clarified}} {{the law of}} defamation, writes Tessa Meyrick in High Court Watch, {{the first}} in a new series of monthly reports on significant policy-related cases LIKE THE NOTION of “free speech," which it is often pitched against, defamation is an elusive concept, and one that the High Court has recently made small, but helpful, steps to clarify. In Radio 2 UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton [2009] HCA 16, the Court departed from its earlier decision in John Fairfax Publications v Gacic [2007] HCA 28 regarding the distinction between personal defamation and business defamation. Gacic had been widely criticised for broadening and, in doing so, complicating the law dealing with claims of damage to a person’s business, trade or professional reputation. At common law, statements will generally be held to be defamatory if the jury believes that the words expressed tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of the public. In practice, this test asks the jury to assess whether the hypothetical referee, whose standards are taken to reflect those of the general community, would conclude that the statements tended to injure the plaintiff’s reputation. The plaintiffs in both Radio 2 UE and Gacic argued that they had been defamed in a professional, rather than (or, as well as) a personal, capacity. The distinction between these two species of defamation was neatly illustrated by Chief Justice Gleeson and Justice Crennan in Gacic. Their Honours provided the example of someone saying: “X is a thoroughly decent person, but he is showing signs of age; his eyesight is poor, and his hands tremble. ” When tested against “general community standards,” such a statement is unlikely to reflect badly on X’s character, nor is it likely to invoke hatred, ridicule or contempt. If X were a surgeon, however, the assessment is quite different. To say that X is an incompetent surgeon, even if he is a very nice one, is clearly likely to damage his professional reputation. Because injuries to a person’s professional reputation may have little, if any, bearing on their moral character, the question arises as to whether it is appropriate that the jury assess a claim of business defamation in accordance with “general community standards” and, if it is not, what standard they ought to apply. In this most recent decision, the High Court reinstated the position (briefly abandoned in the earlier case of Gacic) that the general community standards test should apply regardless of the type of defamation alleged. The Gacic decision The plaintiffs in Gacic were owners of Coco Roco, a restaurant in Sydney that {{was the subject of a}} particularly negative review published in the Sydney Morning Herald. The Gacics brought proceedings against both the newspaper and the restaurant reviewer, arguing specifically that the imputations conveyed in the review constituted business (and not personal or character) defamation. At the first trial, the jury returned a verdict that two of the four imputations alleged had not been made out and that the other two, while made out, were not defamatory anyway.   The Gacics appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal and won. And they won again when the same court rejected a subsequent appeal by the newspaper, finding that no reasonable jury, properly directed, could reach any verdict other than that the imputations were both made out and defamatory. In effect, the Court of Appeal substituted its own verdict for that of the original jury. When the newspaper appealed again, the High Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s ruling, finding it to be an appropriate exercise of its power to correct unreasonable jury verdicts. In reaching this decision the Court was called upon to consider whether the jury had in fact been misdirected as to the appropriate test to be applied in cases of business defamation. Somewhat controversially, and without a great deal of clarity, the majority of the court tended towards the view that the application of “general community standards” may be inappropriate in cases of business defamation. In some cases, for example, it may be more suitable to apply the standard of persons having particular knowledge of the business in question. There may even be occasions where the mere tendency to injure the plaintiff in his business, trade or profession would be sufficient. The reaction to Gacic, particularly amongst journalists and publishers, was remarkably hostile. There was concern that, by broadening the test for business defamation (in combination with the power of the judiciary to overturn jury decisions) the High Court had created uncertainty with respect to future business defamation actions and demonstrated a complete disregard for the general community standards embodied by the jury. While it is easy to overstate the capacity of Gacic to open the gates for vexatious claims of business defamation - just as it is easy to scaremonger publishers into believing that the Court will overturn without hesitation any jury decision it does not like - it is fair to say that the decision left most people confused as to whether business defamation constituted a separate species of defamation and what, if any, standards need to be applied. The decision in Radio 2 UE, handed down by the High Court in April, provides well-timed relief in this regard. Background to Radio 2 UE Radio 2 UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton was borne out of comments made by John Laws on his Radio 2 UE morning program concerning the Ray Chesterton, a journalist with The Telegraph at the time. In a not uncharacteristic outburst, Laws made a number of personal and professional stabs at Chesterton, claiming that he was, amongst other things, a “bombastic, beer-bellied buffoon” and that he had been fired from Radio 2 UE and had wrongly blamed Laws for his dismissal. Chesterton argued that a number of defamatory imputations had been conveyed during the broadcast. Namely, that Chesterton: (a)     is a creep in that he is an unpleasant and repellent person; (b)     is a bombastic, beer-bellied buffoon; (c)     as a journalist, is not to be taken seriously; (d)     was fired from radio 2 UE; (e)     falsely accuses Laws of being responsible for his dismissal from Radio 2 UE; (f)     is an ungrateful person in that he accepted the hospitality of Laws and then attacked him.     Proceedings were brought against Radio 2 UE alleging that these comments were defamatory in that they conveyed imputations that injured his reputation, either with respect to his character generally or, in the cases of imputations (b), (c) and (d), in his capacity as a journalist. At the trial, the jury found in his favour with respect to all imputations, but Radio 2 UE appealed to the Court of Appeal, and then again to the High Court. In argument, Radio 2 UE contended that the trial judge, who relied on the test for business defamation laid out in Gacic, misdirected the jury as to how they were to assess whether the imputations were defamatory. This provided the High Court with a much-needed opportunity to revisit and clarify the legal significance of the distinction between personal and business defamation. The decision Ultimately, the High Court departed from Gacic on the ground that the earlier judgment “assumed, incorrectly, that the relevant injury was that to the plantiffs’ business, not to their reputation,” an assumption that puts undue emphasis on mere economic loss and essentially renders the application of general community standards redundant. In other words, the general test for defamation of community standards should be applied to all imputations which are said to injured a person’s reputation in some respect, irrespective of whether these imputations speak to a person’s moral character or to their competency in their chosen profession. The Radio 2 UE case is not just significant because it largely rejects the reasoning in Gacic, but because it adds considerably to our understanding of the underpinnings of defamation law more generally. The reasoning of Chief Justice French, and Justices Gummow, Kiefel and Bell in particular makes clear how central the concept of reputation is to both instances of defamation. Their Honours point out that “the common law recognises that people have an interest in their reputation and that their reputation may be damaged by the publication of <b>defamatory</b> <b>matter</b> about them to others’. As such, a successful claim of defamation “operates as a vindication of the plaintiff to the public, as well as a consolation. ” This relationship between the plaintiff and the public or, specifically, the esteem in which the public holds the plaintiff, necessarily feeds into the test that is to be applied. With the concept of reputation as the central focus, it is clear that the application of “general community standards” does not in all cases imply an exercise of moral judgment or an assessment of a person’s personal character. As the majority in this case argued, the concept of reputation “comprehends all aspects of a person’s standing in the community” including, as with Chesterton, one’s standing in their capacity as a journalist. • Tessa Meyrick is researcher with the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law at the University of New South Wales Photo: Linda & Colin McKie/ iStockphoto. co...|$|E
