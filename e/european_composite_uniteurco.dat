With accounts of the pays d'etat of Burgundy (Julian Swann) and Languedoc (Stephen J.

40|$|The French pig {{breeding}} organisation ADN {{has been developing}} since 2001 the Chinese <b>European</b> <b>composite</b> line Duochan (25 % Meishan, 25 % French Landrace, 50 % Large White). In order to set up marker assisted selection in the Duochan line, molecular screening was conducted (1) to confirm the effects of QTL identified in the INRA PorQTL (MS x LW) experimental design and (2) to seek for additional chromosomal regions influencing production and reproduction traits included in the breeding goal. Firstly, two groups of 30 individuals, representing the line at its foundation and after two generations of selection, were genotyped using the pig 60 K SNP chip to identify regions of the genome that {{have been affected by}} selection or drift. In a second step, a set of 384 SNPs tagging these candidate regions was established to test associations between markers and performances of 480 animals born between 2003 and 2006. Each selected animal had a CD (coefficient of determination) greater than 0. 25 for a global breeding value combining growth, carcass and reproduction traits). QTLs (Quantitative Trait Loci) were detected in 16 different chromosomal regions. Some of these regions simultaneously affected production and reproduction traits.

40|$|The {{awareness}} of the environmental impact of the building sector is increasing. Steel reinforced concrete is the most commonly used construction material, though with a high-embodied energy and carbon footprint. Large environmental gains may arise if an alternative to steel reinforced concrete is developed. In this context, ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) materials are shown to be promising alternatives with advantages such as lower embodied energy and reduced environmental impact. Predictions suggest that UHPC composite elements for building envelopes could have other benefits such as an increased service life, optimised use of building area due to thinner elements and minimised maintenance due to the absence of reinforcement or use of non-corrosive reinforcing materials such as carbon fibres. In the framework of the H-HOUSE project funded by the <b>European</b> Commission, <b>composite</b> elements are developed.
