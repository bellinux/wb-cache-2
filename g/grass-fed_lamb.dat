40|$|There {{is strong}} {{interest}} in sustainably produced meat. <b>Grass-fed</b> <b>lamb</b> could fulfill this market by reducing off-farm inputs. The objective {{was to examine the}} effect of grass-finishing or minimal supplementation on performance of lambs in the southeastern US. Katahdin lambs born in October 2013 and 2014 and February 2014 were weaned in January 2014 / 2015 and May 2014, respectively. Lambs were blocked by gender (fall; winter included only ram lambs) and randomly assigned to receive no (NON) or grain co-product supplement (SUP; 15...|$|E
30|$|Critics {{of these}} kinds of {{initiatives}} acknowledge the co-benefits but note that “local food” may have a higher carbon footprint than food imported over much longer distances. For example, <b>grass-fed</b> <b>lamb</b> shipped to London from New Zealand may have a lower energy input per pound of meat than grain-fed lamb raised in England and trucked to farmers’ markets [65]. Vegetables carried to New York in the winter from California in large refrigerated trucks may have a lower energy input or carbon footprint per pound of vegetables than greenhouse vegetables carried to farmers’ markets in New York in small trucks from rural areas within New York state. However, such critiques miss the main point: in the fossil fuel-deprived future, there will simply be no possibility of transporting California vegetables to New York, or New Zealand lamb to London. Most food consumed in the city will have to be local, and apart from storable food, seasonal.|$|E
40|$|Thirty 7 -month-old {{crossbred}} lambs (Poll Dorset Border Leicester Merino) finished over 5 {{weeks on}} either low quality pasture or grain-with-hay {{on a farm}} in southern Victoria were assessed for carcass parameters, muscle fat composition and retail colour stability. Lambs on the grain diet had a mix of barley grain (80 %) and lentils (20 %) at 800 g/head. day (air-dry basis ∼ad libitum) with cape weed (Arctotheca calendula) hay available at all times. Lambs under grazing had predominantly rye grass (Lolium perenne) and barley grass (Hordeum leporinum) available ad libitum. Carcass weight tended to be higher (P ≤ 0. 14) in grain-fed lambs than in grass-fed lambs, but fatness indicated by GR (total muscle + fat tissue thickness at 11 cm from midline) did not differ between feeding systems. Fatty acid composition was determined in the loin from the forequarter (M. longissimus thoracis) and lumbar (M. longissimus lumborum) regions and from the leg region (M. semimembranosus). This showed that grain-finished lamb had higher muscle fat (P 0. 001) and omega- 6 fatty acid (P 0. 001) content. Alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or total omega- 3 fat did not differ (P 0. 05) between feeding groups. Saturated fatty acids were greater (P 0. 01) in both loin sampling sites than the leg. The levels of EPA, docosahexaenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid were lower (P 0. 01) in the forequarter (9 %) or lumbar (11 %) sites than the leg sampling site. The distribution pattern of fatty acids across the three sampling sites did not differ between feed types. Retail colour stability determined over 4 days of display (only performed in muscle from the lumbar site), evaluated by the redness (HunterLab a*-value) and metmyoglobin formation (reflectance ratio at 630 : 580 -nm wavelengths) was superior for <b>grass-fed</b> <b>lamb</b> compared with short-term grain-finished lamb. The results demonstrate that the health claimable omega- 3 fat mainly EPA or total omega- 3 fat content in lamb was not altered by short-term grain finishing compared with lamb finished under pasture grazing conditions...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen lambs {{were divided}} into two groups and fed two {{different}} diets. Eight lambs were stall-fed with a concentrate-based diet (C), and the remaining eight lambs were allowed to graze on Lolium perenne (G). The antioxidant status was measured in the liver and plasma samples before and after solid-phase extraction (SPE) to probe the antioxidant effects that grass phenolic compounds may have conferred onto the animal tissues. The liver and plasma samples from <b>grass-fed</b> <b>lambs</b> displayed a greater antioxidant capacity than the tissues from C lamb group, but only if samples had not been passed through SPE cartridges. Finally, the feed and animal tissues, which had been purified by SPE, were analysed by liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to identify phenolic compounds present in L. perenne and to evaluate the results from the antioxidant assays. It would appear that the improvement of the antioxidant capacity of lamb liver and plasma from lambs fed ryegrass was not related to the direct transfer of phenolic compounds from grass to the animal tissues...|$|R
40|$|The {{specification}} of ‘Organic Farming’ on a product gives guarantees {{on the way}} is has been produced, but does not give any guarantees on his quality. There is however, an increased consumer demand concerning the products quality in organic farming. The aim of this project is to compare the quality of lamb meat produced under an organic system vs a conventional system. The comparison will concern the sensorial and nutritional qualities. Another aim will concern the ability of some methodologies {{to be used to}} trace the production system (organic vs conventional) on the product or the animal. The experimental design is : -Comparison of male Limousin house-fed lambs produced under organic (12 lambs) vs conventional (12 lambs) farming. These lambs are fed with concentrate and hay indoors. The feeds are produced under organic vs conventional farming for the organic vs conventional treatments respectively, but the composition of the concentrate is similar as far as raw material is concerned. -Comparison of male Limousin <b>grass-fed</b> <b>lambs</b> produced under organic (12 lambs) vs conventional (12 lambs) farming. These lambs are fed exclusively grass at pasture. The pastures are fertilized with 100 kg N/ha in the conventional treatment vs no N/ha in the organic treatment. It is likely that the sward and diet composition (proportion of legumes particularly) will be different between the organic and the conventional treatment. To study the effect of production system sensu stricto and avoid potential bias, lamb growth rate is maintained at the same level in both systems. -Measurement of the sensorial quality of the meat (longissimus dorsi) and carcass : Panellists session for juiciness, tenderness, flavour of chops. Colour of the meat and the fat and its evolution during maturation (spectrocolorimetry, lipid oxidation). Composition of the meat (DM, proteins, lipids, heminic pigment, soluble and insoluble collagen). -Measurement of the nutritional quality of the meat (longissimus dorsi) : Antioxydant level (Vit E), malonedialdehyde content, Vit B 12 level -Measurement of the traceability of the production system (on different tissues and fluids: perirenal and subcutaneous fat, longissimus dorsi, plasma) : Near infrared spectroscopy, spectrocolorimetry, fluorescence analyses...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{evidenced}} {{significant differences in}} the carcass and meat quality of <b>grass-fed</b> and concentrate-fed <b>lambs.</b> The main differences regard carcass fatness (Murphy et al., 1994), subcutaneous fat colour (Prache and Theriez, 1999), meat colour (Priolo et al., 2002 a) and fatty acid composition (Enser et al., 1998). The use of grazing in lamb feeding favours the presence of substances in the meat which are beneficial to human health. Different methods, based on the spectrophotometric properties of fat have been proposed to verify the origin of the product (Priolo et al., 2002 b). The objective of the present study is to verify if and to what extent the carcass quality of suckling lambs is affected by ewe feeding systems...|$|R
40|$|Leguminous {{fodder crops}} such as lucerne contain {{oestrogenic}} substances and their precursors that may interfere with reproduction in sheep. There is no definite information about the actual levels of oestrogenicity of New Zealand lucerne crops and {{the magnitude of the}} effect that they have on the reproduction of sheep. There is no information about when a crop may be unsafe for ewes to graze just prior to mating and a simple measurement of sheep is needed to provide an alert so sheep farmers can move sheep off a crop or leave them on knowing {{that there will be no}} deleterious effects on subsequent lambing performance. The sheep farm study was an incidental finding from a farmer who noticed udder development in pre-pubertal (25 - 28 weeks of age) lambs (n = 22) grazing lucerne (oestrogenicity ranging from 98. 6 – 149. 6 µg oestradiol equivalent/kg DM) compared with lambs grazing grass (n = 36) that showed no udder development. Differences in teat length, teat width, mammary development and vulva colour were measured on two occasions – straight after grazing oestrogenic lucerne (12 March) and 35 days later (16 April), 4 weeks after the removal from the lucerne crop. The experimental study was designed to provide a reference calibration with known dosage of an oestrogen. For this 12 Coopworth ewes (42 - 44 weeks of age) were randomly assigned to one of three treatments (n = 4, per treatment) : 0, 0, 1, 1. 0 mg β-oestradiol every 3 days for 40 days. Measurements of teat length, teat width and mammary development was measured every 6 days and, on day 41, the ewes were killed and vulva colour, mammary weight, ovary weight and uterus weight were measured and the number of follicles and corpora lutea were counted. In both studies photographs of the mammary region were taken to provide an alternative measurement technique to use of calipers. Results of the sheep farm study showed lambs grazing oestrogenic lucerne were heavier, had longer teat lengths (2. 1 mm difference), with larger teat widths (4. 63 mm difference) than sheep grazing grass and mammary development (in 14 out of 25 lambs grazing lucerne) had occurred. There was no change in vulva colour. After removal from lucerne there was a slight reduction in the oestrogen-related changes and the <b>grass-fed</b> <b>lambs</b> had experienced some mammary/teat development in the intervening period. In the experimental trial, there were dose-related effects on the live weight, teat length, mammary development, uterus weight, ovary weight and mammary weight. There were no changes in teat width, vulva redness or colour saturation, numbers of ovarian follicles and there were no corpora lutea present. Measurements taken from photographs provided reliable information about mammary/teat dimensions. Although the pre-pubertal lambs grazing lucerne were receiving less oestradiol equivalent daily than the older ewes supplied with known amounts of oestradiol (181. 2 – 274. 9 µg oestradiol equivalent versus 333. 3 µg oestradiol per day, respectively), they showed a greater sensitivity to this hormonal stimulus than was exhibited by the pubertal ewes...|$|R
