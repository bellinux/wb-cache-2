5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have {{also been shown to}} biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E

5|$|Zinfandel vines {{are quite}} {{vigorous}} and grow best in climates that are warm {{but not too}} hot, because grapes may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel's thin-skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot. The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, the grapes may be late-harvested to make dessert wine. Zinfandel is often praised <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> reflect both its terroir and its winemaker's style and skill.|$|E
5|$|Games in {{the series}} have been praised as being among the best modern {{role-playing}} games.

The games also won awards from several gaming publications. In March 2014, Bandai Namco reported that the series had sold more than 1.7 million copies worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Interspecies roosts {{have been}} {{observed}} between different bird species. In San Blas, Mexico, the great egret (Ardea alba), the little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), the tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor), and the snowy egret (Egretta thula) are known to form large communal roosts. It {{has been shown that}} the snowy egret determines the general location of the roost {{due to the fact that}} the other three species rely on it <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> find food sources. In these roosts there is often a hierarchical system, where the more dominant species (in this case the snowy egret) will typically occupy the more desirable higher perches. Interspecies roosts have also been observed among other avian species.|$|R

50|$|The Hummer H2 is an SUV and SUT {{that was}} marketed by Hummer and built by AM General from 2002 to 2009.

The rearmost part of the H2 SUV was modified to a pickup truck bed for the 2005 H2 SUT ("sport utility truck"). The Hummer H2 {{was the only one}} of the trucks to have the letters HUMMER between the grille. The H2 SUT is considered a pick-up truck <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> haul cargo with an extendable box to reach 6 feet in length.

5|$|Nolan North, {{the voice}} actor who played Drake, {{had a large}} role in {{defining}} the character's physical and vocal reactions. In the Uncharted series, the actors were used for motion capture, and acted as if performing in a movie. Motion capture was done on a soundstage, and the dialog recorded during this process was used in the game. North was allowed to ad-lib dialog and insert aspects of his own personality into the character. In naming the character, the development team considered many different choices, including Ethan, Samuel, and John. Matthew Drake was seriously contemplated, but received a poor reaction from those it was presented to. Eventually, Naughty Dog settled on the name Nathan <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> be shortened to Nate, and the perception that it sounded historical. Drake's character design changed little between Drake's Fortune and Among Thieves.|$|E
5|$|The NS-10 {{displaced}} the Auratone 5C Sound Cube as the nearfield monitor {{of choice}} in the 1980s and was recognised <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> reveal shortcomings in recordings. It probably first reached American shores through a recording engineer's visit to Japan. The engineer, {{likely to have been}} Greg Ladanyi, monitored a recording session through the speaker in a Japanese studio and brought a pair back on his return to the US. Ladanyi then began using the speakers in a Los Angeles studio. Other engineers heard the NS-10 {{for the first time and}} were impressed by its sound. Its use spread to New York where the NS-10 was adopted at The Power Station and other studios.|$|E

He married Margaret Helen Chrystal on 5January 1946; they had {{a son and a}} daughter. Promoted to acting air commodore on 1March, he was appointed SASO of the British Commonwealth Air Group (BCAIR), headquartered in Kure and responsible for No.81 Wing RAAF, as well as squadrons from the Royal Air Force, Royal New Zealand Air Force, and Indian Air Force. Returning to Australia in 1948, he served as Air Commodore Operations at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, at which time the English Electric Canberra was ordered as Australia's first jet bomber, partly <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> deliver nuclear weapons. He completed his term in September 1951 and took over North-Eastern Area Command, based at Townsville, Queensland. Following his appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year's Honours, McLachlan was posted to Britain for three years, first attending the Imperial Defence College, London, and then serving as RAF Director of Flying Training at the Air Ministry during 1955–56.
