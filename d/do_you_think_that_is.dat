6000|$|Now, my dear friends, {{let me ask}} you as {{reasonable}} beings, <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> hearing me or any man preach, {{can save}} your souls alive? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> sitting over a book for an hour a day, or all day long, will save your souls alive? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your sins are washed away in Christ's blood, when they are there still, and you are committing them? Would they be here, and <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> them, if they were put away? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your sins can be put away out of God's sight, if they are not even put out of your own sight? If <b>you</b> are <b>doing</b> wrong, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> God will treat you as if <b>you</b> were <b>doing</b> right? Cannot God see in you what you see in yourselves? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a man can be clothed in Christ's righteousness at the very same time that he is clothed in his own unrighteousness? Can he be good and bad at once? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a man can be converted--that is turned round--when he is going on his old road the whole week? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a man has repented--that is, changed his mind--when he is in just the same mind as ever as to how he shall behave to his family, his customers, and everybody with whom he has to <b>do?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a man is renewed by God's Spirit, when except for a few religious phrases, and a little more outside respectability, he is just the old man, the same character at heart he ever was? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there is any use in a man's belonging to the number of believers, if he does not do what he believes; or any use in thinking that God has elected and chosen him, when he chooses not to do what God has chosen that every man must do, or die? ...|$|R

40|$|COX: Deborah, in some fields {{foundations}} do {{not seem}} very important, but we both think foundations of statistical inference are important; why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is?</b> MAYO: I think because they ask about fundamental questions of evidence, inference, and probability. I don’t think that foundations of different fields are all alike; because in statistics we’re so intimately connected to the scientific interest in learning about the world, we invariably cross into philosophical questions about empirical knowledge and inductive inference. COX: One aspect {{of it is that}} it forces us to say what it is that we really want to know when we analyze a situation statistically. Do we want to put in a lot of information external to the data, or as little as possible. It forces us to think about questions of that sort. MAYO: But key questions, I think, are not so much a matter of putting in a lot or a little information. Default Bayesians might say ‘we don’t make you put in more than the frequentist (just give us the model and data, we do the rest) ’...|$|E

30|$|CD interviews, {{using both}} {{debriefing}} and a “think aloud” approach, assessed patient {{understanding of the}} draft PROs and evaluated the content, clarity and relevance of the questions, response options and recall periods. A second sample of eligible patients with SLE was recruited from {{four of the six}} practices. Just prior to the face-to-face interviews, patients completed paper versions of the PROs, formatted to look like electronic screen shots, as future administration of the tools using an electronic device (ePRO) is planned. CD interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide developed for the study, with questions such as, ‘Looking at question 1 (feeling tired or lacking energy), how do you define feeling tired? What about lacking energy? What is the difference between these terms? Why would you say that? Do you think we need to include both terms or would you delete one? (If delete one), Which would you omit? Why? Do you have any other suggestions about how this question could be revised? If yes, please describe. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> clearer?’ All patients (with the exception of one) were asked about both PROs, but they were not asked to evaluate every item; the items perceived to be the most challenging were tested and to avoid the interviews becoming tedious for the patients, they were not asked to evaluate questions that were very similar to each other. Multiple rounds of CD interviews were conducted. After each round of interviews, the responses were reviewed and the PROs were modified accordingly. The revised drafts were then used in the next round of interviews.|$|E
