Alkanes can also be polymerized, but only with the help of strong acids.|$|R

50|$|Understanding <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> is {{critical}} to chemistry, biochemistry and pharmacology.In organic chemistry, <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> are nearly universal and affect the rates and activation energies of most chemical reactions to varying degrees. <b>Steric</b> <b>effects</b> often dictate reaction pathways in organic synthesis because there are fewer configurations in which molecules can collide and successfully react.In surface chemistry, <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> manifest in an entropic contribution to the overall Gibbs energy. Hence, colloidal stability {{can be obtained by}} steric shielding from polymers, often made possible via block co-polymer adsorption or grafting polymer onto charged nanoparticles. This spatial shielding effect is large-scale in comparison to Debye shielding due {{to the size of the}} attached polymer strands.In biochemistry, <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> are often exploited in naturally occurring molecules such as enzymes, where the catalytic site may be buried within a large protein structure. In pharmacology, <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> determine how and at what rate a drug will interact with its target bio-molecules.|$|R

[...] The selectivity ratio S3(CH2)9/S6(CH2)18 is 6.0 for Os4(CO)12 and 1.5 for W(CO)6, rationalized by greater <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> in the Os cluster, leading to a preference for the smaller ring product.|$|R
50|$|A-values help {{predict the}} {{conformation}} of cyclohexane rings. The most stable conformation {{will be the}} one which has the substituent or substituents equatorial. When multiple substituents are taken into consideration, the conformation where the substituent with the largest A-value is equatorial is favored.The utility of A-values can be generalized for use outside of cyclohexane conformations. A-values can help predict the <b>steric</b> <b>effect</b> of a substituent. In general, the larger a substituent’s A-value, the larger the <b>steric</b> <b>effect</b> of that substituent.

In this Perspective article we review some of the progress made in studying the <b>steric</b> <b>effect</b> in inelastic and reactive collisions involving relatively small isolated atomic and molecular species.

50|$|The structure, properties, and {{reactivity}} of a molecule {{are dependent on}} straightforward bonding interactions including covalent bonds, ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, {{and other forms of}} bonding. This bonding supplies a basic molecular skeleton that is modified by repulsive forces generally considered <b>steric</b> <b>effects.</b> Basic bonding and <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> are at times insufficient to explain many structures, properties, and reactivity. Thus, <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> are often contrasted and complemented by electronic effects, implying the influence of effects such as induction, conjunction, orbital symmetry, electrostatic interactions, and spin state. There are more esoteric electronic effects but these are among the most important when considering chemical structure and reactivity.|$|R

40|$|Reverse-emulsion {{electrophoretic display}} {{technology}} {{is based on}} an electro-responsive ink comprised of self-assembled nanodroplets dispersed in a non-polar liquid. The dye-containing nanodroplets are selectively driven toward or away from the viewing plane of a display by electric fields. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} image contrast in a nanodroplet electrophoretic display is governed by concentration and <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> that limit the intensity of the dark state. Simultaneously, <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> as well as electrostatic screening can diminish whiteness in the light state. This hypothesis has been tested by multiphysics simulation of dilute species in electrostatic fields and experimental measurements of relative luminance in test displays. Concentration level was varied in a range of dilutions from full concentration (100 %) to one-eighth (12. 5 %) and the highest contrast ratio was achieved at 25 %. The test devices exhibited behavior that was similar to the saturation effects predicted by simulation, accounting for <b>steric</b> <b>effects.</b> Ink concentration showed little effect on switching time, reaching steady-state within approximately 2 seconds for all concentration levels. The hypothesis was further tested by experimentally observing the effect of driving voltage between 1 V to 8 V. The results showed no significant improvement of contrast even at higher voltage, further suggesting that concentration and <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> dictate maximum contrast...|$|R

30|$|Another factor {{influencing}} the morphology of silver nanocrystals with different PVPs is the <b>steric</b> <b>effect.</b> Shorter chains of PVP cause a smaller <b>steric</b> <b>effect</b> which can combine PVP with silver nanoparticles in the colloid better but also results in incomplete coating of silver nanocrystals. In this case, silver nanocrystals may aggregate together. On the contrary, PVP with longer chains can protect silver nanocrystals from aggregation. However, a thicker coating {{on the surface}} of silver nanocrystals may decrease the strength of the coordination interaction between Ag+ ions and PVP.|$|R
40|$|Short Abstract — We have {{developed}} a rule-based kinetic Monte Carlo method that is illustrated by using it to characterize interactions of multivalent ligands with cell-surface receptors in a well-mixed system. A pseudo-spatial modification of the model accounts for <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> and constrains binding of multimolecular complexes. We study the effect of receptor aggregate structure on the overall kinetics of aggregation. We demonstrate that at certain conditions, spatial description of receptor aggregates can be avoided and <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> can be lumped into reaction rate constants that are functions of aggregate sizes...|$|R
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of tetrakis(cytosine) copper(II) perchlorate dihydrate has been determined. All the hydrogen atoms {{were obtained from}} Fourier-difference synthesis. The geometry around. copper is a bicapped octahedron (4 + 2 + 2 *). The adjacent cytosine rings are oriented head-to-tail with {{respect to each other}} and are roughly at right angles to the co-ordination plane. The exocyclic oxo groups form an interligand, intracomplex hydrogen-bonding network above and below the co-ordination plane with the exocyclic amino groups of alternate cytosine bases. The EPR and electronic spectra are consistent with the retention of the solid-state structure in solution. The <b>steric</b> <b>effect</b> of the C(2) =O group of cytosine is offset by the presence of the intracomplex hydrogen-bonding network. The trend in Ei values of Cu-II-Cu-I couples for 1. 4 complexes of cytosine, cytodine, pyridine, 2 -methylpyridine and N-methylimidazole suggests that both <b>steric</b> <b>effects</b> and pi-delocalization in imidazole and pyridine ligands and the <b>steric</b> <b>effect</b> of C(2) =O in pyrimidine ligands are important in stabilising Cu-I relative to Cu-II...|$|R
