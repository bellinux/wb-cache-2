However, {{there is still some}} uncertainty as to how receivers perform in dense forest, where trees interfere with the GPS signal and increase error. These two manuscripts examine GPS accuracy and overall effectiveness within second growth Douglas-fir forest across variable terrain and stand densities. This research was specifically concerned with how GPS <b>filters</b> (<b>settings)</b> affect accuracies and wait times. Two settings were examined: maximum (PDOP 20, SNR 33, and minimum elevation 5 degrees) and default (PDOP 6, SNR 39, and minimum elevation 15 degrees).

The first manuscript (chapter 2) examines the ability of mapping-grade GPS receivers to locate a horizontal position.

While originally applied primarily to state-space models, SMC is increasingly {{being used as}} a general-purpose Bayesian inference tool. Traditional analyses of SMC algorithms focus on their usage for approximating expectations with respect to the posterior of a Bayesian model. However, these algorithms {{can also be used to}} obtain approximate samples from the posterior distribution of interest. We investigate the asymptotic and non-asymptotic properties of SMC from this sampling viewpoint. Let P be a distribution of interest, such as a Bayesian posterior, and let P be a random estimator of P generated by an SMC algorithm.

50|$|The {{majority}} of today's lock-in amplifiers {{are based on}} high-performance digital signal processing (DSP). Over the last 20 years, digital lock-in amplifiers have been replacing analog models across the entire frequency range, allowing users to perform measurements up to a frequency of 600 MHz. Initial problems of the first digital lock-in amplifiers, e.g. the presence of digital clock noise on the input connectors, could be completely eliminated by use of improved electronic components and better instrument design. Today's digital lock-in amplifiers outperform analog models in all relevant performance parameters, such as frequency range, input noise, stability and dynamic reserve. In addition to better performance, digital lock-in amplifiers can include multiple demodulators, which allows analyzing a signal with different <b>filter</b> <b>settings</b> or at multiple different frequencies simultaneously. Moreover, experimental data can be analyzed with additional tools such as an oscilloscope, FFT spectrum analyzers, boxcar averager or used to provide feedback by using internal PID controllers. Some models of the digital lock-in amplifiers are computer-controlled and feature a graphical user interface (can be a platform-independent browser user interface) and a choice of programming interfaces.|$|E
50|$|Quadrupole mass analyzers use {{oscillating}} electrical {{fields to}} selectively stabilize or destabilize {{the paths of}} ions passing through a radio frequency (RF) quadrupole field created between 4 parallel rods. Only the ions in a certain range of mass/charge ratio are passed through the system at any time, but changes to the potentials on the rods allow {{a wide range of}} m/z values to be swept rapidly, either continuously or in a succession of discrete hops. A quadrupole mass analyzer acts as a mass-selective filter and is closely related to the quadrupole ion trap, particularly the linear quadrupole ion trap except that it is designed to pass the untrapped ions rather than collect the trapped ones, and is for that reason referred to as a transmission quadrupole.A magnetically enhanced quadrupole mass analyzer includes the addition of a magnetic field, either applied axially or transversely. This novel type of instrument leads to an additional performance enhancement in terms of resolution and/or sensitivity depending upon the magnitude and orientation of the applied magnetic field. A common variation of the transmission quadrupole is the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The “triple quad” has three consecutive quadrupole stages, the first acting as a mass filter to transmit a particular incoming ion to the second quadrupole, a collision chamber, wherein that ion can be broken into fragments. The third quadrupole also acts as a mass filter, to transmit a particular fragment ion to the detector.

It consists of 33 structural units, or [...] "moments", which can be ordered {{in a number of different}} ways, according to a [...] "connection scheme" [...] specifying the relationships between successive moments by a combination of three elements, one from each of the following groups: (1) similar, different, or opposite; (2) supporting, neutral, or destroying; (3) increasing, constant, or decreasing [...]In Mikrophonie I two percussionists play a large tam-tam with a variety of implements. Another pair of players use hand-held microphones to amplify subtle details and noises, inflecting the sound through quick (and precisely scored) motions. The last two performers, seated in the audience, apply resonant bandpass filters to the microphone outputs and distribute the resulting sounds to a quadraphonic speaker system. The piece was composed on the basis of the results of an experiment carried out by the composer and Jaap Spek in August 1964: I had bought myself a large tamtam for my composition MOMENTE, and set it up in my garden. I now made some experiments, exciting the tamtam with a great variety of implements - of glass, cardboard, metal, wood, rubber, plastic - that I collected from around the house, and connected a microphone (with strong directional sensitivity) that I held in my hand and moved around, to an electrical filter, whose output led to a potentiometer and was then made audible over a loudspeaker. My collaborator Spek was in the house and changed the <b>filter</b> <b>settings</b> and the dynamic levels, improvising. At the same time, we recorded the result on tape. The tape recording of this first microphony experiment was for me a discovery of the greatest importance. We had made no agreement about what the other would do; I used some of the implements that lay to hand as the mood took me, and at the same time I probed the surface of the tamtam with the microphone, as a doctor probes a body with a stethoscope; Spek also reacted spontaneously to what he heard as the result of our combined activity. (preface to the score of Mikrophonie I, p. 9)After an initial attempt to notate the actions and implements proved impractically complicated, Stockhausen decided to categorize the sounds according to their perceived qualities: [...] "groaning, [...] " [...] "trumpeting, [...] " [...] "whirring, [...] " [...] "hooting," [...] "roaring," [...] "grating, [...] " [...] "chattering, [...] " [...] "wailing, [...] " [...] "sawing, [...] " [...] "ringing, [...] " [...] "choking, [...] " [...] "cawing, [...] " [...] "clacking, [...] " [...] "snorting, [...] " [...] "chirping, [...] " [...] "hissing, [...] " [...] "grunting, [...] " [...] "crunching, [...] " [...] "clinking, [...] " [...] "tromboning, [...] " [...] "scraping, [...] " [...] etc., in a scale of 36 steps from the darkest and lowest to the brightest and highest sounds [...] Through this emphasis on subjectively perceived qualities, [...] "For the first time a perceptual equivalent to totally organized structure has been discovered, and it is particularly significant that this has been done with very simple means. This successful fusion of abstract theory and expression makes Mikrophonie I a work of singular importance" [...]“Someone said, must it be a tam-tam? I said no, I can imagine the score being used to examine an old Volkswagen musically, to go inside the old thing and bang it and scratch it and do all sorts of things to it, and play MIKROPHONIE I, using the microphone” [...] However, when it came to tam-tams, some were less suitable than others, and the assortment of implements used to excite the tam-tam in the original performances could be substituted only with difficulty, if the desired range of sounds was to be obtained [...]|$|E

40|$|Time to {{stabilization}} (TTS) is {{the time}} it takes for an individual to return to a baseline or stable state following a jump or hop landing. A large variety exists in methods to calculate the TTS. These methods can be described based on four aspects: (1) the input signal used (vertical, anteroposterior, or mediolateral ground reaction force) (2) signal processing (smoothed by sequential averaging, a moving root-mean-square window, or fitting an unbounded third order polynomial), (3) the stable state (threshold), and (4) the definition of when the (processed) signal is considered stable. Furthermore, differences exist with regard to the sample rate, <b>filter</b> <b>settings</b> and trial length. Twenty-five healthy volunteers performed ten 'single leg drop jump landing' trials. For each trial, TTS was calculated according to 18 previously reported methods. Additionally, the effects of sample rate (1000, 500, 200 and 100 samples/s), <b>filter</b> <b>settings</b> (no filter, 40, 15 and 10 Hz), and trial length (20, 14, 10, 7, 5 and 3 s) were assessed. The TTS values varied considerably across the calculation methods. The maximum effect of alterations in the processing settings, averaged over calculation methods, were 2. 8 % (SD 3. 3 %) for sample rate, 8. 8 % (SD 7. 7 %) for <b>filter</b> <b>settings,</b> and 100. 5 % (SD 100. 9 %) for trial length. Differences in TTS calculation methods are affected differently by sample rate, <b>filter</b> <b>settings</b> and trial length.
