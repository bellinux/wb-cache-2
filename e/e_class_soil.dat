40|$|Jakarta {{is located}} on a thick {{sedimentary}} layer that potentially has a very high seismic wave amplification. However, the available information concerning the subsurface model and bedrock depth is insufficient for a seismic hazard analysis. In this study, a microtremor array method was applied to estimate the geometry and S-wave velocity of the sedimentary layer. The spatial autocorrelation (SPAC) method was applied to estimate the dispersion curve, while the S-wave velocity was estimated using a genetic algorithm approach. The analysis of the 1 D and 2 D S-wave velocity profiles shows that along a north-south line, the sedimentary layer is thicker towards the north. It has a positive correlation with a geological cross section derived from a borehole down {{to a depth of}} about 300 m. The SPT data from the BMKG site were used to verify the 1 D S-wave velocity profile. They show a good agreement. The microtremor analysis reached the engineering bedrock in a range from 359 to 608 m as depicted by a cross section in the north-south direction. The site class was also estimated at each site, based on the average S-wave velocity until 30 m depth. The sites UI to ISTN belong to <b>class</b> D (medium <b>soil),</b> while BMKG and ANCL belong to <b>class</b> <b>E</b> (soft <b>soil).</b> ...|$|R

The <b>E</b> <b>class</b> eventually totalled 65, with 15 examples being built by Nasmyth, Wilson, 30 by Vulcan Foundry and 20 by North British. The first fifteen entered service in 1903/04 and were successful from the outset, providing a much needed boost to WAGR locomotive power.|$|R

Also derived are the elemental characteristics of those source aerosols and {{their contributions to the}} total recorded elemental concentrations (i. e. an elemental mass balance). These are estimated by applying a new approach to apportioning mass among various PCA source components: the calculation of Absolute Principal Component Scores, and the subsequent regression of daily mass and elemental concentrations on these scores...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and test a method to {{determine}} and discriminate <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, based on spectral data obtained via Landsat satellite imagery. Satellite reflectance images were extracted from 185 spectral reading points, and discriminant equations were obtained to establish each <b>soil</b> <b>class</b> within the studied area. Sixteen <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> were analyzed, and discriminant equations that comprised TM 5 /Landsat sensor bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 were established. The results showed that this methodology could effectively identify individual <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> using discriminant analyses of the spectral data obtained from the surface. Success rates of > 40 % were achieved for 14 of the 16 evaluated <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> when applying the satellite image data. When the 10 <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> containing the largest number of minimum cartographic areas were used, the hit rate increased to > 50 %, for seven <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> with a global hit rate of 52 %. When the <b>soil</b> <b>classes</b> were grouped based on their parent materials, the hit rate increased to 70 %. Thus, we concluded that the spectral method for soil classification was efficient. ...|$|R
