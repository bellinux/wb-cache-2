40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{thesis is}} aimed at actual topic of the international labour migration and working foreigners in the Czech Republic {{during the period of}} the global economical crisis of 2008 and 2012. It is an empirical research that comes out from the qualitative and quantitative study of the topic. The subject of the research were working foreigners. We differ foreigners in the position of employees and businessmen as well as foreigners from the European Economic Area and Switzerland and so called third countries. In the work we also focus on the statistical data both from their availability and interpretation point of view and also from the volume of flows of international labour migration and the stock of working foreigners in the Czech Republic. Selected indicators were also used to study spatial distribution of working foreigners in the Czech Republic including <b>its</b> <b>factors</b> <b>from</b> political, social, economic, geographic, demographic or cultural areas. The study was carried out by applying qualitative and quantitative correlation and regression analyses. In this respect we focused also on the discussion of the relevancy of statistical data from areas specified above that may help to clarify the structure of the spatial distribution of working foreigners.

40|$|Subject {{description}} {{representing the}} contents of library materials {{is one of the}} key processes that support the retrieval of materials. Quality of the latter relies on the quality of the subject description of library materials. If they are represented poorly or inadequately, the quality of the searching will likewise be poor. Inappropriate assignment of indexing terms can lead to unsuccessful retrieval - users cannot find relevant materials. The quality of subject description can be improved by studying numerous factors that could affect it. The author raises a question: Can the quality of subject description be affected by the library management, which is not directly connected to the process of subject description? In the article the connection between the quality of subject description and the management is studied. The concept of quality is represented, the quality of subject description is defined and factors that affect it quality are analyzed. The author analyzes the quality of subject description and <b>its</b> <b>factors</b> <b>from</b> the point of view of four basic managerial functions: planning, organizing,personnel management and controlling. On the basis of the analysis and logical connections between the quality of subject description and the management the author concludes that quality of subject description depends on the management, too...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{grain drying}} process is {{characterized}} by its complex and non-linear nature. As a result, conventional control system design cannot handle this process appropriately. This work presents an intelligent control system for the grain drying process, utilizing {{the capabilities of the}} adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to model and control this process. In this context, a laboratory-scale conveyor-belt grain dryer was specifically designed and constructed for this study. Utilizing this dryer, a real-time experiment was conducted to dry paddy (rough rice) grains. Then, the input–output data collected from this experiment were presented to an ANFIS network to develop a control-oriented dryer model. As the main controller, a simplified proportional–integral–derivative (PID) -like ANFIS controller is utilized to control the drying pro-cess. A real-coded genetic algorithm (GA) is used to train this controller and to find <b>its</b> scaling <b>factors.</b> <b>From</b> the robustness tests and a comparative study with a genetically tuned conven-tional PID controller, the simplified ANFIS controller has proved its remarkable ability in con-trolling the grain drying process represented by the developed ANFIS model...|$|R
40|$|The common human {{pathogen}} Streptococcus pyogenes is the causative agent of numerous mild and severe clinical conditions. It expresses {{a number of}} secreted or cell wall-anchored proteins that modulate the human immune system and facilitate colonization and spread of the pathogen in the human host. During S. pyogenes infections, human plasma leaks into the site of infection {{as a consequence of}} inflammation. This thesis shows that S. pyogenes rapidly alters its expression of extracellular and intracellular proteins in response to human plasma. In addition, the pathogen also expresses multiple variants of <b>its</b> important virulence <b>factors,</b> M 1 protein and C 5 a peptidase, when exposed to plasma. The function of modified M 1 protein and C 5 a peptidase is not yet elucidated but is suggested to have important implications for the pathogenicity of S. pyogenes. Opsonizing IgG recognizes and mediates the elimination of bacteria during infection. Here, the identification and characterization of a novel IgG cleaving cysteine proteinase of S. pyogenes, denoted IdeS, is described. IdeS facilitates S. pyogenes evasion of Fc-mediated phagocytosis by specifically cleaving the hinge region of IgG 1, IgG 2, IgG 3, and IgG 4. Moreover, data suggesting that neutrophil proteinases release immunogenic epitopes from IdeS are presented. This is a novel mechanism by which S. pyogenes exploits the human immune system and prevents <b>its</b> virulence <b>factors</b> <b>from</b> being eliminated by opsonizing immunoglobulins...|$|R

40|$|Stroke is {{the most}} common cause of {{disability}} and a leading cause of mortality world wide. Though the incidence is falling in West but probably is rising in Asia. The burden of stroke risk factors in Pakistan is enormous e. g. by 2020 Pakistan will be 4 th most populous country in terms of diabetic patients. Similarly every 3 rd person above age of 45 years has hypertension. Ironically a great majority of these patients are unaware of their diagnosis. This is further complicated by the fact that most of diagnosed patients have uncontrolled hypertension, as a result of poor compliance on patients part and poor updated knowledge on physicians part. Data on stroke incidence and prevalence from Pakistan is scarce, however, there are several reported case series in literature highlighting significant differences in terms of stroke epidemiology, risk factors and stroke subtypes/patterns. Considering a high population, absolute number of stroke in our country would be in millions.

40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&As) are popular expansion strategies for multinational corporations (MNCs), and, in recent years, cross-border mergers {{have become more}} frequent. The post-merger integration process determines the success of M&As between MNCs, and {{is viewed as a}} collection of interrelated integration processes across geographical settings. Most often, mapping the integration process is done through an HQ-perspective, thus examining the integration process from a local perspective adds another angle of comprehension. Through a single case study, this thesis highlights a subsidiary integration process and <b>its</b> influencing <b>factors,</b> <b>from</b> a local perspective, in an HQ-decided M&A. Theoretical indications on integration processes in M&As guided the collection of data to determine the pre-, during-, and post-merger situation, and by applying an abductive research approach the theoretical framework was revised during the data collecting process. The results show how the subsidiary integration process is affected by the administrative MNC heritages carried into the merging process, and followed difficulties aligning strategies and cultures of the firms. Also, the applicability of communication and the quality of socialising events have an impact, along with local institutional and relational contexts. There is a need of balancing factors in the complexity of a mandated parental merging decision on subsidiary level. The findings may be applied by managers in MNCs, and guide future researchers within integration from a subsidiary perspective. MSc in International Business and Trad...|$|R

In this work, electricity generation potential and <b>its</b> dependent <b>factors</b> <b>from</b> this fractured granite reservoir by water circulating through vertical wells are numerically investigated. The results indicate that the vertical well system attains an electric power of 16. 8 - 14. 7 MW, a reservoir impedance of 0. 29 - 0. 46 MPa/(kg/s) and an energy efficiency of about 29. 6 - 12. 8 during an exploiting period of 50 years under reference conditions, showing good heat production performance. The main parameters affecting the electric power are water production rate and injection temperature. The main parameters affecting reservoir impedance are reservoir permeability, injection temperature and water production rate. The main parameters affecting the energy efficiency are reservoir permeability, injection temperature and water production rate. Higher reservoir permeability or more reasonable injection temperature or water production rate within certain ranges will be favorable for improving the electricity generation performance.

We used available continuous (runoff, rainfall, catchment area, % land use, {{and population}} density) and discrete (runoff type, soil type, biome, dominant land use, dominant type of forest, occurrence of stagnant water bodies in catchment, and Gross Product per Capita [GPC]) variables to predict export of P fractions. P export (kg P km 22 y 21) spanned 6 {{orders of magnitude}} worldwide. The distribution of all fractions of P export (total P [TP], soluble reactive P [SRP], and nonSRP [dissolved organic and particle-bound P]) was right skewed. Export of nonSRP had the highest coefficient of variability, and nonSRP was the dominant part of export. The available environmental variables predicted global P export fairly well (R 2 = 0. 73) if total N export was included in calculations. The unexplained variance in P export might be attributed to noise in the data set, inaccuracy of measurements of environmental variables at fine scales, lack of quantitative data on anthropogenic P sources, insufficient knowledge of P behavior in catchment soils, and nonlinearity of controlling processes. P exports were highly variable among catchment types, and runoff and population density were the predictors shared by most models. P export appeared {{to be controlled by}} different sets of environmental variables in different types of catchments. Quasi-empirical, mechanistic models of P export performed better than did empirical models. Our mechanistic understanding of...|$|R

40|$|Prenatal {{counseling}} {{practices at}} {{the limits of}} viability do vary, and constructing a counseling framework based on guidelines, professional and parental preferences, might achieve more homogeneity. We aimed to gain insight into professionals' preferences on three domains of counseling, particularly content, organization, and decision making and their influencing factors. A qualitative, nationwide in-depth exploration among Dutch perinatal professionals by semi-structured interviews in focus groups was performed. Regarding content of prenatal counseling, preparing parents on the short-term situation (delivery room care) and revealing their perspectives on "quality of life" were considered important. Parents should be informed {{on the kind of}} decision, on the difficulty of individual outcome predictions, on survival and mortality figures, short- and long-term morbidity, and the burden of hospitalization. For organization, the making of and compliance with agreements between professionals may promote joint counseling by neonatologists and obstetricians. Supportive materials were considered useful but only when up-to-date, in addition to the discussion and with opportunity for personalization. Regarding decision making, it is not always clear to parents that a prenatal decision needs to be made and they can participate, influencing factors could be, e. g., unclear language, directive counseling, overload of information, and an immediate delivery. There is limited familiarity with shared decision making although it is the preferred model. CONCLUSION: This study gained insight into preferred content, organization, and decision making of prenatal counseling at the limits of viability and their influencing <b>factors</b> <b>from</b> a professionals' perspective. What is Known: * Heterogeneity in prenatal counseling at the limits of viability exists * Differences between preferred counseling and actual practice also exists What is New: * Insight into preferred content, organization, and decision making of prenatal periviability counseling and <b>its</b> influencing <b>factors</b> <b>from</b> a professionals' perspective.

40|$|The modes {{in which}} {{quinidine}} blocks the delayed K current (1 K) of rabbit sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes were investigated by voltage clamp experiments using small preparations. Depo-larizing pulses were applied from a holding potential of- 50 mV and resultant ‘K current was evaluated. At {{a concentration of}} 2 x 1 0 _ 6 M, quinidine blocked 52 ± 5 % of 1 K with a 1 000 -msec test pulse of 0 mV, whereas it inhibited the slow inward current by only 5 to 1 0 %. 1 K inhibition was enhanced with increasingly larger depolarizations. The activation curve obtained {{with the use of}} 1 000 -msec test pulses shifted toward hyperpolarization by 3. 0 mV and <b>its</b> slope <b>factor</b> increased <b>from</b> 7. 3 to 8. 8, suggesting a voltage-dependent mechanism for 1 K blockage. Short and small depolarizing pulses from the holding potential of- 50 mV hardly affected 1 K. The activation of 1 K in the presence of quinidine did not show any delay. These results indicated...|$|R
40|$|Historically, bridges are {{evaluated}} using allowable stress and load factor rating methods. Load rating made in these traditional methods does {{not correspond to}} any standard and quantifiable measure of safety and the resulting ratings are often quite conservative. The newly emerging AASHTO load & resistance factor rating (LRFR) method can lead to consistent and uniform safety. But <b>its</b> <b>factors</b> are derived <b>from</b> conservative traffic and multiple presence assumptions, and not based on site-specific information (although the LRFR manual does discuss the derivation of live load factors based on WIM data). This paper presents a live load probabilistic model based on site-specific data, which allows the elimination of {{a substantial portion of}} live load effect modeling uncertainty, as well as a substantial portion of structural analysis modeling error. Random occurrence rate of peak loads and Bayesian updating of measurement uncertainties are considered. Gumbel distribution is found to fit the projected maximum live load very well. Sensitivity studies show the projected maximum live load is not sensitive to the threshold strain above which events are recorded, as long as the threshold is sufficiently high. Based on the new live load 2 model, the instrumented bridge is evaluated for specified service period and target reliability. Thi...|$|R
40|$|The Master's thesis {{deals with}} work-related stress in its context; {{preventing}} and managing it; and compares approaches to preventing and managing work-related {{stress in the}} Czech Republic and the Nordic countries. Work-related stress may {{have a negative impact}} on physical and mental health or overall quality of life of an individual and it may bring negative implications for an organization. The thesis follows theoretical basis for work- related stress, <b>its</b> <b>factors</b> and consequences <b>from</b> the point of view of an individual as well as an organization. The attention is concentrated on the approaches to preventing and managing work-related stress in organizations in regard to the nature of a work activity, the management level or particular activities carried out by human resources management. It is focusing on stress management precautions taken on the European and national level and describes the process conducted during the development of a programme for preventing and managing work-related stress and its effectivity evaluation. The thesis deals with an analysis of the approaches to preventing and managing work-related stress in the Czech Republic in comparison to those employed in the Nordic countries. The analysis and the follow-up comparison pursues situation in handling the matter in the Czech [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The Shortt clock {{consists}} of two separate units: the master pendulum in a copper vacuum tank 26 cm diameter and 125 cm high attached to a wall, and a precision pendulum clock [...] "slaved" [...] to it, standing a few feet away. To prevent any possibility of coupling between the pendulums, the two units were either installed far apart in different rooms, or the units were oriented so the planes of swing of the two pendulums were ninety degrees apart. The slave clock was {{a modified version of}} a standard Synchronome precision regulator clock. The two components were linked by wires which carried electric pulses that operated electromagnets in the mechanisms to keep the two pendulums swinging in synchronism. The master pendulum rod and its 14-pound weight were made of the alloy invar to reduce thermal expansion and contraction of the pendulum, which causes the pendulum's period to vary with changes in temperature. The residual thermal expansion rate was compensated to zero with a metal insert under the bob. The vacuum tank was evacuated by a hand-operated pump to a pressure of around 30 mm Hg to prevent changes in atmospheric pressure from affecting the rate of the pendulum, and also to greatly reduce aerodynamic drag on the pendulum, which increased <b>its</b> Q <b>factor</b> <b>from</b> 25,000 to 110,000, thus increasing its accuracy by a factor of four. Experiments by Shortt showed that at 30 mm Hg the energy consumed by the flexing of the suspension spring just equalled the energy consumed by deflecting the residual air molecules and therefore a higher vacuum was not required.|$|R
