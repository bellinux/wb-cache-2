5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional.

5|$|Gilbert Charles Stuart (born Stewart; December 3, 1755– July 9, 1828) was an American painter from Rhode Island who {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of America's foremost portraitists. His best known work is the unfinished portrait of George Washington that is {{sometimes referred to as}} The Athenaeum, begun in 1796 and never finished. Stuart retained the portrait and used it to paint 130 copies which he sold for $100 each. The image of George Washington featured in the painting has appeared on the United States one-dollar bill <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> and on various U.S. postage stamps of the 19th century and early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Since {{before the}} start of the American Revolution, Boston and New York City have shared an intense rivalry as cities. <b>For</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> after its founding, Boston was arguably the educational, cultural, artistic, and {{economic}} power in the United States. Boston's location as the closest American port to Europe and its concentration of elite schools and manufacturing hubs helped maintain this position for several decades. During this time period, New York was often looked down upon as the upstart, over-populated, dirty cousin to aristocratic and clean Boston.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the lemuriform toothcomb and the clade it characterizes have been the center of {{considerable}} debate <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b> In 1920, British palaeoanthropologist Wilfrid Le Gros Clark proposed that the toothcomb found in treeshrews (which he believed were primates) was {{an early version of}} the dental structure found in lemuriforms. Because he viewed the fossil lorisoids from the Miocene as not having fully developed the modern lemuriform toothcomb, he implied that lemurs and lorisoids had evolved the trait independently. This view was later overturned, and the monophyletic relationship between lemurs and lorisoids is now accepted.|$|E
5|$|The site, a {{steeply sloping}} {{hillside}} between a main railway line {{and one of}} Brighton's main roads, had been {{the home of a}} railway locomotive works and goods yard <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century.</b> High-density housing was built {{at the same time and}} surrounded the railway buildings. From the 1960s, the area fell into decline: the works and goods yard were closed and demolished, and most of the housing was cleared. This left large areas of derelict land which attracted small-scale redevelopment and transient commercial enterprises. Proposals for redevelopment were made from the 1980s onwards; in 2001 a master plan was granted planning permission by Brighton and Hove City Council. Site clearance work followed, and construction began in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Blakeney Point (designated as Blakeney National Nature Reserve) is a National Nature Reserve {{situated}} near to {{the villages}} of Blakeney, Morston and Cley next the Sea on the north coast of Norfolk, England. Its main feature is a 6.4km (4mi) spit of shingle and sand dunes, but the reserve also includes salt marshes, tidal mudflats and reclaimed farmland. It has been managed by the National Trust since 1912, and lies within the North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest, which is additionally protected through Natura 2000, Special Protection Area (SPA), International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Ramsar listings. The reserve is part of both an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and a World Biosphere Reserve. The Point has been studied <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> following pioneering ecological studies by botanist Francis Wall Oliver and a bird ringing programme initiated by ornithologist Emma Turner.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} his death, sons Robert and Samuel Wilberforce {{published}} a five-volume biography about their father, and subsequently a collection of his letters in 1840. The biography was controversial in that the authors emphasised Wilberforce's role in the abolition movement and played down the important work of Thomas Clarkson. Incensed, Clarkson came out of retirement {{to write a book}} refuting their version of events, and the sons eventually made a half-hearted private apology to him and removed the offending passages in a revision of their biography. However, <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century,</b> Wilberforce's role in the campaign dominated the history books. Later historians have noted the warm and highly productive relationship between Clarkson and Wilberforce, and have termed it one of history's great partnerships: without both the parliamentary leadership supplied by Wilberforce and the research and public mobilisation organised by Clarkson, abolition could not have been achieved.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} known <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> that {{consumption}} of raw or insufficiently cooked shellfish {{can be associated with}} infectious diseases. These are caused either by bacteria naturally present in the sea such as Vibrio spp. or by viruses and bacteria from sewage effluent that sometimes contaminates coastal waters. As filter feeders, bivalves pass large quantities of water through their gills, filtering out the organic particles, including the microbial pathogens. These are retained in the animals' tissues and become concentrated in their liver-like digestive glands. Another possible source of contamination occurs when bivalves contain marine biotoxins as a result of ingesting numerous dinoflagellates. These microalgae are not associated with sewage but occur unpredictably as algal blooms. Large areas of a sea or lake may change colour {{as a result of the}} proliferation of millions of single-cell algae, and this condition is known as a red tide.|$|E
5|$|Known <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> of arts, Meridian {{contains}} many art and cultural organizations and hosts many cultural events. One {{of the first}} art organizations in the city, The Meridian Art League, was established in February 1933. Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian, but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th St was closed, the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art {{to serve as a}} permanent home for exhibits. The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art. The collection also includes 18th and 19th century portraits, 20th century photography, and several sculptures.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{attempted}} <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>century</b> to understand who is portrayed in this painting. Earlier proposals {{that the subject}} was John III Sobieski (who would have been eight years old in 1637) or Stephen Bathory (who died in 1586) have been discredited. According to Otakar Odložilík, while {{the man in the}} painting is clearly wearing Polish garb, it is neither certain who he is, nor whether he is a Pole. Odložilík's research on this issue suggested that the painting may be that of Andrzej Rej, a Polish noble and diplomat of that era who passed through Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where Rembrandt was working, at the time the painting was created. Nonetheless, without any documents from that era clearly acknowledging that fact, as Odložilík noted, it may never be known for certain who the subject really is.|$|E
