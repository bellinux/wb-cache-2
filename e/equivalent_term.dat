5|$|The word mermaid is a {{compound}} of the Old English mere (sea), and maid (a girl or young woman). The <b>equivalent</b> <b>term</b> in Old English was merewif. They are conventionally depicted as beautiful with long flowing hair. As cited above, they are sometimes equated with the sirens of Greek mythology (especially the Odyssey), half-bird femmes fatales whose enchanting voices would lure soon-to-be-shipwrecked sailors to nearby rocks, sandbars or shoals.|$|E
5|$|Elf-like beings {{appear to}} have been a common {{characteristic}} within Indo-European mythologies. In the Celtic-speaking regions of north-west Europe, the beings most similar to elves are generally referred to with the Gaelic term Aos Sí. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>term</b> in modern Welsh is Tylwyth Teg. In the Romance-speaking world, beings comparable to elves are widely known by words derived from Latin fata ('fate'), which came into English as fairy. This word became partly synonymous with elf by the early modern period. Other names also abound, however, such as the Sicilian Donas de fuera ('ladies from outside'), or French bonnes dames ('good ladies'). In the Finnic-speaking world, the term usually thought most closely equivalent to elf is haltija (in Finnish) or haldaja (Estonian). Meanwhile, an example of an equivalent in the Slavic-speaking world is the vila (plural vile) of Serbo-Croatian (and, partly, Slovene) folklore. Elves bear some resemblances to the satyrs of Greek mythology, who were also regarded as woodland-dwelling mischief-makers.|$|E

25|$|Backpacking is {{the outdoor}} {{recreation}} of carrying gear on one's back, while hiking {{for more than}} a day. It is often but not always an extended journey, and may or may not involve camping outdoors. In North America tenting is common, where simple shelters and mountain huts found widely in Europe are rare. In New Zealand, tramping is an <b>equivalent</b> <b>term</b> though overnight huts are frequently used. Hill walking is the equivalent in Britain, though backpackers make use of all kinds of accommodation, in addition to camping. Backpackers use simple huts in South Africa. Similar terms used in other countries are trekking and bushwalking.|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the growing}} {{importance}} of object-oriented programming, a number of testing approaches have been proposed. Frankl et al. propose {{the application of the}} functional approach, using algebraic specifications for the generation of test cases and the validation of methods. Given a specification, Frankl et al. propose that <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms</b> should give observably equivalent objects, and offer general heuristics on the selection of <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms</b> for testing. Their guidelines, however, are only supported by limited empirical results, do not have a theoretical basis, and provide no guarantee of effectiveness. In this paper, we define the concept of a fundamental pair as a pair of <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms</b> which are formed by replacing all the variables on both sides of an axiom by normal forms. We prove that an implementation is consistent with respect to all <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms</b> if and only if it is consistent with respect to all fundamental pairs. In other words, the testing coverage of fundamental pairs is identical to that of all <b>equivalent</b> <b>terms,</b> and hence we need only concentrate on the testing of fundamental pairs. Our strategy is mathematically based, simple, and much more efficient. Furthermore, it underscores the usefulness of axiom-based specifications...|$|R

500|$|Vilfredo Pareto {{analyzed}} microeconomics {{by treating}} decisions by economic actors as attempts {{to change a}} given allotment of goods to another, more preferred allotment. [...] Sets of allocations could then be treated as Pareto efficient (Pareto optimal is an <b>equivalent</b> <b>term)</b> when no exchanges could occur between actors that could make at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off. [...] Pareto's proof is commonly conflated with Walrassian equilibrium or informally ascribed to Adam Smith's Invisible hand hypothesis. • [...] Rather, Pareto's statement was the first formal assertion {{of what would be}} known as the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics.

500|$|Sheng nu (剩女; shèngnǚ; common translation: [...] "leftover women" [...] or [...] "leftover ladies") is a {{derogatory}} term made popular by the All-China Women's Federation that classifies {{women who}} remain unmarried {{in their late}} twenties and beyond. The term is most prominently used in China, including a state sponsored directive and program, but {{has been used to}} describe women across Asia, India, and North America. The term has gone on to become widely used in the mainstream media and {{has been the subject of}} several televisions series, magazine and newspaper articles, and book publications focusing on both the good and bad aspects of the term and surrounding culture. [...] Xu Xiaomin of The China Daily described the sheng nus as [...] "a social force to be reckoned with" [...] while others have argued the term should be taken as a positive to mean [...] "successful women". The slang term, 3S or 3S Women, meaning [...] "single, seventies (1970s), and stuck" [...] has also been used in place of sheng nu. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>term</b> for men, guang gun (光棍) meaning bare branches, is used to refer to men who do not marry and thus do not add 'branches' to the family tree. Similarly, shengnan (剩男) or [...] "leftover men" [...] has also been used.|$|E

A method of “seeding” the system with thousands of potential contextual relations enables a rapid runtime assignment of context to the user’s present query.
