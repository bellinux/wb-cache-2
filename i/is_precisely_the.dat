5|$|Cox {{sold the}} head in 1799 for £230 (about £7,400 in today's money) to three {{brothers}} named Hughes. Interested in starting their own display in Bond Street, the brothers acquired the head as part of other Cromwell-related items. Thousands of posters were produced for the event, but the exhibit was marred by doubtful provenance. The Hughes brothers and their publicist, John Cranch, wrote Cox {{to ask about the}} gaps in the journey, but Cox was evasive, leading to concerns that he had sold them a fake. Indeed, Cranch could not come up with a documentary history of how the head came into their hands, so improvised a story that Cromwell's head was “the only instance of a head cut off and spiked that had before been embalmed; which <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> case with respect to {{the head in}} question”. Although Henry Ireton had also been embalmed before being beheaded, the story stuck, but it was in vain. The exhibition was a failure. The entrance fee was high (two shillings and sixpence, about the equivalent of £5) and rumours that the head was a fake were prevalent.|$|E

25|$|Psychological {{repression}} {{is strongly}} linked with social oppression, which levers on it. It is thanks to psychological repression that individuals are transformed into docile servants of social repression {{who come to}} desire self-repression and who accept a miserable life as employees for capitalism. A capitalist society needs a powerful tool to counteract the explosive force of desire, which {{has the potential to}} threaten its structures of exploitation, servitude, and hierarchy; the nuclear family <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> powerful tool able to counteract those forces.|$|E

25|$|The entire {{capitalist}} system thus {{appears as a}} hierarchical structure of different levels of productivity, and as {{the outcome of the}} uneven and combined development of states, regions, branches of industry and firms, unleashed by the quest for surplus-profit. It forms an integrated unity, but it is an integrated unity of non-homogeneous parts, and it <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> unity that here determines the lack of homogeneity. In this whole system development and underdevelopment reciprocally determine each other, for while the quest for surplus-profits constitutes the prime motive power behind the mechanisms of growth, surplus-profit can only be achieved at the expense of less productive regions and branches of production.|$|E
25|$|On one hand, {{this set}} <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> kernel or nullspace {{of the matrix}} (A − λI). On the other hand, by definition, any non-zero vector that {{satisfies}} this condition is an eigenvector of A associated with λ. So, the set E is the union of the zero vector with the set of all eigenvectors of A associated with λ, and E equals the nullspace of (A − λI). E is called the eigenspace or characteristic space of A associated with λ. In general λ is a complex number and the eigenvectors are complex n by 1 matrices. A property of the nullspace {{is that it is}} a linear subspace, so E is a linear subspace of ℂn.|$|E
25|$|As an example, {{take the}} given rng R, {{and make a}} {{category}} E whose objects are rng homomorphisms R → S, with S a ring having a multiplicative identity. The morphisms in E between R → S1 and R → S2 are commutative triangles of the form (R → S1,R → S2, S1 → S2) where S1 → S2 is a ring map (which preserves the identity). Note that this <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> definition of the comma category of R over the inclusion of unitary rings into rng. The existence of a morphism between R → S1 and R → S2 implies that S1 {{is at least as}} efficient a solution as S2 to our problem: S2 can have more adjoined elements and/or more relations not imposed by axioms than S1.|$|E

Secondly, lax epimorphisms <b>are</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> functors P such that for every morphism f of B the category of all factorizations through objects of P [E] is connected.

25|$|Terrestrial lateral {{undulation}} is {{the most}} common mode of terrestrial locomotion for most snake species. In this mode, the posteriorly moving waves push against contact points in the environment, such as rocks, twigs, irregularities in the soil, etc. Each of these environmental objects, in turn, generates a reaction force directed forward and towards the midline of the snake, resulting in forward thrust while the lateral components cancel out. The speed of this movement depends upon the density of push-points in the environment, with a medium density of about 8 along the snake's length being ideal. The wave speed <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> same as the snake speed, and as a result, every point on the snake's body follows the path of the point ahead of it, allowing snakes to move through very dense vegetation and small openings.|$|E
25|$|A more {{sensitive}} class of detector uses laser interferometry to measure gravitational-wave induced motion between separated 'free' masses. This allows the masses {{to be separated}} by large distances (increasing the signal size); a further advantage {{is that it is}} sensitive {{to a wide range of}} frequencies (not just those near a resonance as is the case for Weber bars). After years of development the first ground-based interferometers became operational in 2015. Currently, the most sensitive is LIGO — the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. LIGO has three detectors: one in Livingston, Louisiana, one at the Hanford site in Richland, Washington and a third (formerly installed as a second detector at Hanford) that is planned to be moved to India. Each observatory has two light storage arms that are 4kilometers in length. These are at 90degree angles to each other, with the light passing through 1m diameter vacuum tubes running the entire 4kilometers. A passing gravitational wave will slightly stretch one arm as it shortens the other. This <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> motion to which an interferometer is most sensitive.|$|E
