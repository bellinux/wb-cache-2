40|$|The {{steadily}} {{increasing number of}} microprocessor controlled devices such as intelligent terminals, numerically controlled machines, etc. created {{the need for new}} approaches to the problems associated with distributing processing functions. Optical communication devices could be used in order to develop new methods to facilitate the distribution of tasks and programs among a large number of small and relatively slow machines. The essence of the approach should be to find means "to pay with bandwidth and low self induced noise " for simpler and more flexible implementation of task and program distribution. An analysis has been conducted leading to the formulation of the relationship between bandwidth, protocols, and topologies. It appears that ring and common bus topologies are the most suitable for implementation utilizing optical communication channels. An experimental fiber optic based loop system has been designed and constructed. The current realization operates at 20 Mb /sec and affords a 255 unit addressing space. The addressing space can be arbitrarily divided into physical and <b>functional</b> <b>addresses.</b> Mechanism for controllerless operation has been developed and tested.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The low-lying excited states (La and Lb) of polyacenes from {{naphthalene}} to heptacene (N = 27) are studied using various time-dependent computational approaches. We perform high-level excited-state calculations using {{equation of}} motion coupled cluster with singles and doubles (EOMCCSD) and completely renormalized {{equation of motion}} coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples (CR-EOMCCSD(T)) and use these results to evaluate the performance of various range-separated exchange-correlation functionals within linear-response (LR) and real-time (RT) time-dependent density functional theories (TDDFT). As has been reported recently, {{we find that the}} range-separated family of <b>functionals</b> <b>addresses</b> the well-documented TDDFT failures in describing these low-lying singlet excited states to a large extent and are as about as accurate as results from EOMCCSD on average. Real-time TDDFT visualization shows that the excited state charged densities are consistent with the predictions of the perimeter free electron orbital (PFEO) model. This corresponds to particle-on-a-ring confinement, which leads to the well-known red-shift of the excitations with acene length. We also use time-dependent semiempirical methods likeTD-PM 3 andTD-ZINDO,which are capable of handling very large systems. Once reparametrized to match the CR-EOMCCSD(T) results, TD-ZINDObecomes roughly as accurate as range-separated TDDFT, which opens the door to modeling systems such as large molecular assemblies. 1...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe recent {{development}} of treatment modalities {{for patients with}} idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension {{has been based on}} the evaluation of many different markers such as <b>functional</b> capacity, <b>addressed</b> by NYHA classification, six-minute walk test (6 MWT) and hemodynamic parameters. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the correlation of N-terminal fragment (NT-proBNP) with other markers in IPAH and its potential for patient stratification. We studied 42 IPAH patients consecutively evaluated through right heart catheterization in the absence of any specific treatment for pulmonary hypertension. Blood samples, clinical evaluation and 6 MWF distance were collected at baseline. The levels of NT-proBNP showed a high correlation with hemodynamic parameters, such as pulmonary vascular resistance (r= 0. 80, P< 0. 001). A significant difference was found among patients with different <b>functional</b> classes, <b>addressed</b> by NYHA classification (P< 0. 02 for all groups comparison). The discriminant analysis reinforced the ability of NT-proBNP to stratify patients according to NYHA functional class. Compared to the other variables studied (hemodynamics and 6 MWT), NT-proBNP had the lowest level of overlap in the stratification of IPAH patients. We conclude that NT-proBNP differs among the different functional classes and correlates with other measures of disease severity, although its role in predicting survival still needs to be addressed...|$|R

50|$|Classification for {{swimming}} {{relied on a}} points system to assess the severity of physical disability without considering athlete functionality specifically as it applied {{to the ability to}} swim a particular stroke. This caused problems because certain types of disability had a greater negative impact on swimming than others, and the point system did not directly <b>address</b> <b>functional</b> ability. To <b>address</b> this, in 1990 point consideration was eliminated for disability types that did not impact performance. The IPC decided {{to reduce the number of}} classifications, and to try to fix classification so that competitors could have more certainty in which classification they would compete in before attending an event. This was a major change, as previously, athletes would be classified immediately before, and even during, an event. As a result, the number of swimming classifications dropped from 31 at Seoul in 1988 to 10 at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona.|$|R
