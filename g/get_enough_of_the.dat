40|$|Nutrition {{is profoundly}} {{important}} for practically all aspects <b>of</b> life. <b>Getting</b> <b>enough</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right kind <b>of</b> food affects cellular function and energy acquisition, disease avoidance, mate attraction, trophic interactions and hence ecosystem structure. When nutritional needs are inadequately met, fecundity and survival can be adversely affected. However, <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> these effects, and <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particular life history stage {{when they were}} experienced, is incompletely understood. Understanding how and when nutritional conditions affect fitness is particularly important for <b>the</b> conservation <b>of</b> endangered species, especially when food supplementation is a key part <b>of</b> managing <b>the</b> few populations that remain. In this thesis, I explore <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> nutrition during early- and adult-life for the hihi (Notiomystis cincta), a colourful, sexually dichromatic endangered New Zealand passerine. I begin by investigating <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> nestling nutritional environment for <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> colourful plumage in adulthood. By experimentally supplementing nestlings with alternative dietary treatments, I demonstrate that early life nutritional conditions have long-term consequences for <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> both carotenoid-based and structurally produced plumage features. Next I investigate whether these colourful plumage traits are sexually selected. I show that different components of a male’s colourful plumage, including yellow carotenoid-based, black melanin-based and white structurally-based colour, are relevant for different aspects of reproductive success. Using the dietary supplementation experiment, I also consider <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> alternative supplementary foods on the growth and subsequent survival of hihi. I show that directly supplementing nestlings with protein has a negligible long-term survival benefit over supplementing carbohydrates, and present evidence that males and females have divergent nutritional needs during development – an important consideration for any supplementary feeding program. Finally, I consider whether moulting male hihi selectively forage for carotenoid-rich foods in the wild, {{as would be expected}} in a species that requires these pigments for sexual display. I present evidence that adult male hihi do indeed target carotenoid-rich foods during moult, which is consistent with the suggestion that dietary carotenoid access maintains signal honesty. In short, by addressing evolutionary questions from a nutritional perspective, I discover how and when investment in key life history traits is prioritised, how this differs between the sexes and show how this knowledge might be used in supplementary feeding programs to <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> endangered species...|$|R

40|$|Although poverty {{levels have}} been {{diminishing}} in Mexico {{since the late}} 90 ’s, several regions still show high levels of poverty which are extremely high in some rural areas. The paper addresses <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linkages between sectoral growth (urban/rural) and poverty levels by applying Ravallion and Datt (1996) reduced equationÂ´s approach to regional data for Mexico. Poverty levels in rural and urban areas are thus linked to <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> agricultural and non agricultural growth.

Urban growth affected mostly urban poverty whereas rural growth affected principally rural poverty. The only inter-sector linkage found was the one that connects rural growth with urban poverty for those people above the food-poverty line but below the moderate poverty line. Exploring plausible channels, we have found that whilerural growth enhances equality of income distribution at total and urban levels, urban growth does exactly the opposite increasing inequality in rural areas. We further explored labor market issues and found that rural growth impacted positively on labor demand for unskilled workers. We have also explored <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> rural/urban growth on relative food prices, although no impact was found here. <b>The</b> share <b>of</b> agriculture in total income is relatively more important for poor people in rural areas, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> food-poor people live in rural areas.

40|$|Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) is {{a process}} in which the oxygen from the air is {{separated}} in one reactor by adhering it to a particle or liquid, and performing <b>the</b> actual combustion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuel in the other reactor with the oxygen. As a result, the output from the reactor in which the combustion is performed does not contain nitrogen, but only CO 2 and water.

The fuel used is methane and the oxygen carrier particles are NiO/bentonite. The computed heat transfer due to convection, radiation and conduction has been compared with experiments with a hot-sphere.
