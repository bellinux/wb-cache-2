40|$|AbstractDuring {{environment}} testing, {{the estimation}} of random vibration signals (RVS) is an important technique for the airborne platform safety and reliability. However, the available methods including extreme value envelope method (EVEM), statistical tolerances method (STM) and improved statistical tolerance method (ISTM) require large samples and typical probability distribution. Moreover, the frequency-varying characteristic of RVS is usually not taken into account. Gray bootstrap method (GBM) is proposed {{to solve the problem}} of <b>estimating</b> frequency-varying RVS with small samples. Firstly, the <b>estimated</b> indexes are obtained including the <b>estimated</b> interval, the <b>estimated</b> uncertainty, the <b>estimated</b> value, the <b>estimated</b> error and <b>estimated</b> reliability. In addition, GBM is applied to <b>estimating</b> the single flight testing of certain aircraft. At last, in order to evaluate the <b>estimated</b> performance, GBM is compared with bootstrap method (BM) and gray method (GM) in testing analysis. The result shows that GBM has superiority for <b>estimating</b> dynamic signals with small samples and <b>estimated</b> reliability is proved to be 100 % at the given confidence level...|$|R
