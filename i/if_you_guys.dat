5000|$|The Royals {{blew the}} game {{open in the}} bottom of the fifth. A {{succession}} of five Cardinal pitchers allowed six Royals runs, five coming after two were out. Campbell gave up a single to Sundberg and was immediately replaced by Jeff Lahti, who allowed four runs before being replaced by Ricky Horton. However, after Horton gave up a single to Brett, Herzog immediately replaced him with the volatile Joaquín Andújar, normally a starter but pressed into relief. Andújar allowed an RBI single to Frank White to increase the Royals lead to 10-0 before the Cardinals came completely unglued. With Sundberg at the plate, Andújar twice charged home plate umpire Denkinger to disagree with his strike zone. First, Denkinger called an Andújar pitch a ball. Herzog, who had been berating Denkinger for most of the game, rushed from the dugout to defend Andújar, and was ejected—reportedly after saying to Denkinger, [...] "We wouldn't even be here if you hadn't missed the fucking call last night!" [...] According to Denkinger, he replied [...] "Well <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> weren't hitting [...]120 in this World Series, we wouldn't be here." [...] The next pitch was also called a ball, and Denkinger ejected Andújar, who again lost his cool and charged at Denkinger. It took three teammates to restrain him and get him off the field. Replays showed both pitches were clearly inside and Al Michaels and Jim Palmer both acknowledged the fact. Andújar was suspended for the first ten games of the 1986 season for his outburst. Although it has been rumored that Herzog sent in Andújar specifically to bait Denkinger, Herzog himself has said several times Andújar was the only pitcher who still had anything left in his arm.|$|E

5000|$|..... The {{producers}} {{approached me}} and asked me to consider it. Nancy Buirski, who made the documentary The Loving Story (2011) ..., Colin Firth, and Ged Doherty, they reached out and asked if I would watch the documentary. And it didn't take long. Pretty much from the moment it ended I had my approach which was to concentrate on the day-to-day lives of the Lovings. I gave them a call and said “Look, this is my interpretation of it—this was kind of on the heels of The Help coming out back in 2011, and it made a boatload of money—and I said, “I’m gonna make a really slow, really quiet film and I don’t know if it's gonna be the feel-good experience of the year.

[...] — Jeff Nichols, on the development and approach of Loving On April 6, 2009, while filming John Doyle's Main Street (2010) in Durham, North Carolina, Colin Firth had stumbled upon the story of Richard and Mildred Loving, before being introduced to filmmaker Nancy Buirski. Buirski herself had recently read the obituary of Mildred Loving in The New York Times, and spoke to Firth about her plans on making a documentary about the couple. Buirski had been in contact with Firth regarding a feature version of the story after learning of his interest in American politics and social history, to which Firth and herself began to brainstorm a narrative structure as well as beginning work on a screenplay. On January 25, 2011, Firth mentioned to Buirski that he was launching a production company, Raindog Films, with Ged Doherty, and had brought up a narrative version of The Loving Story (2011) to Doherty, to which Doherty remarked, [...] "Firth was very taken with the simplicity of the story, with how this ordinary couple made a huge {{difference in the lives of}} other couples." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Firth spoke of his surprise as to how many had not known of Richard and Mildred's story. He also stated, [...] "So I shared the idea with my friend Doherty, who comes from the music industry, and that’s what started us off as producers." [...] On April 29, 2011, after a successful Kickstarter campaign, Buirski's The Loving Story was shown at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, before a release of February 14, 2012, on HBO, to which it received universal acclaim.|$|E
