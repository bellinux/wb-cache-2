500|$|Mays {{said that}} she [...] "had fun singing," [...] but found the {{experience}} [...] "terrifying," [...] as she had never given a musical performance on camera before. She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: [...] "I was so nervous that day. I had to keep eating bread and toast because my stomach was so sick. But {{it was an interesting}} experience. It was definitely a challenge for me. Of course if they ask me to do it again, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again. But I’m not going to go begging them for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Rodriguez and Tarantino {{have said}} that they are {{interested}} in making a sequel to Grindhouse. Tarantino said that he wants to shoot an [...] "old-school Kung Fu movie in Mandarin with subtitles in some countries, and release a shorter, dubbed cut in others" [...] for his segment. It has also been reported by Rotten Tomatoes that Edgar Wright may expand Don't into a feature film. According to Eli Roth, he and Wright have discussed the possibility of pairing Don't with Thanksgiving for a Grindhouse sequel. Roth is quoted as saying [...] "We're talking to Dimension about it. I think they're {{still trying to figure out}} Grindhouse 1 before we think about Grindhouse 2, but I've already been working on the outline for it and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a heartbeat." ...|$|E
500|$|Talk of {{a canopy}} or halo {{to protect the}} driver was {{accelerated}} by the fatal Formula One accident that killed Jules Bianchi in October 2014 and an incident where Justin Wilson was fatally struck {{in the head by}} debris during an IndyCar race in August 2015. In particular, following Wilson's death, Allmendinger stated that he would [...] "never again" [...] run open-wheel cars, adding [...] "The only way <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> is if they put in a closed cockpit over the car and tested it and they thought that was a good direction in safety then I might think about doing it again." [...] As a result, several major open-wheel series have implemented cockpit protection systems, with Formula One, Formula Two, and Formula Three all planning to introduce the halo for the 2018 motorsport season.|$|E
6000|$|Anthea {{smiled at}} him curiously. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I may not have very much money, after all--and, if I had, {{is there any reason}} why you should be willing to give up more than <b>I</b> <b>would?</b> <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> matter so very much that I may, perhaps, be a little richer than you are?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come!" [...] expostulated the old man; [...] "it was I, {{but then}} I was your enemy. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> now. Conditions have changed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Agatha, [...] "I don't think I could. I'm {{not even}} sure that, if I'd had the right, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> He {{recognized}} that." ...|$|R
500|$|Priyanka Chopra {{was cast}} as series protagonist Alex Parrish, {{the result of}} a talent holding deal with ABC Studios which {{required}} the company to develop a starring project for her or cast her in an existing project for the 2015 television season. ABC casting executive Keli Lee had long tried to persuade Chopra to perform on television in the United States. When the actress began considering U.S. TV, Lee learned that Chopra had been approached by another studio: [...] "I said , 'No, you can't make this deal elsewhere. You're coming here. And I'm flying to India. Lee went to India and convinced Chopra to accept ABC's offer. The actress said about Lee: [...] "I told her, the only way <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> is if you find me a show and a path which first will put me in the same position that I am in India".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the music video was a joint {{collaboration}} between Gaga and Lawrence. Originally, the video {{was going to be}} shot in New York City, with more elaborate sets, including sets outdoors. The idea was scrapped, however, for budgetary reasons: [...] the budget for the video was low and there was no product placement. Because of Gaga's schedule, the video was shot in Los Angeles over a two-day period. Lawrence described Gaga's work ethic and creativity during the video shoot: [...] "She loves the art form of music videos and she is a real creative partner and has great ideas and really cool and unique tastes. She has a great team working with her as well, helping build really fantastic things that she wears. She works hard, she shows up on time and she's pretty spontaneous ... it was great ... if she had a new song and wanted to do something, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a second. She was really fun to work with." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, Francis, a {{soap opera}} [...] "legend", reunited with her former onscreen husband, Anthony Geary, during the [...] "Soap Opera Spectacular" [...] episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show. Both Francis and Geary {{were part of the}} supercouple pairing of Luke and Laura on the ABC Daytime soap opera General Hospital. When {{questioned}} by show host Oprah Winfrey if Francis would ever reprise the role of Laura Spencer, she revealed: [...] "I would like her to be funny and {{have a little bit of}} an agenda that might look a little bit vengeful, but it really isn’t. I think she’d have a plan. If there is a way to go forward with Laura and make her into what I'd like her to be now, then perhaps <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> There is nothing in me that is willing to play a victim anymore. I’m sort of done with the wounded dove in my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{resolved}} to tell you. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> till that other woman {{had left the}} house. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have her by to see your anger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea," [...] said he, [...] "it {{is a great}} matter; but it is {{a greater}} matter to fright thee, and so <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for that, and more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{your heart}} was right, G---, and your act was right. What {{you did was}} kindly and courteous and beautiful; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> myself; {{but it was a}} lie.' ...|$|R
500|$|Among Bottomley's {{principal}} biographers, Hyman {{suggests that}} his financial fecklessness and disregard for consequences may have originated from his deprived background and sudden acquisition of {{wealth in the}} 1890s. [...] "Success went to his head and he started spending money like a drunken sailor and could never break the habit." [...] It was a wonder, says Hyman, that he stayed out of prison {{as long as he}} did. Searle speculates that Bottomley was protected from prosecution because of his knowledge of wider scandals in the government, particularly after Lloyd George's coalition assumed power in 1916. Symons acknowledges Bottomley's [...] "wonderfully rich public personality" [...] but suggests that there was no substance behind the presentation: throughout his adult life, Bottomley was [...] "more a series of public attitudes than a person". Matthew Engel in The Guardian notes his ability to charm the public even while swindling them; one victim, cheated of £40,000, apparently insisted: [...] "I am not sorry I lent him the money, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again". If London had had a mayor in those days, says Engel, Bottomley would have won in a landslide.|$|E
500|$|Lincoln's reply {{would become}} famous, {{much more so}} than the prayer that {{provoked}} it. [...] "My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union." [...] Lincoln's statement angered abolitionists; William Seward's wife Frances complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem [...] "that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom." [...] Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, [...] "but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation". When Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a [...] "great boon of freedom". According to Williams, [...] "Lincoln's war for Union was now also Greeley's war for emancipation." ...|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Al Jean {{noted in}} an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly that it was easy to cast Lynch, since [...] "she can do edge, sweetness, and a mix of both". He further noted that the crew was happy when she agreed to take the role, and that he was [...] "embarrassed [...] didn’t ask her before she was so successful because she’s funny in everything she does." [...] Lynch recorded her scenes together with cast member Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer. In an interview with the website Hollywood Outbreak, she commented that [...] "It was pretty amazing to {{every once in a while}} look up at his face and go 'Oh my God, it's that guy that does that voice.'" [...] Lynch added that she [...] "had the best time. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again and again. This is kind of very much a milestone in my career. I will point to this as a big deal." [...] In an interview with Fox All Access, Lynch revealed that she is a longtime fan: [...] "Indeed I am a fan of The Simpsons. I started watching twenty years ago. I remember the first season. I remember clearly moments from the episodes and I thought it was revolutionary, the comedy of it. I really loved it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no! <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sooner <b>do</b> <b>it</b> alone." [...] Then {{she hurried}} {{into her room}} and burst into a flood of tears, {{as soon as the}} door was closed behind her.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{the only}} right thing to <b>do,</b> Billy. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> if you were lying sick, and Bert <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> for you an' me {{if it had been}} the other way around." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would--I {{would have}} found Stephen a place among the prickers or rangers, if--" [...] hesitated John. [...] "In sooth, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> yet <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> if he <b>would</b> make {{it up with the}} housewife." ...|$|R
500|$|In Europe in the 1990s, a {{successful}} driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, {{the pinnacle of}} the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how lucky I was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{to the best of my}} ability and see where it led." [...] He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228laps. He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E
2500|$|As {{editor of}} Archives of Sexual Behavior, Zucker {{published}} a controversial study on reparative therapy by Robert Spitzer. According to The New York Times, after his {{presentation of the}} study caused controversy, Spitzer asked Zucker to publish it. [...] "I knew Bob {{and the quality of}} his work, and I agreed to publish it," [...] Zucker said in an interview. [...] "But I told him <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> only if I also published commentaries". Spitzer later recanted the study's conclusions.|$|E
2500|$|The soundtrack for Days of Heaven is {{a strong}} {{reflection}} of the film's context. Ennio Morricone provided the film's score and received his first Academy Award nomination in his soundtrack composing career {{for his work on}} the film. Morricone recalled the process as being [...] "demanding" [...] and said of Malick: [...] "He didn't know me very well, so he made suggestions, and in some cases, gave musical solutions. This kind of annoyed me because he'd say: 'This thing [...] [...] [...] try it with three flutes.' Something impossible! So, to humor him, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with three flutes and then he'd decide to use my version after all. His was impossible or I would have written it myself. And more nitpicking like that which means he was very attentive and careful about music." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{said that}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> as you bade me, and so <b>I</b> will. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> sooner if I {{had known that}} you wished it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never have worn it at all if I had thought that you disliked it." ...|$|R
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. Well, it's {{too late}} {{for me to be}} reared on the road, but I don't see why I shouldn't marry on the road like you. <b>I</b> {{certainly}} <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> if <b>it</b> <b>would</b> make me one of you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Clever!" [...] cries Mr. Frank, [...] "he {{ought to}} be horsewhipped {{within an inch of}} his life. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> myself; but she made me promise, before she told me a word of the matter, to come {{straight}} to you." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to talk about}} blood atonement as a theocratic form of capital punishment whose time was [...] "nigh at hand," [...] church leaders also discussed unofficial blood atonement. According to one interpretation of Brigham Young's sermon on March 16, 1856, the sermon encouraged enforcement of the doctrine by individuals in certain situations. He said that if [...] "you found your brother in bed with your wife, and put a javelin through both of them, you would be justified, and they would atone for their sins, and be received into the kingdom of God." [...] He said, [...] "under such circumstances, I have no wife whom I love so well that I would not put a javelin through her heart, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with clean hands." [...] But he warned anyone who intended to [...] "execute judgment" [...] {{that he or she}} [...] "has got to have clean hands and a pure heart, ...else they had better let the matter alone." [...] If the adulterous couple were not actually caught in the act, Young recommended to [...] "let them live and suffer in the flesh for their sins." [...] According to Young, when any person violates a covenant with God, [...] "The blood of Christ will never wipe that out, your own blood must atone for it" [...] either in this life or the next [...]|$|E
2500|$|After all of Watchman Nee’s close {{co-workers}} {{were arrested}} on January 29, 1956, Tang and Ren were elected as elders, {{not by the}} congregation {{of the church in}} Shanghai, but by the [...] "Believers’ Political Re-education Committee," [...] which had been formed to oversee the political indoctrination of the church’s members. Tang and Ren cooperated in the PRC’s campaign to denounce Watchman Nee as a counterrevolutionary. Tang had earlier {{been a member of the}} Three-Self Standing Committee but withdrew from this position due to criticism by church members that he had betrayed the church in Shanghai. After his cooperation in denouncing Watchman Nee, Tang was reinstated and made a TSPM Vice Chairman. Under the leadership of Tang and Ren the Nanyang Road meeting hall built under Watchman Nee’s oversight for the church in Shanghai was given to the TSPM in 1958 and any semblance of the church in Shanghai’s meetings ceased. After undergoing re-education in a reform-through-labor (laogai) camp during the Cultural Revolution, Tang was reinstated as a Vice Chairman in the newly re-established TSPM and made a member of the standing committee of the China Christian Council, which was established by the TSPM in 1980. In July 1981 Tang issued a statement titled [...] "Pouring Out My Heart to the Party," [...] in which he said, [...] "I made a decision: anything that was expedient to the Party and our country, as long as I could do it, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and would do it well." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You are mighty {{hard on a}} poor fellow, {{and must}} have a heart of stone to treat a man, who has lost his arm and wants a bit of comfort, in such fashion. Faith, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> <b>it</b> to a dog." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. And Gulden picked it. He's a quarrelsome man. Nobody can {{go against}} him. He's {{all the time}} like some men when they're drunk. I'm sorry I didn't bore him last night. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> if it hadn't been for Red Pearce." ...|$|R
