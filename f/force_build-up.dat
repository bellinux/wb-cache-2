40|$|This paper {{describes}} the behaviour of deadweight force standard machines of 100 kN and 1 MN at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt(PTB). A build-up system {{was used to}} measure the dynamic behaviour of the deadweight force standard machines. The oscillating signals from the force-transducers in a build-up system are much larger than those from a single force-transducer. This is because the force-transducers in a build-up system are located several tens of millimeters from the centre of the force-standard machine. Hence, small movements of the deadweight result in changes in the reaction <b>forces</b> of the <b>build-up</b> system, which are amplified by the lever mechanism. The frequency and the trajectory of the pendulum’s movements are investigated. The trajectories of the pendulum’s movements are estimated by using force signals from the build-up system. In addition to that, the major and minor radii, direction of the elliptic motion and the rotational direction as functions of time are estimated to interpret the pendulum’s movements more meaningfully. The two machines show somewhat different dynamic behaviour. 1...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes the changing strategic environment in East Asia and the Pacific. Despite sweeping foreign policy initiatives, the Soviets maintain a significant military capability. Even as {{the likelihood of}} the Soviet threat diminishes, low-intensity type conflict threaten U. S. regional interests. Additionally, changing regional perceptions are undermining traditional U. S. security arrangements. Rising Asian nationalism questions the need for forward deployment of U. S. forces within regional states. A policy of forward presence via maritime assets is the solution. U. S. naval assets would allow for a reasonable power projection capability in time of crisis, yet would meet fiscal constraints during peacetime through a scaling down of deployed assets. Other U. S. forces will maintain their ability to meet regional responsibilities through training exercises with regional <b>forces</b> and a <b>build-up</b> of the U. S. sealift capability. Now is the time to encourage regional states to assume greater responsibilities for their own defense. A regional maritime organization must be developed to maintain open trade routes. With a focused mandate, such an organization would not threaten individual national sovereignties and would promote regional cooperation and stability. An expansion of the U. S. Navy's peacetime mission will certainly serve the national interest. Increased port visits to economically less developed regions should be coordinated to support on-going or planned U.

40|$|In this work, the {{adsorption}} {{of various}} polymers on cellulose surfaces was studied in detail at molecular level. Special attention was paid on {{the interactions between}} renewable polysaccharides and different nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) grades. Polymer or nanoparticle adsorption in aqueous medium was explored as a strategy to functionalize NFC. The role of pulp raw material and chemical pre-treatment on the NFC properties was clarified via indirect adsorption studies with ultrathin NFC films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) -in different imaging and force detection modes-, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), Raman spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were combined {{to carry out this}} research. The similar backbone having polysaccharides had natural affinity on NFC substrates. Comparison between NFC from different origin (hardwood vs. softwood), although of similar morphology, revealed differences in the conformation of adsorbed polysaccharide layer. The polysaccharide structure rather than NFC origin had more notable effect on adsorbed polysaccharide amount and layer properties. The attachment of the very thin (only few nm thick) polysaccharide layer was uniform without aggregates. They nevertheless were able to change the surface properties of cellulosic materials. One example was the lowered friction co-efficient with one polysaccharide (chitosan) determined for regenerated cellulose spheres in low pH aqueous solution. In addition, NFCs prepared after chemical pre-treatments were compared to unmodified NFC. Increasing the anionicity prevented the interfibril association by electrostatic repulsion. As a consequence the fibrillation efficiency was enhanced and very thin nanofibrils were achieved. The surface interactions were systematically probed and compared with different cationic counterparts using layer-by-layer (LbL) -technique. The high charged, chemically modified NFC behaved differently compared to low charged, unmodified NFC: they bound more water and the layer formation and stabilization was faster; and the adsorbed amount increased as the function of layer number. Nevertheless, multilayers could also be formed with the lower charged NFCs to some extent. Non-electrostatic interactions were significant between oppositely charged all-cellulosic materials. A considerable increase in adhesive <b>forces</b> during multilayer <b>build-up</b> due to high compressibility of the high charged NFC was also detected. The information obtained in this study for the interactions of emerging, renewable, bio-based materials can be used to create more sustainable material applications in the future...|$|R

A stylus with 45 -degree cuspal angulation and an opposing copper-plated lower arch was used for approximation of the natural situation.

40|$|This master thesis was {{performed}} in collaboration with Öhlins Racing AB. The company provides suspension systems to the automotive industry and to motorsport teams globally. Many of Öhlins’ customers compete in rallycross, a style of competition that generally involves highly modified production cars racing on closed, elevated and mixed surfaced circuits. Rallycross cars generally have an inherent problem and tend to over rotate mid-air after taking off from a jump. The vehicle often lands with a large pitch angle, damaging suspension components or losing valuable time when the driver waits for the vehicle to settle. The request from Öhlins was to analyse this phenomenon. The scope of the master thesis was to; investigate four different simulation software and choose the most appropriate software to simulate a rallycross car, perform a parameter study to analyse which parameters affect the jumping behaviour of the vehicle and study the force build up in the suspension during the landing phase. The four simulation software investigated were LMS Amesim, CarSim, Adams/Car and a 2 D MATLAB model. The models were parameterised with vehicle data acquired from a rallycross car and validated against measured data obtained from tests with the same car. The MATLAB model {{was considered to be}} the best performing model given the criteria which were set up. A parameter study was conducted with the chosen simulation model where different vehicle parameters, driver behaviour and road profiles were analysed to investigate what impact they had on the jumping performance of the rallycross car. It could be concluded that the rear damper stiffness is critical for the jumping behaviour of the vehicle and that a stiffer rear damper generally gives the best performance. The longitudinal position of the centre of gravity also has a significant impact on vehicle jumping where a position in the middle between front and rear axle is preferred. The <b>force</b> <b>build-up</b> in the vehicle suspension was also analysed. Vehicle jumping and landing behaviour was compared to measurements from a human jumping in order to investigate if a human jumping utilised other <b>force</b> <b>build-up</b> strategies. It was found that the car <b>force</b> <b>build-up</b> during landing was similar to a human beings. Other <b>force</b> <b>build-up</b> strategies for the dampers were tested and it was found that dampers reacting to stroke position or hub acceleration can improve jumping performance of a rallycross car...|$|E

40|$|Myosin II isoforms {{with varying}} {{mechanochemistry}} and filament size interact with filamentous actin (F-actin) networks to generate contractile forces in cells. How their properties control force production in environments with varying stiffness is poorly understood. Here, we incorporated literature values for properties of myosin II isoforms into a cross-bridge model. Similar actin gliding speeds and force-velocity curves expected from previous experiments were observed. Motor force output on an elastic load was regulated by two timescales [...] {{that of their}} attachment to F-actin, which varied sharply with the ensemble size, motor duty ratio, and external load, and that of force build up, which scaled with ensemble stall force, gliding speed, and load stiffness. While such regulation did not require force-dependent kinetics, the myosin catch bond produced positive feedback between attachment time and force to trigger switch-like transitions from short attachments and small forces to high force-generating runs at threshold parameter values. Parameters representing skeletal muscle myosin, non-muscle myosin IIB, and non-muscle myosin IIA revealed distinct regimes of behavior respectively: (1) large assemblies of fast, low-duty ratio motors rapidly build stable forces over a large range of environmental stiffness, (2) ensembles of slow, high-duty ratio motors serve as high-affinity cross-links with <b>force</b> <b>build-up</b> times that exceed physiological timescales, and (3) small assemblies of low-duty ratio motors operating at intermediate speeds may respond sharply to changes in mechanical context [...] at low forces or stiffness, they serve as low affinity cross-links but they can transition to effective force production via the positive feedback mechanism described above.
