Besides, <b>environment</b> <b>pollutions</b> and public participation have no influence on each other. In the long term, there exists the Granger causality among public participation, government regulation and <b>environment</b> <b>pollutions.</b> Our results also show that improving the public participation’s ability in environmental protection and strengthening government regulation’s intensity are the basic measures to improve China's environmental pollution in the long run.
