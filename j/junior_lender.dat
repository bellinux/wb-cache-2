5000|$|In January 2012, two {{hedge fund}} creditors, Trilogy Portfolio Co. and Canyon Value Realization Fund LP, in a loan with Brookfield, {{filed a lawsuit}} in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington asking that the court {{restrain}} Brookfield's attempt to acquire the Kerzner International properties from closing. In the lawsuit, the hedge funds alleged that Brookfield engaged in [...] "brazen self-dealing" [...] and collusion with <b>junior</b> <b>lender</b> PCCP and servicer Wells Fargo to complete the deal {{in violation of the}} loan agreement. The court granted a temporary injunction pending a hearing. Brookfield consequently cancelled its offer to acquire the property. Brookfield walked away after a Delaware judge issued the injunction. The two hedge funds subsequently agreed to a restructuring that allowed Brookfield to acquire the One&Only Ocean Club in the Bahamas, Atlantis Paradise Island Resort in the Bahamas, and the One&Only Palmilla Resort in Mexico. Brookfield subsequently sold the One & Only Ocean Club to Access Industries for $140 million.|$|E
40|$|The {{idea that}} real estate could {{have contributed to}} banking crises during the Great Depression has been downplayed due to the {{conservatism}} of mortgage contracts at the time. For instance, loan-to-value ratios often did not exceed 50 per cent. Using newly discovered archival documents and data from 1934, this article uncovers a darker side of 1920 s US mortgage lending: the so-called ‘second mortgage system’. As borrowers often could not make a 50 per cent down payment, a majority of them took second mortgages at usurious rates. As theory predicts, debt dilution, even {{in the presence of}} seniority rules, can be highly detrimental to both <b>junior</b> and senior <b>lenders.</b> The probability of default on first mortgages was likely to increase, and commercial banks were more likely to foreclose. Through foreclosure they would still be able to retrieve 50 per cent of the property value, but often after a protracted foreclosure process. This would have put further strain on banks during liquidity crises. This article is thus a timely reminder that second mortgages, or ‘piggyback loans’ as they are called today, can be hazardous to lenders and borrowers alike. It provides further empirical evidence that debt dilution can be detrimental to credit...|$|R
