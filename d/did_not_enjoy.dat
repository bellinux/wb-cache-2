5|$|While {{training}} as a teacher, O'Reilly joined the Sydney University Regiment, {{a unit of the}} Militia Forces (Army Reserve). He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>enjoy</b> his time in the military, and along with most of his peers, regarded the commanding officer as inept. O'Reilly was a non-conformist who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>enjoy</b> taking orders, and was unimpressed with the firearm drills, because the recruits were armed only with wooden sticks. However, he signed up for a second year to raise money for his education. Fed up with military routines he considered to be pointless, O'Reilly volunteered to be a kitchen hand.|$|E

5|$|Taft <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>enjoy</b> {{the easy}} {{relationship}} with the press that Roosevelt had, choosing not to offer himself for interviews or photo opportunities as often as his predecessor had. His administration marked a change in style from the charismatic leadership of Roosevelt to Taft's quieter passion {{for the rule of}} law.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi opposed {{providing}} {{any help}} to the British war effort and he campaigned against any Indian participation in the World War II. Gandhi's campaign <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>enjoy</b> the support of Indian masses and many Indian leaders such as Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad. His campaign was a failure. Over 2.5million Indians ignored Gandhi, volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the allied forces.|$|E

5|$|His mother {{played the}} piano {{reasonably}} well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture.

After the deaths of Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Justice Robert Jackson, Minton found himself with little support for many of his opinions, which led him to begin considering retirement.|$|E
5|$|Once the new king, Edward III, {{came of age}} {{and assumed}} {{personal}} control of government, he annulled the charges against his uncle. The title and estates of the Earl of Kent descended on Edmund's son, also called Edmund. When this Edmund died, in 1331, his brother John became earl. Though he was officially exonerated, Edmund <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>enjoy</b> a great reputation during his life and afterwards, due to his unreliable political dealings.|$|E

Nash won the club goal kicking award with 37 goals.|$|E

Argentina <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>enjoy</b> a rapid recovery, and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{regulations}} {{imposed by the}} Writers Guild of America, only those employed as writers for Saturday Night Live were allowed to write sketches for the program. Henson and his puppeteers merely performed the scripts for the segments—they {{were not involved in}} the writing process. Saturday Night Live cast members <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>enjoy</b> working with The Land of Gorch segments. Writing assignments for The Land of Gorch sketches were given to Saturday Night Live staff as a penalty for being the least-liked among the production team. Writers generally regarded the routines as childish.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>enjoy</b> a {{harmonious}} {{relationship with his}} elder son, Ferdinando. They disagreed about Cosimo's bigoted ideology and his monthly allowance. Cosimo married him to a Bavarian princess, Violante Beatrice. This union was exceedingly discontent, and produced no offspring. Anna Maria Luisa was the Grand Duke's favourite child. She married Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine, and like her brother, had no issue. Gian Gastone, Cosimo's eventual successor, despised {{his father and his}} court. Anna Maria Luisa arranged for him to marry Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, a union that produced no children.|$|E

Edward took the examination to enter Osborne Naval College, and began there in 1907. Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but the prince's father had disagreed. Following {{two years at}} Osborne College, which he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>enjoy,</b> Edward {{moved on to the}} Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. A course of two years, followed by entry into the Royal Navy, was planned. A bout of mumps may have made him infertile.|$|E
5|$|For the 1938 season, Constantine {{played for}} Rochdale in the Central Lancashire Cricket League, {{although}} {{he continued to}} live in Nelson. He received £812 for the season, and performed successfully, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>enjoy</b> the experience. The nature of the pitches was different in his new league; furthermore, {{some of the players}} seemed resentful of his high earnings. There was also an incident of racial abuse which Constantine believed the Central Lancashire League committee effectively covered up. This season ended Constantine's career in the Lancashire Leagues, although during the war he returned to play for Nelson as an amateur.|$|E

After a crash at the Canadian Grand Prix, Hill {{announced plans to}} retire from the sport {{at the end of}} the year, but after failing to finish the French Grand Prix that Frentzen won, he considered quitting the sport immediately.|$|E
