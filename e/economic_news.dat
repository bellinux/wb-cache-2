5|$|Eleanor Elverson Patenôtre ordered cuts {{throughout}} the paper, {{but was not}} really interested in managing it and ownership was soon put up for sale. Cyrus Curtis and Curtis-Martin Newspapers Inc. bought the newspaper on March 5, 1930. Curtis died a year later and his stepson-in-law, John Charles Martin, took charge. Martin merged The Inquirer with another paper, the Public Ledger, but the Great Depression hurt Curtis-Martin Newspapers and the company defaulted in payments of maturity notes. Subsequently, ownership of The Inquirer returned to the Patenôtre family and Elverson Corp. Charles A. Taylor {{was elected president of}} The Inquirer Co. and ran the paper until it was sold to Moses L. Annenberg in 1936. During the period between Elverson Jr. and Annenberg The Inquirer stagnated, its editors ignoring most of the poor <b>economic</b> <b>news</b> of the Depression. The lack of growth allowed J. David Stern's newspaper, The Philadelphia Record, to surpass The Inquirer in circulation and become the largest newspaper in Pennsylvania.|$|E

25|$|In {{early modern}} Europe, the {{increased}} cross-border interaction created a rising {{need for information}} which was met by concise handwritten news-sheets. In 1556, the government of Venice first published the monthly notizie scritte, which cost one gazetta, a small coin. These avvisi were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and <b>economic</b> <b>news</b> quickly and efficiently to Italian cities (1500–1700)—sharing some characteristics of newspapers though usually not considered true newspapers. However, none of these publications fully met the classical criteria for proper newspapers, as they were typically not intended {{for the general public}} and restricted to a certain range of topics.|$|E

25|$|The Tobacco Institute {{was founded}} in 1958 as a trade {{association}} by cigarette manufacturers, who funded it proportionally to each company's sales. It was initially to supplement {{the work of the}} Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC), which later became the Council for Tobacco Research. The TIRC work had been limited to attacking scientific studies that put tobacco in a bad light, and the Tobacco Institute had a broader mission to put out good news about tobacco, especially <b>economic</b> <b>news.</b> It also attacked scientific studies, although more by casting doubt on them rather than by rebutting them directly. It also lobbied Congress, although initially at a low level. Robert Hockett (first scientific director of Sugar Research Foundation, a sugar-equivalent of TIRC) became TIRCs associate scientific director.|$|E

By the late 1970s Hippe had joined the Latin American Group in Oslo {{and became one of}} its leading members. The organisation had around 80 members and had collaborated with Amnesty International on projects involving Latin America. Hippe later landed a job as a journalist for the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet and became the paper's correspondent in Argentina. Hippe and Frode Holst, a journalist from Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang, were arrested and expelled from Argentina in 1982 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who claimed that they were spies working for the British government. Holst was put on a plane to Brazil and Hippe left for Santiago, Chile. In a press conference Argentina's Minister of Interior Bernardo Menendez claimed that the journalists were [...] "compromising national security". In 1984 he sent a job application to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) to become their correspondent in Latin America. When he moved back to Norway he worked for NRK Arbeiderbladet and Fafo. Until 1999 Hippe worked in the <b>economic</b> <b>news</b> sector at NRK.|$|E

2500|$|International Harvester's {{behavior}} at {{and away from}} the bargaining table, coupled with the company's exceedingly positive <b>economic</b> <b>news,</b> hardened the UAW's bargaining position. [...] On September 14, 1979, the UAW said it would strike all heavy-equipment manufacturers it was negotiating with if new collective bargaining agreements were not reached. The UAW's contract at International Harvester expired on October 1, 1979. But despite the union's more rigid stands, a council of all 51 IH local unions agreed to extend the contract on a day-to-day basis as negotiations continued.—a decision opposed by the international union.|$|E

BMI is led by career journalist Dan Gainor, a former managing editor at CQ.com, the website for Congressional Quarterly. It released a research report in June 2006 covering the portrayal of business on prime-time entertainment television during the May and November [...] "sweeps" [...] periods from 2005. The report concluded that the programs, among them the long-running NBC legal drama Law & Order, were biased against business. Another report of the BMI accused the networks of bias in favor of the Gardasil vaccine, a vaccine intended to prevent cervical cancer.|$|E
