5|$|A {{number of}} {{airlines}} {{interested in a}} takeover of Virgin America approached the airline in late 2015, prompting Virgin America to correspond with an undisclosed financial adviser about how and if to proceed with a sale. Alaska Air Group and JetBlue Airways were the two most <b>interested</b> <b>companies</b> to make offers to purchase the airline from Virgin Group. In December 2015, Alaska was interested at $44.75 per share, before JetBlue manifested its interest in February 2016. A bidding war ensued culminating on March 31 and April 1 at $57 per share, % higher than the day's closure at $38.9. On April 4, 2016, Alaska Air Group announced that it had agreed to buy Virgin America for $2.6 billion. Including debt and aircraft leases, the transaction was worth approximately $4 billion. Had the merger agreement been terminated by Virgin America, {{they would have been}} contractually obligated to pay Alaska Air Group a termination fee equal to $78.5 million.|$|E

25|$|Accordingly, the {{specification}} {{was aimed}} at providing a capable defence interceptor that could form part of the nation's measures to counter this threat {{would need to be}} capable of similar speeds and an exceptionally high rate of climb in order to reach high altitude bombers in time. Conceptually, the envisioned aircraft was to be operated in a similar fashion to that of the German Me 163, it would use its rocket engine to climb rapidly to meet and engage its target prior to gliding back to earth in a fuel-exhausted state before landing upon a retractable skid arrangement. According to aviation author Derek Wood, Saunders-Roe had quickly identified that that the unpowered 'glide home' return flight could be a source of danger and expense, and thus approached the Air Ministry to discuss their concept for the adoption of a secondary jet engine, which would be used for the purposes of powering the interceptor's journey home. The Ministry was enthusiastic on this concept; in May 1951, all <b>interested</b> <b>companies</b> were asked to examine this arrangement.|$|E

The NA-236 shared some similarities with the XF-108, although the most obvious differences were the additions of two finlets at the midspan of the horizontal stabilizers, and canards. Political and budgetary difficulties led to the cancellation of the program on 9May1956.|$|E

500|$|On February 16, 2011, it was {{announced}} that Universal Studios was considering a fifth Terminator film with Arnold Schwarzenegger returning as the star and with Fast Fives Justin Lin directing along with Chris Morgan as the screenwriter. The discussions for the film had been in the very early stages. On April 27, 2011, it {{was announced}} that a rights package to a Terminator film, to which Schwarzenegger, Lin, and producer Robert W. Cort were attached, but no screenwriter, had been circulating among the studios. Universal, Sony and Lionsgate, and CBS Films had been some of the <b>interested</b> <b>companies.</b> According to sources close to Schwarzenegger, he had only wanted to commit fully if a good script could be [...] created.|$|E
500|$|Initial reports touted the {{possibility}} of a film adaptation; six offers were made from <b>interested</b> <b>companies.</b> BBC Films acquired the rights, and are potentially set to begin filming in late-2010 or early-2011, once a director has been contracted. The film was to star Nicole Kidman, and was to be produced by Kidman, Gail Mutrux and Per Saari through Mutrux's production company Pretty Picture, and Kidman's, Blossom Films. Shawn Slovo was to write the script, and Christine Langan was to be the executive producer. Kidman had already read the novel before Mutrux contacted her about producing the film, on a flight between Los Angeles and Australia. The Times reported that she was [...] "so eager" [...] to play Sarah that she personally competed with several film studios in order to secure the rights to the book.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{decided to}} create a new carmaker, Samsung Motors (also known as SMI) and a truck manufacturer, Samsung Commercial Vehicles Co., Ltd. (...) , the latter through Samsung Heavy Industries with Nissan Diesel's support. SMI was {{established}} in 1994 (incorporated in 1995) and Daegu-based Samsung Commercial Vehicles in 1996. Shortly after SMI started its operations, the Asian financial crisis hit. Samsung divested itself of SMI as well as other non-core subsidiaries. [...] SMI was put up for sale, with Daewoo Motors being one of the first <b>interested</b> <b>companies,</b> but, as the crisis deepened, Daewoo Motors itself was bought by GM. [...] Hyundai Motors was also considered as a possible buyer, but corporate politics and strife between the Samsung Group and the Hyundai Group made this impossible. Negotiations with Renault started in December 1998, and in September 2000 the French automaker bought a 70% stake for $560 million. Samsung Commercial Vehicles was kept by Samsung, but finally it filed for bankruptcy at the end of 2000.|$|E
