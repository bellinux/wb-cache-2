2500|$|On October 8, Mullan left Fort Owen {{for a spot}} about [...] north-northwest {{of present-day}} Corvallis, Montana. He and 15 men set up a camp <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> seven days, {{erecting}} two barns, a corral, and four log cabins. Mullan named it Cantonment Stevens. On October 15, he and guide John Owen (owner of Fort Owen) set out to explore {{the southern end of}} the Bitterroot Valley and then proceed southward to find their way to Fort Hall (near present-day Pocatello, Idaho). But Owen lost his way after just a few days, and the two returned ignominiously to Cantonment Stevens. In November, Mullan, accompanied by five men, explored the Bitterroot River to its source, crossed the Sapphire Mountains and Anaconda Range, and explored the Big Hole River north and west to the Jefferson River. Returning to the Missoula Valley, from November 28 to December 13 he retraced his route to the Big Hole River, followed it south to its headwaters, then crossed the Beaverhead Mountains to enter modern-day Idaho. Passing south via the valley between the Beartooth Mountains and the Lemhi Range, he reached Fort Hall on December 13.|$|E

[...] "I wanted so much," [...] she said, {{looking down at her}} feet, [...] "to thank you for letting Teddy off, you know. That is why I wanted to see you." [...] Lewisham took his first step beside her. [...] "And it's odd, isn't it," [...] she said, looking up into his face, [...] "that I should meet you <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> the same place. I believe ... Yes. The very same place we met before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not soon; some day, perhaps, if {{all goes}} well. But I mean to be back here often before that. I mean to be <b>here</b> <b>in</b> October, <b>just</b> for a little visit, if mamma can spare." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You bet I can," [...] I {{replied with}} comical access of pride, [...] "but I don't like to. That {{is to say}} I don't like {{to give up my}} work <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Boston <b>just</b> when I am {{beginning}} to feel at home." ...|$|R

5000|$|Before he {{left for}} basic training, Mailer was certain that he could write “THE war novel” based on his and others’ {{experiences}} as soldiers in World War II. [...] After Mailer returned home from the war, he moved to France with his first wife, Beatrice, where he studied at the Sorbonne in Paris. <b>Here,</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> fifteen months, Mailer wrote his war novel as noted in Mailer's introduction to the Fiftieth Anniversary Edition of his novel.|$|E

[...] "I guess {{probably}} {{it would be hard}} to get a nurse <b>here</b> <b>in</b> town <b>just</b> now.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 200 years, {{there have been}} countless {{groundbreaking}} discoveries in biology and medicine at Yale University. However, one particularly noteworthy discovery with profoundly important and broad consequences happened <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> the past two decades. In 2009, Thomas Steitz, the Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for “studies of the structure and function of the ribosome,” along with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Ada E. Yonath of the Weizmann Institute of Science. This article covers the historical context of Steitz’s important discovery, the techniques his laboratory used to study the ribosome, and the impact that this research has had, and will have, {{on the future of}} biological and medical research...|$|E

6000|$|The {{next morning}} Louise {{said to her}} husband: [...] "I can see, Brice, that you are full {{of the notion of}} {{changing}} that love business, and if I stay round I shall simply bother.

6000|$|... "Si--the light you see <b>here,</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> a range with Capri, is at her gaff; we {{have seen}} her the whole {{afternoon}} and evening. In fact, she towed us kindly round the cape, until we got fairly into this Bay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right. Well, now, you've got me here, {{you must}} {{let me make}} myself useful any way I can.

They wouldn't {{have a chance to}} try my gleaner, {{on the other side of}} the Alps much before September, anyway. Now, in Ohio, the part I come from, we cut our wheat in June. When is your wheat harvest at Middlemount?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{stop making}} fun of yourself! I like it when you're earnest--like when you saw that {{beautiful}} snowfall last night.... Oh dear, isn't it hard to have to miss so many beautiful things <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the city--there's <b>just</b> the parks, and even there there aren't any birds, real wild birds, {{like we used to}} have in Pennsylvania." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I'm curious to know. When you leaped <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> <b>just</b> now, {{you must have}} meant to do something, if I couldn't {{convince}} you that the woman was lying. Well, you see that I don't try. I give you leave to believe whatever she said. What then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] Mr. Armstrong said, {{when their}} appetites were appeased, [...] "tell us by what miracle you arrived <b>here</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> {{time to save}} us.

"Today, Monday, the 7th of {{the month}} of March of the year 1611, was when Sebastián Vizcaíno, citizen of Mexico, set out and left Mexico here, {{appointed}} general of the China boats going to China Philippines. At that time he then took the Japanese; he placed next to himself the Japanese nobleman whose name was now Don Alonso and who now went dressed as a Spaniard, {{to return to his}} home; here he threw away his outfit that he wore coming here.

5000|$|Rosehill Junction was {{the name}} of the railway station that opened <b>here</b> <b>in</b> 1882, <b>just</b> west of the bridge over the Duck River [...] It was a {{junction}} for the Western railway line with the Carlingford railway line and Sandown railway line. The Commissioner of Railways Edward Miller Grant Eddy renamed the station Clyde Junction, before settling upon the name Clyde in 1883 saying: New Glasgow is close by and as old Glasgow is watered by the Clyde, to which Duck River has been likened, perhaps Clyde would not be unacceptable. The station became Clyde Junction in 1901 but reverted to Clyde in April 1904.|$|R
5000|$|A deputy to the North Ossetian Supreme Soviet explained, [...] "When the {{war began}} in South Ossetia (Georgia), there were {{thousands}} of refugees....Naturally, those Ossetian refugees from South Ossetia and from Georgia who fled here wanted to kick out Georgians living here.

40|$|I want {{to respond}} <b>here</b> <b>in</b> depth to <b>just</b> one of the criticisms of my book, A Farewel to Alms, raised at the SSHA meeting session. This was the {{assertion}} by Deirdre McCloskey, among others, that the processes of “survival of the richest ” which were identified there could not have had any {{significant effect on the}} culture or genetics of societies like England by 1800 (this same criticism was made by Sam Bowle...|$|R
30|$|The thermoacoustic {{refrigerator}} analyzed <b>here</b> resulted <b>in</b> <b>just</b> {{a concept}} device used for demonstrating {{the interaction between}} sound and heat, but it performed the duties of a real stand-alone thermoacoustic refrigerator. From a practical point of view, during the very first startup, {{it is necessary to}} tune the oscillator at the appropriate frequency; then, the volume can be increased until the maximum power is reached (see previous section), then the device can start working as standing-alone. This thermoacoustic refrigerator complexity, despite the addition of the circuits, is still less than that of a common refrigerator; moreover, it is important to highlight that the circuit complexity will not increase in the event that the resonant stack part is improved using different materials, geometries, or gases.|$|R
5000|$|Joystick is {{also thought}} to be a bisexual. During Civil War, The Thunderbolts took on a group of college kids that had stolen M.A.C.H. IV's old suits of armor.

60|$|I have safely arrived <b>here,</b> <b>just</b> <b>in</b> time {{to add a}} line to that effect, and {{get this}} off by to-morrow's English mail from New York. Catarrh rather better. Everything triumphant last night, except no sleep again. I suppose Dolby to be now {{on his way back}} to join me here. I am much mistaken if the {{political}} crisis do not damage the farewells by almost one half.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{some believe}} it was a replica of Copenhagen's The Little Mermaid, the creator stated: I didn't believe we should have a copy of the mermaid. She is {{rightfully}} a symbol of Copenhagen... I proposed to have a life-size scuba diver seated there. At that time scuba diving was getting quite popular <b>here</b> <b>in</b> Vancouver and, <b>just</b> as important, I didn't know of any similar sculpture anywhere in the world. It was a new idea… There was tremendous opposition and great controversy. I still don't know why.|$|R
5000|$|A Year With No Summer was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews that highlighted its general aura of disenchantment and resignation, its thematic depth, and the bold shift in style from the band's debut, while a few critics found this turn to feel bland and disappointing. Regarding Obsidian Kingdom's sophomore's apparent softening, PROG stated that [...] "Boiled down to easy-to-swallow essentials, there’s a mainstream and very marketable album <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>just</b> bursting to get out." ...|$|R

50|$|In 2015, Collins took on {{his biggest}} role to date {{as the leading}} {{character}} of James in the feature film Where Do We Go From <b>Here?.</b> Shot <b>in</b> <b>just</b> 16 days, the film centres around the newly instated Nurse Jen of the 'Easy Love Care Home' who questions why the 25-year-old James is {{living and working in}} the care home. Determined to take his elderly fiends on one last adventure, James finds the only medical cover they can get is with the one person who doesn't want to be around old people. The film appeared at the 2015 edition of the Sydney Indie Film Festival where it was nominated for 7 awards with Collins receiving nominations for Best Actor and for Best Score as the films composer. Collins later {{went on to win the}} Best Score accolade.|$|R
60|$|I am {{driven to}} what is either the vehicle for the sentimental vaporings of a school girl, or the last {{resource}} of a desperate, friendless woman.

60|$|But {{they listened}} to St Paul and St James no {{more than they did}} to our Lord. After the fall of Jerusalem, even more than before, they became the money-makers and the money-lenders of the whole world. And what befel them? Their wealth stirred up the envy and the {{suspicion}} of the Gentiles. They were persecuted, robbed, slaughtered, again and again for the sake of their money. And yet they would not give up their ruinous passion. Throughout all the middle ages, <b>here</b> <b>in</b> England, <b>just</b> as much as on the Continent, they lent money at exorbitant interest; and then their debtors, to escape payment, turned on them for not being Christians; accused them of poisoning the wells, and what not; massacred them, burnt them alive, and committed the most horrible atrocities; fulfilling the warnings of our Lord and His Apostles, only too terribly and brutally, again and again.|$|R
