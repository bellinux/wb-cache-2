5|$|During the 2004 trial {{regarding}} {{allegations of}} Rush Limbaugh's drug abuse, the ACLU argued that his privacy {{should not have}} been compromised by allowing law enforcement examination of his medical records. In June 2004, the school district in Dover, Pennsylvania, required that its high school biology students listen to a statement which asserted that the theory of evolution is not fact and mentioning <b>intelligent</b> <b>design</b> as an alternative theory. Several parents called the ACLU to complain, because they believed that the school was promoting a religious idea in the classroom and violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The ACLU, joined by Americans United for Separation of Church and State, represented the parents in a lawsuit against the school district. After a lengthy trial, Judge John E. Jones III ruled in favor of the parents in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District decision, finding that <b>intelligent</b> <b>design</b> is not science and permanently forbidding the Dover school system from teaching <b>intelligent</b> <b>design</b> in science classes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In our country, {{the common}} {{problems}} of the quenching machine tool in manufacturing are lack of systematic and modular. In design and manufacturing process, there is no designing platform for the whole life cycle of the machine tool. Aimed at this problem, this paper construct a <b>intelligent</b> <b>designing</b> platform for the general quenching machine tool based on the whole life cycle. The platform can control the whole life cycle of the quenching machine tool. It used NEI biological network technology on the machine tool designing CAD system module. The platform realizes the automatic discovery, negotiation and combination of the designing resources and design knowledge. The platform generates a self-organization, self-aggregation, collaborative <b>intelligent</b> <b>designing</b> environment. The platform broke {{the limitations of the}} traditional machine tool design and solved the problems lacking of a systematic modular to the quenching machine tool in manufacturing industry...|$|R

5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and <b>intelligent</b> <b>design.</b> In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and <b>intelligent</b> <b>design,</b> {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the scientific method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon {{in most of}} the first half of the 20th century. The Scopes Trial decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 Epperson v. Arkansas decision. Since then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in pseudoscientific form as <b>intelligent</b> <b>design</b> (ID), to be excluded once again in the 2005 Kitzmiller v.

5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of <b>intelligent</b> <b>design,</b> has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E
