50|$|A pantographic {{knife or}} paratrooper knife is a folding knife whose blade is opened by a unique {{scissors}} method. The blade {{has a slightly}} longer tang than a folding <b>knife</b> <b>heel.</b> The handle is symmetrically segmented and articulated to fold away on both sides to grip the longer tang. The manner {{is similar to a}} balisong knife (also called a butterfly knife in western countries)—with which it is often confused. Unlike the balisong knife handles that swing freely and independently, the pantographic knife uses a pantograph linkage to keep the handles aligned during opening and closing. The pantographic knife is very strong when compared to most other folding knife designs, being joined at several points and along several planes—this increases the force required to break the blade away from the handle. By enclosing the blade on both sides, double edged blades can be used.|$|E

Then, for the man had spirit enough, he leaped at Steel like a panther, with something in his hand that twinkled. He was, however, a second too late, for the birch staff met him {{in the center of his}} face, and, falling like a log, he lay where he fell. Steel deliberately snapped the <b>knife</b> beneath his <b>heel,</b> and Lane shouted something as my comrade said: [...] "The next man I down at that trick will get his skull smashed in." ...|$|R
