Burns really was trying to change and this was reflected in the end when he tried to give Lisa her share of the profits, with Lisa refusing. Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode.

25|$|On March 9, 1987, LaMarche's {{father was}} murdered, {{shot to death}} by a lifelong friend in a Toronto hotel lobby, in front of dozens of witnesses. This sent LaMarche into {{depression}} and alcoholism for the next two years, effectively stalling his stand-up career. After getting sober on Inauguration Day in 1989, LaMarche embarked again into the world of his first love, standup comedy, {{in the early part of}} 1990. However, just as he was regaining lost momentum, tragedy struck once more, as his 18-year-old sister was killed in a car accident in September of that year. At this point, though he remained sober, LaMarche decided <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not do standup comedy anymore.|$|E
25|$|Regrettably {{there was}} jealousy between Rear Admiral Seivers and Gordon. Seivers {{had been born}} at Copenhagen and served the King of Denmark in his navy about the year 1708. Having been engaged by Peter the Great as captain, he was {{sometimes}} employed on board, sometimes in the yard, as Under-Equipage Master. He was reported {{as a man of}} excellent sense, general knowledge and very exact and methodical in his conduct. He was also able to speak and write most European tongues and was fluent in Russian. But <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not stand Thomas Gordon. Seivers refused to suffer Rear Admiral Gordon to be present at discussions upon the executions of any orders even when required by the Tsar. He felt that Peter the Great esteemed Gordon before him and indeed the Tsar appointed Gordon to take charge of a fleet over his head on the strength of his having been a British officer and trained in a better navy than Sievers had. Unlike Seivers, Gordon could not speak Russian but was fluent in Dutch.|$|E

500|$|Next, Pausch {{explained}} {{his dream of}} being like Captain Kirk from the Star Trek series, with the slide showing [...] "Being like Meeting Captain Kirk". Meeting Captain Kirk”] Pausch explained that he realized {{that there were some}} things <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not do, {{and that was one of}} them. He eventually changed the goal into meeting William Shatner, the actor who played Captain Kirk. Shatner had written a book on the science of Star Trek, and had gone to Pausch for help with the virtual reality section of the book. Pausch met and worked with Shatner for this purpose. Pausch concluded the section with the story of his becoming an Imagineer at Disney, as well as his achieving the goal of [...] "being one of those guys who wins stuffed animals", which was at a carnival with his wife and children.|$|E

2500|$|Scrooge {{was shown}} in The Magic Hourglass in a more {{positive}} light than in previous stories, but his more villainous side is present too. Scrooge is seen in this story attempting to reacquire a magic hourglass that he gave to Donald, before finding out that it acted as a protective charm for him. Scrooge starts losing one billion dollars each minute, and comments that he will go bankrupt within 600 years. This line is a parody of Orson Welles's line in Citizen Kane [...] "You know, Mr.Thatcher, {{at the rate of}} a million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place in... 60 years". To convince his nephews to return it, he pursues them throughout Morocco, where they had headed to earlier in the story. Memorably during the story, Scrooge interrogates Donald by having him tied up and tickled with a feather in an attempt to get Donald to reveal the hourglass's location. Scrooge finally manages to retrieve it, exchanging it for a flask of water, as he had found his nephews exhausted and left in the desert with no supplies. As Scrooge explains, he intended to give them a higher offer, but <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not resist having somebody at his mercy without taking advantage of it.|$|E
2500|$|However, one of {{the most}} {{controversial}} moments of Pippen's career came in his first year without Jordan. In the 1994 NBA Playoffs, the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the New York Knicks, whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2–0 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach Phil Jackson needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals. With 1.8 seconds left and the score tied at 102, Jackson designed the last play for rookie Toni Kukoč, with Pippen instructed to inbound the basketball. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Although Kukoč did hit the game-winner, a 23-foot fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, there was little celebrating by the Bulls, as television cameras caught an unsmiling Phil Jackson storming off the court. [...] "Scottie asked out of the play," [...] Jackson told reporters moments later in the post-game interview. Teammate Steve Kerr elaborated when asked to recall the event: [...] "I don't know what got into Pippen. He is such a great teammate and maybe the pressure was getting to him and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not take it anymore, no one knows for sure but he is a team player." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{between this}} young mother and this young father lay the {{crippled}} child, like {{a bit of}} pale silk floss on the pillow, and a little white pain-quenched face.

He was still attractive and desirable. But there was a little frown between his brow as if he had been cleft there with a hatchet: cleft right in, for ever, and that was the stigma.|$|E
