5|$|James E. Boyd, who {{had assumed}} the vice chancellorship of the University System of Georgia the {{previous}} month, was appointed Acting President of Georgia Tech by Chancellor George L.

The chancellor hoped this combination would help resolve a brewing controversy over whether the EES should be integrated into Georgia Tech's academic units to improve both entities' competitiveness for federal money.|$|E

5|$|As a young adventurer, Fossett {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{participants}} in the Worldloppet, a series of cross country ski marathons around the world.

And in 1980, he became the eighth skier to complete all 10 of the long distance races, earning a Worldloppet medallion. He has also set cross-country skiing records in Colorado, setting an Aspen to Vail record of 59h, 53min, 30s in February 1998, and an Aspen to Eagle record of 12 hr, 29 min in February 2001.|$|E
5|$|As in its predecessor, System Shock, {{gameplay}} in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of {{the action}} role-playing game and survival horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a role-playing system allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a heads-up display that shows character and weapon information, a map, and a drag and drop inventory.|$|E

5|$|Bottomley {{spent five}} years in an orphanage before {{beginning}} his career, aged 14, as an errand boy. Subsequent <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a solicitor's clerk gave him a useful knowledge of English law, which he later put to effective use in his court appearances. After working as a shorthand writer and court reporter, at 24 he founded his own publishing company which launched numerous magazines and papers, including, in 1888, the Financial Times. He over-reached himself with an ambitious public flotation of his company, which led to his first arraignment on fraud charges in 1893. Despite evidence of malpractice, Bottomley, who defended himself, was acquitted. He subsequently amassed a fortune as a promoter of shares in gold-mining companies.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{initially}} {{wanted to}} nominate Thomas to replace William Brennan, who stepped down in 1990, but he then decided that Thomas {{had not yet}} had enough <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a judge after only months on the federal bench.

5|$|Chaplin {{founded a}} new {{production}} company, Attica, and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting. Filming in England proved a difficult <b>experience,</b> <b>as</b> {{he was used}} to his own Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no longer had limitless production time. According to Robinson, this had an effect {{on the quality of the}} film. A King in New York was released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews. Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in the United States. This severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe. A King in New York was not shown in America until 1973.|$|E

5|$|Evers {{rejoined the}} Braves as a scout. As Braves owner Emil Fuchs sold manager Rogers Hornsby to the Cubs and assumed {{managerial}} duties {{himself for the}} 1929 season, Fuchs hired Evers as a coach. Fuchs had no <b>experience</b> <b>as</b> a field manager, and so Evers became captain of the Braves, directing the team during the game and dealing with umpires. Evers and fellow coach Hank Gowdy played in one game in the 1929 season, coming {{into the bottom of}} the ninth inning on October 6, 1929. In the process, Evers became the oldest player in the league for the year.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Putnam's {{internal}} realism {{has been}} accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form of subjective idealism.

That is, if existence depends on <b>experience,</b> <b>as</b> subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, then the rest of the universe would stop existing as well.|$|E
