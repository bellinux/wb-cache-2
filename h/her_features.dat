5|$|Carlotta Joaquina, {{sometimes}} {{described as}} sinister, {{is said to}} have been ambitious and violent. <b>Her</b> <b>features</b> were reportedly ugly, and she was short in stature. Whatever her shortcomings she lived in great style at Queluz, employing an orchestra which William Beckford described as the finest in Europe. The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens, of which nothing remains today. She died at the palace in 1830.|$|E
5|$|Portraits of Mary {{show that}} she had a small, oval-shaped head, a long, graceful neck, bright auburn hair, hazel-brown eyes, under heavy lowered eyelids and finely arched brows, smooth pale skin, a high forehead, and regular, firm features. She was {{considered}} a pretty child and later, as a woman, strikingly attractive. At some point in her infancy or childhood, she caught smallpox, but it did not mark <b>her</b> <b>features.</b>|$|E
5|$|She {{subsequently}} {{served as}} a storeship and depot ship, and in 1904 {{was assigned to the}} Royal Navy's torpedo training school. The ship was converted into an oil jetty in 1927 and remained in that role until 1979, at which point she was donated by the Navy to the Maritime Trust for restoration. The restoration process took eight years, during which many of <b>her</b> <b>features</b> and fittings were either restored or recreated. When this was finished she returned to Portsmouth as a museum ship. Listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, Warrior has been based in Portsmouth since 1987.|$|E

5|$|Whistler was {{not entirely}} content with the realism the {{painting}} displayed in its original form, a trait he blamed on the influence Courbet had on him at the time. Later, between 1867 and 1872, he reworked it {{to give it a}} more spiritual expression. Even though Symphony was begun before Whistler first met Rossetti, the Pre-Raphaelite influence is still clear. The painting was an early experiment in white on white, with a woman standing in a white dress in front of a white background. This colour scheme was a subject he would return to later, in two paintings that would be given the titles of Symphony in White, No. 2 (1864) and Symphony in White, No. 3 (1865–67). The panel is long and slender, and the model's pose and the shape of her clothes further emphasise the vertical nature of the painting. The woman is bold, almost confrontational, in her direct gaze at the viewer, and <b>her</b> <b>features</b> are highly individualised. Art critic Hilton Kramer sees in Whistler's portraits a charm and a combination of craft and observational skills that his more radical landscapes lacked.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} black of the {{background}} and some abrasion caused by cleaning, the painted surface reveals the painting is almost entirely by the artist's hand. There has been some slight retouching of <b>her</b> <b>features</b> in red, and {{the edge of the}} veil in ochre. Some scholars believe there also was some later retouching of the hands.|$|E

25|$|Lyttelton {{and both}} his wives {{were members of}} the {{intellectual}} group known as The Souls. In 1885 he married Octavia Laura, daughter of Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Baronet. Laura, as she was usually known, was born in 1862 and died in 1886, within days of giving birth to their only child, a son, who died in 1888. Edward Burne-Jones designed her memorial in St Andrew's Church, Mells and, also in her memory, used <b>her</b> <b>features</b> for the mermaid in his 1886 painting The Depths of the Sea.|$|E
25|$|Marie Louise was not {{considered}} attractive, as <b>her</b> <b>features</b> were heavy {{and her face was}} dominated by a large nose. She was however very charming, and greeted those of all ranks with natural friendliness and sincere concern for their well being. They had two children before his untimely death by drowning on 14 July 1711, the youngest of whom was born after his death. William Charles Henry Friso's birth was met with great relief by the Frisians, and he automatically inherited the title Prince of Orange.|$|E
25|$|As for {{distinguishing}} features, Bella {{has a small}} crescent-shaped scar on {{her hand}} where she was bitten by James, a tracker vampire, in Twilight. The scar is described as being pale, always a few degrees colder {{than the rest of}} her body, and it shines like a vampire's skin when exposed to the sunlight. After Bella is changed into a vampire by Edward, she becomes extremely beautiful with even paler skin, straight waist-length hair, and crimson red eyes that will eventually turn gold after months of drinking animal blood. <b>Her</b> <b>features</b> are also heightened and perfected by the transformation.|$|E

25|$|Gyges {{asks the}} Queen {{to join in}} the dancing. She takes a cup and empties it as if to drown her thoughts. She dances in a trance and empties another cup, which is filled by the ghost of Candaules, who {{suddenly}} tears the crown from her head. Terrified, she swoons and Gyges hurries to her side and endeavours to lead her to her throne, but again, the ghost appears. Nisia, panic-stricken, runs among the dancers, who cannot see the reason for her fear. At last, exhausted, she falls in Gyges's arms, but the ghost points to his grave, where he awaits his guilty wife. A deathly pallor steals over <b>her</b> <b>features</b> and she sinks to the ground dead. Gyges, overcome with grief, tries to restore her to life. At this moment, Pythia appears. She tells Gyges not to grieve, but to thank Heaven for having preserved him from death and she indicates a cup of poison that Nisia had prepared for him.|$|E
25|$|The art of {{the region}} of Tuscany in the late 13th century was {{dominated}} by two masters of the Byzantine style, Cimabue of Florence and Duccio of Siena. Their commissions were mostly religious paintings, several of them being very large altarpieces showing the Madonna and Child. These two painters, with their contemporaries, Guido of Siena, Coppo di Marcovaldo and the mysterious painter upon whose style the school may have been based, the so-called Master of St Bernardino, all worked {{in a manner that}} was highly formalised and dependent upon the ancient tradition of icon painting. In these tempera paintings many of the details were rigidly fixed by the subject matter, the precise position of the hands of the Madonna and Christ Child, for example, being dictated {{by the nature of the}} blessing that the painting invoked upon the viewer. The angle of the Virgin's head and shoulders, the folds in her veil, and the lines with which <b>her</b> <b>features</b> were defined had all been repeated in countless such paintings. Cimabue and Duccio took steps in the direction of greater naturalism, as did their contemporary, Pietro Cavallini of Rome.|$|E
500|$|During this {{intercourse}} I {{perceived the}} superiority of Miss Honora Sneyd's capacity ... her sentiments were on all subjects so just and were delivered with such blushing modesty though not without an air of conscious worth as to command attention from every one capable of appreciating female excellence. Her person was graceful <b>her</b> <b>features</b> beautiful and their expression such as to heighten the eloquence of every thing she said. I was six and twenty and {{now for the first}} time in my life I saw a woman that equalled the picture of perfection which existed in my imagination.|$|E

500|$|Vicious debuted {{with the}} band at London's Notre Dame Hall on 28 March. In May, the band signed with Virgin Records, their third new label {{in little more than}} half a year. Virgin was more than ready to release [...] "God Save the Queen", but new {{obstacles}} arose. Workers at the pressing plant laid down their tools in protest at the song's content. Jamie Reid's now famous cover, showing Queen Elizabeth II with <b>her</b> <b>features</b> obscured by the song and band names in cutout letters, offended the sleeve's plate makers. After much talk, production resumed and the record was finally released on 27 May.|$|E
500|$|Although Saint-Gaudens' {{design for}} the eagle had {{featured}} Liberty in an Indian-style headdress, no {{attempt was made to}} make <b>her</b> <b>features</b> appear to be Native American. [...] According to numismatist Mike Fuljenz in his book on early 20th century American gold coinage, the obverse of the eagle had featured [...] "Lady Liberty topped with a fanciful head covering designed to look like an Indian headdress". [...] Until Saint-Gaudens' and Pratt's pieces were struck, only Mint Chief Engraver James Longacre had attempted to depict Indians on US circulating coinage (in the 1850s), with his Indian Head cent and Indian Princess designs for the gold dollar and three-dollar pieces. [...] After Pratt, only James Earle Fraser's depiction of an Indian in 1913 on the Buffalo nickel would appear until the 2000 arrival of the Sacagawea dollar.|$|E
500|$|Ellen became {{something}} of a tourist attraction for Turville.

Some paid to take cuts of Ellen's hair, until the [...] "supply" [...] began to run out. A Bucks Free Press journalist recounted his visit: Her breathing was regular and natural, the skin soft and the body warm, as in a healthy subject; the pulse rather fast. The hands were small and thin, but the fingers quite flexible; the body somewhat emaciated; the feet and legs like those of a dead child, almost ice cold... the aspect of <b>her</b> <b>features</b> was pleasant, more so than might be expected under the circumstances... her eyes and cheeks were sunken, and the appearance was that of death... but although there was no colour on her cheeks, the paleness was not that heavy hue which betokens death.|$|E

500|$|Sullivan's longest {{love affair}} {{was with the}} American socialite, Fanny Ronalds, a woman three years his senior, who had two children. He met her in Paris around 1867, and the affair began in earnest soon after she moved to London {{permanently}} in 1871. A contemporary account described Fanny Ronalds this way: [...] "Her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness, <b>her</b> <b>features</b> small and exquisitely regular. Her hair was a dark shade of brown – châtain foncé [...] – and very abundant ... a lovely woman, with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine, and the most beautiful teeth." [...] Sullivan called her [...] "the best amateur singer in London". [...] She often performed Sullivan's songs at her famous Sunday soirees. She became particularly associated with [...] "The Lost Chord", singing it both in private and in public, often with Sullivan accompanying her. When Sullivan died, he left her the autograph manuscript of that song, along with other bequests.|$|E
500|$|In 1758, {{the family}} moved to Warrington Academy, in Warrington, where Barbauld's father had been offered a {{teaching}} position. It drew many luminaries of the day, such as the natural philosopher and Unitarian theologian Joseph Priestley, and {{came to be known as}} [...] "the Athens of the North" [...] for its stimulating intellectual atmosphere. One other luminary may have been the French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat; school records suggest he was a [...] "French master" [...] there in the 1770s. He may also have been a suitor to Barbauld; he allegedly wrote to John Aikin declaring his intention to become an English citizen and to marry her. Archibald Hamilton Rowan also fell in love with Barbauld and described her as, [...] "possessed of great beauty, distinct traces of which she retained to the latest of her life. Her person was slender, her complexion exquisitely fair with the bloom of perfect health; <b>her</b> <b>features</b> regular and elegant, and her dark blue eyes beamed with the light of wit and fancy." [...] Despite her mother's anxiety, Barbauld received many offers of marriage around this time — all of which she declined.|$|E

A wife and mother, she is quite a mature woman now - but <b>her</b> <b>features</b> are unchanged. The face appears familiar to the hermit and he tries to place it. Eventually he succeeds. The shock of recognition dazes him - and changes him. The light of sanity returns to his eyes. His reason is restored. He takes to his breast the daughter whom he had lost and found again. She takes him from his forest home and back to the civilization that had tricked him. But the kindly care and love his daughter bestows on him to act in a measure as a recompense for the wrong done him in the long ago, and with the passing years the bitterness passes from his being. The picture touches the heartstrings; it will please to a certainty." ...|$|E
