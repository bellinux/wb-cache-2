40|$|Cast {{aluminium}} alloy-mica particle composites {{were made}} by dispersing mica particles in a vortex produced by stirring the liquid Al- 4 wt% Cu- 1. 5 wt% Mg alloy and then casting the melt containing the suspended particles into permanent moulds. Spiral fluidity and casting fluidity of the alloy containing mica particles in suspension were determined. Both the spiral fluidity and the casting fluidity of the base alloy were found to decrease {{with an increase in}} volume or weight percent of mica particles (of a given size), and with a decrease in particle size (for a given amount of particles). The fluidities of Al- 4 wt% Cu- 1. 5 wt% Mg alloys containing suspended mica particles were found to correlate very well with the surface area of suspended mica particles. The regression equation for spiral fluidity Y (cm) as a function of surface area of mica particles per gram of spiral X (cm 2 g– 1) at 700 ° C was found to be Y= 42. 62 – 0. 42 X with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9634. The regression equations for casting fluidity Yprime (cm) as a functiono of surface area of mica particles per gram of <b>fluidity</b> <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> Xprime (cm 2 g– 1) at 710 and 670 ° C were found to be Yprime= 19. 71 – 0. 17 Xprime and Yprime= 13. 52 – 0. 105 Xprime with correlation coefficients of 0. 9194 and 0. 9612 respectively. The percentage decrease in casting fluidity of composite melts containing up to 2. 5 wt% mica with a drop in temperature is quite similar to the corresponding decrease in the casting fluidity of base alloy melts (without mica). The change in fluidity due to mica dispersions has been discussed in terms of changes in viscosity of the composite melts. However, the fluidities of these composite alloys containing up to 2. 5 wt% mica are adequate for making a variety of simple castings including bearings for which these alloys have been developed...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper was to {{evaluate}} the probability of the top event in the <b>fluidity</b> <b>test</b> by Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). One of the important tests used in the foundry practice is the <b>test</b> of the <b>fluidity.</b> Fluidity {{is the ability of}} the molten metal to fill the cavity of the molds and create a cast. The AlSi 10 MgMn (EN 1706) alloy with 5 or 10. 54 % of silica was the experimental material. The melted alloy was cast into "horizontal" three-channel mold to <b>test</b> its <b>fluidity.</b> The pouring temperatures were between 605 and 830 °C. In some cases, the experiment was not successful, for a some reasons. This fact led to a waste of time, energy, potential risk of accident, confusion among participants, especially "beginners" founders and became an impulse for the analysis of creation and possible events of fault for the <b>fluidity</b> <b>test</b> using the FTA. It has been found that for the probability of the top event in examined process was disproportionately high (0. 29824). The Monte Carlo method was used for the simulation of the effect of decreasing the probability of basic events on the probability of the top event – the fault of the <b>fluidity</b> <b>test...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of sintered {{woven wire mesh}} is one of classical porous medium. The porosity {{is one of the}} major parameters for the porous media. This paper presents the experimental results of the effect of porosity on internal flow behavior and heat transfer characteristics of sintered metal wire mesh structures. All the three <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> made of stainless steel wires with the same wire diameter (d = 0. 14 mm) were sintered after woven. One of them was sintered using two sintered metal wire mesh structures with different porosities (55 % and 26 %) so that the porosity changed along the flow direction. The porosities of the other two <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> are 55 % and 26 %, respectively. The experiments were completed with the Reynolds number in the range of 10 to 42. The permeability and inertia coefficient of each <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> were obtained as well as the friction factor. Infrared camera was used to measure the wall temperature of the <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> to get the Nusselt numbers. The results show that for all <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> permeability increases as porosity increases, while inertia coefficient shows the opposite trend. Pressure drop of all pieces increases with respect to the mass flow rate. Friction factor decreases as the Reynolds number increases. The curves for <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> # 3 fall between those for <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> # 1 and # 2 and are more close to that for test # 2. Nusselt number increases when the Reynolds number keeps arising. However, The Nusselt numbers of the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> with changed porosity are influenced by the flow direction.

To clarify the effect of the thermoplastic binder on the flow deformation behavior of wood, capillary <b>fluidity</b> <b>tests</b> were performed using impregnated wood with various contents of thermoplastic binder (polymer). The extrusion load of the impregnated wood through the capillary decreased with an increase of the polymer content in the wood.
