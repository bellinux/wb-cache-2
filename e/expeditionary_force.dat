5|$|On 20 September 1939 the Australian War Cabinet {{approved}} {{the formation of}} a RAAF <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> for overseas service which would have included a wing designated No. 1 Fighter Wing as well as two wings of bombers. Under the approved structure for the <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force,</b> No. 1 Fighter Wing was to command No.7 and No. 15 Squadrons. This plan proved short-lived as on 20 October the Government announced that the formation of the <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> would not proceed, with the Empire Air Training Scheme instead being the RAAF's main contribution to overseas campaigns.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, Mercer was amongst those immediately called upon by Hughes to establish and build a Canadian <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force.</b> Ordered to take his regiment to Camp Valcartier near Quebec City at 12.30 on the 4 August, Mercer worked in his law office until 12.00 before arriving on time at the barracks in uniform. Within days he had been promoted to Temporary Brigadier-General in command of the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade which consisted of the first four battalions of the <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> recruited in Ontario. Amongst these men his militiamen were dispersed, intended to spread experience and morale amongst the raw recruits. At the end of September, after just under two months training, the brigade departed on the 20-day sea voyage to Britain as the first installment of the Canadian <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, an <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> of seven regular divisions was mobilised for service in France. At the same time, the Territorial Force was activated to replace them for home defence duties. The <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> represented almost all the regular units stationed in the United Kingdom, but only about half the strength of the regular Army; the remainder was scattered in various stations around the Empire, mainly in India and the Mediterranean. These units were withdrawn as quickly as they could be replaced by Indian or Territorial units, and formed into new divisions to reinforce the <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once the Regular Army {{had been}} {{organised}} as a continental <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force,</b> {{it would be}} necessary to provide forces for home defence. Haldane's proposal anticipated that the existing tripartite division of the Army - the Regular Army, the Volunteers/Yeomanry and the Militia - should be changed into a two-part structure, with an <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> and a home-defence Territorial Force based on County Associations.|$|E
5|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} in August 1914 the British Army sent the British <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> (BEF), {{consisting}} mainly of regular army troops, to France and Belgium. The fighting bogged down into static trench warfare {{for the remainder of}} the war. In 1915 the army created the Mediterranean <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> to invade the Ottoman Empire via Gallipoli, an unsuccessful attempt to capture Constantinople and secure a sea route to Russia.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Puttick's territorial regiment was designated part of the Samoa <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force,</b> which was raised for the Occupation of German Samoa in early August 1914. Now with the rank of captain, he landed at Apia on 29 August. The occupation was achieved without loss of life and he spent the next several months on garrison duty before returning to New Zealand in April 1915. On his return, he volunteered for the New Zealand <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> (NZEF) which was then in the Middle East, preparing for the Gallipoli Campaign.|$|E
5|$|General Sir Archibald Murray, the {{commander}} of the British Empire forces in Egypt, formed the Egyptian <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> (EEF) in March 1916 by merging the Force in Egypt, which had protected Egypt {{since the beginning of the}} war, with the Mediterranean <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> which had fought at Gallipoli. The role of this new force was to both defend the British Protectorate of Egypt and provide reinforcements for the Western Front. Murray had his headquarters in Cairo to better deal with his multiple responsibilities, although he was at Ismailia during the battle for Romani.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, General Edmund Allenby was {{commander}} of the Cavalry Division and later the Cavalry Corps in the BEF. His leadership was noted during the retreat from Mons and the first battle of Ypres. After commanding an infantry corps, he was appointed to command the Third Army on the western front. He had previously served in the Zulu War, the Sudan campaign, and the Second Boer war. In 1917, he was given command of the Egyptian <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force,</b> where he oversaw the conquest of Palestine and Syria in 1917 and 1918. Allenby replaced Archibald Murray, {{who had been the}} Chief of Staff of the British <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> in France in 1914.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Stewart {{entered the}} Royal Military College, Duntroon in Australia, having passed its {{entrance}} exams. He graduated early {{in order to}} volunteer for the New Zealand <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> (NZEF) in 1916.|$|E
5|$|On {{leave in}} New Zealand when the First World War broke out, Fulton again offered his {{services}} to the New Zealand government in aid of the war effort. He {{was part of the}} Samoa <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> and later served on the Western Front with the New Zealand <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> (NZEF). He led the New Zealand Rifle Brigade during the Somme Offensive and the Battle of Messines. He died in 1918 as a result of wounds received when his headquarters was shelled by artillery. He was the third and last brigadier-general to be killed on active service with the NZEF during the war.|$|E

50|$|Expeditionary warfare is the {{deployment}} of a state's military to fight abroad, especially away from established bases. <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>forces</b> were in part the antecedent of the modern concept of Rapid Deployment <b>Forces.</b> Traditionally, <b>expeditionary</b> <b>forces</b> were essentially self-sustaining with an organic logistics capability and with a full array of supporting arms.|$|R
5|$|Australians made up {{seven percent}} of the British <b>Expeditionary</b> <b>Force</b> but 25 percent of deserters, while an Australian was nine {{times more likely to}} be imprisoned than a British soldier. Haig asked for {{permission}} to shoot Australians, but their government refused.|$|E
5|$|Batavian {{control of}} the Dutch Cape Colony was a serious risk to British {{shipping}} rounding the Cape of Good Hope, and a substantial force under Sir George Keith Elphinstone was sent from Britain to eliminate it. Arriving in early August, Elphinstone initially attempted to intimidate the governor into surrender, but eventually authorised a landing at Simon's Town. On 7 August the <b>expeditionary</b> <b>force</b> fought a skirmish at Muizenberg and clashes continued throughout August. A major Dutch attack on 3 September was forestalled {{by the arrival of}} a large fleet of Indiamen carrying British reinforcements, and as these troops came ashore the outnumbered Dutch surrendered. A much-delayed Batavian <b>expeditionary</b> <b>force,</b> sent to retake {{control of the}} Cape, arrived in August 1796, but was out-manoeuvered and forced to surrender by Elphinstone at the Capitulation of Saldanha Bay.|$|E
5|$|By August {{the plan}} was already behind schedule: severe {{shortages}} of stores and wages slowed work at the Brest shipyards, while the troops {{set aside for the}} invasion of Cornwall proved unreliable, deserting in large numbers. A practice voyage of the Cornish invasion fleet ended in total failure, as the small ships intended for the operation proved unable to operate in open water. The plan was dropped and the reliable soldiers from the unit were merged into the Ireland <b>expeditionary</b> <b>force</b> and the rest returned to prison. Reinforcements from the Mediterranean Fleet were also delayed: seven ships from the expedition under Contre-amiral Joseph de Richery had to shelter from the British blockade squadron in Rochefort, only arriving in Brest on 8 December, while a second squadron under Contre-amiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve did not arrive until after the <b>expeditionary</b> <b>force</b> had departed.|$|E
