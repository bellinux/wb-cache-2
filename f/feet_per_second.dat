The discharge of the creek at various locations ranges from 0 to 320 cubic <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> The discharge of acid mine drainage in the creek ranges from 0 to 17.2 cubic <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> In 2001, the discharge was typically found to be higher in March than in August.|$|E

5|$|Kettle Creek {{flows through}} Elk Township in Tioga County, then Abbott Township and Stewardson Township in Potter County, then Leidy Township and Noyes Township in Clinton County. Its mouth {{is at the}} {{community}} of Westport. Major tributaries include Cross Fork, Hammersley Fork, Little Kettle Creek, and others. The Kettle Creek Lake is located on Kettle Creek. Numerous metals and other substances contaminate the creek. These include iron, aluminum, manganese, and sulfates.

5|$|Some {{stretches}} of Fishing Creek contain {{significant amounts of}} algae because of leaking septic systems in the watershed. The area around the tributary West Creek is the least habitable part of the Fishing Creek area, according to a 2011 study. The water quality of Fishing Creek can vary. Its pH ranges from 4.9 to 8.5, while the concentration of dissolved oxygen ranges from 5 to 17.5mg per liter. The creek's average discharge is 615 cubic <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (17.4 m3/s); its watershed contains gravel, shale and various loams—in particular the Albrights soil series and the Leck Kill soil.|$|E
50|$|Docking {{occurred}} at 9 am EDT, 29 June, using R-Bar or Earth radius vector approach, with Atlantis {{closing in on}} Mir from directly below. R-bar approach allows natural forces to brake the orbiters approach more than would occur along standard approach {{directly in front of}} the space station; also, an R-bar approach minimizes the number of orbiter jet firings needed for approach. The manual phase of the docking began with Atlantis about a half-mile (800 m) below Mir, with Gibson at the controls on aft flight deck. Stationkeeping was performed when the orbiter was about 75 m from Mir, pending approval from Russian and U.S. flight directors to proceed. Gibson then maneuvered the orbiter to a point about 10 m from Mir before beginning the final approach to station. Closing rate was close to the targeted 0.1 <b>foot</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (30 mm/s), being approximately 0.107 <b>foot</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (33 mm/s) at contact. Interface contact was nearly flawless: less than 25 mm lateral misalignment and an angular misalignment of less than 0.5 degrees per axis. Docking occurred about 216 nautical miles (400 km) above Lake Baikal region of the Russian Federation. The Orbiter Docking System (ODS) with Androgynous Peripheral Docking System served as the actual connection point to a similar interface on the docking port on Mirs Kristall module. ODS, located in the forward payload bay of Atlantis, performed flawlessly during the docking sequence.|$|R
