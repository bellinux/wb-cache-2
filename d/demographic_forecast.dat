Additionally, the cost of construction and property is fairly low, which helps the community {{to have more than}} 10,000 residents.The current <b>demographic</b> <b>forecast</b> indicates the highest growth rate for Hünstetten until 2030. An important reason for that development is the high quality of school, public education, and caring institutions for children and teens. To be able to combine both, family and work, is another argument for a lot of young families to live in Hünstetten.The biggest growth in the areas of community and economy development are in Görsroth, Kesselbach and Oberlibbach, which are three of the ten subtowns (Ortsteile) of Hünstetten. In the planning and extension of the community projects, Hünstetten puts main focus and attention on the life quality of the residents.A comfortable life for elder people enables one senior residence and one institution of assisted living. Both institutions are located in Wallbach, one of the ten subtown of Hünstetten where the town hall is also located. Additionally, Hünstetten offers: shopping, doctors, banking, offices and commercial space.Since 2010, all subtowns of Hünstetten are equipped with fiberglass internet. With this step Hünstetten removed a growth barrier.|$|E

The essence and features of probabilistic demographic forecasting, methods, a component and dynamic ranks are considered; requirements to initial indicators for each type of the forecast are provided.

The basic methodical principles of the <b>demographic</b> <b>forecast</b> are given by an extrapolation method (dynamic ranks), calculation features by means of the generalized indicators, such as extrapolation on the basis of indicators of an average pure gain, average growth rate and average rate of a gain are presented.  To develop population forecast, the method of retrospective extrapolation (for the short-term forecast) and a component method (for the mid-term forecast) are mostly used.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the causes of}} unemployment fluctuations in Quebec since 1962 according to age and sex. The author distinguishes between the cyclical and structural component of unemployment rates. Referring to the expansionary peak of 1966, he establishes that 50 % of {{the rise in the}} female unemployment rate is of structural matter, whereas 80 % of the rise in the youth unemployment rate comes from the demand deficiency. The structural factors appear in two groups of variables: the socio-demographic variables (the baby boom and the rise in the female participation rate) and the policy variables which include the generosity index of the unemployment insurance program, the relative minimum wage, and the relative earnings in the public and parapublic sector. This study shows that the policy factors have played a prominent part inside the structural component of unemployment rates during the 70 's, especially for young men. Nearly 60 % of the increase in the global structural unemployment rate since 1962 has been attributed to the government policies analyzed in this study, and nearly 30 % has been issued solely from the government wage policy. For the author, the most important step to jump in order to improve the employment situation in Quebec remains the elimination of the three percentage points of purely cyclical unemployment that persisted in 1980 and 1981 (7 to 9 in 1982). The second one would be to bring back the average earnings in the public and parapublic sector closer to the average earnings in the private sector. The introduction of these policies coupled with the <b>demographic</b> <b>forecast</b> of StatisticsCanada would give a better employment surrounding for youth, but would only slow down the increase in the female unemployment rates...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{assesses the}} {{possibility}} of raising the retirement age to mitigate the effects of ageing on the pension system of Russia. The authors make demographic forecasts based on hypotheses {{about the presence of}} global demographic trends in population reproduction and manifestations of development features specific for Russia. The <b>demographic</b> <b>forecast</b> is based on the age shifting method according to three scenarios. The forecast takes into account the provisions of a draft law that has already been approved and that provides for a gradual increase in age limit for civil servants, both men and women, to 65 years (by six months each year). The following assumption is made for the purpose of studying the effects of raising the retirement age to 65 years for all categories of Russian citizens. The increase in the retirement age begins in 2016 at the rate of 6 months per year, and it will end for men in 2026 and for women – in 2036. Thus, by 2036, the official retirement age will be 65 years for both sexes. The resulting forecasts show that population ageing in Russia is an inevitable process. Depending on whether demographic processes are in line with global trends or whether certain specific Russian features of development are revealed, ageing process will occur in the first case – “from above”, in the second case – “from below”. The forecast has confirmed a well-known paradox that if the situation regarding the decline in mortality is improved further, as has happened in recent years, then the pace of ageing that negatively affects the balance of the pension system will be even higher, at least in the medium term. Forecast calculations have shown that, first, demographic burden on the working population will continue to increase under any demographic development scenario implemented in Russia, and most significantly, under a scenario that describes a successful demographic policy. Second, the number of retirement age women is a significant potential reserve for decreasing the demographic burden on able-bodied population. It appears that raising the retirement age is feasible but it should be carefully prepared so as to be implemented gradually and accompanied by several additional measures...|$|E
