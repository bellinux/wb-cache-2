50|$|Uncinula necator (syn. Erysiphe necator) is {{a fungus}} that causes powdery mildew of grape. It {{is a common}} {{pathogen}} of Vitis species, including the wine grape, Vitis vinifera. The fungus {{is believed to have}} originated in North America. European varieties of Vitis vinifera are more or less susceptible to this fungus. Uncinula necator infects all green tissue on the grapevine, including leaves and young berries. It can cause crop loss and poor wine quality if untreated. The sexual stage of this pathogen requires <b>free</b> <b>moisture</b> to release ascospores from its cleistothecia in the spring. However, <b>free</b> <b>moisture</b> is not needed for secondary spread via conidia; high atmospheric humidity is sufficient. Its anamorph is called Oidium tuckeri.|$|E

50|$|Uredinia {{can develop}} 5 to 8 days after {{infection}} by urediniospores. The first urediniospores {{can be produced}} as early as 9 days after infection, and spore production can continue for up to 3 weeks. Uredinia may develop for up to 4 weeks after a single inoculation, and secondary uredinia will arise {{on the margins of}} the initial infections for an additional 8 weeks. Thus, from an initial infection, there could be first generation pustules that maintain sporulation for up to 15 weeks. Even under dry conditions this extended sporulation capacity allows the pathogen to persist and remain a threat. If conditions for re-infection are sporadic throughout the season, significant inoculum potential still remains from the initial infection to reestablish an epidemic. Successful infection is dependent on the availability of moisture on plant surfaces. At least 6 hours of <b>free</b> <b>moisture</b> is needed for infection with maximum infections occurring with 10 to 12 hours of <b>free</b> <b>moisture.</b> Temperatures between 15 and 28°C are ideal for infection.|$|E
5000|$|Rice blast is a {{significant}} problem in temperate regions {{and can be found}} in areas such as irrigated lowland and upland. Conditions conducive for rice blast include long periods of <b>free</b> <b>moisture</b> where leaf wetness is required for infection and high humidity is common. Sporulation increases with high relative humidity and at 77-82 degrees F, spore germination, lesion formation, and sporulation are at optimum levels.|$|E

50|$|Olive {{peacock spot}} {{disease is a}} {{worldwide}} agricultural problem and it thrives in similar conditions wherever it occurs. It depends on mild to low temperatures and <b>free</b> <b>moisture</b> to germinate and so it usually infects in the fall, winter, and spring. Hot and dry conditions in the summer cause the fungus to become inactivated and the leaf spots to turn white and crusted. During the summer, the diseased leaves fall leaving only the healthy ones on the partially defoliated trees. This provides a natural control for the disease. The disease also mainly infects young leaves in the spring.|$|E
50|$|Pseudomonas cichorii {{grows in}} warm, wet and humid areas. It spreads by wind driven rain and survives and infects on wet leaf surfaces.

In young plantings where the spears are not harvested, these spots develop into yellow, cup-shaped, spore-bearing aecia in {{concentric}} ring patterns. Air currents and splashing rains carry the microscopic golden aeciospores to the smaller branches, where they germinate and infect when <b>free</b> <b>moisture</b> as dew, fog, or rain is present [...] The common, brown, blister-like pustules (uredia) develop about two weeks later.|$|E
50|$|Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri overseason in {{infected}} area which is canker lesion on leaf or stem. The bacteria ooze {{out of the}} lesions when there is <b>free</b> <b>moisture.</b> During the rainy weather, wind-blown rain carries the inoculum to the new susceptible hosts. The bacteria infect new plants through stomata and wounds. The wound {{can be caused by}} pruning or hedging that could cut open mesophyll tissues for direct infection. The rain can also cause water congestion on leaf surface, form column of water through stomata and promote infection through the natural opening. The infection can form on fruit, foliage and young stem. The varied size of lesions on citrus fruit is because of the multiple cycle of infections.|$|E
5000|$|Temperature and {{moisture}} {{are the most}} important factors for germination and development of the pathogen on the plant, with moisture being most important of all. <b>Free</b> <b>moisture</b> must be present on susceptible leaves for at least one hour in order for germination of spores to occur. The pathogen can enter a healthy host in a variety of ways. With enough moisture, conidia directly penetrate through the cuticle and infect healthy cucurbits. Wounds to the plant, especially those left by feeding insects such as the striped cucumber beetle or aphids, are important passageways for the pathogen to enter in older hosts. [...] Other diseases, like Powdery Mildew, can also weaken a host enough to provide easy entry for D. bryoniae. After spore germination, symptoms can appear as soon as 7 days later.|$|E

50|$|Soil {{moisture}} sensors {{measure the}} volumetric water content in soil. Since the direct gravimetric measurement of <b>free</b> soil <b>moisture</b> requires removing, drying, and weighting of a sample, soil moisture sensors measure the volumetric water content indirectly by using some other {{property of the}} soil, such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant, or interaction with neutrons, {{as a proxy for}} the moisture content. The relation between the measured property and soil moisture must be calibrated and may vary depending on environmental factors such as soil type, temperature, or electric conductivity. Reflected microwave radiation is affected by the soil moisture and is used for remote sensing in hydrology and agriculture. Portable probe instruments can be used by farmers or gardeners.|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{the main}} {{process in a}} rotary vacuum drum filter is {{continuous}} filtration whereby solids are separated from liquids through a filter medium by a vacuum. The filter cloth {{is one of the}} most important components on a filter and is typically made of weaving polymer yarns. The best selection of cloth can increase the performance of filtration. Initially, slurry is pumped into the trough and as the drum rotates, it is partially submerged in the slurry. The vacuum draws liquid and air through the filter media and out the shaft hence forming a layer of cake. An agitator is used to regulate the slurry if the texture is coarse and it is settling rapidly. Solids that are trapped on the surface of the drum are washed and dried after 2/3 of revolution, removing all the <b>free</b> <b>moisture</b> 6.|$|E
5000|$|Halo blight {{seems to}} thrive when the {{temperatures}} are cooler. The optimal temperature for Pseudomonas Syringae to thrive is 20-23°C. Moist environments also allow {{the spread of}} this disease. The pathogen enters the plant through wounds or stomata and hydathodes during periods of high relative humidity or <b>free</b> <b>moisture.</b> Above 28°C, symptoms will usually not develop even though some water soaked spots may be present. [...] Rain splash can allow the disease to spread, especially {{when there is a}} prevailing wind to allow the bacteria to transmit even farther. The presence of an organism such as a human or animal can also allow for the spread of the disease. Contact from the mammal to an infected plant cause the bacteria to be carried wherever the organism goes. The mammal can spread the disease to a whole new environment and introduce the pathogen to new hosts.|$|E
50|$|The fungus {{has been}} able to {{establish}} resistance to both chemical treatments and genetic resistance in some types of rice developed by plant breeders. It is thought that the fungus can achieve this by genetic change through mutation. In order to most effectively control infection by M. grisea, an integrated management program should be implemented to avoid overuse of a single control method and fight against genetic resistance. For example, eliminating crop residue could reduce the occurrence of overwintering and discourage inoculation in subsequent seasons. Another strategy would be to plant resistant rice varieties that are not as susceptible to infection by M. grisea. Knowledge of the pathogenicity of M. grisea and its need for <b>free</b> <b>moisture</b> suggest other control strategies such as regulated irrigation and a combination of chemical treatments with different modes of action. Managing the amount of water supplied to the crops limits spore mobility thus dampening the opportunity for infection. Chemical controls such as Carpropamid have been shown to prevent penetration of the appressoria into rice epidermal cells, leaving the grain unaffected.|$|E

50|$|Once a {{production}} mould is obtained, a wax (hollow for larger sculptures) is then cast from the mould. For a hollow sculpture, a core is then cast into the void, and is retained in its proper location (after wax melting) by pins {{of the same}} metal used for casting. One or more wax sprues are added to conduct the molten metal into the sculptures - typically directing the liquid metal from a pouring cup {{to the bottom of}} the sculpture, which is then filled from the bottom up in order to avoid splashing and turbulence. Additional sprues may be directed upward at intermediate positions, and various vents may also be added where gases could be trapped. (Vents are not needed for ceramic shell casting, allowing the sprue to be simple and direct). The complete wax structure (and core, if previously added) is then invested in another kind of mould or shell, which is heated in a kiln until the wax runs out and all <b>free</b> <b>moisture</b> is removed. The investment is then soon filled with molten bronze. The removal of all wax and moisture prevents the liquid metal from being explosively ejected from the mould by steam and vapour.|$|E
40|$|Summary.

40|$|The {{performance}} of several important industrial processes, such as fluid coking or fluid catalytic cracking, {{is dependent on}} the good distribution of liquid feed sprayed into a fluidized bed of hot inert or catalytic particles, respectively. Liquid injected into a fluidized bed is distributed in three different ways: (i) <b>free</b> <b>moisture,</b> or liquid coating individual particles; (ii) wet micro-agglomerates, which are fluidized; and (iii) wet macro-agglomerates, which settle {{to the bottom of the}} bed. This study develops and evaluates various methods for the determination of this moisture. In the study using electrical techniques, two different kinds of electrodes geometries are considered, one single rod electrode and 5 separate plate wall electrodes. Several nozzles are used to spray water into a gas-solid fluidized bed: scaled-down versions of regular industrial nozzles and a nozzle (HALR) that uses an exceptionally high flowrate of atomization gas to provide a nearly perfect dispersion of the injected liquid on fluidized particles. Since the HALR nozzle does not form agglomerates, it is ideal to calibrate various methods for the measurement of the <b>free</b> <b>moisture.</b> The properties of the wet agglomerates that are formed during injection are determined with a method that is only suitable for small beds. A sugar solution as a binder is injected into a fluidized bed, and the bed is defluidized to preserve the initial agglomerates until the entire bed dries out. The agglomerates are collected, sorted in different size cuts, and their initial liquid content is estimated from their sugar concentration. The bed conductance is shown to provide an accurate measurement of the <b>free</b> <b>moisture</b> in both small and large fluidized beds. While plate wall electrodes provide the most accurate results, both experimental measurements and modeling results show how rod electrode geometry could provide reliable estimates of the <b>free</b> <b>moisture.</b> The rod electrode is applied in a large fluidized bed with commercial-scale spray nozzles to determine the best nozzle premixer and the best nozzle type. Finally, a model is developed for predicting the bed conductance, using COMSOL Multiphysics and considering the collected agglomerates properties. The model is fully validated with experimental data...|$|E
