40|$|The European Energy Policy has {{currently}} {{two main}} goals to reach: to minimize exposure to volatility of fossil fuel prices {{and to reduce}} of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To reach these targets a practical way, among the others {{is represented by the}} biogas production by anaerobic digestion (Bonoli et al., 2014) (AD) and its upgrading to biomethane. In this work the absorption of CO 2 is studied using a column working at atmospheric pressure and low temperature (5 99 %) and a stream of methane (> 99. 9 %) in order to reproduce a typical raw biogas composition, i. e. molar fraction of methane of about 0. 6. The internal temperature was monitored by a thermocouple and the inlet and outlet flow of biogas (G) was measured using a mass flowmeter while the water flow rate (L) was monitored using a magnetic <b>induction</b> <b>flowmeter.</b> The compositions were determined using a 3000 A micro-Gas Chromatograph Agilent, previously calibrated. The temperature was varied between 6. 5 and 20 °C and the water flow rate between about 0. 5 and 5 L/h. The composition of the gas exiting the micro-pilot plant was monitored every 5 minutes until the stationary condition...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{investigation}} and theoretical analysis of an electromagnetic flowmeter {{designed for use}} with dielectric liquids has been carried out. An extensive survey of the industrial users of flowmeters has been made, involving the participation of over 47 companies, which provides information about the current industrial use, attitudes and attributes of electromagnetic {{and other types of}} flowmeters. The design of the flowmeter is mainly concerned with overcoming the charge noise that is associated with the flow of dielectric liquids so as to effectively detect the weak flow signal. It is shown that the working of the flowmeter depends heavily on the design of the eddy current free electrostatic shield. The result of the mathematical analysis of the design is a simplified formula for predicting the sensitivity of the meter. It is adjusted to take account of such factors as end-effects and electrical properties of the flow conduit of the meter. Experimental results show that not only an <b>induction</b> <b>flowmeter</b> based on Faraday's principle is possible but also the measured values of the flow signal closely matches those obtained from the formula. It is suggested that the formula can be generalised to include moderately conducting liquids which is supported by results achieved from experiments on water. Finally, recommendations for future work are put forward for further improvement of the design...|$|E
40|$|The {{instantaneous}} flow-rate in high-pressure pipelines {{of fluid}} power {{systems can be}} predicted by means of refined numerical models, the performance of which should be validated extensively against experimental pressure transients. However, such an approach in complex hydraulic systems can require an advanced modelling of the hydraulic, mechanical and electronic components and can therefore be cumbersome and ineffective. Experimental analysis is valuable to support the fast and complete evaluation of integrated electronic-hydraulic power systems, i. e., reciprocating pumps equipped with sophisticated regulation devices, gasoline and diesel fuel injection apparatus, anti-lock braking systems and traction-control systems. However, {{the state of the}} art only allows the unsteady high-pressure liquid flows in these systems to be characterized in terms of the pressure time-history measured at fixed locations. The situation is particularly critical for volumetric pumps, since the main mission of these components is the high-pressure instantaneous delivered flow-rate and one main aspect concerning the final judgement of their performance is related to the flow-rate ripple, which can only be evaluated approximatel. The selection of the operating principle for the flow-rate measurement in high-pressure pipelines can be considered challenging because miniaturized devices, capable of operating at high-pressure levels and characterized by a superior dynamic performance, are required. Obstruction meters, which relate the fluid velocity to the measured pressure drop across a calibrated orifice, offer steady measurements and are therefore not suitable for transients. On the other hand, positive displacement, turbine, and Coriolis flowmeters cannot generally be used because of their relatively low dynamic response (the cut-off frequency can reach 1 kHz) and their excessive overall sizes. As far as magnetic <b>induction</b> based <b>flowmeters</b> is concerned, they are characterized by high dynamic performance, but these meters require fluids with electrical conductivity as low as 0. 1 S/cm, and diesel oil and gasoline both have much lower conductivity than this threshold. Finally, laser Doppler velocimetry-based techniques, which have been applied to the analysis of fluid dynamic transients in gasoline injection systems ([12]), imply a high initial setup cost, and are only applicable for laminar flows. Furthermore, these measurements require a pipe section made of quartz glass and this technique cannot therefore be applied when the pressure is higher than 100 bar. Flow-rate estimations, based on instantaneous pressure measurements, seem to be the most attractive opportunity, due to the superior dynamic response and the miniaturized sizes of the pressure transducers. Having assessed that pressure wave propagation occurs along a single direction, a mathematical relation exists between the pressure and flow-rate time-histories at any pipe section. On the other hand, the flow rate time-distribution cannot be inferred from the pressure time-history, measured at a single location, when the pressure waves travel back and forth through the pipeline, as usually occurs in engineering systems. An innovative methodology has been developed to evaluate the unsteady flow-rate in high-pressure pipelines, on the basis of the signals from two piezoelectric pressure transducers. A first-order non-linear ordinary differential equation was derived from Euler's momentum balance and mass conservation equations, and was numerically solved to compute the instantaneous mass flow-rate. The flowmeter working principle was validated successfully through a comparison with numerical flow-rate data, which were predicted by means of a reliable one-dimensional model of a CR fuel injection system, and satisfactory accuracy and repeatability of the measurements were proved. However, the flowmeter algorithm required knowledge of the initia...|$|R
