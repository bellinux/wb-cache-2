5|$|Forster wrote well-polished German prose, {{which was}} not only scientifically {{accurate}} and objective, but also exciting and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> This differed from conventional travel literature of the time, insofar as it presented {{more than a mere}} collection of data – it also demonstrated coherent, colourful and reliable ethnographical facts that resulted from detailed and sympathetic observation. He often interrupted the description to enrich it with philosophical remarks about his observations. His main focus was always on the people he encountered: their behavior, customs, habits, religions and forms of social organization. In A Voyage Round the World he even presented the songs sung by the people of Polynesia, complete with lyrics and notation. The book {{is one of the most}} important sources concerning the societies of the Southern Pacific from the times before European influence had become significant.|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that were <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> {{something}} {{she felt she}} was unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, and him being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have.|$|E

The AT laboratory eventually released their own STREAMS library, which incorporated much of the same functionality in a software stack with a different architecture, but the wide distribution of the existing sockets library reduced the impact of the new API. Early versions of BSD were used to form Sun Microsystems' SunOS, founding the first wave of popular Unix workstations.|$|E

25|$|Microblogging: Microblogging is the {{practice}} of posting small pieces of digital content—which could be text, pictures, links, short videos, or other media—on the Internet. Microblogging offers a portable communication mode that feels organic and spontaneous to many users. It has captured the public imagination, {{in part because the}} short posts are <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> on the go or when waiting. Friends use it to keep in touch, business associates use it to coordinate meetings or share useful resources, and celebrities and politicians (or their publicists) microblog about concert dates, lectures, book releases, or tour schedules. A wide and growing range of add-on tools enables sophisticated updates and interaction with other applications. The resulting profusion of functionality is helping to define new possibilities for this type of communication. Examples of these include Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and, by far the largest, WeiBo.|$|E
25|$|Frindall {{was also}} known for {{producing}} scoring charts for many of his tours with England. He modified the linear scoring system invented by John Atkinson Pendlington and developed by Australian scorer Bill Ferguson into a version that {{is known as the}} Frindall system. Frindall met Ferguson in 1953, when he was 14 years old. The concentration needed to maintain such consistently high-quality work was immense, and Frindall believed it was his time in the RAF that prepared him for the task. Writing honed by his training to be an architect meant that each page was beautifully laid out and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Every scorecard, like the wagon-wheels he produced to show where a batsman scored his runs after playing a significant innings, was a work of art. Frindall's work was so meticulously accurate that the commentators would habitually trust his figures if they differed from the official scoreboard.|$|E
25|$|The {{print of}} the Goražde Psalter is clean, clear, and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> The text in red was printed first, {{followed}} by the text in black. The faces of the cast metal types used for its printing were designed {{in the manner of}} uncial Cyrillic of medieval Serbian manuscripts, with certain elements of cursive. Ordinary text is printed in black letters with the corpus size of 2.7millimetres. Their strokes have moderately varying widths; their ascenders and descenders are also of moderate sizes. In the first 136 leaves, a block of ten lines of text written in these letters is 74millimetres high, and there are usually 18 to 20, though occasionally 21, lines per page. In the other leaves, the ten-line block is 70millimetres high, with mostly 22 lines per page, and word spacing is tighter than {{in the first part of}} the book. Somewhat larger letters, 5 to 6millimetres high, appear at the beginning of some sentences; they can be black or red. Headings and lines at the beginning of textual units are printed in red. Among the punctuation marks used in the book are the indexes and symbols in the form of a fish, horn, and quadruple dot.|$|E

500|$|Meic Pearse of Third Way {{magazine}} {{described the}} style of the collection as [...] "funny yet depressing, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> yet extremely profound." [...] Publishers Weekly considered the writing to be [...] "graceful and often witty", although the [...] "main points get hammered home too quickly and too often". Doctor D. of the National Review considered the style to be [...] "extraordinary", with [...] "clear and penetrating prose" [...] that was [...] "always fearless for the truth". James R. Otteson, in his novel Actual Ethics, spoke of how Dalrymple [...] "does not employ the facts and figures", but [...] "relies instead on his anecdotal experience".

500|$|Bede is {{described}} by Michael Lapidge as [...] "without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period". His Latin has been praised for its clarity, but his style in the Historia Ecclesiastica is not simple. He knew rhetoric, and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation, depending as they often do on the connotations of the Latin words. However, unlike contemporaries such as Aldhelm, whose Latin is full of difficulties, Bede's own text is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> In the words of Charles Plummer, {{one of the best-known}} editors of the Historia Ecclesiastica, Bede's Latin is [...] "clear and limpid... it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence...

500|$|Maurice Richardson, in The Observer, thought You Only Live Twice [...] "though {{far from}} the best Bond, is really almost as <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> as any of them". He was {{critical}} {{of a number of}} aspects, saying that the [...] "narrative is a bit weak, action long delayed and disappointing when it comes but the surround of local colour... has been worked over with that unique combination of pubescent imagination and industry which is Mr. Fleming's speciality." [...] In The Guardian, Francis Iles wrote that [...] "I think he [...] must be getting tired of the ineffable James Bond and perhaps even of writing thrillers at all". Iles reasoned that [...] "of the 260 pages of You Only Live Twice...only 60 are concerned with the actual business of a thriller", and his enjoyment was further diminished by what he considered [...] "the grossness of Bond's manners and his schoolboy obscenities".|$|E
500|$|A McKinsey book, In Search of Excellence, was {{published}} in 1982. It featured eight characteristics of successful businesses based on an analysis of 43 top performing companies. It {{became one of the}} most influential and highly read management books and marked the beginning of McKinsey's shift from accounting to [...] "softer" [...] aspects of management, like skills and culture. In Search of Excellences distribution prompted others, including McKinsey consultants, to write more management books. According to David Guest from King's College, In Search of Excellence became popular among business managers because it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> well-marketed and some of its core messages were valid. However, it was disliked by academics because of flaws in its methodology. Additionally, a 1984 analysis by BusinessWeek found that many of those companies identified as [...] "excellent" [...] in the book no longer met the criteria only two years later.|$|E

After late June, when a new command was installed, the family was forbidden from fraternizing with the guards and the conditions of their imprisonment became even more stringent.|$|E

500|$|Views in the U.S. press were mixed. In {{a review}} for The New York Times, current U.S. {{ambassador}} to the United Nations, Harvard scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winner Samantha Power described the book as a [...] "raging and often meandering assault" [...] on U.S. foreign policy. Believing that Chomsky divides the world into two camps, the oppressor and the oppressed, she asserts that in Hegemony or Survival he portrays the U.S. as [...] "the prime oppressor, [...] can do no right", meanwhile overlooking the crimes of the oppressed. Arguing that he completely ignores the concept that the U.S. might undertake any foreign interventions with good intentions, she asserts that his book is not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> and that his [...] "glib and caustic tone" [...] are distracting. Furthermore, she highlights problems with his use of end notes, particularly when some of these notes simply reference his earlier publications. Although disagreeing with his arguments, she believed that reading his book was [...] "sobering and instructive", having value in illustrating how many non-Americans viewed the U.S. and highlighting many of the [...] "structural defects" [...] in U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, recognizing that Chomsky's [...] "critiques have come to influence and reflect mainstream opinion elsewhere in the world," [...] she concedes that Chomksy's analysis has a coherence that, for many, resolves much of the post-9/11 confusion and disillusionment stemming from the Bush administration's standard response to the question, [...] "Why do they hate us?".|$|E
500|$|The author Nicholas Tucker {{notes that}} it was common to see Blyton cited as people's {{favourite}} or least favourite author according to their age, and argues that her books create an [...] "encapsulated world for young readers that simply dissolves with age, leaving behind only memories of excitement and strong identification". Fred Inglis considers Blyton's books to be technically <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> but to also be [...] "emotionally and cognitively easy". He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality. Woods surmised that Blyton [...] "was a child, she thought as a child, and wrote as a child... the basic feeling is essentially pre-adolescent... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas... Inevitably Enid Blyton was labelled by rumour a child-hater. If true, such a fact {{should come as no}} surprise to us, for as a child herself all other children can be nothing but rivals for her." [...] Inglis argues though that Blyton was clearly devoted to children and put an enormous amount of energy into her work, with a powerful belief in [...] "representing the crude moral diagrams and garish fantasies of a readership". Blyton's daughter Imogen has stated that she [...] "loved a relationship with children through her books", but real children were an intrusion, and there was no room for intruders in the world that Blyton occupied through her writing.|$|E
500|$|Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle {{began with}} an {{inspiration}} of the four-member team, Clamp, to link their works set in a realistic world with their works set in different fantasy worlds. Prior to beginning work on Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Clamp had created the manga Cardcaptor Sakura, from which the two main characters are taken. Clamp decided to draw Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle by using a style first conceived by Osamu Tezuka, named the [...] "father of manga" [...] and often credited as the [...] "father of anime", known as Osamu Tezuka's Star System. In this system, characters with the same name and design are used in different settings, drawing mostly from the vast character pool of its own works and occasionally from others' works. Unlike characters under the Star System, three {{months prior to the}} release of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, the Young Magazine began serializing Clamp's xxxHolic, a manga whose two main characters, Kimihiro Watanuki and Yūko Ichihara, are two of the same characters used in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle; both series run in parallel. Like many of their other works, each member of Clamp had a role different from their other projects instead of retaining set roles. For Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Mokona drew the main characters, whereas Tsubaki Nekoi and Satsuki Igarashi drew the side characters and backgrounds; Nanase Ohkawa was the sole person in charge of the storyline; the other members of Clamp were not told in advance how the plot would unfold. The word [...] "Tsubasa" [...] was used so that the title would be <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> However, believing [...] "Tsubasa" [...] only would be too short, they added the words [...] "Chronicle" [...] and [...] "Reservoir" [...] from Nekoi's notes.|$|E
