In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly.

T.R. got to come out and I got to say to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay.

[...] Three passengers – Michael O'Connor, Kevin Blum, and Mark McEntee – tackled Ferguson and pinned him {{to one of}} the train's seats. Several other passengers ran forward to grab his arms and legs and help hold him pinned across a three-seat row with his head towards the window and legs towards the aisle. While he was pinned, Ferguson said, [...] "Oh God, what <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> What <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> I deserve whatever I get." [...] He also repeatedly pleaded with those holding him, [...] "Don't shoot me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry." [...] Five to six people continued to hold him pinned for some time while they awaited relief. While those who had not tackled him, but were holding him down, inquired as to the location of the gun, they were assured that it had been kicked away and that there had only been one gunman. Most, if not all passengers still in the car were concerned that no further violence take place and that the shooter be held rather than attacked. He was held down for several minutes. Soon, Andrew Roderick, an off-duty Long Island Rail Road police officer who was picking up his wife from the train, boarded the train car and handcuffed Ferguson.|$|E

2500|$|Mayhew {{learned of}} a casting call for Star Wars, which was filming in London, {{and decided to}} audition.

5000|$|The song's release came {{shortly after}} their {{previous}} single, [...] "So Long", performed disappointingly {{in terms of}} charts and sales.

The song's popularity was boosted (particularly in Australia) by {{the release of a}} promo clip shown on television. The song, presumably because of its title as much as the sentiment, is popular at weddings and was featured in the film Muriel's Wedding, when the ABBA-mad title character gets married.|$|R
