The test is carried out at the (National product processing company dishes and tubes production). Usually, the final products (tubes) undergo a series of non-destructive inspection online and offline welding, and obviously destructive mechanical testing (bending, flattening, flaring, etc.). For this and for the purpose of implementing the <b>flattening</b> <b>test,</b> which applies to the processing of round tubes in other forms, it took four sections of welded tubes draft (before stretching hot) and welded tubes finished (after drawing hot and annealing), it was also noted the report 'health' flattened tubes must not show or crack or tear.

40|$|Friction Flash to Tube (F 2 T) is an {{innovative}} friction based manufacturing technique to produce seamless tubes based on open die forging, invented at Aalto University. These tubes {{can be produced}} economically in small sizes and batches, envisaging applications of high value materials that are not available in the market. The objective of this Master thesis was to develop the experimental condition of F 2 T {{as well as the}} proper parameters in F 2 T by approaching Taguchi method. The pre-defined parameters to investigate in Taguchi method were established as forging force, tool rotation and initial transient plunging depth and the investigating of geometrical and metallurgical characteristics were done. Cold rolled high strength and low alloy structural steel S 355 is the material used in this research work. The parameters of the F 2 T process were developed based on design of experiments, with geometrical and hardness properties as performance parameters. The optimized conditions and parameters were applied to produce tubes for extensive evalua-tion of the mechanical and metallurgical material properties. The F 2 T process has specific components and control demands that cannot be met by the existing manufacturing systems. This challenge was overcome by developing one first version of a dedicated system based on an existent Friction Stir Welding equipment. One additional challenge was to produce tubes longer than 40 mm because of buckling. The buckling was prevented by implementing a lateral support system constraining the consumable rod during the initial transient plunging period. The test specimens for extensive mechanical test and metallurgical analysis were extracted from tubes produced with 80 mm in length. These longer tubes were manufactured using the support system to prevent buckling. The results on tensile test, <b>flattening</b> <b>test</b> and flare test of F 2 T tube reveal that the mechanical properties of produced tubes are as good as tube of similar material produced by another manufacturing technique. The temperature during the application of the F 2 T process was monitored with thermo-couples. The mechanical properties of produced tubes were evaluated by hardness meas-urement of cross and longitudinal sections. Tensile test were applied to sub-sections of wall of the tubes, and flare and <b>flattening</b> <b>test</b> to the whole tubes. The metallurgical analysis encompasses optical microscopic analysis, and SEM/EBSD with grain size evaluation.

40|$|AbstractSteel {{plates and}} pipes, {{widely used in}} industries, are {{generally}} required to examine their plasticity according to bending and flattening tests. To clearly understand large deformation behaviors in bending and flattening tests, finite element models were created to simulate the evolution of bending and flattening by using Abaqus software, and experiments were carried out to verify the simulated results. It was found that classical Lagrangian method tracking material particles was difficult to cope with large deformation due to severe distortion of elements, while the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method combining the advantages of Lagrangian and Eulerian methods was very attractive for solving such issues. The simulated results based on ALE method were dependent on mesh size and contact parameters to some extent, with decreasing the mesh size the portion of yielded elements increased and the spring-back decreased, and the friction could effectively constrain the relative slide of contact pairs and reduce the separation of former from plates. The simulations showed acceptable agreement with the bending and <b>flattening</b> <b>test</b> results. However, some available criteria in current standards, without concern for neutral plane shifting, ignored the separation of former from plates and hence gave values lower than the actual strain, which might lead to incorrect assessment.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the thesis, failure modes and fatigue {{behavior}} of laser welds in lap-shear specimens of HSLA steel sheets are investigated based on experimental observations and finite element analyses. The optical micrographs of failed specimens show that laser welds failed in the base metal due to the necking/shear of the load carrying sheets towards weld face under quasi-static loading conditions and in the HAZ due to the kinked fatigue crack propagating through the load carrying sheets towards the weld root under cyclic loading conditions. Elastic-plastic finite element analyses are conducted to explain the ductile failure and effects of the sheet thickness on the failure modes under quasi-static loading conditions. A kinked fatigue crack growth model based on the computational global and local stress intensity factor solutions for finite kinked cracks and a structural stress model based on the closed-form structural stress solutions of the beam bending theory are adopted to estimate the fatigue lives of the laser welds. Approximate stress intensity factor solutions as functions of the normalized weld width are 2 proposed for the right pre-existing crack tip of the load carrying thinner sheet. The effect of weld gap is also investigated based on the computational stress intensity factor solutions and an analytical structural stress model. In the second part of the thesis, Niobium-clad and polymer-graphite coated stainless steel sheets were examined for their ductility and formability. The effects of annealing temperature and time on the mechanical behavior and failure mechanisms of Nb-clad 304 L stainless steel sheets were investigated under uniaxial tensile, bending and <b>flattening</b> <b>tests.</b> Nano-indentation tests indicated that the intermetallic layer formed due to the annealing process exhibits much higher values of hardness and elastic modulus as compared to those of the stainless steel and Nb sheets.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the flattening equation, which relates {{the shape of}} the dark halo to the angular velocity dispersions and the density of a tracer population of stars. It assumes spherical alignment of the velocity dispersion tensor, as seen in the data on stellar halo stars in the Milky Way. The angular anisotropy and gradients in the angular velocity dispersions drive the solutions towards prolateness, whilst the gradient in the stellar density is a competing effect favouring oblateness. We provide an efficient numerical algorithm to integrate the <b>flattening</b> equation. Using <b>tests</b> on mock data, we show that the there is a strong degeneracy between circular speed and flattening, which can be circumvented with informative priors. Therefore, we advocate the use of the <b>flattening</b> equation to <b>test</b> for oblateness or prolateness, though the precise value of the flattening q can only be measured with the addition of the radial Jeans equation. We apply the flattening equation to a sample extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey of ∼ 15000 halo stars with full phase space information and errors. We find that between Galactocentric radii of 5 and 10 kpc, {{the shape of the}} dark halo is prolate, whilst even mildly oblate models are disfavoured. Strongly oblate models are ruled out.

The <b>tested</b> <b>flattened</b> tubes have the same equivalent internal diameter of 2. 2 mm, but different aspect height/width ratios (H/W) of 1 / 4, 1 / 2, 2 and 4. The experimental data were compared against results for circular tubes using R 134 a and R 245 fa as working fluids at a nominal saturation temperature of 31 degrees C. For mass velocities higher than 200 kg/m(2) s, the flattened and circular tubes presented similar heat transfer coefficients. Such a behavior {{is related to the}} fact that stratification effects are negligible under conditions of higher mass velocities. Heat transfer correlations from the literature, usually developed using only circular-channel experimental data, predicted the flattened tube results for mass velocities higher than 200 kg/m(2) s with mean absolute error lower than 20 % using the equivalent diameter to account for the geometry effect. Similarly, the critical heat flux results were found to be independent of the tube aspect ratio when the same equivalent length was kept. Equivalent length is a new parameter which takes into account the channel heat transfer area. The CHF correlations for round tubes predicted the flattened tube data relatively well when using the equivalent diameter and length. Furthermore, a new proposed CHF correlation predicted the present flattened tube data with a mean absolute error of 5 %. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Often copper tubing is connected to pressurized containers as a make-shift jet stream for reorienting elements on the assembly line. These makeshift jets when working in conjunction create noise pollution. By manipulating the exit of these small jets, it is hypothesized that the noise level can be decreased. Using the National Center for Physical Acoustics (NCPA) at the University of Mississippi, three geometry alterations—deburring the end, creating a converging-diverging nozzle, and <b>flattening</b> the end—were <b>tested</b> on these small jets against a control (that still had the burrs and smaller diameter from the pipe cut) to determine {{the validity of the}} hypothesis.

However, by performing an uncertainty analysis and investigating the volumetric flow rate of the control, two discrepancies were uncovered: the flow rate for the control was less than the variables and the volumetric flow readout had its own amount of uncertainty. It was found that both the deburred and converging-diverging jets eliminated a tonal frequency that occurred with the control jet.

Seed shadows were obtained in the field under natural conditions, using wind speeds between four and ten m/s. The flight of individual seeds was followed by eye, and seed shadows were acquired, with median distances varying from 0. 7 to 3. 1 m between species. Multiple regression models of wind speed and seed weight on dispersal distance were significant for six out of ten species; wind speed had significant effects in seven cases, but seed weight only once. A good correlation between mean terminal falling velocity of the seeds of a species and median dispersal distance, indicates the promising explanatory power that individual terminal velocity data might have on dispersal distance, together with wind speed and turbulence. The theory that seeds {{that seem to be}} adapted to wind dispersal travel much longer distances than seeds that have no adaptation was <b>tested.</b> <b>Flattened</b> and winged seeds were indeed found to be transported further by wind, but not much further. Moreover, the species with wind-adapted seeds were also taller, being an alternative explanation since their seeds experienced higher wind speeds at these greater heights. Furthermore, flattened and winged seeds were disseminated from ripe umbels at lower wind speeds in the laboratory. This means that the observed difference in dispersal distance would have been smaller when species specific thresholds for wind speed were incorporated in the field experiments. We argue therefore, that seed morphology is not always the best predictor in classifying species in groups with distinctly different dispersal ability...|$|R

Fielddata, microfacies data - qualitative as well as quantitative with respect to PIB ratios and frequency distributions of larger foraminifera - and the analysis of some 30 samples with smaller benthonic foraminifera resulted in a detailed reconstruction of the northern foreslope of the Avedat plateau with special reference to the paleo-bathymetry of autochthonous and allochthonous sediments. Biometric data on the outer and inner morphology of Asterocyclina from about 30 samples and the inner morphology of Discocyclina from 17 samples were analysed. The outer morphological data of Asterocyclina suggest an irregular increase of the test size {{in the course of}} the time combined with a relative <b>flattening</b> of the <b>test.</b> The inner morphological data prove distinct heterogeneity in Asterocyclina and Discocyclina. In Asterocyclina two groups are recognized on the basis of the size of the embryon and the degree of enclosure of the embryonic chambers (R). The data suggest an increase {{in the course of the}} time of R and the size of the embryon. These parameters serve to subdivide the assemblages into biometric units: A. taramellii and A. stella in the group with a small embryon; A. cuvillieri and A. sp. in the group with a large embryon. Furthermore another "species" cf. Asterophragmina pagoda is separated on the basis of the reduction of radial chamber walls in the median layer. In Discocyclina three groups are recognized on the combinations of outer morphological characters and inner morphology. These are D. varians s. 1., D. archiaci and D. sp. None of them shows evolutionary trends, but there are extreme differences in morphology between different samples. The depth profile, the frequency distributions of the larger foraminifera and the morphological characters of A. taramellii, A stella and D. varians s. l. were compared. Asterocyclina shows a preference for the upper foreslope environment. Discocyclina is more frequent in the lower foreslope. The large overlap in depth range suggests a further niche segregation by means of other environmental parameters, possibly by means of substrate or vegetation dependency. In Asterocyclina, and possibly also in Discocyclina the <b>test</b> becomes more <b>flattened</b> with increasing depth. The evolution within Asterocyclina is considered as an example ofquantum speciation. The data suggest that with the change of A. taramellii to A. stella a change of habitat occurred. D. varians is considered as an "elastic" species, which may adapt to widely different subenvironments and show corresponding morphological variation. A hierarchy of morphological features is proposed, which may be used for discrimination on family, subfamily, genus and species level within the Discocyclinidae. Lower ranked features become increasingly environment controlled and may provide information on ecology. The origin of the Discocyclinidae is discussed. It is suggested that they are derived from peripheral isolates of Lepidorbitoides minor and L. socialis which passed the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. A subsequent radiation, possibly via A. taramellii and D. augustae resulted in at least three different lineages in the subfamily Asterocyclininae and at least two in the subfamily Discocyclininae, each with its own rate of evolution...|$|R
40|$|Planktonic foraminifera are marine, calcite {{secreting}} protists. They have a {{long history}} of study in both industry and academia. Individual species show distinct biogeographical distributions and ecological tolerances. Traditionally species concepts are based on the gross morphology of the foraminiferal test. The closer the morphology of two species, the closer they are related. This has resulted in a single species being named by several authors from differing global locations and also, in long lived species, differing time intervals. This work investigates morphological variation of Late Pleistocene – Holocene menardiform globorotalids, and links this morphological variation to different ecological and environmental conditions. To achieve this 70 global sample sites are investigated covering a range of differing environmental conditions, but within constrained time limits. Where possible samples dated as Holocene have been used, where absolute dating was unavailable samples from about the Emiliani huxleyi acme zone, giving an upper age is given of 65 – 70 thousand years. Analysis of morphological variation allowed identification ofintergrading morphoclines and a total of six distinct morphotypes (e. g. the menardi-form morphotypes α, β, χ and η and the two tumid form morphotypes ε and φ). The morphotypes are shown to have distinct though overlapping biogeographic distributions. In the bivariate morphospace of spiral height versus axial diameter the equation y = 2. 07 x – 15 separates morphocline(G. menardii morphologies) from morphocline(G. tumida morphologies). Within morphoclinethe line with equation y = 3. 2 x – 160 separates morphotypes α (G. menardii menardii) from morphotype β (G. menardii cultrata). Morphotype β is interpreted as G. menardii cultrata and is seen to dominate environments with mean annual sea surface temperatures over 25 °C. Morphotype α is interpreted as G. menardii menardii and becomes more dominant as sea surface temperatures become cooler. In areas where both morphologies are present in a sample we interpreted the situations a vicariant trophic depth adoption. G. menardii cultrata lives at shallow depths, while G. menardii menardii occurs deeper within the water column. This interpretation is supported by stable isotope studies carried out on samples from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean region where the two morphologies show significantly different isotopic signals. G. menardii cultrata morphologically has a <b>flattened</b> smooth <b>test</b> with little secondary encrusting, while isotopically it has a shallow depth habitat and possible symbiotic relationship. G. menardii menardii morphometrically shows greater inflation and encrusting of the test and isotopically it shows a deeper and colder depth habitat. The presence of all ontogenetic stages within the two recognized morphological groups with distinct isotopic signatures, suggests that G. menardii may have two distinct subpopulations living at different depths within the Caribbean. Ultrastructural studies on adult forms of morphotypes α and β from the same size fractions taken from a single sample, show that differences are present even in juvenile growth stages. Prolocular size and rate of growth suggest that morphotype α has a r-selected (rapid growth, opportunistic) mode of life. While morphotype β is k-selected (longer living, symbiont bearing, specialist) mode of life. Morphotype η is interpreted as G. menardii gibberula this is the highest spired morphotype within the G. menardii group and is found only at the southerly extent of the sample set. Specimens have been identified in sample sites from the Western Pacific, which extends its known biogeographic range. It also has the highest spire of all the menardii forms and shows a correlation to the coldest sea surface temperatures. Morphotype χ is only found in the northern part of the Indian Ocean and is interpreted as G. menardii neoflexuosa. It has a distinct flexure of the final chamber, but with removal of the final “flexed” chamber, the morphotype falls within morphotype β morphospace, to which is shows similar textural structure. The cause of the flexing is not clear, but as it is found in increased numbers during the summer monsoon, it has been suggested that it is a response to lowered salinity and an increase in turbidity of the surface waters. Within morphocline 2 morphotype ε (G. tumida) is seen to intergrade the morphologically similar but texturally different morphotype φ (G. ungulata). The diminutive size and delicate structure of G. ungulata is suggestive of it being the shallow dwelling juvenile form with being G. tumida the deeper dwelling more robust adult form. However, isotopic studies show differing depth habitats for the two morphotypes, with the heavier encrusted G. tumida showing a constantly deeper signal than the smoother more delicate form of G. ungulata, when comparing size equivalent specimens from the same sample sites. The first occurrence of G. ungulata is unclear but is believed to occur during the late Pleistocene. Because of this the results are interpreted as indicating ecophenotypic variation within a species, rather than just ontogenetic variation, with morphotype φ representing the shallow dwelling morphology, and morphotype ε the deeper dwelling morphology. Secondary encrusting of all specimens used in this present study indicates that encrusting is a function of which the foraminifera lived an not an indication of its stage of ontogeny or gametogenesis...|$|R
