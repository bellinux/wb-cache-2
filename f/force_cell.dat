50|$|Cell fenders {{are best}} {{employed}} for small or large vessels where reaction force {{is an important}} criterion. Among all types of fenders, cell fenders offer minimum reaction per ton-meter energy absorbed. The very geometric shape gives it sturdiness, shear resistance, compact structure {{and the capacity to}} absorb energy equally from all directions. The Cylindrical buckling column absorbs axial loads effectively and buckles radially. This results in multi-directional dispersion of energy. Cell fenders are the most durable rubber fenders available and are currently the largest moulded fenders made. 2000-2500 mm high cell fenders are typically used for LNG berths. In order to distribute the reaction <b>force,</b> <b>cell</b> fenders are typically supplied with large fender panels, which keeps the hull pressure low.|$|E

40|$|Currently {{available}} experimental {{tools such}} as microarrays and qRT-PCR for studying the genomes and gene expression in mixed populations of environmental bacteria generally require relatively large amounts of starting material (DNA or RNA), and provide population-averaged data. Although these experimental tools provide valuable insights into microbial communities, the pooling of samples severs {{the link between the}} genotype and phenotype of each individual cell. We are developing high-throughput tools for studying bacteria one cell at a time, allowing us to unravel the complicated dynamics of population, gene expression, and metabolic function in mixed microbial communities. Three microfluidic technologies have been developed to enable these studies: (1) automated 16 S rRNA FISH for identification of microbial cells in a mixed sample, (2) photonic <b>force</b> <b>cell</b> sorting for selectively isolating a species of interest (3) encapsulation of individual cells in picoliter-volume droplets, followed by genetic analysis. These three technologies can be coupled to one another, allowing, e. g. FISH-based identification of a rare species, followed enrichment of the rare species of interest by photonic <b>force</b> <b>cell</b> sorted, followed by single-cell encapsulation and PCR analysis. The droplet technology in particular allows us to scale down conventional (microliter-volume) assays, such as PCR, into much smaller reaction volumes better suited to the size of an individual microbe. By dramatically reducing the reaction volume, the effective concentration of template is increased, reducing amplification artifacts that often arise in single-cell reactions carried out at a conventional scale. Droplets can be generated rapidly (hundreds per second), with very good uniformity in size (< 5 percent variation in droplet diameter), allowing high throughput experiments to be conducted with much better precision than is possible with conventional emulsion techniques. These technologies are currently under development with simple laboratory strains of E. coli and other well-characterized organisms such as D. Vulgaris, and upon validation will then be translated to studying more complex mixed cultures and environmental samples...|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the mitochondrial and cellular effects of the lipoxygenase inhibitor MK 886. Low concentrations (1 uM) of MK 886 selectively sensitized the permeability transition pore (PTP) to opening, whereas higher concentrations of MK 886 (10 uM) caused depolarization through combination of an ionophoretic effect with inhibition of respiration. MK 886 killed prostate cancer PC 3 cells only at the higher, toxic concentration (10 uM), whereas the lower concentration (1 uM) had no major effect on cell survival. However, 1 uM MK 886 alone demonstrably induced PTP-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction; and it caused cell death through the mitochondrial pathway when it was used {{in combination with the}} cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, which had no effects per se. Treatment with 1 uM MK 886 plus indomethacin sensitized cells to killing by exogenous arachidonic acid, which induces PTP opening and cytochrome c release (Scorrano, L., Penzo, D., Petronilli, V., Pagano, F., and Bernardi, P.

40|$|Despite their {{biological}} complexity, animals, living tissues and cells, the smallest unit of live, {{are subjected to}} physical principles. In living tissues, permanent or transient regulation processes, such as biochemical and mechanical interactions between a single cell and its environment are essential to develop tissue structure and function. These interactions {{play a major role}} in biological processes such as differentiation and gene expression of cells. In contrast, metastatic cancer cells escape such regulations. These cells proliferate and migrate through tissues unregulated, ignoring input from environment. Their mechanical and adhesion properties are drastically different than those of non-tumour cells. The presented studies describe experiments which mimic conditions in vivo by applying uniaxial stress to a single living cell under physiological conditions. Simultaneously, applied <b>force,</b> <b>cell</b> deformation and cellular shape are determined with highest accuracy. Uniaxial deformation is applied to a single cell which adheres between two parallel glass plates. Such mechanical assays accomplished at constant displacement or constant force allow for quantifying cellular viscoelastic properties and for describing the data by using linear force relations or the Kelvin model. Biolipids such as sphingosylphosphorylcholine and lysophosphatidic acid modulated the cytoskeleton architecture which showed to cause fatal consequences for mechanical properties of rat embryonic fibroblasts and human pancreatic cancer cells. Cellular stiffening or softening, power generation and energy consumption upon cellular contraction of a single cell are quantitatively measured.

The purpose of this study was to find added mass on human swimmers and investigate the effect of shape and body size. Thirty subjects were connected to a 2. 8 m long bar with handles, attached with springs (stiffness k= 318 N/m) and a <b>force</b> <b>cell.</b> By oscillating this system vertically and registering the period of oscillations it was possible to find the added mass of the swimmer, given the known masses of the bar and swimmer. Relative added mass (Ma%) for boys, women and men were, respectively, 26. 8 ± 2. 9 %, 23. 6 ± 1. 6 % and 26. 8 ± 2. 3 % of the subjects total mass. This study reported significantly lower added mass (p< 0. 001) and relative added mass (p< 0. 002) for women compared to men, which indicate that the possible body shape differences between genders may be an important factor for determining added mass. Boys had significantly lower (p< 0. 001) added mass than men. When added mass was scaled for body size there were no significant differences (p= 0. 996) between boys and men, which indicated that body size is an important factor that influences added mass. The added mass in this study seems to be lower and within a smaller range than previously reported ([Klauck, 1999] and [Eik et al., 2008]). It is concluded that the added mass in human swimmers, in extended gliding position, is approximately 1 / 4 of the subjects’ body mass...|$|E

A provocative test was developed in which surface pressure was increased in increments of 3. 7 mmHg until perfusion reached an apparent minimum by a computer-controlled plunger that included a <b>force</b> <b>cell,</b> a laser Doppler flowmeter to determine perfusion, and a thermistor to monitor skin temperature. Force {{was applied to the}} greater trochanters of adult male fuzzy rats. Skin perfusion (n= 7) initially increased with low levels of surface pressure (up to 13. 9 ± 1. 9 mmHg) and then decreased with further increases in pressure, reaching minimum (zero) perfusion at 58. 2 ± 3. 64 mmHg. After pressure release, reactive hyperemia (3 × normal) was observed, with levels returning to normal within 15 - 30 min. The provocative test was then applied after a 5 -hr ischemic episode (produced by 92 mmHg) and 3 hr of recovery. A comparison of responses between stressed and unstressed skin revealed: elevated (63 %) control perfusion levels; loss of the initial increase in perfusion with low levels of increasing pressure; a depression (45 %) in the hyperemic response with delayed recovery time; and a decrease (54 %) in amplitude of low frequency (< 1 Hz) rhythms in skin perfusion. Skin surface temperature gradually increased both during the control period and the period of incremental increases in surface pressure (total ∆T= 3. 3 °C). The results suggest a compromised vasodilator mechanism(s).
