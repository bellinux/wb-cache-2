2500|$|According to the Russian defense minister, {{the hijackers}} {{approached}} the ship on July 24 on an inflatable boat with a purported engine problem, and were thus taken aboard by the crew. The alleged hijackers denied that any hijacking attempt took place, {{claiming to be}} environmentalists who were {{picked up by the}} ship after their boat had run out of fuel. Eleven crew members (the captain and several others remained on the ship) were returned to Moscow and held in isolation as witnesses that, quoting Alexander Bastrykin, First <b>Deputy</b> <b>Prosecutor</b> <b>General</b> of Russia, [...] "need to be immediately interrogated." [...] The Finnish National Bureau of Investigation was not supplied any information on why the crew was being held, and if they were suspected of any wrongdoing. The Russian Foreign Ministry announced that, when captured by the Russian warship, the captain initially claimed that the ship was North Korean, which was subsequently denied by Pyongyang. An attorney representing one of the alleged hijackers stated that it was the captain of the ship who prevented the men (purportedly stranded environmentalists) from disembarking the ship and who actually led her towards the western coast of Africa. Nine of the eleven detained crewmen returned home to Arkhangelsk on August 29; the remaining two ostensibly were released at a later date. In the meanwhile, the investigating authorities have placed a gag order on the crew, with a penalty of up to 7 years in prison.|$|E
