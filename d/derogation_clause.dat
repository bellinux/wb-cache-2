40|$|Decentralising wage {{setting in}} times of crisis? The {{regulation}} and use of wage-related <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses</b> in seven European countries The author addresses the issue of wage setting decentralisation from the inter-sectoral to company level {{through the use of}} <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses.</b> Sectoral and inter-sectoral level collective agreements are a key feature of industrial relations in most Western European countries. Traditionally inter-sectoral bargaining has had the function of homogenising wages and working conditions for entire sectors or countries, of bringing stability to the relations between workers and employers and of relieving company level actors from engaging in time consuming and possibly conflict-ridden bargaining processes. In recent decades, however, the rationale for such inter-sectoral agreements has been questioned for an advancing globalisation of competition and for a greater requirement from employers of decentralisation and flexibility in the setting of wages and working conditions. A specific form of decentralisation is the opening up of possibilities for companies, through various kinds of <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses</b> (opening clauses, hardship clauses, opt-out clauses, inability-to-pay clauses, etc.), to deviate from pay norms set under inter-sectoral or sectoral agreements when they suffer from temporary economic hardship. The article provides a summary of the results of a comparative study on the regulations, practices and politics of wage <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses</b> in seven EU countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain. It provides a detailed and original contribution to the political and academic debate on labour law and industrial relations...|$|R
30|$|Temporary opening or ‘inability to pay’ clauses {{have become}} rather popular during the Recession. They {{are to be}} {{distinguished}} from the general <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses</b> discussed in the previous paragraph. General <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses</b> delegate particular issues to be decided at enterprise level under conditions specified in the sector agreement and with outcomes that can deviate from sectoral minima or standards. In the limit case, as in some sector agreements in manufacturing in Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands the sector agreement does not specify (minimum) pay provisions. Temporary ‘inability to pay’ clauses allow the suspension or renegotiation of (part of) the agreement in cases of hardship, although how tightly this is defined varies. General opening or <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses</b> are an instrument of organized decentralisation within sectoral agreements; they {{have no place in}} enterprise agreements. Temporary hardship clauses can apply to any collective agreement at any level and rather being an element of decentralisation they are a safety valve in agreements that define hard minimum or standard conditions, and in agreements that cover a period longer than one year.|$|R

30|$|The {{question}} of whether state parties may derogate from economic, social and cultural rights in times of public emergency has {{been a matter of}} much debate. Derogating from a right essentially allows states to put their obligations on hold for a specified period of time. As derogating is a somewhat extreme measure, whether or not a particular right may be derogated from, and under which circumstances, is usually laid down in the text of a human rights treaty. However, {{this is not the case}} for the ICESCR, which neither contains a <b>derogation</b> <b>clause</b> allowing for derogations, nor a provision prohibiting derogations. This is unlike the ICCPR, Article 4 of which specifies the conditions for derogations from its provisions, and prohibits derogations from several rights (Article 4, paragraphs 1 and 2, respectively). Nonetheless, the fact that there is no <b>derogation</b> <b>clause</b> in ICESCR does not necessarily mean that states would be precluded from derogating from them.|$|E

40|$|The {{recognition}} of some human rights as non-derogable in international treaties that contain appro-priate <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses</b> {{has led many}} authors, and — in some situations (eg. the assessment of reservations to human rights treaties) — states {{to argue that the}} specifi city of these rights is also manifested in areas other than situations of emergency, and to treat them as located hierarchically above other human rights. After presentation of arguments of legal theorists in support of such a position and the practice of States, the author points out to the analysis of the rights recognized as non-derogable in international human rights treaties, {{as well as to the}} position of international bodies in this respect. The conclusions contain arguments that allow him to deny the view according to which all non-derogable rights are placed in the hierarchy above other human rights...|$|R
30|$|However, {{it can be}} {{inferred}} from the purpose of <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses</b> {{that at least some}} economic, social and cultural rights are non-derogable. According to Müller, this would extend to subsistence rights (Müller 2009, 593). The purpose of derogations is not to allow states to decrease their attention to the rights, but (following the criteria of Article 4 ICCPR) must be to ensure that the state is in a position where it is capable of ensuring human rights and to restore a situation of normalcy (United Nations Human Rights Committee 2001, para 1). This is evident from the requirement that a state be in a “time of public emergency that threatens the life of the nation” before it may make derogations. Whilst it may be true that a non-international armed conflict may cause such a situation of public emergency, it cannot reasonably be expected that derogating from rights such as the right to food, water and healthcare, could help to restore the state to a situation of normalcy. On the contrary, reducing access to essential resources would aggravate, rather than ameliorate, a situation of public emergency.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the major issues dealt within the Gbagbo case, {{recently}} decided by the ECOWAS' Court of Justice. In particular, the Court did {{not rule out the}} possibility of derogations under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, despite the absence of an explicit <b>derogation</b> <b>clause</b> in the latter treaty, provided that the conditions generally laid down in the derogation clauses contained in other human rights instruments are fulfilled. According to the Court, however, the requirements set down by the domestic law of the State invoking the derogation must also be respected and no derogation whatsoever may authorise grave and systematic breaches of fundamental human rights...|$|E
40|$|Astoundingly, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) {{does not}} contain [a] <b>derogation</b> <b>clause.</b> Furthermore, it has been {{established}} by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (the Commission) {{in the case of}} Commission Nationale des Droits de l'Homme et des Libertes v Chad (Commission Nationale case) that a member state of teh ACHPR cannot derogate human rights in case of emergencies. Hence, the Commission's view may lead to a conclusion that all rights under the ACHPR are non-derogable. This raises the issue of whether it is tenable to conclude that a state facing a situation that endangers the nation, should not at all derogate from the provisions of the ACHPR. Emergency clauses, which permit derogation of human rights in times of emergencies, are also found in most domestic legal instruments. Most African states also encompass this clause in their constitutions. Although the levels of compliance by states are questionable, some of these constitutions also include a list of non-derogable rights. The constitutions of Ethiopia and Mozambique also provide for a <b>derogation</b> <b>clause</b> and a list of non-derogable rights. The aim of the study is to make a critical analysis of the African derogation system. Firstly, the study will analyse the concept of derogation and non-derogable rights in general. Secondly, the jurisprudence and the law of the African system with regard to derogation and non-derogable rights will be examined. In analysing the jurisprudence of the Commission effort will be made to critically study the cases that have been examined by the Commission in relation to derogation and non-derogable rights.

40|$|This note {{looks at}} the {{decision}} adopted by the Turkish authorities to suspend the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) {{in the wake of}} the attempted military putsch of July 2016. Derogations from some - but not all - human rights are permissible under Article 15 of the ECHR when a state party is faced with a public emergency that threatens the life of the nation. Extraordinary measures can thus be adopted to address the situation in the attempt to restore normalcy. However, substantial as well as procedural obligations must be complied with while implementing emergency measures. The note will first address whether the situation prevailing in Turkey falls within the scope of Article 15. It will then examine if the emergency measures adopted are compatible with the substantial requirements imposed by the provision. Finally, it will assess whether the decision to derogate was notified in accordance with the procedures set out in Article 15. The analysis will be based on a perusal of Article 15 as interpreted by the European Court and European Commission of Human Rights. The note concludes that, while resort to the <b>derogation</b> <b>clause</b> is probably warranted, some of the measures adopted by the Turkish authorities are difficult to justify, as they seem to go beyond what is strictly required by the exigencies of the situation...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} and comments {{the types of}} emergency situations which are recognised by the international law of human rights as justifying suspension of specific rights and freedoms. The European standards on this matter are extensively analysed, and subsidiary consideration is given to many connected agreements and reports sponsored by international organisations. The introduction asks whether the public danger must always be "officially proclaimed". It then indicates what state organs should be competent to declare an emergency {{and to what extent}} their decisions in this respect are liable to effective judicial and political control. On the availability of such checks depends the enforcement of those further safeguards which international bills of rights have set with respect to when a crisis actually prevails. The first Chapter considers the terms whereby the <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses</b> of international charters of human rights refer to emergency situations and draws upon the construction which has been officially given to the relevant provisions. The definition of a public danger may be more or less encompassing and consequently more or less permissive. Thus, the reference in article 4 (3) (c) of the European Convention on Human Rights to threats to the "well-being" in addition to threats to the "life" of the community has significantly broadened the scope of emergency exceptions to the freedom from forced or compulsory labour. Under the American Convention on Human Rights, derogatory measures can be taken when a situation "threatens the independence or security of a State Party", and it is demonstrated that this provides no valuable test as to whether a proclamation of emergency corresponds to an actual danger. The same is true of the expression "(threat to) the interests of the people" which appeared in the drafts of both the European Convention and the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These two agreements, as well as the European Social Charter, condone the taking of derogatory measures wherever the "life of the nation" is endangered, and the meaning of this phrase is studied {{in the light of the}} relevant preparatory works and the judicial pronouncements of the European Commission and Court of Human Rights. In the second Chapter, critical sets of circumstances involving revolutionary elements are considered with a view to ascertaining whether they meet the requirements of international bills or rights as regards the nature of the crisis. The main problem which was brought before the European Commission with respect to this matter is raised by the coming to power of an unconstitutional government. Has such a government the right to derogate from the Convention in order to preserve its own existence? An affirmative answer was given in the First Greek Case. Nevertheless, it is submitted that the Report of the Commission on this Case embodies a considerably hardened approach as compared to its earlier case-law. Moreover, on the merits of the Case, the Commission has not stuck to the right question and has overlooked the main element: it has, in fact, decided that on April 21, 1967, no public emergency threatened, the life of the constitutional, rather than the revolutionary, Government of Greece and it has not drawn at all upon the effects of the occurence of the coup itself. Threats to the territorial integrity of Contracting Parties are then shortly discussed and, with particular reference to self-determination, it is shown that most <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses</b> favour the preservation of the status quo. The same would hold good when it comes to threats to democracy as such, whether they be raised lawfully or not. In this connection, the European Commission appears to have qualified the sweeping language that it originally used in the German Communist Party Case. As to duration, finally. Chapter three asks whether the periods just preceding and just following a public danger are themselves covered by the relevant derogatory provisions. Anticipatory proclamations of emergency are invariably accepted as legitimate. All <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses</b> indicate that it is the threat which must be actual and not the hostilities, though these must be imminent. The European Commission has not applied consistently its own views on this matter. Conversely, transitional states of emergency may be acceptable from an economic standpoint, but not in the field of human rights. The difficulty here is to make sure that a crisis has not merely been placed under control and that a withdrawal of derogatory measures will not revive the threat to the life of the nation. This problem, it is submitted, must be treated in conjunction with the determination whether the suspension of rights and freedoms remained "strictly required by the exigencies of the situation". The article concludes that valuable standards have been set on the international plane as to conditions regulating the existence of those public emergencies which condone suspension of human rights. Most of these tend to make sure that the legal conception of a public danger continuously relates to an actual crisis and remains essentially limited in substance and in time. The case is also made for the retention of judicial control over the type of "political" decision involved...|$|R

40|$|This study {{looks into}} the {{relationship}} between international humanitarian law and human rights law. The former is specific law that applies in situations of armed conflict, while the latter is general law applicable at all times. This means that, at least in principle, their scopes of application overlap during armed conflict. The aim {{of the study is}} to examine the relevance of human rights law in armed conflict in theory as well as in practice. First, it is investigated how these two branches of international law relate to one another by looking at their objectives, origins, similarities and differences, as well as their mutual references. Both branches endeavour to protect individuals, although they have separate origins and somewhat different standing points: the former has been developed to alleviate unnecessary human suffering during war by regulating the actions of the armed forces towards the enemy people, whereas the latter is essentially meant for protecting citizens from arbitrary exercise of power of their own State by giving them various rights. In addition to the aforementioned differences, it is noteworthy that the regimes have dissimilar systems of implementation, the one of human rights law being clearly more effective with the right to individual petition, for instance. The main sources of humanitarian law are the Geneva Conventions of 1949 with their additional protocols of 1977, and those of human rights law include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by the United Nations as well as regional human rights treaties, especially the European Convention on Human Rights. Even though there are various links and mutual references between humanitarian law and human rights law – {{one of the most significant}} ones being the <b>derogation</b> <b>clauses</b> in human rights treaties, which allow for derogating from most human rights norms in an emergency like armed conflict – there are no detailed rules on the interaction between humanitarian law and human rights law, so the views of scholars and case law are significant when examining their relationship. A crucial theoretical question not clearly answered by treaty law is whether humanitarian law and human rights law are simultaneously applicable, and if so, what is their mutual hierarchy like. The International Court of Justice, for example, has confirmed the concurrent applicability. As for the hierarchy, there seems to have been a gradual shift from considering humanitarian law as a whole primary as specific law, to an interpretive approach according to which either humanitarian or human rights law may be given primacy depending on which one provides a more suitable and precise norm in a particular case. The humanitarian treaty rules concerning non-international armed conflicts are sparser and more vague than those concerning international armed conflicts. However, by means of customary international law, most rules on international conflicts also apply to non-international ones. Humanitarian rules are in many cases more detailed and protective than human rights norms, and in other cases it is the other way around. Case law, too, seems to show that the regimes are more complementary than conflicting in practice. This concerns mainly situations outside the battlefield during armed conflict. When it comes to the hostilities in international conflicts, human rights law is seldom relevant as it only applies extraterritorially if the State has effective control over the area or person in question. Thus, humanitarian law applies alone. What is more, there are no clear rules on attacking or detaining fighters in non-international armed conflicts; the views of humanitarian and human rights law differ. The case law of human rights treaty bodies suggests that there is a requirement to arrest fighters instead of attacking them whenever possible and all fatal use of force ought to be investigated afterwards. By contrast, in humanitarian law attacking enemy combatants is the norm. With regard to detaining fighters in non-international conflicts, the case law appears to provide the fighters with better procedural guarantees than humanitarian law. It can be considered reasonable that the rules that offer more comprehensive protection to the individual prevail if feasible – the opposite view would be hard to justify when the parties to a conflict are obligated by those rules. The mandate of human rights treaty bodies is limited to their own treaty, but humanitarian law can be used for interpretation, which, at the same time, gives humanitarian rules a chance to be taken into account regardless of the weak system of implementation in humanitarian law. Despite certain issues to be solved regarding the simultaneous application, it appears that the co-operation between the regimes is synergetic and even inevitable...|$|R
40|$|Moving {{from the}} {{complementary}} relationship between International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law, {{this article analyses}} the issue of private proper-ty in occupied territory from the civilians perspective. In the attempt to verify if contem-poraneous practice has modified customary international law obligations of Occupying Powers, the Author highlights the complex and heterogeneous evolution of {{the protection of the}} right to private property. On the one hand, practice confirms the strengthening of its safeguard by the extensive interpretation of the absolute prohibition on confiscation, for-bidding an occupying power to take “permanent” measures of dispossession and de facto transfer of title. The same result is achieved by the enlargement of the material scope of application of the crime of pillage, and by the narrow interpretation of the <b>derogation</b> <b>clause</b> of the “absolute necessity of military operations”, contained in the rule prohibiting the destruction of private property. Moreover, practice’s development proves the existence of a privileged class of assets (such as foodstuffs, houses, or medical supplies), whose es-sential nature to the well-being of the civilian population makes them object of a stronger guarantee. On the other hand, recent trends show a weakening in the protection of the right to private property, above all within the context of prolonged occupation as well as trans-formative one. The occupant’s widest powers of requisition of private property in these particular cases interfere in a deeper manner with the enjoyment of the right in hand, part-ly justified by the more and more flexible interpretation given to the general conservation-ist principle of military occupation law. Actually, this weakening is only apparent. From a broader point of view, the less protection of the right to private property is counterbal-anced by the use of the proportionality test, to assess if occupying power action respects the other human rights of the civilian population...|$|E
40|$|Biodiversity offsets {{have emerged}} as one of the most {{prominent}} policy approaches to align economic development with nature protection across many jurisdictions, including the European Union. Given the increased level of scrutiny that needs to be applied when authorizing economic developments near protected Natura 2000 sites, the incorporation of onsite biodiversity offsets in project design has grown increasingly popular in some member states, such as the Netherlands and Belgium. Under this approach, the negative effects of developments are outbalanced by restoration programs that are functionally linked to the infrastructure projects. However, although taking into consideration that the positive effects of onsite restoration measures leads to more leeway for harmful project development, the EU Court of Justice has recently dismissed the latter approaches for going against the preventative underpinnings of the EU Habitats Directive. Also, the expected beneficial outcomes of the restoration efforts are uncertain and thus cannot be relied upon in an ecological assessment under Article 6 (3) of the Habitats Directive. Although biodiversity offsets can still be relied upon whenever application is being made of the <b>derogation</b> <b>clause</b> under Article 6 (4) of the Habitats Directive, they cannot be used as mitigation under the generic decision-making process for plans and programs liable to adversely affect Natura 2000 sites. We outline the main arguments pro and contra the stance of the EU Court of Justice with regards to the exact delineation between mitigation and compensation. The analysis is also framed in the ongoing debate on the effectiveness of the EU nature directives. Although ostensibly rigid, it is argued that the recent case-law developments are in line with the main principles underpinning biodiversity offsetting. Opening the door for biodiversity offsetting under the Habitats Directive will certainly not reverse the predicament of the EU's biodiversity. A reinforcement of the preventative approach is instrumental to avert a further biodiversity loss within the European Union, even if it will lead to additional permit refusals for unsustainable project developments...|$|E
