5|$|As Wing Commander Kellett {{was taking}} off, Schumacher was dismissing {{any idea that}} the British would attempt a bombing raid in clear weather. On the island of Wangerooge, Leutnant Hermann Diehl of Regiment 3, battery LN-Vers was demonstrating the Freya set to a visiting naval officer. Diehl was using Falck's 2./ZG 76 to test the set. After some demonstration, he swung the set north, {{pointing}} to the Heliogoland Bight. As soon {{as he did so}} he picked up an echo. He telephoned Schumacher's Geschwader at Jever. They were told that the naval radar reported nothing, and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous</b> to think the British would attack in such clear skies. Diehl spoke to von Bülow-Bothkamp. No one wanted to know. Some 20 minutes later, naval Freyas also picked up the formation, but still no fighters were scrambled. German radar was just as efficient as its British counterpart, the problem lay in communication. The British married their radar to an efficient fighter control system. The Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine had poor communication and their areas of responsibility overlapped, creating confusion over who was responsible. Added to this was the German disbelief that RAF Bomber Command would expose itself on a day when conditions favoured the fighter. Only when observers on the ground confirmed that the formation existed were fighters scrambled. The observers described a formation of 44 British aircraft, twice its actual strength.|$|E
25|$|When Wallis {{announced}} he was giving Davis top billing, she argued <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous</b> to do so given hers was a supporting role. The studio's publicity department argued it was her name that would attract an audience and, despite her resistance, the film's credits and all promotional materials listed her first.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Sima Qian, {{who wrote}} Xiang Yu's biography in the Records of the Grand Historian, described Xiang {{as someone who}} boasted about his achievements and thought highly of himself. Xiang Yu preferred to depend on his personal abilities as opposed to learning with humility from others before him. Sima Qian thought that Xiang Yu had failed to see his own shortcomings and to make attempts to correct his mistakes, even until his death. Sima Qian thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous</b> when Xiang Yu claimed that his downfall was due to Heaven's will and not his personal failure.|$|E

500|$|On October 18, 2000, de la Rocha {{released}} a statement announcing his departure from the band. He said, [...] "I {{feel that it is}} now necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed. It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band, and from my perspective, has undermined our artistic and political ideal." [...] "There was so much squabbling over everything", explained Morello, [...] "and I mean everything. We would even have fist fights over whether our T-shirts should be mauve or camouflaged! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> We were patently political, internally combustible. It was ugly for a long time".|$|E
500|$|The band Them {{was signed}} by Phil Solomon, who {{contracted}} producer Bert Berns {{to work with the}} group, and Phil Coulter came on as a musical arranger and lyricist. The group became popular with songs including [...] "Baby Please Don't Go", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Here Comes the Night". Morrison commented of Them: [...] "Them were never meant to be on Top of the Pops. I mean, miming? lip syncing? We used to laugh at that programme, think it was a joke. Then we were on it ourselves. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> We were totally anti that sort of thing. We were really into the blues... and we had to get into suits and have make-up put on and all that shit." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{producers}} realised that Paul's behaviour {{had gone}} too far, they considered killing him off. Dennis commented [...] "As an actor, I had the best time because this character just got more evil and more sneaky, more of a cad and a womaniser and it just escalated where {{it got to the}} point where it just got silly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous</b> for the supposed reality of the show." [...] The actor also said that he accepted the producers decision to kill his character off when they explained that they did not know where to take him. However, the show's then executive producer Ric Pellizzeri decided to save the character and redeem him by giving him a brain tumour. Following the removal of the brain tumour, Paul mellowed in his evil ways. Of Paul's dramatic change to his personality, post brain tumour, Dennis compared the differences stating: [...] "He's changed back to where he was 18 odd years ago. What he has become is the same Paul he was back then when he was a very ambitious young entrepreneur with Lassiters and Robinson Corporation. But the difference now is that he is older and wiser and therefore a lot more shrewd and a lot more careful. Post brain tumor, he is no longer evil, more ruthless than evil. Ruthless with a conscience and emotion." ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{image the}} Coens and Raimi {{conceived}} was of Norville Barnes about {{to jump from}} the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he got there and how to save him. The inclusion of the hula hoop came {{as a result of a}} plot device. Joel remembers, [...] "We had to come up with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success." [...] Ethan said, [...] "The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate." [...] Joel: [...] "What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback." [...] It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project [...] "takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about Big Business. The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{band was}} {{inspired}} to write [...] "Counterfeit" [...] after local bands began to copy their style. According to Borland, [...] "They saw this little thing we built [...] and they were like, 'Oh, let's get baggy pants and dress like kind of hip-hoppy and, you know, play heavy metal and rap.' [...] five or six bands just popped up out of nowhere that became these, you know, groups that were trying to sound like us. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> That's where the song 'Counterfeit' came from." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kennedy's role split many Buffy fans {{into two}} groups. Many viewers hated Kennedy, {{because they saw}} her {{as a way of}} saying; [...] "Tara's dead, let's move on." [...] and they weren't ready to. After the {{emotional}} death of Tara and Willow's reaction (nearly ending all life on Earth) many fans thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous</b> for Willow to recover and move on so quickly. Kennedy overall, has received much hate, but there is the other side who say that she was exactly what Willow needed to recover and continue a happy life.|$|E
5000|$|The premiere {{was not a}} success. The German critic Eduard Wahl wrote:It would fain {{be simple}} and childlike; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> childish. <b>It</b> would fain <b>be</b> religious; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sentimental. ... <b>It</b> would fain <b>be</b> serious; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in bad taste, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous.</b>|$|R
60|$|Criticism {{upon the}} book {{considered}} as literature, if <b>it</b> can <b>be</b> so considered, I should, of course, never dream of discussing--firstly, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous</b> to do so; and, secondly, because there was, in my opinion, much justice in such criticism.|$|R
6000|$|I laughed aloud. [...] "Those women," [...] said I, [...] "are {{just the}} same as nuns. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ridiculous</b> to suppose that one of them would be allowed to come here as my secretary, even if she wanted to." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "What {{they had}} against us was that I had taken {{classes at the}} Actors Lab in Hollywood {{where some of the}} {{teachers}} were from the Group Theater and therefore suspect, and we had been members of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, an organization in support of World [...] War II to which almost all of Hollywood's writers belonged. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous,</b> but it was very real, and there was nothing we could do about it. We took a larger mortgage on the house and started writing a play, but we didn't work in films for almost two years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Saint Petersburg Pisemsky {{made friends}} with Ivan Panaev, one of the editors of Sovremennik, and sent him his novel The Rich Fiancé, written in 1851 and satirizing {{characters}} like Rudin and Pechorin. Skabichevsky thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous</b> the way the magazine which pretended to be the guiding light of the Russian intelligentsia had fallen for the Rich Fiancé where this very same intelligentsia (in the Shamilov character) was dragged through the mud. For Pisemsky, the alliance with Sovremennik felt natural, for he was indifferent towards all political parties and the Slavophile movement appealed to him as little as {{the ideas of the}} Westernizers.

2500|$|Bassoonist/multireedist James Jacson {{had studied}} Zen Buddhism before joining Sun Ra and {{identified}} strong similarities between Zen teachings and practices (particularly Zen koans) and Ra's use of non sequiturs and seemingly absurd replies to questions. Drummer Art Jenkins admitted that Sun Ra's [...] "nonsense" [...] sometimes troubled his thoughts for days until inspiring {{a sort of}} paradigm shift, or profound change in outlook. Drummer Andrew Cyrille said Sun Ra's comments were [...] "very interesting stuff... whether you believed it or not.

2500|$|Richthofen's {{participation}} on {{the operation}} {{came to an}} abrupt end on 23 June 1942. Having been informed by Jeschonnek and Hitler that he was to assume command of Luftlfotte 4 after the fall of Sevastopol earlier, they decided not to wait. They ordered him to Kursk in order to take up his command, leaving his Corps behind, and Sevastopol air operations under the command of von Wild. Richthofen was disgusted. He felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous</b> to move him mid-operation, and he had wanted to be there when the fortress fell. He wrote, [...] "It is a pity that one can never finish what one starts in the east. After a while, it takes away all the pleasure".|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Game {{released}} of {{his third}} studio album, LAX. After the release, Game announced his plan on retiring from music, just {{to spend more}} time with his family and focusing on what's more important to him during the time. However, he later stated Interscope Records didn't want him to retire, and the label wanted him to come back and release another album, which was for February 2009. Game commented these statements about given was so far off his radar and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ridiculous.</b> He later stated [...] "Now, if you give me like five, ten million dollars or something to do itI'm the biggest thing in that building now, with the recent demise of G-Unit, and that's just it, man." ...|$|E
