50|$|A <b>Guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> {{is similar}} to a label on a bottle: it carries {{information}} telling the consumer facts about the product. Controlling the information and the accuracy of the <b>Guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> is therefore of critical importance. A unique body (e.g. an electricity regulator or a transmission system operator) is usually granted this authority for a given domain.|$|E

50|$|Directive 2004/8/EC of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council of 11 February 2004 on the {{promotion}} of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market includes the article 5 (<b>Guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration).|$|E
5000|$|In operation, a GO is a [...] "green label" [...] or [...] "tracker" [...] guaranteeing {{that one}} MWh of {{electricity}} has been produced from renewable energy sources. <b>Guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> are traded. When a company buys <b>Guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin,</b> as documentation for the electricity delivered or consumed, the <b>Guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> are cancelled {{in the electronic}} certificate registry. This single standardised instrument {{makes it possible to}} track ownership, verify claims and ensure that <b>Guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> are only sold once and that there is no double counting.|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, <b>Guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> (GoOs) are {{tradable}} on the EEX derivatives market. GoOs are certificates which {{confirm that}} a given Megawatt Hour of power has been generated from renewable resources. These are exclusively issued for disclosure and transparency purposes and they are cancelled upon use. Trading in <b>Guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> on EEX is not connected with the delivery <b>of</b> power. <b>Guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> can be traded {{up to three years}} into the future.

50|$|The {{work of the}} AIB is of {{relevance}} to all electricity customers, as the <b>Guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> (the instrument created in the European Directive and standardised through EECS) is a cornerstone of providing reliable disclosure information {{on the origin of}} electricity supplied to consumers.|$|E
50|$|Good Energy validates {{its claim}} of {{supplying}} 100% renewably generated electricity through the Renewable Energy <b>Guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> scheme.

50|$|<b>Guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the Eugene Green Energy Standard or EKOenergy labelling scheme. Both provide consumers with more information about their power (transparency). However, Eugene and EKOenergy go further by requiring additionality. Besides, Eugene and EKOenergy are private initiatives whereas <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> arise from European regulations.|$|R

Aruba holds three important certifications: ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 for the provision of Data Centre services, and the GO (<b>Guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin),</b> which certifies that all the energy used in its data centres is produced from 100% renewable energy sources.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{suppliers}} offering 'green' electricity in the United Kingdom. In theory these types of tariffs help to lower carbon emissions by increasing consumer demand for green electricity and encouraging more renewables to be built. Since OFGEM's 2014 regulations there are now set criteria defining what can be classified as a green source product. As well as holding sufficient <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> certificates to cover the electricity sold to consumers, suppliers are also required to show additionality by contributing to wider environmental and low carbon funds.|$|E

50|$|At no stage had the ECJ {{suggested}} that use {{which was not}} understood by the public to be a designation of the origin, could not infringe. The judge had found that Mr Reed's use of the marks did not indicate {{the origin of the}} goods but had failed to consider whether such use was liable to affect or jeopardise the <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> which was the essential feature of Arsenal's marks. Mr Reed's use meant that the goods, which did not originate from Arsenal were in free circulation. This affected the ability of Arsenal's marks to guarantee the origin of the goods.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{whatever}} their commercial evolution, the legal purpose of trade-marks continues (in terms of s. 2 of the Trade-marks Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13) {{to be their}} use by the owner [...] "to distinguish wares or services manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by him from those manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by others". It is a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and inferentially, an assurance to the consumer that the quality will be {{what he or she}} has come to associate with a particular trade-mark (as {{in the case of the}} mythical [...] "Maytag" [...] repairman). It is, in that sense, consumer protection legislation.|$|E
5000|$|As laguiole designates {{a type of}} {{knife and}} is not a brand or trade name of cutlery, laguiole knives are {{manufactured}} globally. This has led to the widespread availability of inexpensive, and sometimes low-quality, knives manufactured in Asia. Quality laguiole knives are handcrafted in France by skilled workers. French production is shared between the cutlery hub town of Thiers, and the village of Laguiole: these places have worked together for more than 150 years. Quality French manufacturers stamp a trademark or signature into the steel of their knives. A description of the type of steel used and [...] "Made in France", will often be stamped as well. This is a <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b>|$|E
40|$|Demand is {{increasing}} in the EU for specific electricity products <b>of</b> desired <b>origin.</b> For now, this demand relates {{almost exclusively to}} electricity generated from renewable energy sources, and comes from business organisations wishing to enhance their environmental credentials and households wishing {{to contribute to a}} better environment. The tracking system <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> is instrumental to the reliable authentication of claims about the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> a certain quantity of final energy. European law stipulates that <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are to be used to prove the share of renewables in total deliveries of a supplier to customers. This report considers, among other factors, the rationale and selected options in the design of forthcoming EU legislation to extend the use <b>of</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> to verify disclosed information about sources of electricity deliveries to final consumers, and makes a number of policy recommendations...|$|R
50|$|The {{system for}} <b>Guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> was {{implemented}} by the EU Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC. In 2010 the average electricity consumption mix of a Norwegian household was 36% renewable.|$|R
5000|$|June 2013: EEX offers {{trading in}} <b>Guarantees</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> (GoOs). These {{certificates}} prove that one megawatt hour of electricity was generated from renewable energy sources. ECC takes over {{clearing and settlement}} of the trades.|$|R
50|$|This {{decision}} {{has a special}} relevance for the trade mark law {{in view of the}} trade mark directive. It pointed out that the important requirements are the specific interests and as a consequence of that the essential function. For the applicability of the law, there has to be at first a specific interest by the owner of the registered trade mark. And therefore this special interest has to concern an essential function of the trade mark. In this case the ECJ pointed out that the essential function is the <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The consideration that there could be other essential functions is not far to seek obvious. If such interests exist and what they will be was left unanswered by European Court of Justice.|$|E
50|$|At first, the ECJ {{pointed out}} that Reed was using a sign {{in the course of}} trade which was {{identical}} with the trade mark registered by Arsenal FC. In this particular case, there is a trademark infringement. Beyond that the question had to be answered whether any use of the sign of a third party would entitle Arsenal FC to forbid this use. Or if there must be a specific interest by the owner of the registered trade mark. In this point, the ECJ made clear that Article 5 (1) (a) of the trade mark directive requires for its applicability a specific interest. Ensuing, the ECJ pointed out, that a specific interest is constituted by violation of an essential function. The owner of a registered trade mark could only prohibit the use of an identical sign if his interests regarding the essential function of the trade mark violated. The essential function of a registered trade mark is to identify the origin of the goods. So there is no danger of confusion by the customers. A use of an identical sign in a merely describing way would not violate the interest of the owner of the trade mark. The ECJ is convinced that the style of the products sold by Mr. Reed could lead to the impression in the course of trade, that there is a relationship between these products and Arsenal FC. Even the disclaimers at the stalls that the products sold by Mr. Reed are not official products of Arsenal FC, do not lead to another estimate. Following the opinion of the ECJ, most of all by the time the products left the stalls they can be regarded as official Products of the Arsenal FC by other customers. The interesting point here is that the arguments are identical with those, which lead to the rejection in the claim of passing off. Under this the decision about the claim of passing off maybe has to be reconsidered. But the ECJ did not say anything about this former ruling of the High Court and its arguments. Going back to the case, the ECJ assume to be convinced that the use of a sign which is identical with a registered trade mark is suitable to harm the <b>guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and therefore consequently the essential function of a registered trade mark. Consequently, in this particular case, there is a violation of the specific interests of the Arsenal FC by Mr. Reed. He used the sign in the meaning of Article 5 (1) of the trade mark directive. Therefore there is a trade mark infringement by Mr. Reed selling products, not official wear by Arsenal FC, but carrying the sign of the Arsenal FC.|$|E

40|$|The {{labels and}} {{certificates}} are {{a response from}} the retail to consumer’s needs for enhanced monitoring of quality and food safety. There are several types of labels found in retail, some are specific to the attribute related to {{the origin of the}} product and others attest various intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics. Among labels of products marketed by a supermarket network in Brazil is the <b>Guarantee</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> (G. O). In order to assess the perception of consumers, 120 customers were interviewed in supermarkets in the region of Campinas and Piracicaba-SP, that had GO products. By means of factor analysis, four important dimensions were identified: food safety; intrinsic quality of product; different production system; and governmental verification. In relation to the origin and sustainability attributes, values such as prestige, credibility and respect were considered relevant. The paper presents contributions in the methodological and theoretical fields,helping a better comprehension of these consumers’ perceptions about these attribute...|$|E
