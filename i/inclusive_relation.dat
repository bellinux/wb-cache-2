The data were collected from forty-eight prospective secondary school teachers enrolled in an initial training programme. The results indicate three changes in how the prospective teachers anticipate secondary students’ answers in relation to the role given to a perceptual or relational perspective of the classification of quadrilaterals. These changes are described considering how prospective teachers grasp the students’ understanding of the <b>inclusive</b> <b>relation</b> among quadrilaterals as a conceptual advance.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{development}} of students' geometrical reasoning, in particular of <b>inclusive</b> <b>relations</b> between 2 dimensional shapes, e. g. the rhombus {{as a special}} case of the kite. Students in the study worked with a dynamic figure constructed using Dynamic Geometry Software. The figure is a quadrilateral whose diagonals are constructed {{so that they are}} of fixed length and perpendicular. All students in the study were observed to use a strategy of 'dragging' to keep one diagonal as the perpendicular bisector of the other. This generated a 'family of shapes' which was comprised of an infinite number of kites, arrowheads (i. e. concave kites), one rhombus and two isosceles triangles. I have called this strategy 'Dragging Maintaining Symmetry' (DMS) and I claim {{it has the potential to}} mediate the understanding of the rhombus as a special case of the kites (and the isosceles triangle in the context of dynamic geometry). However students in the study typically perceived the shapes, generated using DMS, according to a partitional view i. e. as different shapes, albeit with common properties such as line symmetry. When asked how many kites it would be possible to make by dragging the figure some students reported that there were four kites (one typical kite in each of four relative positions). It appears that they perceived the dragging activity as a journey to a discrete end position rather than as an action that resulted in a continuously changing figure. To address this problem I showed the students an animation of the figure under DMS. This proved to be the catalyst which moved their reasoning towards perceiving <b>inclusive</b> <b>relations</b> between the rhombus and kite...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} homosociality {{describes}} and defines social bonds between {{persons of the}} same sex. It is, for example, frequently used in studies on men and masculinities, there defined as a mechanism and social dynamic that explains the maintenance of hegemonic masculinity. However, this common and somewhat overexploited use of the concept to refer to how men, through their relations to other men, uphold and maintain patriarchy tends to simplify and reduce homosociality to an almost descriptive term – one used to point at how men tend to bond, build closed teams, and defend their privileges and positions. The {{purpose of the present}} article is to investigate, explore, and discuss the concept of homosociality. We will introduce a distinction between vertical/hierarchical and horizontal homosociality. Hierarchical homosociality is similar to and has previously been described as a means of strengthening power and of creating close bonds between men and between women to maintain and defend hegemony. Horizontal homosociality, however, is used to point toward more <b>inclusive</b> <b>relations</b> between, for example, men that are based on emotional closeness, intimacy, and a nonprofitable form of friendship. Relating this distinction to the concept of and discussion on hegemonic masculinity, we will reconstruct and develop a more dynamic view on homosociality...|$|R

As peace operations are undertaken by inter-governmental bodies that tend to be inherently state-centric, however, peace operations need to go beyond merely supporting the extension of state-authority and strengthen <b>inclusive</b> state-society <b>relations</b> by supporting and facilitating inclusive processes that can address social cohesion, inequalities and marginalization. In order to support the emergence of resilient societies, these operations must help states and their societies to develop inclusive processes that enable participatory and responsive state institutions that are closely connected to the social institutions in the communities they serve. Furthermore, peace operations are often perceived as being partial to the party in government, while the government of the day often discourages peace operations from engaging with civil society. In {{the first part of this}} paper we explain why strengthening <b>inclusive</b> state-society <b>relations</b> is an important issue to address when peace operations are mandated to foster peace processes that can resist relapse. The second half of the paper shifts the attention to 'how' peace operations can enhance and support state-society relations. In addition to monitoring the effect peace operations have on state institutions, operations should monitor how people experience the role and impact of peace operations. This can be assessed in a number of ways, including by involving representative advisory groups from civil society and local communities in assessments, analysis, planning, implementation and evaluation, so as to ensure continuous direct input and feedback from the society on the work of the peace operation...|$|R

40|$|The general {{aim of this}} {{manuscript}} is to appreciate how social enterprise can create a space of relations and opportunities that impacts beneficially on community welfare and individual wellbeing. We refer to cooperative relations that are aimed at {{the pursuit of a}} social goal. In this sense we talk of the bright side of social capital, as opposed to relational networks that are mainly functional to the pursuit of exclusive interests even at the detriment of others. Consistently with the premise, in this work we focus on social enterprise which we define as values-based businesses set up for social and/or environmental purpose, driven by an entrepreneurial spirit. Specifically we regard social enterprises and their networks of cooperation as the immaterial assets of a community, as reservoirs of pro-social and cooperative attitudes that are able to create connectivity and engender flexible responses to community evolving needs. In other words, social enterprises can be seen as immaterial spaces which support individuals and communities in developing opportunities through activities of various nature as a response to contextual needs. The creation and use of space {{from this point of view}} is a reflection of specific values such as cooperation and the public interest. The study of how social enterprise create space for <b>inclusive</b> <b>relations</b> and opportunities that impacts on community welfare is supported using two illustrative cases, one on arts and one on health. The first connects access to creative spaces with inclusion and community welfare, the other connects community assets to generate social inclusion and to enhance the physical and psychological welfare of NHS patients. The two cases highlight a path for community development building on the nature and assets of social enterprise. The path goes from social enterprise to the creation of inclusive spaces, to the furthering of social inclusion, which ultimately enhances psychological and physical health. Both projects have developed over a medium time span so that we can trace the emerging path of activities and outcomes. ...|$|R

When the participants themselves choose the channels, pieces, sources, and specific media that they use to enhance or disassemble the first piece of media they encounter, especially when these are perceived to be mostly independent sources, the result is an enriched self-discovery experience with a level of engagement not possible from even the most well designed guided experiences. Meshing goes beyond simply mutually <b>inclusive</b> public <b>relations</b> across media channels, pieces, and product placement. Broadband technology and diversity of online services have increased the accessibility and prevalence of simultaneous media experiences to the point where some would argue there is a new, more demanding and more inquisitive, incarnation of information consumers.
