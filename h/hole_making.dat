60|$|Elsa put {{her hand}} through the hole, too, to see {{the extent of the}} mischief. Yes! that was it, her father must more than once have missed the pocket and put his hand into the <b>hole,</b> <b>making</b> it bigger and bigger. Why! there was a whole lot of rubbish deep down inside the lining. Elsa drew out an empty tobacco-pouch, a bit of string, a length of tinder, and from the very bottom, where it lay in a crinkled mass, a ball of {{crumpled}} paper.|$|E
60|$|They had {{not seen}} more of me than my shoes and stockings; so when I stole after them, {{to see what they}} were like, they were waiting under a bush to see what I was like. They jumped away again, spitting, without seeing me, alarmed by the rustle which I could not avoid making in the cover. So I {{followed}} them, just a quiver of leaves here, a snarl there, and then a rush away, until they doubled back towards the rocky place, where, parting the underbrush cautiously, I saw a dark hole among the rocks of a little opening. The roots of an upturned tree arched over the <b>hole,</b> <b>making</b> a broad doorway. In this doorway stood two half-grown lucivees, fuzzy and gray and savage-looking, their backs still up, their wild eyes turned in my direction apprehensively. Seeing me they drew farther back into the den, and I saw nothing more of them save now and then their round heads, or the fire in their yellow eyes.|$|E

However, modern Hardanger fabric is an evenweave cotton material woven with pairs of threads, typically 22 pairs per linear inch in both directions, {{referred to as}} '22-count'. The weave gives a squared appearance to the fabric (similar to Aida cloth), with distinct <b>holes,</b> <b>making</b> it easy to count and work on.|$|R

5000|$|A {{pilot hole}} {{is either a}} small hole drilled into a {{material}} to guide a larger drill to the appropriate location and ease {{the job of the}} larger drill, to allow for the insertion of another <b>hole</b> <b>making</b> tool, such as a knockout punch, that will produce the final size hole, or, in wood or plastic, to locate, guide, and provide clearance for a self threading screw to prevent damaging the material or breaking the screw.|$|E
50|$|In string theory, {{the term}} black brane {{describes}} {{a group of}} D1-branes that are surrounded by a horizon. With {{the notion of a}} horizion in mind as well as identifying points as zero-branes, a generalization of a black hole is a black p-brane. However, many physicists tend to define a black brane separate from a black <b>hole,</b> <b>making</b> the distinction that the singularity of a black brane is not a point like a black hole, but instead a higher dimensional object.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{other black}} hole analogs {{such as a}} sonic black hole in a Bose-Einstein condensate, a slow light black hole analog is not {{expected}} to mimic the quantum effects of a black hole, and thus not emit Hawking radiation. It does, however, mimic the classical properties of a gravitational black <b>hole,</b> <b>making</b> it potentially useful in studying other properties of black holes. More recently, some physicists have developed a fiber optic based system which they believe will emit Hawking radiation.|$|E
50|$|The brief from Hille {{was for a}} {{low cost}} mass-produced {{stacking}} chair, affordable by all and to meet virtually every seating requirement. Over time it became available {{in a wide variety}} of colours and with different forms of base and upholstery.

50|$|Factory {{ammunition}} {{was produced}} by the Super Cartridge Company, Riverbrand, IMI and Sportco, some using new Boxer primed cases (single flash hole and primer has anvil), others using military Berdan primed cases (double flash hole cartridge and primer has no anvil). Factory cartridges are far easier to reload once fired in comparison to military cartridges, because military cartridges have a crimped in Berdan primer. Berden primed cartridges also have a double flash <b>hole,</b> <b>making</b> their removal difficult because the standard decapping die only has a single decapping pin.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} story, a mouse is walking along when a bee nest falls on his head. He tries {{to reason with}} the bees to go away, but the bees like his head as their home. The mouse then {{comes up with a}} plan to go into a mud <b>hole</b> (<b>making</b> the bees think it's his home). As he goes deeper, the bees still like the mouse until they hate his bed (the mouse being {{submerged}} in the mud) and finally go away, allowing the mouse to go home to take a bath.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the more}} {{interesting}} features of Brenish is the Blowhole. This is a deep hole in the ground which is roughly 20 metres inland. It has a sea cave which funnels sea water into the hole, sometimes with such ferocity that the sea water blows out the top of the hole. The hole is situated {{to the north of the}} village and although it is large it can easily be missed because it is situated in a dip in the ground. There is no fencing around the <b>hole</b> <b>making</b> it a hazard to the unsuspecting walker.|$|E
5000|$|Rich ceramic assemblage, {{representing}} the Mature Harappan culture {{was found at}} this site.

50|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the Ss. Paul and Peterâ€™s Basilica design is the spires, which are hollow. They have slender <b>holes</b> <b>making</b> {{the tops of the}} towers light and elegant reminiscent of the conic formation of the chestnut flowers one can find blooming in trees along the walkways in the VyÅ¡ehrad complex. The spires (and indeed the triangular gable of the faÃ§ade between them) are frilled with pedal like finial protrusions along their length and on their tops, further connecting their likeness to the flower.|$|R
5000|$|Another device, used in antiquity, {{was called}} a [...] "water thief" [...] or [...] "clepsydra". Carl Sagan {{described}} it in his book Cosmos as [...] "... a brazen sphere with an open neck and small holes in the bottom, it is filled by immersing it in water. If you pull {{it out with the}} neck uncovered, the water pours out of the <b>holes,</b> <b>making</b> a small shower. But if you pull it out properly, with the neck covered, the water is retained in the sphere until you lift your thumb." ...|$|R
50|$|Mechanical jars {{look like}} a long, tubular piece of {{machined}} metal that slides longer or shorter approximately 75% to 90% of its total length. They give the effect of hammering on the downhole tools. The weight or hit of the 'hammer' {{depends on how much}} sinker bar is added above the jars. Generally, a slickline operator controls the downhole tools with taps and hits from the sinker bar via the mechanical jars, controlled at surface by lowering or raising the toolstring and monitoring weight, depth, and pressure. Mechanical jars for slickline can hit up or down the <b>hole,</b> <b>making</b> them a versatile form of jarring.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} reach the cell wall, phage lysins have to cross the cell membrane. However, they lack a signal peptide {{that would allow them}} to do so. In order to solve such a problem, phage viruses {{synthesize}} another protein called holin which binds to the cell membrane and makes holes in it (hence its name), allowing lysins to reach the peptidoglycan matrix. The prototypical holin is the lambda phage S protein, which assists the lambda phage R protein (lysin). All holins embed themselves in the cell membrane and contain at least two transmembrane helical domains. The <b>hole</b> <b>making</b> process is thought to be achieved by holin oligomerization at a specific moment when progeny virions are set to be released.|$|E
50|$|Madly Madagascar is a Valentine's Day-themed TV special, It was {{released}} on DVD on January 29, 2013, and starred all the main characters from the Madagascar film series. The story appears to take place sometime between {{the second and third}} films. It featured many of the same voice actors as the films, including Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, and Jada Pinkett Smith. However, voice actor Danny Jacobs once again replaced Sacha Baron Cohen as the voice of the character King Julien. King Julien finds a love potion and starts selling it to members of the watering <b>hole,</b> <b>making</b> Marty attractive to all the animals.

50|$|The Fox Network {{decided to}} {{implement}} a year-round schedule because episodes of the show would be broadcast irregularly {{due to the fact}} that Fox had recently obtained the rights to air the World Series for several years. Thus, FOX chose to air all 24 episodes, without any hiatuses, over 19 weeks beginning mid-seasonâ€”with back-to-back episodes airing twice in the first week, and again at the season finale. Utilizing the extra time this opportunity afforded the writers, Season Four's later premiere date allowed the creators to go back to previous episodes and fill in continuity errors and plot <b>holes,</b> <b>making</b> the episode transitions more fluid and realistic.|$|R
5000|$|Melvin {{was later}} {{defeated}} by Taylor, but eventually leaps at Aden and Taylor, but was later attacked from behind by Tracy. Tracy eventually congratulates Aden for [...] "bringing out Taylor's full potential". Eventually, two other A.S.S. agents arrive, consisting of Aden's step-step-brother-in-law, and X (the A.S.S. founder), who reveals to Taylor {{that he is}} her father. X then also congratulates Aden, and awards him the <b>H.O.L.E.,</b> <b>making</b> him an official A.S.S. Aden then asks Taylor {{to go to the}} homecoming dance with him, but Taylor was able to beat him to it, but when the two reach the school, the dance has already ended. Aden eventually sets his watch to JR Aquino's [...] "You and I", and asks Taylor to dance. While dancing, a bush starts making noise, startling the two. Before they go investigate, the two share a kiss, ending the movie.|$|E
50|$|Most {{frequently}} {{made from}} {{a single piece of}} bamboo, the sÃ¡o measures between 40 and 55 centimeters in length and 1.5 to 2 centimeters in diameter, with six or ten finger holes and a tuning slide. Located inside the bamboo tube, near the oval blowing hole, is a soft wooden piece that adjust pitches when necessary. The first hole after the blowing hole is 12 centimeters away, while the other holes continue at a distance of 1 centimeter apart. At {{the other end of the}} flute, there is a non-covering hole called definite pitch <b>hole,</b> <b>making</b> it easier for the listener to discern pitch. The simple construction of the holes allow for very complex techniques in playing the instrument such as the use of breath with changes in the blowing angle for great or minute changes in sound quality, or partial-holding of finger holes to make delicate pitch changes.|$|E
5000|$|The EP was {{recorded}} by {{friend of the}} band Gar Wood in his garage. It has unusual packaging; the dye-cast cardboard sleeve has a large flower-shaped sticker placed over the center <b>hole,</b> <b>making</b> it necessary to cut the sticker around the center hole in order to remove the record from the sleeve. This causes the cut-out portion of the sticker to then become the center label of the record. The warning [...] "cut carefully and play loud" [...] is printed {{along the edge of}} the area to be cut, since cutting the sticker poses the risk of scratching the record. This warning became the de facto title of the EP. Because of the unusual packaging the records all had to be hand-assembled by the band and friends. The EP was released in 12" [...] vinyl format limited to 3,000 copies, with the first 100 copies pressed on translucent blue vinyl. The original EP is out of print, however all the songs were re-released on CD format on the compilation album Hot Charity/Cut Carefully and Play Loud in 2002.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} of tool use by woodpecker finch species differs between vegetation zones. In the arid zone, where food is limited {{and hard to}} access, tool use is essential, especially during the dry season. Up to half of the finches' prey is acquired {{with the help of}} tools, making them even more routine tool users than chimpanzees. The tools allow them to extract large, nutritious insect larvae from tree <b>holes,</b> <b>making</b> tool use more profitable than other foraging techniques. In contrast, in the humid zone, woodpecker finches rarely use tools, since food availability is high and prey is more easily obtainable. Here, the time and energy costs of tool use would be too high.|$|R
