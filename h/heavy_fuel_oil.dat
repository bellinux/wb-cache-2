5|$|The naphtha cut, as that {{fraction}} is called, {{contains many}} different hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, {{it has an}} initial boiling point of about 35°C and a final boiling point of about 200°C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different boiling range. At some distance below the overhead, the next cut is withdrawn {{from the side of}} the column and it is usually the jet fuel cut, also known as a kerosene cut. The boiling range of that cut is from an initial boiling point of about 150°C to a final boiling point of about 270°C, and it also contains many different hydrocarbons. The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a boiling range from about 180°C to about 315°C. The boiling ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp. After these come the <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> cuts and finally the bottoms product, with very wide boiling ranges. All these cuts are processed further in subsequent refining processes.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of the droplet quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to the measurement of viscosity for industrial oils is reported. In this approach a small-volume droplet of fluid is investigated via its influence on the resonant frequency of a quartz oscillator. The droplet QCM viscosity response is investigated for a selection of industrial oils, including commercial automotive lubricants, <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils,</b> calibration oils and used automotive lubricating oils. This approach shows significant analytical promise for distinguishing between <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> dyed to indicate their duty status. It is also demonstrated that lubricating oils aged in engine tests exhibit an enhanced QCM viscosity response than accepted viscosity measurements would otherwise indicate. The locus at which the viscosity response saturates due to violation of the small loading approximation (extreme viscosities) is identified and found to be qualitatively consistent with established equivalent circuit models. The identification of commercial lubricating oils is observed to be unreliable {{on the basis of}} viscosity response alone...|$|R

25|$|Like {{all modern}} Finnish icebreakers, Kontio has a {{diesel-electric}} propulsion system. It utilizes the so-called power plant principle {{in which the}} main generators provide electricity for all shipboard consumers through a common busbar. Her main generators, four 16-cylinder Wärtsilä Vasa 16V32 four-stroke medium-speed diesel engines producing 5,460kW each and driving 7,540 kVA Kymi-Strömberg alternators, are located on the upper deck beneath the helicopter platform. In addition, she has two smaller Wärtsilä 4R22/26 generators with an output of 350kW for use in ports. The uncommon location of the engine room was chosen to improve the seakeeping characteristics of the icebreaker by moving {{the center of gravity}} higher to calm the ship's motions in heavy weather. In addition, the maintenance of the main engines is easier as the heavy engine components can be handled with the ship's main crane and the <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> tanks could be placed amidships to reduce the probability of an oil spill in case of grounding. , Kontio and her sister ship Otso are the only Finnish icebreakers running on <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> which, being the cheapest fuel available, reduces operational costs of the icebreaker.|$|E

In addition to 12,413.75 m3 of ballast water in the side tanks and 12,304 m3 of void space {{in the middle of}} the barge there are tanks for 592.66 m3 of <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> that can be used to replenish the fuel tanks of the pusher, 82.05 m3 of marine diesel oil for the pusher's auxiliary engines and the barge's own generator and 82.05 m3 of freshwater.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{thermoelectric}} {{generation has}} come to lead a system that was dominated by hydropower: Hydropower plant capacity has gone from 90 percent to only 30 percent. The reasons for this shift are twofold. First, hydroelectric development became more expensive when funding through interest-free loans for its development from International financial institutions was cut. Second, the lower risks and shorter maturity of thermal generation projects, as perceived by private investors, directed generation expansion towards the use of <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> and medium speed diesels.|$|E
50|$|The first post-World War I {{example of}} direct {{gasoline}} injection {{was on the}} Hesselman engine invented by Swedish engineer Jonas Hesselman in 1925. Hesselman engines used the ultra-lean-burn principle and injected the fuel {{in the end of}} the compression stroke and then ignited it with a spark plug, it was often started on gasoline and then switched over to run on diesel or kerosene. The Hesselman engine was a low compression design constructed to run on <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|R
50|$|In North America, No. 2 {{diesel fuel}} is recommended, {{since it has}} a higher cetane number than No. 1 fuel, and has lower {{viscosity}} (better ability to flow) than <b>heavier</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils.</b> Some owners in North America, where cetane levels are generally poor (as low as 40), use additives, or premium diesel, to get cetane numbers closer to the standard levels found in the European market (at least 51) where the engine is designed. Improved cetane reduces emissions while improving performance, and may increase fuel economy.|$|R

25|$|The boilers of Tarmo were {{converted}} for <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> in 1950, which increased her endurance from one week {{to more than}} one month in normal ice conditions and quadrupled her range. Furthermore, the number of stokers tending the boilers could be reduced from 15 to 9. Her superstructure was also expanded and the crew accommodation was brought up to modern standards. However, as late as in 1952 she still lacked a gyrocompass, echosounder and even a radar, all of which were standard equipment on board the merchant ships she assisted during the winter months.|$|E
25|$|For {{electricity}} production the ships have four auxiliary generating sets, Wärtsilä-Vasa 624TS 4-stroke medium-speed diesel engines driving 1,000 kVa Strömberg alternators. One {{of the four}} engines, each with a power output of 810kW at 750 rpm, can also be coupled to a radial compressor to serve the air bubbling system. A fifth engine of the same type is dedicated to drive a second compressor. Instead of <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> the auxiliary generating sets run on marine diesel oil. There's also an emergency diesel generator of Soviet origin that has a power output of 100kW at 1,500 rpm.|$|E
25|$|For the {{manufacturing}} of the on-board power plant, a contract was {{signed with the}} German MAN Diesel company based in Augsburg. The contract, worth over €100 million, includes the supply of 24 large-bore diesel engines, along with electro-mechanical equipment to be installed on four powerships with a total output of 400 MW. Twenty one of them are of type 18V51/60DF dual-fuel diesel engines {{and the three of}} type 14V48/60 <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> engines.

5000|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the {{refinery}} began a long-range modernization and expansion of its facilities to accommodate the new post-war consumer demands for petroleum products. The refinery constructed units that increased production of highly refined products for the postwar generation of higher-compression engines. In 1951, a [...] residuum stripper was constructed to convert <b>heavy</b> residual <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> into lighter products. In 1959, the company made a major breakthrough when it developed the Isocracking process which uses catalysts to rearrange the existing molecules of <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> to remove sulfur and convert low-value <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> into higher-yield products such as gasoline. The company also completed a new fluid catalytic cracking unit capable of processing [...] daily of feed stock, further adding to the high-octane gasolines being demanded in rapidly increasing quantities by modern, high-compression automobile engines. In 1965, a breakthrough came when the Richmond refinery opened the world's largest Isomax hydrocracking complex. The unit converts heavy petroleum oils to lighter stocks for gasoline and other higher valued products. The -a-day unit increased the plant's gasoline output by 40%. A solvent de-asphalting plant and a hydrogen manufacturing plant were also constructed to support the Isomax and were the largest of their kind ever constructed.|$|R
40|$|Use of <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oils</b> in {{industrial}} furnaces {{is known to}} produce a host of corrosion and environmental related problems.

Cabinet papers released in 2014 indicate that MacGregor wished to close 75 pits over a three-year period. Meanwhile, the Thatcher government had prepared against a repeat of the effective 1974 industrial action by stockpiling coal, converting some power stations to burn <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> and recruiting fleets of road hauliers to transport coal in case sympathetic railwaymen went on strike to support the miners.|$|E

Fearing that the ship would sink, the captain called for help from Spanish rescue workers, {{with the expectation that}} the vessel would be brought into harbor. However, pressure from local authorities forced the captain to steer the embattled ship away from the coast and head northwest. Reportedly after pressure from the French government, the vessel was once again forced to change its course and head south into Portuguese waters in order to avoid endangering France's southern coast. Fearing for its own shore, the Portuguese authorities promptly ordered its navy to intercept the ailing vessel and prevent it from approaching further.|$|E
25|$|When Finn-Baltic capsized, some <b>heavy</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> spilled {{to the sea}} {{and had to be}} {{recovered}} from the nearby shores. After the chief engineer and the chief officer had been rescued, the combination was refloated from the shallows and towed to a sheltered location near Ryssö and Mässkär islands on 9 January 1991 to prevent further oil spills and damage to the vessels due to heavy seas. Finn-Baltic was rightened two months later by a Soviet crane ship Stanislav Yudin. The first two attempts resulted in failures, the first on 28 January due to a severed cable and the second two days later due to insufficient lifting capacity, but the third attempt on 1 February was successful. The damaged vessels were towed to Hollming shipyard in Rauma for rebuilding and returned to service in 1991, the pusher as Steel and the barge as Botnia.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{depletion}} of high-grade fuels and for economic reasons, use of residual <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> in energy generation systems is a common practice.

5000|$|According to the {{composition}} of the crude oil and depending on the demands of the market, refineries can produce different shares of petroleum products. The largest share of oil products is used as [...] "energy carriers", i.e. various grades of <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> and gasoline.

Refineries also produce other chemicals, some of which are used in chemical processes to produce plastics and other useful materials. Since petroleum often contains a few percent sulfur-containing molecules, elemental sulfur is also often produced as a petroleum product. Carbon, in the form of petroleum coke, and hydrogen may also be produced as petroleum products. The hydrogen produced is often used as an intermediate product for other oil refinery processes such as hydrocracking and hydrodesulfurization.|$|R
