40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first phase}} of a four-phase collaborative action research study which aimed to facilitate family-focused nursing <b>in</b> the <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> environment. The purpose of phase one was to determine <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> nurses' perceptions of family-focused critical care nursing and the appropriateness of family-focused nursing <b>in</b> the <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit. A collaborative action research group was established with six registered nurses working <b>in</b> the <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit of a metropolitan tertiary referral hospital. Data were collected through group discussions and analysed using open coding. Findings revealed two categories related to perceptions of family-focused <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> nursing: partnership <b>in</b> care and maintaining a balance. The group unanimously agreed that family-focused nursing was appropriate <b>in</b> the <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> environment. The three subsequent action research phases of this study are reported elsewhere...|$|R

5|$|Preterm newborns {{are known}} to be at higher risk for bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} with extended exposure to high concentrations of oxygen. Other groups at higher risk for oxygen toxicity are patients on mechanical ventilation with exposure to levels of oxygen greater than 50%, and patients exposed to chemicals that increase risk for oxygen toxicity such the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin. Therefore, current guidelines for patients on mechanical ventilation <b>in</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> recommends keeping oxygen concentration less than 60%. Likewise, divers who undergo treatment of decompression sickness are at increased risk of oxygen toxicity as treatment entails exposure to long periods of oxygen breathing under hyperbaric conditions, in addition to any oxygen exposure during the dive.|$|E
