5|$|As the Stranger {{continues}} {{to explore the}} island, books linking to more Ages are discovered hidden behind complex mechanisms and puzzles. The Stranger must visit each Age, find the red and blue pages hidden there, and return to Myst Island. These pages can then {{be placed in the}} corresponding books. As the Stranger adds more pages to these books, the brothers can be seen and <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> clearly. After collecting four pages, the brothers can talk clearly enough to tell the Stranger where the fifth and final missing page for their book is hidden; if the Stranger can complete either book, that brother will be set free. The clearer dialog also allows the player to more accurately judge each brother's personality. The Stranger is left with a choice to help Sirrus, Achenar, or neither.|$|E
5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change {{that is going to be}} made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E
25|$|The most-commonly-spoken foreign {{languages}} in Berlin are Turkish, English, Russian, Arabic, Polish, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, Italian, Vietnamese, and French. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian are <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> {{often in the}} western part, due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. English, Vietnamese, Russian, and Polish have more native speakers in East Berlin.|$|E

25|$|Calls are {{typically}} <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> frequently during the breeding season. However, {{the time of}} day can differ amongst species, as some are more vocal in the morning, others in the evening, and some are more vocal during the heat of midday. Some will call at night from their roosts. Frequency can vary between species and between individuals. One male brushland tinamou called every few minutes from dawn until dusk (over 500 calls daily). Some, in particular Crypturellus species, use regular call sites. Only a few possess an alarm call.|$|E
25|$|Although {{some species}} are quite common, {{tinamous}} are shy and secretive birds. They are active during the day, retiring to roosts at night. They generally have cryptic plumage, with {{males and females}} similar in appearance, though the females are usually larger. They are opportunistic and omnivorous feeders, consuming {{a wide variety of}} plant and animal food from fruits and seeds to worms, insects and small vertebrates. They will dust-bathe as well as wash themselves by standing in heavy rain. They are <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> often than seen, communicating with each other by a variety of frequently given, characteristic calls, especially during the breeding season.|$|E
500|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{disclosure of}} the communications intercepted by the United States and Japan revealed {{a considerable amount of}} information about their intelligence systems and capabilities. National Security Agency director Lincoln D. Faurer commented: [...] "...as a result of the Korean Air Lines affair, you have already <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> about my business {{in the past two weeks}} than I would desire... For the most part this has not been a matter of unwelcome leaks. It is the result of a conscious, responsible decision to address an otherwise unbelievable horror." [...] Changes that the Soviets subsequently made to their codes and frequencies reduced the effectiveness of this monitoring by 60%.|$|E

500|$|Chisholm {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} at age 61 and left all his music to the University of Cape Town. Although he {{composed}} over 100 works, only 17 were published in his lifetime, of which 14 were issued in printed score. After his death performances of his music, especially in Britain, fell into neglect but admirers have continued to press for his music to be <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> regularly. His style was called varied, eclectic, and challenging, and his modernism was sometimes considered difficult for audiences. However, in recent years through the efforts of the Erik Chisholm Trust [...] there has been a revival of interest in his music and several works, including orchestral, piano and vocal pieces, have been revived and recorded. Also, many of his unpublished works, formerly in manuscript, have been typeset and are available through the Erik Chisholm Trust.|$|E
500|$|The defense {{deliberately}} antagonized {{the judge}} {{by making a}} large number of objections and motions, which led to numerous bitter engagements between the attorneys and Judge Medina. Sabin, p 46. Despite the aggressive defense tactics and a voluminous letter-writing campaign directed at Medina, he stated [...] "I will not be intimidated". Out of the chaos, an atmosphere of [...] "mutual hostility" [...] arose between the judge and attorneys. [...] Judge Medina attempted to maintain order by removing disorderly defendants. In the course of the trial, Medina sent five of the defendants to jail for outbursts, including Hall because he shouted [...] "I've <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> law in a kangaroo court", and Winstonan African Americanfor shouting [...] "more than five thousand Negroes have been lynched in this country". Morgan, p 315 (Morgan erroneously quotes Winston as saying 500the correct quote is 5,000). [...] Martelle, p 175. Several times in July and August, the judge held defense attorneys in contempt of court, and told them their punishment would be meted out upon conclusion of the trial.|$|E
500|$|On 6 November 2015, Apple Records {{released}} a new deluxe {{version of the}} 1 album in different editions and variations (known as 1+). Most of the tracks on 1 have been remixed from the original multi-track masters by Giles Martin. Giles Martin, with Jeff Lynne also remixed [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] to accompany the music video for the DVD and Blu-ray releases. The remix of [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] cleans up Lennon's vocal further, and uses a different take of Harrison's vocal phrase, replacing the lyric [...] "whatever happened to the life that we once knew" [...] with [...] "whatever happened to love that we once knew". Towards {{the end of the}} track, this version also contains a clip of Lennon stating the phrase [...] "turned out nice again" [...] played forward—which was played backwards in the original mix of the song. McCartney's lead vocal, buried in the original mix to serve as a double-track for Lennon's own vocal, can now [...] be <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> prominently in the second verse.|$|E

2500|$|First Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Renat Kuzmin claimed 20 February 2013 {{that his}} office had {{collected}} enough evidence confirming Kuchma's responsibility for ordering Gongadze's assassination. Kuchma's reply {{the next day}} was: [...] "This is another banal example of a provocation, which I've <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> than enough in the past 12 years".|$|E
2500|$|The opera company {{specializes in}} the {{classics}} of Russian opera such as Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, Glinka's A Life for the Tsar, and Rimsky-Korsakov's The Tsar's Bride, {{as well as the}} operas of Tchaikovsky. [...] Many operas by western composers are also performed, especially works of Italian composers such as Rossini, Verdi, and Puccini. [...] Until the mid-1990s, most foreign operas were sung in Russian, but Italian and other languages have been <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> frequently on the Bolshoi stage in recent years.|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{testimony}} of Enrique Jorrín, he composed some [...] "Danzones" [...] in which the musician of the orchestra had to sing short refrains, and this style was very successful. In the Danzón [...] "Constancia" [...] he introduced some montunos and the audience was motivated to join in singing the refrains. Jorrín also asked {{the members of the}} orchestra to sing in unison so the lyrics may be <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> clearly and achieve a greater impact in the audience. That way of singing also helped to mask the poor singing skills of the orchestra members.|$|E
2500|$|Reminiscent of Tin Pan Alley and Brill Building {{techniques}} and {{an example of}} modified 32-bar form, the song is written on a two-bridge model, with only an intervening verse to connect them. The song has no real [...] "lead" [...] singer, as Lennon and McCartney sing in harmony with each other. Lennon's vocals are more prominent on the recording and on the live bootleg BBC version; however, when the Beatles performed the song on The Ed Sullivan Show on 9 February 1964, McCartney's vocals could be <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> clearly (although {{this may have been}} due to the audio mix, as their microphones were not turned to the same sound level).|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, consul Mosby was {{occupied}} entertaining {{his old friend}} President Grant, who spent the two years after his retirement touring {{the world as a}} semi-private citizen. Mosby received Grant on April 30. During the nearly week-long visit, Grant told Mosby he had <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> reports about the problems in Bangkok and advised Mosby to go directly to President Hayes (as Mosby had just done) and promised to talk to Hayes personally. However, Bailey was confirmed as consul in Shanghai before Grant's return home, and newspapers had begun publishing stories about Mosby's inappropriate attire, the start of a campaign to minimize him as a [...] "crackpot." [...] Moreover, the new State Department investigator was General Julius Stahel, who had fought Mosby in Virginia and had been consul at Hyogo, Japan.|$|E

2500|$|Days, weeks, months, {{and even}} years might have passed on {{much in the}} same manner.... We breakfasted at the same hour, and the tea-kettle was always boiling...; a lounge in the orchard {{for an hour or}} two, and twice a week we could see the steam-boat {{creeping}} like a spider over the surface of the lake; a volume of the Scotch novels..., or M. Galignani's Paris and London Observer, amused us till dinner time; then tea and a walk till the moon unveiled itself, [...] "apparent queen of the night," [...] or the brook, swoln with a transient shower, was <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> distinctly in the darkness, mingling with the soft, rustling breeze; and the next morning the song of peasants broke upon refreshing sleep, as the sun glanced among the clustering vine-leaves, or the shadowy hills, as the mists retired from their summits, looked in at our windows.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Garbage {{was named}} the 71st {{greatest}} album of all time by The Guardian, which polled a number of renowned critics, artists, and radio DJs worldwide. It was later included in the musical reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. According to Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood, the record's techno-minded sound and Manson's alluring persona complemented and countered the contemporary post-grunge music Vig had helped pioneer after producing Nirvana's 1991 album Nevermind. Sound on Sound journalist Sam Inglis argued that the musical techniques used on Garbage were radical {{at the time and}} influenced subsequent popular music, [...] "uniting distorted guitars and cool female vocals with production that owed as much to Public Enemy as Led Zeppelin". In Jancee Dunn's opinion, the album always sounded [...] "very forward-thinking, intelligent" [...] and current, even when <b>heard</b> <b>more</b> than a decade later.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of the NIV, New Living Translation, {{and similar}} {{versions}} {{contend that the}} translation used for Acts 22:9 is inaccurate. The verb used here — akouō (ἀκούω) — can be translated both [...] "hear" [...] and [...] "understand" [...] (both the KJV and NIV translate akouō as [...] "understand" [...] in , for example). It often takes a noun in the genitive case for a person is being heard, with a noun in the accusative for the thing being <b>heard.</b> <b>More</b> classically, {{the use of the}} accusative indicates hearing with understanding. There is indeed a case difference here, with [...] using the genitive tēs phōnēs (τῆς φωνῆς), and [...] using the accusative tēn phōnēn (τὴν φωνὴν). However, there has been debate about which rule Luke was following here. On the second interpretation, Paul's companions may indeed have heard the voice (as is unambiguously stated in Acts 9:7), yet not understood it, although New Testament scholar Daniel B. Wallace finds this argument based on case inconclusive.|$|E
