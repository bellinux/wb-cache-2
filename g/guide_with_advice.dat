5000|$|He used such volumes as {{the basis}} for his pocket guides to {{selected}} regions, with route instructions for the most of the named peaks in the area. The books followed those of the Abraham Brothers in being exhaustively illustrated with the author's own photographs (usually in black and white). His habit in later volumes of drawing the route of ascent in white on the photograph was helpful for route-finding. Landmarks are important for route-finding, especially where paths are indistinct (as on many Scottish hills), and he advises on important features to look for on the paths he describes. They include cairns, standing stones, bothies, distinctive rock formations, panoramas, views and natural features such as cascades and waterfalls. He also warns of problems be aware about on more challenging paths (such as the [...] "bad step" [...] on the climb up to Crib Goch). He generally used a Leica for his photography, and gave details of his methods in the pocket <b>guides,</b> together <b>with</b> friendly <b>advice</b> on hillwalking and scrambling.|$|R
