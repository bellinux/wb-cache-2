5|$|Alongside the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{the greater}} Elves, Tolkien also {{developed}} the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> children visiting Valinor, the island-homeland of the Elves in their sleep. Elves would also visit children {{at night and}} comfort them {{if they had been}} chided or were upset. This theme, linking elves with children's dreams and nocturnal travelling was largely abandoned in Tolkien's later writing.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} Butlin had nurtured the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a holiday camp.

In addition, the chapter considers Hume’s views on the imagination as a faculty <b>of</b> producing <b>ideas,</b> {{as well as on}} the part that imagining plays in the acquisition of modal knowledge and in the comprehension of, and resistance to, false or fictional opinions...|$|R

5|$|According to his autobiography, it {{was while}} he was in bed with a fever that Wallace thought about Thomas Malthus's <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{positive}} checks on human population growth and came up with the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> natural selection.

From 1858 to 1861 he rented a house on Ternate from the Dutchman Maarten Dirk van Renesse van Duivenbode. He used this house as a base camp for expeditions to other islands such as Gilolo.|$|E

5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box.

He also has a clear and distinct <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
