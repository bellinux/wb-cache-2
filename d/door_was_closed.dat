25|$|There was {{a chapel}} in the {{courthouse}}, 100 {{yards from the}} barracks. Mrs Devine's duty was to prepare the courthouse for mass. The next day, Sunday, she was allowed to do so, but was accompanied {{by one of the}} Kellys. At about 10am Kelly remained in the courthouse and helped Mrs Devine prepare the altar and dust the forms. When this was done Kelly escorted her back to the barracks, where the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> and the blinds pulled {{to give the impression that}} the Devines were out. Hart and Dan Kelly, dressed in police uniform, walked to and from the stables during the day without attracting notice.|$|E
25|$|With {{the second}} series {{delivered}} the SM53 units entered service {{on most of}} street tram lines. Two exceptions were the Kampen Line and the Vestbanen Line, both which were built for the older narrow profile {{and could not be}} used by the wider trams. As the trams were unidirectional they required a balloon loop at the ends of each line, which was also lacking on the Kampen Line, and new track arrangement had to be built at Vålerenga Depot and Majorstuen Depot. The issue was availed by the 1957 opening of Grefsen Depot, which was built for unidirectional trams. The MBO50 units were rebuilt in 1959, whereby the back <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> and the received the same interior as the new trams, with single seats all the way along the door side.|$|E
25|$|Dorothy was {{to pick up}} {{her sister}} Louise after seeing Snider and never showed, which was very unlike her. Around 11 pm, Snider's private {{investigator}} called Cushner on his private line, saying that he had been trying to call Snider for several hours, but Snider was not answering. Although there were many guests in the residence, Snider's bedroom <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> and they assumed Snider's privacy was essential. Cushner broke into Snider's room and discovered the nude bodies of Snider and Stratten, both having been shot with a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun, which Snider had recently acquired. Police determined that Snider murdered Stratten, who was 20, then abused and raped her corpse, before turning the shotgun on himself. Dorothy's body was found connected to an odd, homemade sexual contraption and both bodies were covered with ants.|$|E

500|$|Within a year Cardus {{had been}} moved from the reporters' room {{to take charge of}} the paper's [...] "Miscellany" [...] column. He also resumed the duties of {{part-time}} secretary to Scott, who was at this time over 70, and had edited The Manchester Guardian since 1872. Despite his years, he struck Cardus as [...] "of inexhaustible energy and aliveness". Scott was a demanding employer, who gave his young writers free rein, but expected in return long hours and total dedication. Driven hard, sometimes to the point of exhaustion, Cardus nevertheless relished these years, and never complained to Scott of weariness. Early in 1919 his role changed again, when he was made junior drama critic under the direction of C.E. Montague, the paper's principal theatre critic who had returned from war service with no great desire to continue in the role. Cardus's principal ambitions still lay in the direction of music criticism, though he recognised that this <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> while Samuel Langford, music critic since 1906, remained in post. In preparation for any opportunity that might arise in that direction, Cardus maintained a daily two-hour study of music or music literature.|$|E

2500|$|Close {{examination}} of the wreckage revealed no evidence of structural faults such as fatigue, corrosion or mechanical damage that could have caused the in-flight breakup. It was also suggested that the breakup could have been initiated by an in-flight separation of the forward cargo door like the disasters on board Turkish Airlines Flight 981 or United Airlines Flight 811, but all evidence indicated that the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> and locked at impact. The NTSB concluded that [...] "the in-flight breakup of TWA flight 800 was not initiated by a preexisting condition resulting in a structural failure and decompression." ...|$|E
2500|$|FIFA President Sepp Blatter {{took the}} unusual step of apologising to England and Mexico for the {{decisions}} that went against them, saying: [...] "Yesterday I spoke to the two federations directly concerned by referees' mistakes [...] I apologised to England and Mexico. The English said thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it." [...] Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying: [...] "We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting." [...] Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke said the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the IFAB.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Ducellier alternator {{supplied with}} the early production DMC-12s could not provide enough current to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the battery would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the [...] "safety" [...] lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, further draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner Johnny Carson shortly after he was presented with the vehicle. Later cars were fitted from the factory with a higher output Motorola alternator which solved this problem. This also is believed [...] to be the reason behind the improvement in the sound quality of the horn. Earlier models emitted a weak sound, not loud or strong enough {{to be effective in}} normal traffic.|$|E

2500|$|Georgescu's {{career as}} a cellist {{came to an end}} late in World War I. [...] He was interned for a time in Berlin as an enemy alien; {{although}} the local artistic community quickly obtained his release, Georgescu was still obligated to contact the police twice daily. [...] More seriously, as he traveled to an engagement in 1916, a railway carriage <b>door</b> <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> on his hand, causing a painful injury that ultimately precluded his further performance on the cello. [...] As that chapter in his life closed, however, a new one opened; Richard Strauss and Arthur Nikisch both advised him to take up conducting, advice that he quickly followed after coaching with the latter. [...] Not long after a private appearance as conductor at the home of Franz von Mendelssohn, Georgescu made his public debut in that capacity on February 15, 1918, leading the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in Tchaikovsky's Pathétique Symphony, Grieg's Piano Concerto, and Richard Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks. [...] There followed a year of performances with that ensemble, notable, inter alia, for including Claudio Arrau's Berlin debut.|$|E
