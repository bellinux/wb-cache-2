50|$|This snake {{is known}} to be a {{powerful}} constrictor, and therefore its diet consists of mostly mice if domestic, and other rodents if wild. It also can <b>feed</b> on <b>clutches</b> of reptile eggs detected beneath the surface via smell. In part because of its resistance to pitviper venom, the desert kingsnake is able to consume young diamondback rattlesnakes that are common within its range, and at the scent of L. getula even adult western diamondbacks edge hastily backward, shielding their heads with defensive loops.|$|R
5000|$|The CX-7 {{features}} {{fully independent}} suspension, four wheel ventilated disc brakes with standard anti-lock brakes, stability control and traction control, and {{a choice of}} either front-wheel drive, or Mazda's Active Torque-Split all wheel drive system. With the Active Torque Split system, two computer controlled magnetic <b>clutches</b> <b>feed</b> up to 50% of the engine's torque to the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|Like other {{woodpecker}} species {{they usually}} excavate a new breeding cavity every season, which {{takes a few}} weeks. With this species a nest is not located {{in the vicinity of}} the previous season's nest. The entrance hole is oval in shape, and situated about 2 meters from the ground. The glossy white eggs, 1 to 3 in number, are laid on a layer of wood chips. Incubation starts when the full clutch has been laid at one day intervals, and this usually occurs in spring or early summer. Both parents partake in incubation, brooding and <b>feeding.</b> The <b>clutch</b> is incubated for about 12 days, and the chick leaves the nest in some 27 days, when it is immediately independent. The scaly-throated honeyguide is a recorded nest parasite.|$|R
50|$|The Papuan {{hornbill}} nests {{in a large}} tree hollow in the rainforest, from {{at least}} 18 m up to 30 m above the ground. The female is restricted to the nest cavity throughout the incubation and nestling period, being largely sealed inside by plastering up the entrance {{with a mixture of}} fruit pulp and rotten wood, leaving only a narrow aperture through which the male <b>feeds</b> her. The <b>clutch</b> size is about two eggs.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{relating}} reproduction to food availability {{are usually}} restricted to food quantity, but ignore food {{quality and the}} effects of habitat structure on obtaining the food. This is particularly true for insectivorous birds. In this study we relate measures of reproductive success, time of reproduction and nestling size of water pipits (Anthus sp. spinoletta) to biomass, taxonomic composition and nutritional contents of available food, and to vegetation structure and distance to <b>feeding</b> places. <b>Clutch</b> size was correlated positively with the proportion of grass at the feeding places, which facilitates foraging. This suggests that water pipits adapt their clutch size to environmental conditions. Also, pipits started breeding earlier and produced more fledglings when abundant food and a large proportion of grass were available, probably because these conditions allow the birds to gain more energy in less time. The number of fledglings was correlated positively with the energy content of available food. No significant relationships were found between feeding conditions and nestling size or the time that nestlings took to fledge. This suggests that water pipits do not invest more in individual nestlings when food conditions are favourable but rather start breeding earlier and produce more young. Taxonomic composition and nutritional content of prey were not correlated with any of the reproductive parameters, indicating that profitability rather than quality of food affects reproductive success...|$|R
40|$|A {{possibility}} of applying {{the theory of}} semi-Markov (semimarkovian) processes to {{the description of the}} reliability of an automotive vehicle has been presented, with taking a passenger car as an example. In the car considered, such constructional systems (functional components) as engine with fuel, lube oil, and coolant <b>feeding</b> systems, <b>clutch,</b> gearbox, drive shaft, driving axle, steering and suspension system, braking system, electrical system, body with chassis, and measuring and monitoring equipment have been distinguished. A reliability model of the car has been developed {{in the form of a}} semi-Markov process, which is a single-state model. The set of reliability states has been built as consisting of one state of car serviceability and ten states of the functional components as specified above. A graph of changes in these states has been shown and an initial distribution and a functional matrix representing changes in the said reliability states of the car have been defined. Formulas have been derived that define the boundary distribution of the process of changes in the technical states of such a car. This distribution represents the probability of the car being serviceable and unserviceable due to a failure of any of the functional components mentioned above. The {{possibility of}} using statistics to estimate the probabilities of changes in the said car reliability states has been presented. A possibility of applying the theory of semi-Markov processes to the investigation of car reliability in the case of defining the instantaneous distribution of the process of changes in the car reliability states has also been mentioned.

25|$|New Zealand {{grass grub}} has an annual life cycle, taking {{typically}} one year under normal climatic conditions but {{can take up}} to two years in adverse weather such as drought or significant cold periods (this also includes periods where the soil moisture is very high), or due to a food shortage. Over that one-year period the adult beetles live for 4–6 weeks emerging in spring (October – December) when the air temperature is above 10 degrees Celsius, and undertake two main flights, the first flight is to mate and the second and consecutive are to <b>feed</b> and lay <b>clutches</b> of eggs. Females are the last to emerge from the soil, this leads to localized infestations due to them being unable to reach a significant distance before being mated. Egg cluster size can range from 5-80 eggs and range from 80–250mm {{below the surface of the}} soil. Females can lay two to three clusters over a two to three week period. Costelytra zealandica larvae hatch between November and March (depending on the time they were laid). They start to feed on roots of clover and pasture plants from the time they hatch until September. They undergo three stages called instars before pupation.|$|R
40|$|A {{short-term}} Tisbe battagliai {{toxicity test}} design {{was used to}} assess the potential ecological effects of pollutants in coastal marine communities. By exposing nauplii and reproductive females over 4 and 6 d, respectively, to 3 toxic substances (fluoranthene, cypermethin and deltamethrin), the bioassay was seen to successfully measure survival effects on egg, nauplii and adults and sublethal effects on food acquisition and clutch size. Predictive consequences of toxic exposure at population level was estimated in terms of reproductive success, by integrating effects on adult survival and reproductive performance over the studied exposure period. Fluoranthene exposure reduced <b>feeding</b> rate and <b>clutch</b> size at concentrations below those affecting survival and population responses. For cypermethrin, survival, sublethal and reproductive success concentration effects were of a similar magnitude. For deltamethrin adult and nauplii survival, clutch size and reproductive success were equally affected at concentrations which were lower than those affecting feeding and egg survival. Responses to contaminated algae showed a different pattern, with toxicant effects only on nauplii survival and reproductive success, and under exposure to pyrethroid insecticides. Thus, differences in the dominant ecotoxicological modes of action, in terms of the balance between survival and sublethal responses with potential effects at the population level, could be successfully assessed using this short-term bioassay. These results have important implications for risk assessment in estuarine and coastal waters because with relatively short-term, and thus cost-effective tests, the functional relationship between effects on survival, feeding and reproduction rates and concentration can be determined...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHatching {{asynchrony}} in avian species generally {{leads to}} a size hierarchy among siblings, favouring the first-hatched chicks. Maternally deposited hormones affect the embryo and chick's physiology and behaviour. It has been observed that progesterone, a hormone present at higher levels than other steroid hormones in egg yolks, is negatively related to body mass in embryos, chicks and adults. A differential within-clutch progesterone deposition could therefore {{be linked to the}} size hierarchy between siblings and to the resulting brood reduction. We tested whether yolk progesterone levels differed between eggs according to future parental ability to <b>feed</b> the entire <b>clutch</b> in wild rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome. This species presents a unique reversed egg-size dimorphism and hatching asynchrony, with the larger secondlaid egg (B-egg) hatching before the smaller first-laid egg (A-egg). Yolk progesterone levels increased only slightly with female body mass at laying. However, intra-clutch ratios were not related to female body mass. On the other hand, yolk progesterone levels increased significantly with the date of laying onset for A-eggs while they decreased for B-eggs. Early clutches therefore had proportionally more progesterone in the B-egg compared to the A-egg while late clutches had proportionally less progesterone in the B-egg. We propose that females could strategically regulate yolk progesterone deposition within clutches according to the expected food availability during chick growth, an adaptive strategy to adjust brood reduction to conditions. We also discuss these results, relating to yolk progesterone, in the broader context of other yolk steroids...|$|R
60|$|To {{break-in}} an ox, {{take a long}} thong or cord, make a noose {{at one end of}} it, and let two {{or three}} men lay hold of the other; then, driving all the herd together in a clump, go in among them and, aided by a long stick, push or slip the noose round the hind leg of the ox that you want, and draw tight. He will pull and struggle with all his might, and the other oxen will disperse, leaving him alone dragging the men about after him. Next, let another man throw a noose round his horns, and the beast is, comparatively speaking, secured. It is now convenient to throw the animal down on his side, which is easily done by the judicious tugging at his tail and at the thongs. To keep him on the ground, let one man take the tail, and, passing it round one thigh, hold him down by that, while one or two men force the horns down against the ground. His nose has next to be pierced. A stick, shaped like a Y, eight inches long, is cut of some tough wood; and the foot of it, being first sharpened, is forcibly poked through the wall that divides the nostrils, and a thin thong is tied firmly to either end of this nose-stick. The thong is gathered together, and wound in a figure of 8 round the two horns, where it henceforward remains while the animal <b>feeds,</b> and by <b>clutching</b> at which, he is at any time caught.|$|R
40|$|The Late Permian mass {{extinction}} occurring at 252. 6 ± 0. 2 Ma {{is the most}} severe Phanerozoic extinction event and was preceded and followed by additional disturbances. Patterns and processes of extinction and recovery of marine vertebrates have been little studied compared to marine invertebrates. This project focuses on Chondrichthyes, which, together with other marine fish, {{appeared to have been}} relatively unaffected by the extinction, while most of their supporting ecosystem collapsed. This study explores the authenticity of extinction among chondrichthyans and possible explanations for the observed patterns, because extinction severities on the taxonomic and ecological levels may be decoupled or the quality of the fossil record may be variable. The presented analyses are based on a newly compiled database that supercedes older compilations. It is supplemented by material obtained from numerous localities globally, which includes newly described taxa. Hence, this study attempts to be the most up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of patterns and trends in chondrichthyan diversity and distribution that is currently available. The data demonstrate that, despite some variability in the Permian–Triassic chondrichthyan fossil record, the Lopingian record is shown to be of adequate completeness and, furthermore, range-through genus diversity is not significantly correlated with the number of taxonomic occurrences. Genus diversity declined from the mid-Guadalupian following an increasing extinction rate, which intensified throughout the Lopingian and thus supports a combined overall extinction {{as a result of the}} end-Guadalupian and Late Permian events. Furthermore, global distribution of chondrichthyan diversity shifted away from tropical regions and particularly the Boreal Sea gained in diversity, tracking extinction and recovery in marine benthic invertebrates in both time and space. No significant dependence of extinction on taxonomic structure or palaeoecological traits exists, which suggests proportional losses, except during the end-Smithian crisis. Also, a significant size decrease is absent among Permian/Triassic boundary-crossing taxa, suggesting selective loss of large-sized chondrichthyans rather than adaptive size decrease. Ultimately, the Hybodontiformes, Neoselachii, Xenacanthiformes and Holocephali are identified as the survivors, which possessed a varying combination of characteristics such as moderate body-size, adaptation to brackish/freshwater environments, benthic or generalist littoral (<b>clutching)</b> <b>feeding</b> behaviour, and a wide palaeogeographic range.
