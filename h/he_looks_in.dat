25|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Bullitt drives home. As {{he walks up}} to his apartment, he spots Cathy's car. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> and sees her {{sleeping}} in his bedroom, {{but he does not}} wake her. He takes off his gun and balances it on a banister. As he begins to wash up at the bathroom sink, he looks up into his own reflection and contemplates himself for a long moment.|$|E
2500|$|Later on, Jack {{meets with}} Sam, who {{gives him the}} key to the deposit box at the Grand Central Station. She also informs him about another job, which he happily accepts. The credits roll, which during which Jack is then shown on a desert road in his Mustang. Sam calls up and asks, [...] "How's it goin' down there? Havin' a good time, Jack?" [...] to which Jack responds, [...] "There's no place I'd rather be." [...] Smiling, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> his {{rear-view}} mirror, as the camera pans overhead to reveal a number of police cars chasing him.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is unknown}} whether {{the origins of}} the {{practice}} are purely superstitious. Hall of Famer Denis Potvin says that the Islanders of the 1980s would [...] "play four games in five nights in the first round and it was just something that kind of happened." [...] The 1980 Islanders included two Swedish players (Stefan Persson and Anders Kallur), so it is possible that tennis champion Björn Borg's custom of not shaving his beard during Wimbledon, which he had been doing for several years by that time, was an influence on the start of the practice in hockey. Some players have said the beard is both a reminder of team unity and a way to get a player thinking about the playoffs from the moment <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> the mirror in the morning. The 2009 Red Wings used the slogan [...] "The beard is back" [...] for the final series of their 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs run. They played the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Stanley Cup Final that year (won by Pittsburgh) in which most of the players (and the owner of the team, Mario Lemieux) grew beards as well.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> his solemn {{way towards}} his wife, {{but not a}} word said she.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A good-looking young man,' he said, {{with his}} eyes where Swithin had vanished. 'But not so good as <b>he</b> <b>looks.</b> <b>In</b> fact a regular young sinner.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{him first}} {{what we think}} of him," [...] he objected. [...] "Let me tell him what <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> the eyes of a pure-minded American." ...|$|E
6000|$|Tell Tom {{he draws}} a farce in vain, [...] Before <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> nature's glass; Puns cannot form a witty scene, [...] Nor pedantry for humour pass.|$|E
60|$|When <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> {{upon her}} she sprang {{out of her}} lair, great-eyed and trembling.|$|R
60|$|The {{corners of}} the Sergeant's melancholy mouth curled up, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> hard <b>in</b> my face, just as <b>he</b> had <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> the garden.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> astonishment at the {{splinters}} of glass, and {{the brown}} hand lying upon the floor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} not. However, here's Sir Timothy. When <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> that way, all buckram, deportment, and solemnity, I know he's going to pitch into somebody." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How nice <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> them," [...] Lily said to {{her sister}} afterwards, knowing nothing of the {{thoughts}} which had troubled her lover's mind while he was adorning his legs.|$|E
6000|$|The {{officers}} {{hurried to}} the spot. [...] "Yes, the poor fellow is a sergeant of the Heavies. No doubt you were right, Easton. You see he has been wounded in the side. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> a bad way." ...|$|E
60|$|I thanked him, and we parted. Just as he {{was closing}} the door <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> again.|$|R
60|$|On {{arriving}} at the doorway, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in,</b> but without seeing any one, because of the gloom.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> {{wonder and}} affright {{from the woman}} who {{questioned}} him to the other whose arm he clutched.|$|R
6000|$|... "Often {{he spends}} the summer where the snow remains all the year through and his white coat is a {{protection}} from the keenest eyes. You see, when not moving, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> the distance {{for all the world}} like a patch of snow on the rocks.|$|E
6000|$|Weakened and thinned by {{his illness}} at Patras, Byron {{returned}} to Athens. There, standing {{one day before}} a looking-glass, he said to Lord Sligo, [...] "How pale I look! I should like, I think, to die of a consumption." [...] "Why of a consumption?" [...] asked his friend. [...] "Because then," [...] he answered, [...] "the women would all say, 'See that poor Byron--how interesting <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> dying!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Why should Mohegan go?” {{returned}} the Indian, gloomily. “He {{has seen the}} days of an eagle, and his eye grows dim He looks on the valley; he looks on the water; <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> the hunting-grounds—but he sees no Delawares. Every one has a white skin. My fathers say, from the far- off land, Come. My women, my young warriors, my tribe, say, Come. The Great Spirit says, Come. Let Mohegan die.” ...|$|E
60|$|Monsieur Albert {{looked over}} her {{shoulder}} for the man who must surely be <b>in</b> attendance--but <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> vain.|$|R
6000|$|... "He don't just say," [...] said mother; [...] "he said he {{must keep}} very quiet. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> {{this morning for}} a minute or two, and <b>he</b> said he'd <b>look</b> <b>in</b> later in the day again. But he said to keep Fred very quiet." ...|$|R
60|$|The window being {{accessible}} {{from the}} footway, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> over the blind, returned the shuttlecock, {{and put his}} question.|$|R
6000|$|Rachel sings sweet-- [...] Oh yes, at night, Her {{pale face}} bent [...] In the candle-light, Her slim hands touch [...] The {{answering}} keys, And she sings of hope [...] And of memories: Sings {{to the little}} [...] Boy that stands Watching those slim, [...] Light, heedful hands. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> her face; [...] Her dark eyes seem Dark with a beautiful [...] Distant dream; And still she plays, [...] Sings tenderly To him of hope, [...] And of memory.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't think I have--I {{have had}} the same thing said to me two or three times before," [...] replied Fan naïvely. [...] "But I wish you would tell me more about my father when he was healthy and happy. Was he really as {{handsome}} as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> the portrait? It seems so life-like that when I am looking at it I can hardly realise that he is not somewhere living on the earth, that I shall never hold his hand and hear his voice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The usual thing, I suppose, old chap," [...] he said, with a {{smile and}} a yawn. [...] "I ring for a b. and s., and then I have my tub. I splash a good deal in the water, of course. You are aware that there are two ways in which I can receive Tommy Carmichael when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> to have a chat about polo. I can talk to him through the {{bathroom}} door, or I can be picking at a grilled bone which my man has brought in. Which would you prefer?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> at it <b>in</b> silence. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> at me--also <b>in</b> silence.|$|R
6000|$|But <b>he</b> <b>looked,</b> <b>in</b> {{spite of}} it, {{literally}} apprehensive and consistently strenuous. [...] "Ah, I thought you liked me for myself!" ...|$|R
60|$|Later on <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> at {{the club}} and saw Freddy Vavasour, polo team captain, dawdling over grilled bone No. 1.|$|R
60|$|That {{is what a}} lot {{of people}} say about Blacky the Crow. Of course it is true that Blacky does get into a lot of mischief, but if people really knew him they would find that he isn't as black as <b>he</b> <b>looks.</b> <b>In</b> fact, Blacky the Crow does a whole lot of good in his own {{peculiar}} way, but people are always looking for him to do bad things, and you know you most always see what you expect to see. Thus the good Blacky does isn't seen, while the bad is, and so he has grown to have a reputation blacker than the coat he wears.|$|E
6000|$|The {{lights are}} high on beacon and from bower, [...] And 'midst them Conrad seeks Medora's tower: [...] <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> vain--'tis strange--and all remark, [...] Amid so many, hers alone is dark. [...] 'Tis strange--of yore its welcome never failed, [...] Nor now, perchance, extinguished--only veiled. [...] 1740 [...] With the first boat descends he for the shore, [...] And looks {{impatient}} on the lingering oar. [...] Oh! for a wing beyond the falcon's flight, [...] To bear {{him like an}} arrow to that height! [...] With the first pause the resting rowers gave, [...] He waits not--looks not--leaps into the wave, [...] Strives through the surge, bestrides the beach, and high [...] Ascends the path familiar to his eye.|$|E
6000|$|It is haying time; {{a bright}} day; all is cheerful; the birds sing; men, women, and {{children}} are busy in the field. Up we go, zigzag; it grows steeper and steeper. Now right below me is a field, where men are literally working almost on a perpendicular wall, cutting hay; now we are so high that the houses in the valley look like chips. Here we stand in a place two thousand feet above the valley. There is no shield or screen. The horse stands on the very edge; the guide stops, lets go his bridle, and composedly commences an oration on the scene below. [...] "0, for mercy's sake, why do you stop here?" [...] I say. [...] "Pray go on." [...] <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>in</b> my face, with innocent wonder, takes the bridle on his arm, and goes on.|$|E
60|$|Not {{prepared}} for a display of physical force, Comrade Ossipon stumbled far into the shop before her push. He was astonished at {{the strength of the}} woman and scandalised by her proceedings. But he did not retrace his steps in order to remonstrate with her severely in the street. He was beginning to be disagreeably impressed by her fantastic behaviour. Moreover, this or never was the time to humour the woman. Comrade Ossipon avoided easily the end of the counter, and approached calmly the glazed door of the parlour. The curtain over the panes being drawn back a little he, by a very natural impulse, <b>looked</b> <b>in,</b> just as <b>he</b> made ready to turn the handle. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> without a thought, without intention, without curiosity of any sort. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> because <b>he</b> could not help <b>looking</b> <b>in.</b> <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in,</b> and discovered Mr Verloc reposing quietly on the sofa.|$|R
60|$|Wilfrid {{stood still}} with astonishment as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> at the door, which Mr. Atherton had himself opened in {{response}} to his knock.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>in</b> my face steadily, and then, {{instead of}} {{replying}} to my remark, he said slowly, [...] "Your name is Spottiswood, I believe?" ...|$|R
