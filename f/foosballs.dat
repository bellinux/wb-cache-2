40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the development of}} a programmable robotic <b>foosball</b> table as a versa-tile platform for robotics research. A programmable robotic <b>foosball</b> table is a <b>foosball</b> table with a computer controlled mechanical system to control the rods,and a mean of sensing the position of the ball and the rods. We discuss the design of the system that we’ve created, and its various implementations. In particular,we suggest its use in an international robotic programming contest. ...|$|R
40|$|Prolonged {{working hours}} are a {{primary cause of}} stress, work related {{injuries}} (e. g, RSIs), and work-life imbalance in employees at a workplace. As reported by some studies, taking timely breaks from continuous work not only reduces stress and exhaustion but also improves productivity, employee bonding, and camaraderie. Our goal {{is to build a}} system that automatically detects breaks thereby assisting in maintaining healthy work-break balance. In this paper, we focus on detecting <b>foosball</b> breaks of employees at a workplace using a smartwatch. We selected <b>foosball</b> as {{it is one of the}} most commonly played games at many workplaces in the United States. Since playing <b>foosball</b> involves wrist and hand movement, a wrist-worn device (e. g., a smartwatch), due to its position, has a clear advantage over a smartphone for detecting <b>foosball</b> activity. Our evaluation using data collected from real workplace shows that we can identify with more than 95 % accuracy whether a person is playing <b>foosball</b> or not. We also show that we can determine how long a <b>foosball</b> session lasted with an error of less than 3 % in the best case...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{designing}} and implementing low-cost yet effective user interfaces for interactive computer games that heavily use physically-based animation. Due to the nature of a physics-driven gaming setup in our system, we require that the interfaces should mimic the tangibility of real-world interfaces to maximize the playability of the game. Our prototype gaming system, called Space <b>Foosball,</b> is a virtual realization of the real-world <b>foosball</b> in a space-age setting. The biggest challenge to build our system was to design effective and robust interfaces to control the motion of user paddles, which in turn drive the physics simulation of the secondary motion between a soccer ball and the environment, and between a ball and game characters. To meet our tight development budget and schedule, we opted for off-the-shelf optical sensors as a basis of the controlling mechanism. These sensors are low-cost but provided a robust solution to our problem. Another important task to build the Space <b>Foosball</b> was implementing a high-performance game physics engine that suits for simulating the very dynamic <b>foosball</b> environment. To meet this demand, we designed and implemented an in-house physics engine, called Virtual Physics, based on a mathematical formulation of Lie groups. In less than a short period of two months, we successfully built our prototype gaming system which effectively utilizes tangible interfaces while robustly simulating the game physics environment...|$|R
