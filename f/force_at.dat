5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} bite <b>force</b> <b>at</b> the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite <b>force</b> <b>at</b> the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite <b>force</b> <b>at</b> the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E
5|$|After France {{requested}} U.S. {{assistance for}} its beleaguered <b>force</b> <b>at</b> Dien Bien Phu in 1954, Radford suggested an aggressive stance toward the Viet Minh, recommending the U.S. threaten them {{with nuclear weapons}} as it had with the Chinese in Korea. He also advocated U.S. military intervention in the 1955 First Taiwan Strait Crisis {{as well as the}} 1956 Suez Crisis, but Eisenhower favored diplomatic approaches and threats of force.|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{characterization of}} the rotordynamic fluid forces acting on a whirling centrifugal impeller has been investigated at different flow rates and cavitating conditions. The recently developed method for continuously measuring the rotordynamic <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> variable whirl ratios has been readapted and successfully applied for measuring the same <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> constant whirl ratio but variable cavitation number. The flowrate has {{a major influence on}} the stability of the rotordynamic <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> positive whirl ratios where a threshold flowrate separates the stable zone from the unstable. At negative whirl ratios, the normal force is typically unstable independently on the flow rate. Cavitation has always a destabilizing effect at positive whirl ratio while it can stabilize the rotor dynamic <b>forces</b> <b>at</b> negative whirl ratio...|$|R

However, on 10 March 1811, the Spanish commander, José Imaz, was bribed into surrendering to a French force under Marshal Soult. A British and Portuguese army, commanded by Marshal Beresford, endeavoured to retake it and on 16 May 1811 defeated a relieving <b>force</b> <b>at</b> Albuera, but the siege was abandoned the following month.|$|E
