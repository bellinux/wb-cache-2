The process of nitrogen fixation requires an influx of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate. Nitrogen fixation is highly sensitive to the presence of oxygen, so Azotobacter developed a special defensive mechanism against oxygen, namely a significant intensification of metabolism that reduces the concentration of oxygen in the cells. Also, a special nitrogenase-protective protein [...] protects nitrogenase and is involved in protecting the cells from oxygen. Mutants not producing this protein are killed by oxygen during nitrogen fixation {{in the absence of a}} nitrogen source in the medium.

2500|$|In these organisms, {{hydrogen}} is oxidized by a membrane-bound <b>hydrogenase</b> causing proton pumping via electron transfer to various quinones and cytochromes. [...] In many organisms, a second cytoplasmic <b>hydrogenase</b> {{is used to}} generate reducing power {{in the form of}} NADH, which is subsequently used to fix carbon dioxide via the Calvin cycle.

The NiFe <b>hydrogenases,</b> when isolated, are found to catalyse both H2 evolution and uptake, with low-potential multihaem cytochromes such as cytochrome c3 acting as either electron donors or acceptors, depending on their oxidation state. Generally speaking, however, NiFe <b>hydrogenases</b> are more active in oxidizing H2. A wide spectrum of H2 affinities have also been observed in H2-oxidizing <b>hydrogenases.</b>|$|R

[NiFe]-hydrogenases are heterodimeric proteins with the active site localized in the large subunit. [FeFe]-hydrogenases are mostly monomeric and their active site is called H-cluster. <b>Hydrogenases</b> often possess additional domains that contain redox centers, mostly iron-sulfur clusters. Most of the accessory domains of <b>hydrogenases</b> are homologous to other redox complexes, e. g. Complex I of respiratory chain. Maturation of <b>hydrogenases</b> is a complex process involving the activity of several proteins, some of which have been already partially characterized.

It is unknown whether the electrons are transferred from the Fe-S clusters to the protein kinase domain. The histidine protein kinase activates a response regulator.

Hydrogen is also regarded as a key component in future energy systems as it is a sustainable, clean, and transportable energy carrier. Some microorganisms can produce hydrogen during a reversible reduction of protons to dihydrogen, a reaction which is catalyzed by <b>hydrogenases</b> [1]. <b>Hydrogenases</b> belong to an iron – sulphur protein family, that contains active sites consisting of inorganic sulfide and iron atoms bound to the polypeptide chain. On the basis of their bimetallocenter composition <b>hydrogenases</b> are divided into three main groups, phylogenetically not related: [NiFe] <b>hydrogenases,</b> [Fe] only <b>hydrogenases</b> and ‘metal – free hydrogenases’ which were described in methanogenic Archaea only.

On the other hand, [Fe] only <b>hydrogenases,</b> being usually monomeric enzymes and restricted to Bacteria and a few eukaryotic species are far less described. These proteins, being omnipresent catalysts of many biological reactions, are especially abundant in Clostridia. The physiological function of Clostridial [Fe] only <b>hydrogenases</b> is to dispose under the form of hydrogen, of the excess of reducing power generated during the fermentation of carbohydrates.

Factors regulating the expression of these genes are emerging from recent studies. New ideas on the potential physiological and ecological roles of nitrogenases and <b>hydrogenases</b> are presented. There is {{a renewed interest in}} exploiting cyanobacteria in solar energy conversion programs to generate H 2 as a source of combustible energy. To enhance the rates of H 2 production, the emphasis perhaps needs not to be on more efficient <b>hydrogenases</b> and nitrogenases or on the transfer of foreign enzymes into cyanobacteria. A likely better strategy is to exploit the use of radiant solar energy by the photosynthetic electron transport system to enhance the rates of H 2 formation and so improve the chances of utilizing cyanobacteria as a source for the generation of clean energy...|$|R
