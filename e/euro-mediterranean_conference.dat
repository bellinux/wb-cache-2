Overall, the meeting provided {{a platform for}} scientists from different nations to discuss emerging ideas that focused on cell signaling in cancer; the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases; the identification and use of natural products as well as novel drug delivery approaches {{for the treatment of}} cancer, arthritis, diabetes, tuberculosis, fungal infection, etc.; and untapped or unconventional sources for natural products. This fourth in a row conference tried to bridge the gap not only between basic research and clinical applications, but also between developed nations and developing countries. With the continuing success of these past meetings, the fifth <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Conference</b> of Natural Products and Drug Discovery (BioNat-V) is slated to be in February 2017...|$|E

40|$|The {{conclusions}} of the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Conference</b> of November 2007, devoted {{for the first time}} exclusively to the issue of migration, show that at this level a con-sensus has emerged on the partners ’ mutual interest in facilitating legal migration, following temporary or cir-cular patterns. Proposals were in the air since a com-munication by the European Commission dated May 2007 was delivered to the European Parliament and the Council {{as well as to the}} Economic and Social Com-mittee and the Council of the Regions, and since the report by the Global Commission on International Mi-gration – GCIM (2005). The European Commission for-mulated two circular migration plans from the per-spective of opening up new ways for legal migration. It constructed its differentiation according to the prin...|$|E

The paper {{makes an}} {{overview}} {{on the current}} state of GIS-based inititatives to share Heritage information in Spain, pointing at {{some of the issues that}} explain why this field is still greatly under developed, with the exception of a few regions: fragmentation or arguable policies about data sharing. Contrastingly, demands for a wider access to Heritage data are increasing, and unofficial agents, both from the academic realm or just from the civil society, have begun to fulfill those demands with the development of different web based services. Some examples of these are also presented. The paper ends with some remarks on the current situation and perspectives on future developments. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|EMCEI 2017 - <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Conference</b> for Environmental IntegrationUnconventional {{natural gas}} {{extraction}} from tight shale reservoirs, or shale gas, has recently {{emerged as an}} attractive energy resource to face the rising worldwide demand. Over the past decade, advanced technologies of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) have allowed the economic viability of shale gas exploration from rather unattainable deposits. Apart from optimistic growth projections, shale gas production is also responsible for worrying environmental and social implications, which are related, among others, to elevated freshwater consumption and hazardous wastewater generation. Within this framework, the ability of zero-liquid discharge desalination to promote water reuse and/or water recycling is critical for shale gas industry. Hence, application of effective desalination processes is mandatory to treat the large amounts of polluting hypersaline wastewater, alleviating environmental and public health impacts and enhancing overall shale gas process sustainability. This work outlines the challenges and future directions for ZLD desalination of shale gas wastewater. This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement No. 640979...|$|E
40|$|The Barcelona Process {{represents}} the European Union's effort to define complex and coherent strategy towards {{the countries of}} the Mediterranean region. Mutual relations have been gradually developed from the 1960 s; nevertheless only particular initiatives were undertaken with the aim to deal with the specific aspects of the relations. With regard {{to the development of the}} European Communities and considering events on the international scene it was necessary to define more complex strategy that would comprise not only economic aspects but also political, security, social and cultural aspects. The introduction of the thesis addresses to defining and arrangement of the external relations of the European Communities/European Union. Then it deals with the development of mutual relations until 1995 according to every decade, in which there are mentioned and described initiatives and activities of EC/EU in the Mediterranean region as well as events on the international scene that had significant impact on the shaping of the agenda. Year 1995 represents a break-through because of the fact that during the first <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>Conference</b> of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, held in Barcelona on 27 - 28 November 1995, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership was created and we are talking about the starting point of the [...] ...|$|E
