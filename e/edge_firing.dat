Novitskiy, after several hours of wavering, organised a relief force of 3000 men and 10 cannons, and started a march towards the city centre. The column crossed Marszałkowska Street unopposed and reached Saxon Square. There it was met by a negligible unit of not more than 100 civilians armed with a single 6 pounder cannon, commanded by Captain of Artillery Jacek Drozdowski. The Polish unit opened fire from its cannon and started gradually retreating across the square towards the Brühl's Palace on its northern <b>edge,</b> <b>firing</b> all the way. At {{the same time}} the Russian commander did not issue any orders and his column simply stopped under fire. Although much inferior in numbers, training and equipment, Drozdowski's unit was not attacked by the Russian force, as Novitskiy lost control over his troops. The Russian soldiers broke ranks and entered the undefended Saxon Palace, where they seized the cellars full of alcohol. The Poles continued to shell them with artillery for almost three hours, without being attacked. When a company of the 10th Regiment returning from Powiśle appeared at Królewska Street, the Russians started a disorganised retreat towards Jerusalem Avenue, leaving Igelström to his fate.|$|E

In an effort to help the infantry fighting to take Omaha, some of the destroyers providing gunfire support closed near the shoreline, almost grounding themselves to fire on the Germans.

40|$|Charcoal {{records from}} lake sediments may show changes in fire {{frequency}} {{over thousands of}} years, but such records are ambiguous {{with regard to the}} actual locations of fires. Using a comparison of fire dates from an 1800 -year lake sediment record from the west coast of Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada) and dates of last fire from 38 sites in the same watershed using tree-ring and soil-charcoal C dates, we estimated the source area that contributes to charcoal peaks and determined the degree to which fires were biased to certain locations. Twenty-three charcoal peaks, likely corresponding with individual fire events, were objectively identified from the sediment record. Comparison of fire dates from charcoal peaks in the sediment record with fire dates from points near the lake suggests that the charcoal source area is within 500 m of the lake <b>edge.</b> <b>Fire</b> occurrence within this charcoal source area increased sharply at AD 1100 from ca. 50 to ca. 300 years between charcoal peaks, coeval with the first "Little Ice Age" cooling...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{boreal forest}} of northwestern Ontario clearcutting and fire {{are the most}} common edge-creating disturbances.

40|$|Abstract — Determination {{of flame}} or <b>fire</b> <b>edges</b> is {{increasing}} importance now-a-days {{due to the}} immense applications in fire and safety, laboratory research and in the power generation plants. A wide variety of flame or fire detectors are currently available in the market, but image based flame detection is getting of increased importance because of its easier and faster implementation and increased processing and analytical abilities. Research shows that the existing edge detection methods do not emphasize the continuity and clarity of the flame and fire images. In this proposed method, it identifies continuous and clear edges from the flame image, {{which can be used}} for various industrial and research purposes. This work uses Sobel edge detection method along with Gaussian window for the detection of flame and <b>fire</b> <b>edges...</b>|$|R
