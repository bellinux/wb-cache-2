40|$|Utilization of {{l-malic acid}} by yeast strain Hansenula anomala IGC 4380 {{is subject to}} glucose repression. Derepressed mutants were {{obtained}} with UV light by use of the nonmetabolizable glucose analog 2 -deoxyglucose as a selective agent. Three mutant strains degraded l-malic acid {{in the presence of}} up to 30 % (wt/vol) glucose and are of potential interest for the biological deacidification of grape must. The mutant strains, as compared with the parent strain, displayed inverse <b>diauxy</b> in glucose-malate medium, glucose being metabolized only after malate consumption had been completed...|$|E
40|$|The {{biodegradation}} {{patterns of}} {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH) mixtures were studied in systems with and without sediments. Naphthalene showed no change in its behaviour {{in the presence of}} any other PAH. In sediment-free systems, acenaphthene showed a diauxic pattern in the presence of naphthalene, but was unaffected with fluoranthene. <b>Diauxy</b> was not observed in the same mixture in sediment-containing systems. Sediment-free experiments with fluoranthene indicated it was the only PAH not degraded when present alone, and it was only degraded with naphthalene. In sediment-containing systems, fluoranthene degradation only occurred above a critical naphthalene concentration. Experiments using all three PAHs in both sediment-free and -containing systems showed results similar to those obtained using pairs. This work indicated that mixtures of PAHs do have different biodegradation patterns to single compounds. These patterns may be additive. Sediments act as a sink for PAHs, highlighting the concentration dependence of the patterns observed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMicrobial {{metabolism}} {{of plant}} polysaccharides {{is an important}} part of environmental carbon cycling, human nutrition, and industrial processes based on cellulosic bioconversion. Here we demonstrate a broadly applicable method to analyze how microbes catabolize plant polysaccharides that integrates carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) assays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and anaerobic growth screening. We apply this method to study how the bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans ferments plant biomass components including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans. These polysaccharides are fermented with variable efficiencies, and <b>diauxies</b> prioritize metabolism of preferred substrates. Strand-specific RNA-seq reveals how this bacterium responds to polysaccharides by up-regulating specific groups of CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize the constituent sugars. Fifty-six up-regulated CAZymes were purified, and their activities show most polysaccharides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family, but with divergent rates, specificities, and cellular localizations. CAZymes were then tested in combination to identify synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms. We discuss how these results advance our understanding of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass...|$|R
