Aiming at this phenomenon, this paper designs a robot that not only can avoid the various fittings on the line, but also can cross the tension tower of phase line to <b>jumper</b> <b>line.</b> According to the development status of the deicing robot at home and abroad, the specific environment of the transmission line, {{as well as the}} function of crossing obstacle and tension tower, the design specifications and structural scheme is presented. On the basis of the mechanical structure design, the motion characteristics of deicing robot is researched, and the virtual prototype of the robot is simulated based on ADAMS, and key research is the factors which affect the gravity center when the robot crosses obstacle and tower. With the analysis of factors mentioned, robot stability greatly improved...|$|E
40|$|An amine-based {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) and water vapor sorbent in pressure-swing regenerable beds has been {{developed}} by Hamilton Sundstrand and baselined for the Orion Atmosphere Revitalization System (ARS). In three previous years at this conference, reports were presented on extensive Johnson Space Center (JSC) testing of this technology. That testing was performed in a sea-level pressure environment with both simulated and real human metabolic loads, and in both open and closed-loop configurations. The Orion ARS is designed to also support space-suited operations in a depressurized cabin, so {{the next step in}} developmental testing at JSC was to test the ARS technology in a typical closed space suit-loop environment with low-pressure oxygen inside the process loop and vacuum outside the loop. This was the first instance of low-pressure, high-oxygen, closed-loop testing of the Orion ARS technology, and it was conducted with simulated human metabolic loads in March 2009. The test investigated pressure drops and flow balancing through two different styles of prototype suit umbilical connectors. General swing-bed performance was tested with both umbilical configurations, as well as with a short <b>jumper</b> <b>line</b> installed in place of the umbilicals. Other interesting results include observations on the thermal effects of swing-bed operation in a vacuum environment and a recommendation of cycle time to maintain acceptable suit atmospheric CO 2 and moisture levels...|$|E

40|$|An amine-based {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) and water vapor sorbent in pressure-swing regenerable beds has been {{developed}} by Hamilton Sundstrand and baselined for the Orion Atmosphere Revitalization System (ARS). In two previous years at this conference, reports were presented on extensive Johnson Space Center (JSC) testing of this technology in a sea-level pressure environment with simulated human metabolic loads. Another paper at this year s conference discusses similar testing with real human metabolic loads, including some closed-loop testing with emergency breathing masks. The Orion ARS is designed to also support extravehicular activity operations from a depressurized cabin. The next step in developmental testing at JSC was, therefore, to test this ARS technology in a typical closed space suit loop environment with low-pressure pure oxygen inside the process loop and vacuum outside the loop. This was the first instance of low-pressure oxygen loop testing of a new Orion ARS technology, and was conducted with simulated human metabolic loads in December 2008. The test investigated pressure drops through two different styles of prototype suit umbilical connectors and general swing-bed performance with both umbilical configurations {{as well as with}} a short <b>jumper</b> <b>line</b> installed in place of the umbilicals.

40|$|Jumper {{connectors}} {{are used}} in the Hanford site for remotely connecting <b>jumper</b> pipe <b>lines</b> in the radioactive zones. The jumper pipes are used for transporting radioactive fluids and hazardous chemicals. This report evaluates the adequacy and the integrity of the 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -in. single-port integral seal block (ISB) jumper connector assemblies, as well as the three-way 2 -in. configuration. The evaluation considers limiting forces from the piping to the nozzle. A stress evaluation of the jumper components (hook, hook pin, operating screw, nozzle and nozzle flange, and block) under operational (pressure, thermal, dead weight, and axial torquing of the jumper) and seismic loading is addressed in the report...|$|R

40|$|In today’s world, {{power saving}} is very {{important}} and difficult. Though there are many power generation methods, it has become very difficult due to insufficient resources. So, saving of power {{is the need for}} our society. This paper discusses about how power can be saved in street lights. The main objective is to control the street lights (dim during dawn and dusk time as well as bright during night time) using Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF). The engineer at Electricity Board (EB) can control the street lights of various areas. If any over load occurs, the connection will be disconnected and the information is transferred through Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) to EB. In case of any detachment of <b>jumper</b> (EB <b>line)</b> then also the information is sent. Also, if there is any complaint by the consumers, they can send the information to EB through Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Reader, which will be fixed in one of the street light posts and the tag is given to all consumers. The message will be sent to EB server through GSM...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{integrated}} circuits require multiple wiring layers. In complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing, these layers are robustly separated by amorphous dielectrics. These dielectrics would dominate energy loss in superconducting {{integrated circuits}}. Here we demonstrate {{a procedure that}} capitalizes on the structural benefits of inter-layer dielectrics during fabrication and mitigates the added loss. We separate and support multiple wiring layers throughout fabrication using SiO_ 2 scaffolding, then remove it post-fabrication. This technique is compatible with foundry level processing and the can be generalized to make many different forms of low-loss multi-layer wiring. We use this technique to create freestanding aluminum vacuum gap crossovers (airbridges). We characterize the added capacitive loss of these airbridges by connecting ground planes over microwave frequency λ/ 4 coplanar waveguide resonators and measuring resonator loss. We measure a low power resonator loss of ∼ 3. 9 × 10 ^- 8 per bridge, which is 100 times lower than dielectric supported bridges. We further characterize these airbridges as crossovers, control <b>line</b> <b>jumpers,</b> {{and as part of}} a coupling network in gmon and fuxmon qubits. We measure qubit characteristic lifetimes (T_ 1 's) in excess of 30 μs in gmon devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} {{study was to examine}} the effectiveness of two digital tools: a virtual number <b>line</b> (<b>Jumper</b> Tool); and a dynamic hundreds chart (Morphing Chart) in improving children’s understanding of multiplication and number sense. One hundred twenty-two third grade students (69 girls), ages ranging from 8 years- 0 months to 10 years- 3 months (M = 8. 88 years, SD = 0. 44) from three New York City public elementary schools, were recruited to participate in the study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two math treatment groups or a reading control group. Students in the Jumper group used a number line tool, while those in the Morphing group used a morphing hundreds chart. Children’s number sense ability and understanding of multiplication were tested at pre- and posttest to examine group differences. Researchers recorded children’s strategy use and a back-end logging system collected data on accuracy during treatment sessions. No group differences across the Jumper, Morphing, or Control groups were found at posttests when controlling for pretest performance. However, the presence of a tool (Jumper or Morphing) during treatment sessions resulted in better performance than the absence of a tool (No Tool). Strategy use had a significant effect on session performance as well. Fast and Tool Use responses performed better than Delayed responses. Additionally, Fast responses were more likely to be correct than those who used an Advanced strategy. Finally, the results indicated that Fast responses were predictive of children’s performance on multiplication facts and number sense tests and Tool use was predictive of performance on multiplication facts. These findings suggest that having a tool, Jumper or Morphing, helped children solve multiplication problems and that tool use is related to superior mastery of multiplication facts...|$|R
