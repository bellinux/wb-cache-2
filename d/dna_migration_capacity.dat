Our aim was to evaluate postoperative peritoneal inflammation and its impact on cultured colon cancer cells’ <b>migration</b> <b>capacity.</b> Methods. 23 patients undergoing elective colorectal resection with uneventful recovery were prospectively enrolled. Patients were operated on for both malignant and benign etiologies. Peritoneal fluids collected at surgery initiation and after surgery were evaluated for their effect on migration potential of human colon cancer cells using an in vitro scratch assay and on TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and IL- 10 levels using bead-based fluorokine-linked multianalyte profiling.

Here, we investigated the involvement of IP 3 R type 3 (IP 3 R 3) in the migration processes of three human breast cancer cell lines showing different migration velocities: the low-migrating MCF- 7 and the highly migrating and invasive MDA-MB- 231 and MDA-MB- 435 S cell lines. We show that a higher IP 3 R 3 expression level, but not IP 3 R 1 nor IP 3 R 2, is correlated to a stronger cell line <b>migration</b> <b>capacity</b> and a sustained calcium signal. Interestingly, silencing of IP 3 R 3 highlights an oscillating calcium signaling profile and leads to a significant decrease of cell <b>migration</b> <b>capacities</b> of the three breast cancer cell lines.

Considering the fact that resin monomers from dental restorative materials are released into the saliva and diffuse into the tooth pulp or gingiva, mucosa, and salivary glands, this may potentially contribute to tumorigenesis. Resin monomers may also be reabsorbed and reach the circulating blood as well. Whereas the cytotoxic potential of some components has been clearly documented, data on genotoxicity in human target cells require further investigation. In the present study, genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of three common methacrylates are investigated in human samples of salivary glands and peripheral lymphocytes. The Comet assay was used to quantify DNA single strand breaks, alkali labile and incomplete excision repair sites in salivary gland probes and lymphocytes of 10 volunteers.

Here, we demonstrate an approach to quantifying species vulnera-bilities to climate change for 419 rare vascular plants in Alberta, Canada, based on a multivariate velocity of cli-mate change metric, local habitat fragmentation, and <b>migration</b> <b>capacity.</b> Climate change velocities indicated that future migration requirements ranged from 1 to 5 km/ year in topographically complex landscapes, such as the Alberta Foothills and Rocky Mountains.
