The renovation was partially sponsored by the Deborah Heart and Lung Center, which donated seating & lounge areas, in part to encourage mall walking. To accommodate, there is a stretch of discolored tile {{around the perimeter of}} the mall with numbers <b>engraved</b> <b>marking</b> walking distance. Also, Starbucks and Auntie Annes open at 8:30 am (10:00 on Sundays) to cater to the mall walkers who arrive before the rest of the mall opens.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to monitoring the surface deformations during various types of laser processing, e. g., <b>engraving,</b> <b>marking,</b> cutting, bending, and welding. The measuring system {{is based on a}} laser triangulation principle, where the laser projector generates multiple lines simultaneously. This enables us to measure the shape of the surface with a high sampling rate (80 Hz with our camera) and high accuracy (± 7 µm). Full-field measurements of steel-plate deformations are presented for plates of different thickness and with different processing parameters.

While there, a fellow artist, Cornelis Le Mair, recommended he should move to Antwerp, where {{he went on to}} study graphic design at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts from 1968 to 1971. His teachers in Antwerp included the etcher René De Coninck, himself a pupil of Jules De Bruycker, as well as the <b>engraver</b> <b>Mark</b> Severin, who designed several Belgian postage stamps, and Jos Hendrickx.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{reports the}} {{development}} of a paste containing Fry´s reagent (a CuCl 2 solution in HCl) and bentonite {{that can be used to}} restore <b>engraved</b> <b>marks</b> on iron and steel surfaces. The efficiency as an etching reagent is similar than that reported for the liquid Fry’s solution. The ease of using this paste gives distinct advantages over the liquid reagent, such as avoiding acid solution spoilage during etching by technicians and police experts. The work is completed with a morphological study of the metallic surface after the procedure by electron microscopy. The surface is not altered by the applications of the reagent. This paste is currently used by police staff in Uruguay...|$|R

50|$|The main or {{front surface}} of a medal is termed the obverse, and may contain a portrait, {{pictorial}} scene, or other image along with an inscription. The reverse, or back surface of the medal, is not always used and may be left blank or may contain a secondary design. It {{is not uncommon to}} find only an artistic rendering on the obverse, while all details and other information for the medal are inscribed on the reverse. The rim is found only occasionally employed to display an inscription such as a motto, privy <b>mark,</b> <b>engraver</b> symbol, assayer’s <b>marking,</b> or a series number.|$|R

50|$|The Bad Taste of the Town (also {{known as}} Masquerades and Operas) {{is an early}} print by William Hogarth, {{published}} in February 1723/24. The small print - 5 in by 6 in - mocks the contemporary fashion for foreign culture, including Palladian architecture, pantomimes based on the Italian commedia dell'arte, masquerades (masked balls), and Italian opera. The work combines two printmaking techniques - etching and engraving - with etched lines made in the plate using acid and <b>engraved</b> lines <b>marked</b> using a burin.|$|R
5000|$|As {{commonly}} used in the collectibles and antiques industry, the term refers to the mark impressed on a blown glass item over this scar, since many notable glassblowers have impressed or <b>engraved</b> makers <b>marks</b> in the punt scars of their work. [...] In the case of mold-blown work, where no pontil is used during manufacture, the term has also come to apply to marks impressed {{in the base of}} the work where the pontil scar would have been had it been free blown.|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} increased scholarly {{interest in}} pseudo script {{has opened a}} somewhat new avenue within traditional Egyptological studies, offering a deeper insight into marking systems which traditionally are not included {{within the boundaries of}} established written languages and/or iconographical representation. Thus, in addition to studying the rich and well preserved demotic and Greek inscriptions on site, the Gebel el Silsila Epigraphic Survey Project 2012 will also document, categorise and analyse <b>engraved</b> <b>marks</b> – ‘quarry marks’ – in the ancient Egyptian quarry for the purpose of identifying who was responsible for making these stone cuttings and why. This paper will use the theme of the conference and cross the boundaries of previous academic generalisation – the identification of quarry marks with masons’ marks, stone cutters’ marks or identity marks as a whole. By exploring the quarry marks in detail within their textual context and by comparing the individual marks with contemporary signs found on other media, other options will be explored as well, including a more religious/superstitious significance that is emphasised in the late Ptolemaic and early Roman period during which they were created. This paper will present a general overview of the mission’s epigraphic survey 2012 and results achieved so far...|$|R

50|$|Long before Lincoln Park was {{incorporated}} as a city, an area along the Ecorse River {{was the site}} of a pivotal meeting during Pontiac's Rebellion. On April 27, 1763, a council of several American Indian tribes from the Detroit region listened to a speech from the Ottawa leader Pontiac. Pontiac urged the listeners to join him in a surprise attack on the British Fort Detroit, which they attempted on May 9. Today, the area is known as Council Point Park, and a small <b>engraved</b> boulder <b>marks</b> the site of the historic meeting.|$|R
50|$|Laser engraving, {{which is}} a subset of laser marking, is the {{practice}} of using lasers to engrave an object. Laser marking, on the other hand, is a broader category of methods to leave marks on an object, which also includes color change due to chemical/molecular alteration, charring, foaming, melting, ablation, and more. The technique does not involve the use of inks, nor does it involve tool bits which contact the engraving surface and wear out, giving it an advantage over alternative <b>engraving</b> or <b>marking</b> technologies where inks or bit heads {{have to be replaced}} regularly.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the subject of Simone de Beauvoir and how she creates her view of motherhood. With help from Toril Moi’s method – which she calls {{personal}} genealogy – as a standpoint I have read Beauvoir’s autobiography Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter with and against her essay about women, The Second Sex. The genealogy tries to understand the term ‘making’ and the idea of production or construction and the personal genealogy sees the subject – the person – as an extraordinarily complex effect of a whole network of different discourses or determinants. In {{order to be able to}} understand Beauvoir’s view on motherhood I have read her philosophy with and against the feminist philosopher Ulla M. Holm’s and the radical feminist Adrienne Richs’ theories about mothering and the institution of motherhood. In Beauvoir’s other works I have also found keys to the patriarchal motherhood she writes about in The Second Sex. A motherhood she in her individual life dissociates herself from, and through which she creates her own self, when she ten years after The second Sex publishes the first volume in her autobiography. With help from Julia Kristeva’s theory about the abject my study also shows that the ”motherhood as slavery” that she runs away from has made <b>engraving</b> <b>marks</b> in her own body...|$|R

Carrying a coin bearing the date of your birth is lucky. In Austria any coin found during a rainstorm is especially lucky, because it is said to have dropped from Heaven. European charms often require silver coins to be used, which are <b>engraved</b> with <b>marks</b> such as an [...] "X" [...] or are bent.
