5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic mechanics of their body that normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside down but with their necks twisted 180 degrees to <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork.

5|$|By December 1409 Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas {{had agreed}} on a common strategy: Their armies would unite into a single massive force and march {{together}} towards Marienburg (Malbork), capital of the Teutonic Knights. The Knights, who took a defensive position, did not expect a joint attack and were preparing for a dual invasion—by the Poles along the Vistula River towards Danzig (Gdańsk) and the Lithuanians along the Neman River towards Ragnit (Neman). To counter this perceived threat, Ulrich von Jungingen concentrated his forces in Schwetz (Świecie), a central location from where troops could respond to an invasion from any direction rather quickly. Sizable garrisons were left in the eastern castles of Ragnit, Rhein (Ryn) near Lötzen (Giżycko), and Memel (Klaipėda). To <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> plans secret and mislead the knights, Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas organised several raids into border territories, thus forcing the knights to <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> troops in place.|$|E
5|$|Each police {{district}} {{is led by}} a chief of police and is subdivided into several police stations in towns and cities, and sheriffs' offices for rural areas.

The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority is partially integrated with the police.|$|E
5|$|In the Grisons, the {{situation}} also reverted to pre-war conditions. The Habsburgs could <b>keep</b> <b>their</b> rights over {{eight of the}} communes of the Zehngerichtebund, but also had to accept that league's alliance with the two other leagues and with the Swiss Confederacy.
