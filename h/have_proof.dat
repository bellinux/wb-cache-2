5|$|On 29 January, General Nguyễn Khánh ousted Minh's MRC in a bloodless pre-dawn coup; {{although}} Khánh {{accused the}} junta of intending {{to make a}} deal with the communists and claimed to <b>have</b> <b>proof,</b> he was actually motivated by personal ambition. After Khánh was deposed a year later, he admitted that the allegations against Minh's group were false. In later years, Khánh, Thơ and Minh's generals all agreed that the coup was strongly encouraged by the Americans and could not have occurred without their backing.|$|E

25|$|With the {{archbishop}} absent, Sverre tightened {{his grip on}} the bishops, and on Nikolas Arnesson in particular. Nikolas was the half-brother of Inge Krokrygg and had become bishop of Oslo in 1190 against Sverre's wish. After the destruction of the Øyskjeggs at Florvåg, Sverre arranged a meeting with Nikolas where he claimed to <b>have</b> <b>proof</b> that the bishop had colluded with the Øyskjeggs. The king accused Nikolas of treason and threatened severe punishment. Nikolas submitted, and on 29 June, together with the other bishops, he crowned Sverre as King of Norway. Sverre's domestic priest was elected bishop of Bergen.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, reports {{surfaced}} that Italian {{authorities were}} investigating claims that several major Brunello producers were adulterating their wines by using foreign or domestic grape varieties {{in violation of}} the DOCG regulations, which stipulate that only Sangiovese may be used to make Brunello. The prosecutor handling the investigation said he would bring commercial fraud charges that could result in imprisonment for the violators. The producers in question were suspected of adding wine made from non-approved grapes {{in order to make it}} more appealing to the international market. In response the U.S. government blocked imports of Brunello that did not <b>have</b> <b>proof</b> that they were in fact 100% Sangiovese. The scandal was coined Brunellopoli by the Italian wine press.|$|E
25|$|Most of the contemporaries' {{critics to}} the Ordinary reprimanded him {{not for his}} office or for being {{insensitive}} or too rigorous and persistent in obtaining confessions, but for slackness and negligence and for being too lax. 19th and 20th century commentators characterised him as morally lax, drunken and dissolute, an incompetent minister, weak and ineffectual, unable to exert any control over the condemned. Victorian and Edwardian writers conflate the Ordinary and his Accounts with the corruption and depravity of 18th century Church. We <b>have</b> <b>proof</b> of the corruption of some Ordinaries as well: Samuel Smith and John Allen were discharged by the Court of Aldermen for undue practices, such as fabricating false confessions and dying speeches, pocketing charitable donations and money sent to the condemned, soliciting bribes under the pretext of obtaining reprieves for the criminals.|$|E

25|$|Authorities {{claimed that}} the assassin had been a teenage boy from South Waziristan. They claimed to <b>have</b> <b>proof</b> that the attack had been masterminded by Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency concurred that this was probable; Mehsud {{believed}} that Bhutto's pro-American and secularist agenda would undermine the Pakistani Taliban's control of South Waziristan and hinder the growth of Sunni Islamist radicalism. Mehsud denied the accusation, with al-Qaeda spokesman Mustafa Abu al-Yazid instead claiming that his organisation had carried out the killing {{on the order of}} its second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahiri. The PPP accused the government of a cover-up, with several PPP figures claiming that Bhutto had been killed by a sniper linked to the intelligence agencies. Within Pakistan there was also public speculation that the attack might have been masterminded by India, or the United States. Musharraf agreed to invite Britain's Scotland Yard to investigate the assassination. Requests for the body to be exhumed for an autopsy were rejected by Zardari.|$|E
500|$|Kubicek {{characterized}} {{the fact that}} Sebastian was not arrested for injuring Blaine as [...] "an absurd plot twist". He criticized Kurt for withholding the evidence and wrote, [...] "Santana's plan isn't vicious or mean, it's getting justice. Sebastian committed a crime and he should pay for it." [...] Slezak thought the {{decision as to whether}} the police would be given Santana's evidence should have been Blaine's to make, and Lynch posited that [...] "a talk with the police" [...] might teach Sebastian [...] "that violent actions have legal consequences". Chaney was incredulous at Will's statements to the glee club on the matter, especially, [...] "Unless you <b>have</b> <b>proof</b> that he tampered with the slushie, the police aren’t getting involved." [...] Kubicek called Artie's anger that led to [...] "Scream" [...] a story arc that [...] "goes nowhere and was just a poorly written excuse to do that song", but Votta was impressed that [...] "we learn more about Artie's frustration in this fantasy scene than we have in 3 seasons". Canning wrote that [...] "as extraneous as the extended [...] "Scream" [...] segment was, the build up to that moment was perfect".|$|E
500|$|Voorhis's {{supposed}} {{involvement with}} and endorsement by the CIO's P.A.C., which {{was believed to}} be a Communist front organization, was a major issue in the campaign. Nixon's campaign manager claimed to <b>have</b> <b>proof</b> of Voorhis's involvement with the group. On September 13, the two candidates met at a debate at South Pasadena Junior High School. When Nixon was challenged to produce proof of the allegation, Nixon took from his pocket a local bulletin of the National Citizens Political Action Committee that contained an endorsement of Voorhis. This was a different group, also affiliated with the CIO. While Voorhis's staff was aware of this endorsement, no one had told the representative. Voorhis, confronted with the bulletin, noted that these were two different groups. Nixon responded by reading the names of the boards of directors of the two groups, with many names in common. After the debate, Voorhis asked Congressman Chester E. Holifield for his view of how it had gone, and Holifield responded, [...] "Jerry, he cut you to pieces." [...] Voorhis had been successfully linked with [...] "the PAC", though he had refused to accept the endorsement of any PAC unless it renounced Communist influence. Nixon defeated Voorhis by over 15,000 votes and Time magazine praised the future president for [...] "politely avoid personal attacks on his opponent".|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, he {{announced}} plans to introduce Anti-Social Behaviour Orders, although {{not in the same}} form as those in Britain. McDowell's Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 prohibited cut-price drinks promotions and placed restrictions on alcohol advertising, as well as making it mandatory for under-21s to <b>have</b> <b>proof</b> of age when drinking in pubs. This law also banned under-18s from pubs after 9pm, a regulation that was highly unpopular and was later relaxed to 10pm during the summer months. In 2005, McDowell proposed to grant licences for café-bars which would have a limited capacity and serve meals as well as alcohol. It was hoped that this would combat binge drinking by introducing a more European [...] "café culture". This initiative was dropped owing to objections from publicans and members of his coalition partners, Fianna Fáil.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the sheets}} had been sent, Melville changed the title.

After expressing his hope that Bentley would receive this change in time, Allan said that [...] "Moby-Dick is a legitimate title for the book, being the name given to a particular whale who if I may so express myself is the hero of the volume". Biographer Hershel Parker suggests that the reason for the change was that Harper's had two years earlier published a book with a similar title, The Whale and His Captors.|$|E

[...] Humala went on to cite similar claims of voting fraud {{in the first round}} made by right-wing National Unity candidate Lourdes Flores when she told reporters that she felt she had [...] "lost at the tabulation tables, not at the ballot box". When asked if he had proof for his claims by CPN Radio Humala stated [...] "I do not <b>have</b> <b>proof.</b> If I had the proof, I would immediately denounce those responsible to the electoral system".

2500|$|General Abernathy {{appears in}} , voiced by Lee Majors. In this series, General Abernathy is {{depicted}} as a bald man with an eye patch. General Abernathy is a full general in the US Military, who doesn't trust Cobra Industries.

When Duke claims they were set up, General Abernathy tells them to turn themselves in, because unless they <b>have</b> <b>proof</b> of their innocence, he can't help them.

In [...] "Revelations" [...] Pt. 2, General Abernathy is with the Falcons, when the Joes and Professor Patrick O'Hara turn themselves in, with the proof that General Abernathy wanted.
