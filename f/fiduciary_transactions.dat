Nowadays, {{under the influence of}} the globalizing processes „trust-like devices ” are appearing in many civil law jurisdictions or are under active consideration in the economic spheres of some countries. The given paper deals with the comparative analysis of the Swiss and French “fiducie”-s (contemporary trust-like mechanisms of Switzerland and France) via putting emphasis on the major similarities and differences of these institutions. The Swiss <b>fiduciary</b> <b>transactions</b> developed in 1893 in response to the practical necessity. Initially, these transactions aimed at the transference of ownership as security for a debt. However, in 1905 they were arranged for fiduciary management. Nowadays, the Swiss “fiducie ” considers the transference of assets by a natural or a legal person to the fiduciary (another natural or legal person), who performs management tasks for the purpose of serving the creator’s or beneficiary’s interests. The Swiss law differentiates several forms of “fiducie ” (“fiducie-gestion”, “fiducie-libéralité ” and “fiducie-sûreté”), which have conceptual counterparts (“coincidences”) in the French legal system. Characterization of terminological and semantic “coincidences”, their separation and precise description – this is the major task of the given paper and one of the urgent questions of the contemporary legal studies...|$|E
40|$|Saistību dzēšanas procedūra ir jauns institūts fiziskās personas maksātnespējas procesā, kas stājās spēkā 2010. gada 1. novembrī. Darbā tiek analizēta jaunā Maksātnespējas likuma saistību dzēšanas procedūra no praktiskās puses, autorei norādot konkrētus uzlabojumus, kādi būtu veicami tiesību aktos. Autore ir minimāli analizējusi ārvalstu pieredzi, jo uzskata, ka ne katra ārvalstu pieredze būtu pārņemama un tā ne vienmēr integrējas Latvijas tiesību sistēmā. Autores ieskatā esošais regulējums Maksātnespējas likumā ir optimāls, bet uzlabojams. Tā kā šāds tiesību institūts Latvijā ir spēkā tikai dažus mēnešus, tad praksē vēl neviena persona Latvijā nav pilnībā ar to saskārusies. Tādēļ šis darbs un tajā paustās atziņas lielā mērā ir jauninājums, kas ir maz aplūkots juridiskajā literatūrā. The new Latvian Insolvency Law, which {{entered into}} force on November 1, 2010, {{provides}} for {{significant changes in}} natural person's insolvency process solutions. The liabilities' cancellation is a new procedure in the natural person's insolvency process, and its aim is both to shorten the natural person's insolvency process and provide the fullest possible satisfaction of creditors' demands. The paper analyzes the liabilities' cancellation procedure in the new Insolvency Law from the practical side, assesses the restrictions for applying of the liabilities' cancellation and evaluates the preferential arrangements for cancellation of liabilities {{laid out in the}} Insolvency Law in view of their compatibility with the principles of equality established by the Latvian Constitution. The paper also analyzes the concept of debtor's property, looks into the concept of debtor's property resulting from <b>fiduciary</b> <b>transactions,</b> evaluates the judicial practice in calculating administrative expenses and challenging marital contracts. The author suggests particular improvements that should be made in the legislation to amend the insolvency process. Since the Law on liabilities' cancellation procedure is in force in Latvia only for a few months, no one in Latvia has yet fully experienced the topic described in the paper: liabilities' cancellation procedure in the natural person's insolvency process. Therefore, this paper and its conclusions to a large extent is a new contribution to a topic that is underrepresented in the legal literature of cases where the debtor is unable to pay his/her debts...|$|E
40|$|Why, {{when and}} how should control {{transactions}} be policed ex post and by a judiciary? This article {{is the first to}} 1) articulate the doctrinal prerequisites for effective ex post judicial policing of <b>fiduciaries</b> in control <b>transactions,</b> and 2) theoretically unify two seemingly distinct approaches to police control transactions: the ex post judicial policing in the United States and the ex ante policing by the Takeover Panel in the United Kingdom. Shareholder collective action and asymmetric information problems, and the extent of gatekeeping by fiduciaries together determine the mode of third-party interventions, such as those by judiciaries and the Takeover Panel, in control transactions. The Article’s analysis yields normative conclusions about how judiciaries in the United States, including Delaware’s, should fine-tune gatekeeping by corporate <b>fiduciaries</b> in control <b>transactions.</b> It predicts that multijurisdictional shareholder litigation that seeks anticipatory adjudication will produce negative consequences. Further, it gives policy makers outside of the United States the theoretical foundation for crafting third-party interventions in both types of control transactions, i. e., third-party acquisitions of control and controller freeze-outs, that are optimal for their own jurisdictions...|$|R
2500|$|The {{corporate}} opportunity doctrine {{does not}} apply to all fiduciaries of a corporation; rather, it is limited to directors, officers, and controlling shareholders. [...] The doctrine applies regardless of whether the corporation is harmed by the transaction; indeed, it applies even if the corporation benefits from the transaction. [...] The corporate opportunity doctrine only applies if the opportunity was not disclosed to the corporation. [...] If the opportunity was disclosed {{to the board of directors}} and the board declined to take the opportunity for the corporation, the fiduciary may take the opportunity for him- or herself.
