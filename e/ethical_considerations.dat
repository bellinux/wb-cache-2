5|$|Governments {{such as the}} Netherlands and New Zealand {{have responded}} to the public's {{concerns}} by outlawing invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the great apes. In 2015, captive chimpanzees in the U.S. were added to the Endangered Species Act adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them. Similarly, citing <b>ethical</b> <b>considerations</b> and the availability of alternative research methods, the U.S. NIH announced in 2013 that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out experiments on chimpanzees.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, Swiss {{authorities}} {{considered the}} construction of a Swiss nuclear bomb. Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology ZÃ¼rich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic possibility. In 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies. Financial problems with the defence budget and <b>ethical</b> <b>considerations</b> prevented the substantial funds from being allocated, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. All remaining plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by 1988.|$|E
5|$|Since the Bronze Age of Comics, the Joker {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as an archetypal trickster, displaying talents for cunning intelligence, social engineering, pranks, theatricality, and idiomatic humor. Like the trickster, the Joker alternates between malicious violence and clever, harmless whimsy. He is amoral and not driven by <b>ethical</b> <b>considerations,</b> but by a shameless and insatiable nature, and although his actions are condemned as evil, he is necessary for cultural robustness. The trickster employs amoral and immoral acts to destabilize {{the status quo and}} reveal cultural, political, and ethical hypocrisies that society attempts to ignore. However, the Joker differs in that his actions typically only benefit himself. The Joker possesses abnormal body imagery, reflecting an inversion of order. The trickster is simultaneously subhuman and superhuman, a being that indicates a lack of unity in body and mind. In Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker serves as Batman's trickster guide through the hero's own psyche, testing him in various ways before ultimately offering to cede his rule of the Asylum to Batman.|$|E

25|$|Coupled with Russell's other doctrines, this {{influenced}} the logical positivists, who formulated {{the theory of}} emotivism or non-cognitivism, which states that ethical propositions (along with those of metaphysics) were essentially meaningless and nonsensical or, at best, little more than expressions of attitudes and preferences. Notwithstanding his influence on them, Russell himself did not construe ethical propositions as narrowly as the positivists, for he believed that <b>ethical</b> <b>considerations</b> are not only meaningful, but {{that they are a}} vital subject matter for civil discourse. Indeed, though Russell was often characterised as the patron saint of rationality, he agreed with Hume, who said that reason ought to be subordinate to <b>ethical</b> <b>considerations.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} never entirely abandoned halakhic (traditional jurisprudence) argumentation, both due to {{the need}} for precedent to counter external accusations and the continuity of heritage, but had largely made <b>ethical</b> <b>considerations</b> or the spirit of the age the decisive factor in determining its course. The German founding fathers undermined the principles behind the legalistic process, which was based on a belief in an unbroken tradition through the ages merely elaborated and applied to novel circumstances rather than subject to change. Rabbi Samuel Holdheim advocated a particularly radical stance, arguing that the halakhic Law of the Land is Law principle must be universally applied and subject virtually everything to current norms and needs, far beyond its weight in conventional Jewish Law.|$|E

25|$|The Church {{has a role}} in {{discussing}} the {{issues related to the}} social order. Social and economic issues are vital to her not from a technical point of view but in terms of moral and ethical issues involved. <b>Ethical</b> <b>considerations</b> include the nature of private property. Within the Catholic Church several conflicting views had developed. Pope Pius XI declares private property essential for the development and freedom of the individual. Those who deny private property, deny personal freedom and development. But, said Pius, private property has a social function as well. Private property loses its morality, if it is not subordinated to the common good. Therefore, governments have a right to redistribution policies. In extreme cases, the Pope grants the State a right of expropriation of private property.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} no approved treatments using embryonic stem cells. The first human trial {{was approved by}} the US Food and Drug Administration in January 2009. However, the human trial was not initiated until October 13, 2010 in Atlanta for spinal cord injury research. On November 14, 2011 the company conducting the trial (Geron Corporation) announced that it will discontinue further development of its stem cell programs. ES cells, being pluripotent cells, require specific signals for correct differentiationâif injected directly into another body, ES cells will differentiate into many different types of cells, causing a teratoma. Differentiating ES cells into usable cells while avoiding transplant rejection {{are just a few of}} the hurdles that embryonic stem cell researchers still face. Due to <b>ethical</b> <b>considerations,</b> many nations currently have moratoria or limitations on either human ES cell research or the production of new human ES cell lines. Because of their combined abilities of unlimited expansion and pluripotency, embryonic stem cells remain a theoretically potential source for regenerative medicine and tissue replacement after injury or disease.|$|E
500|$|Historian John Toland relates a {{story by}} GÃ¼nter Syrup, a {{subordinate}} of Heydrich. Heydrich showed him a picture of Himmler and said, [...] "The top half is the teacher but the lower half is the sadist." [...] Historian Adrian Weale comments that Himmler and the SS followed Hitler's policies, without question or <b>ethical</b> <b>considerations.</b> Himmler accepted Hitler and Nazi ideology, and saw the SS as a chivalric Teutonic order of new Germans. Himmler adopted the doctrine of Auftragstaktik ("mission command"), whereby orders were given as broad directives, with authority delegated downward to the appropriate level to carry them out in a timely and efficient manner. Weale states that the SS ideology gave the men a doctrinal framework, and the mission command tactics allowed the junior officers leeway to act on their own initiative to obtain the desired results.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} theodicy was {{expanded}} mainly {{with the thought}} of Weber and his addition of <b>ethical</b> <b>considerations</b> to the subject of religion. There is this ethical part of religion, including [...] "(1) soteriology and (2) theodicy. These mean, respectively, how people understand themselves {{to be able to be}} in a correct relationship with supernatural powers, and how to explain evil â or why bad things seem to happen to those who seem to be good people". There is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class. [...] "Theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil.... In contrast, theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved." [...] Weber also writes that [...] "the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies, which emphasise that prosperity is a blessing of God... theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next." [...] Thus these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion.|$|E
