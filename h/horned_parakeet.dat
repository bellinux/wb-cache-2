500|$|A green rosella {{specimen}} {{was collected}} in Adventure Bay, Tasmania, by ships' surgeon William Anderson {{on the third}} voyage of James Cook between 26 and 30 January 1777. Cook wrote of seeing [...] "yellowish paroquets" [...] in the woods there. Tasked as the expedition's naturalist, Anderson collected many bird specimens but died of tuberculosis in 1778 before the return home. Many collection localities were incorrect, and notes were lost or pieced together many years later. The specimen, along with many others, {{ended up in the}} collection of British naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. English naturalist John Latham saw it there and wrote about the green rosella in his 1780s work A General Synopsis of Birds. He called it the Caledonian parrot as he assumed (incorrectly) it came from New Caledonia. He even suspected it might be the female of the <b>horned</b> <b>parakeet,</b> which he also saw in Banks' collection. Latham did not give them binomial names, however. It was left to German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin to describe the species, which he did as Psittacus caledonicus in the 13th edition of Systema Naturae in 1788.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, through DNA studies, it was {{discovered}} that Eunymphicus cornutus, the <b>horned</b> <b>parakeet,</b> and Eunymphicus uvaeensis (formerly Eunymphicus cornutus uvaeensis), the Uvea or Ouvea parakeet, were actually separate species. The genus now contains 2 species: E. cornutus and E. uvaeensis.|$|E
50|$|Horned parakeets will nest {{either on}} or near the ground, and also in hollowed-out logs, or nest hollows in dead trees. Uncommon among parrots, <b>horned</b> <b>parakeets</b> have been {{reported}} nest-sharing. The number of eggs laid is usually 2-4. Incubation lasts 21-22 days (in captivity) and the time from hatching to fledging is approximately 5 to 6 weeks (again, in captivity).|$|R
2500|$|Since 1995, the zoo {{has been}} a part of the red wolf Species Survival Plan and {{reintroduction}} program. [...] The zoo has been home to 48 of these critically endangered animals, including a litter of 5, born at the zoo in 2002, which became the first captive-bred wolves to be adopted by wild parents. [...] The zoo is also involved in the gorilla Species Survival Plan and received two female gorillas in early 2010 as part of the effort. As a result of their successful breeding, two male gorillas (Bomassa and Apollo) were born in August 2012. The Aviary is also known for a number of high-profile hatchings, including the first US hatchings of the golden white-eye, the red-faced liocichla, the African pied barbet, the golden-headed manakin, the <b>horned</b> puffin, the <b>parakeet</b> auklet and the thick-billed murre as well as the second US hatchings of the African grey-headed kingfisher and the African spoonbill.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Eunymphicus cornutus) is {{a species}} of parrot in the genus Eunymphicus, in the family Psittaculidae. Eunymphicus cornutus is a {{medium-sized}} parrot endemic to New Caledonia. It is called [...] "horned" [...] because it has two black feathers that protrude from the head and have red tips.|$|E
50|$|The Ouvea parakeet (Eunymphicus uvaeensis) or Uvea parakeet, is {{a species}} of parrot in the genus Eunymphicus, in the family Psittaculidae. It is endemic to the island of Uvea in the Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia. The species was once {{considered}} conspecific with the <b>horned</b> <b>parakeet</b> of Grande Terre, but they have now been split into two species.|$|E
50|$|Adult birds usually measure {{approximately}} 32 cm (or about 14 inches) in length, {{including the}} tail. Like many parrots, the <b>horned</b> <b>parakeet</b> is primarily green in color. This parrot has a yellowish nape {{with a black}} and red face and bluish wings and tail. Its most striking feature is a two-feather black crest, with the crest feathers tipped in red.|$|E
50|$|The Ouvea parakeet is a {{medium-sized}} parakeet with mostly green plumage and a prominent green crest. The crest {{is composed of}} six backward feathers that curl forwards. The underside of the bird tends to be yellower and there is bright blue on the wings and tail. The face is dark and the beak is black, lacking the yellow {{on the face of}} the <b>horned</b> <b>parakeet.</b>|$|E
50|$|Main {{threats to}} the <b>horned</b> <b>parakeet</b> are the black rat, the wildcat, the {{introduced}} Rusa deer, logging, La Nina (wet) years, and Psittacine beak and feather disease, a severe virus which is known to affect ~42 species of parrots. Humans poaching the birds for local trade is rare, because the birds' nests are difficult to find, and more importantly, there are no ingrained local customs regarding keeping birds as pets.|$|E
50|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>parakeet</b> {{is listed}} by the IUCN as Vulnerable, {{due to their}} {{restricted}} range and small, declining population size. These parrots are listed as CITES I as of year 2000, meaning all international commerce regarding the species is prohibited. In 2014, the European Union listed the species as Annex A, which means all intra-EU trade is prohibited. The parrots are also fully protected under New Caledonian law.|$|E

50|$|Reasons for {{the species}} rarity are unknown. There {{seems to have}} been a marked decline in the numbers of two of the other three parrots native to New Caledonia (the New Caledonian red-crowned parakeet and the <b>horned</b> <b>parakeet.</b> Deplanches lorikeet is still common), also for unknown reasons. New Caledonian bird populations decline {{wherever}} habitat is modified, which supports the hypotheses that human interference impacts the birds in a serious way. However, C. diademas post-1880 decline - if real - took place too early for habitat destruction to have been a decisive factor. Neither could capture for the cage bird trade have influenced the decline. Introduced cats or rats could have been responsible for the decline, or an introduced disease, or a combination of these factors and subtle habitat changes. For example, the large-scale destruction of lowland forest may have deprived the species of a food source they seasonally depended on. The introduction of cats and European rats in the mid-19th century fits the assumed pattern of decline; however, cats probably didnt spread over the whole island until recent times. Rats, especially black rats, which are arboreal, probably represent a serious threat, but the species did not succumb to the prehistoric arrival of the Polynesian rat. For whatever reason, the New Caledonian lorikeet is an extremely rare and elusive bird. The rarity could be caused in part by the elusiveness. Its relative, the red-throated lorikeet, feared extinct since the beginning of the 20th century, apparently survived in considerable numbers to the 1970s. However, it is more likely C. diadema is genuinely rare. Based on distance between sightings and remaining prime habitat, any remaining populations are probably small and geographically fragmented.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{revise the}} {{taxonomy}} {{of the two}} parakeet taxa in the psittaciform genus Eunymphicus – E. cornutus cornutus (<b>Horned</b> <b>Parakeet)</b> and E. c. uvaeensis (Ouvéa Parakeet) – which are restricted to New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands, in the south-western Pacific, and we investigate {{their relationship with the}} genera Cyanoramphus, considered traditionally as its closest related genus, and Prosopeia. We used three sets of characters to assess the level of differentiation between the Eunymphicus taxa: behaviour (vocalisations), morphology (biometrics and plumage coloration) and genetic (mitochondrial cytochrome b DNA sequence variation, 924 nucleotides). The analysis of vocalisations revealed significant differences, as did morphological analyses (size and number of feathers of the crest, size of the bill, and colour pattern of the head). Genetic distance between the Horned and Ouvéa Parakeets is similar to that recorded between closely related species of Cyanoramphus and both taxa possess novel and diagnostic synapomorphic substitutions. From these genetic, behavioural and morphological data, the two Eunymphicus taxa should be considered separate species, a suggestion that is supported by ecological data as well as anecdotal data on hybridisation from captive birds. Our molecular data also support the traditional view that Cyanoramphus is the closest relative of Eunymphicus, with Prosopeia a sister group to this clade. The consistency with which Platycercus clusters next to the Cyanoramphus–Eunymphicus–Prosopeia grouping suggests that Platycercus may well be the next closest relative of this clade...|$|E
