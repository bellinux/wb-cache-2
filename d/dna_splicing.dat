Nick journeys into the underworld and makes {{a deal with the}} [...] "devil", also known as Quin. As the story progresses, the reader takes on the second person perspective of Nicola and is introduced to a meerkat whom Nicola names Salvador. Salvador (an assassin meerkat sent by Quin) attacks Nicola but she incapacitates him. Nick arrives at Nicola's door and chokes her till she is near death and sent to an organ bank in the underworld. Shadrach comes into play in the third person point of view and takes the initiative of finding his lost love Nicola in the underworld. He finds Salvador injured at Nicola's apartment and cuts off the meerkat's head and attaches it to a plate and renames him John the Baptist. After, with the help of Dr. Fergusen, he finds a partially mutilated Nicola in an organ bank under a pile of miscellaneous body parts guarded by a naked troll. He carries Nicola through the underground tunnels back to his childhood home and finds a creation of Quin named Candle. Candle leads Nick to the Psyche witch named Rafter. After Rafter decides to try to salvage Nicola, Shadrach takes the action of venturing deeper into the underworld to kill Quin. He finds Nick, now transformed into a piece of living art, being attacked by some in the garbage re-cycling facility. Nick takes Shadrach lower and tells him how to get to Quin by jumping off a moving train with a parachute. Nick pushes Shadrach out of the train only to be shot by Shadrach as he falls. Shadrach manages to open his chute yet he hits the ground hard. Later, he wakes by a beach and an ocean and kicks over a skull where he finds another creation of Quin's called the Gollux. The Gollux tells him the truth while John the Baptist lies, the Gollux leads Shadrach to a ray-like creature named the saylber which Shadrach rides across the ocean and into Quin's world which is actually a very large minnow named the leviathan. He kills Quin and the remote and the whole place explodes. Shadrach climbs up the cliffs back to the subway level.

40|$|Abstract Background Splicing of DNA {{molecules}} is {{an important}} task in molecular biology that facilitates cloning, mutagenesis and creation of chimeric genes. Mutagenesis and <b>DNA</b> <b>splicing</b> techniques exist, some requiring restriction enzymes, and others utilize staggered reannealing approaches. Results A method for <b>DNA</b> <b>splicing</b> and mutagenesis without restriction enzymes is described. The method is based on mild template-dependent polymerization arrest with two molecules of cytosine arabinose (Ara-C) incorporated into PCR primers. Two rounds of PCR are employed: the first PCR produces 5 ' overhangs that are utilized for <b>DNA</b> <b>splicing.</b> The second PCR is based on polymerization running through the Ara-C molecules to produce the desired final product. To illustrate application of the run through stop mutagenesis and <b>DNA</b> <b>splicing</b> technique, we have carried out splicing of two segments of the human cofilin 1 gene and introduced a mutational deletion into the product.

40|$|Abstract—Associating {{functional}} {{information with}} biological sequences remains {{a challenge for}} machine learning methods. The performance of these methods often depends on deriving predictive features from the sequences sought to be classified. Feature generation is a difficult problem, as {{the connection between the}} sequence features and the sought property is not known a priori. It is often the task of domain experts or exhaustive feature enumeration techniques to generate a few features whose predictive power is then tested in the context of classification. This paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm to effectively explore a large feature space and generate predictive features from sequence data. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on {{an important component of the}} gene-finding problem, <b>DNA</b> <b>splice</b> site prediction. This application is chosen due to the complexity of the features needed to obtain high classification accuracy and precision. Our results test the effectiveness of the obtained features in the context of classification by Support Vector Machines and show significant improvement in accuracy and precision over state-of-the-art approaches.

Perhaps, best known for shaping immune-system genes in vertebrates, <b>DNA</b> <b>splicing</b> plays {{a central role in the}} life of ciliated protozoa, where thousands of germline DNA segments are eliminated after sexual reproduction to regenerate a functional somatic genome.
