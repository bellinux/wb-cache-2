The amount of green material is not important, as long as some is present, but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate. The scent of plants such as yarrow acts as an olfactory attractant to females.|$|E

25|$|Rajasthani cooking was {{influenced}} by both the war-like lifestyles of its inhabitants {{and the availability of}} ingredients in this arid region.

It is known for its snacks like Bikaneri Bhujia. Other famous dishes include bajre ki roti (millet bread) and lashun ki chutney (hot garlic paste), mawa kachori Mirchi Bada, Pyaaj Kachori and ghevar from Jodhpur, Alwar ka Mawa(Milk Cake), malpauas from Pushkar and rassgollas from Bikaner.

25|$|Proteins {{account for}} 8% to 12% of dried green coffee beans. A {{majority}} of the proteins are of the 11-S storage kind (alpha – component of 32 kDa, beta – component of 22 kDa), {{most of which are}} degraded to free amino acids during maturation of green coffee beans. Further, 11-S storage proteins are degraded to their individual amino acids under roasting temperature, thus are an additional source of bitter components due to generation of Maillard reaction products. High temperature and oxygen concentration and low pH degrade 11-S storage proteins of green coffee beans to low-molecular-weight peptides and amino acids. The degradation is accelerated in the presence of organic acids such as chlorogenic acids and their derivatives. Other proteins include enzymes, such as catalase and polyphenol oxidase, which are important for the maturation of green coffee beans. Mature coffee contains free amino acids (4.0mg amino acid/g robusta coffee and up to 4.5mg amino acid/g arabica coffee). In Coffea arabica, alanine is the amino acid with the highest concentration, i.e. 1.2mg/g, followed by asparagine of 0.66mg/g, whereas in C. robusta, alanine is present at a concentration of 0.8mg/g and asparagine at 0.36mg/g. The free hydrophobic amino acids in <b>fresh</b> <b>green</b> coffee beans contribute to the unpleasant taste, making it impossible to prepare a desirable beverage with such compounds. In <b>fresh</b> <b>green</b> coffee from Peru, these concentrations have been determined as: isoleucine 81mg/kg, leucine 100mg/kg, valine 93mg/kg, tyrosine 81mg/kg, phenylalanine 133mg/kg. The concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (a neurotransmitter) has been determined between 143mg/kg and 703mg/kg in green coffee beans from Tanzania. Roasted coffee beans do not contain any free amino acids; the amino acids in green coffee beans are degraded under roasting temperature to Maillard products (reaction products between the aldehyde group of sugar and the alpha-amino group of the amino acids). Further, diketopiperazines, e.g. cyclo(proline-proline), cyclo(proline-leucine), and cyclo(proline-isoleucine), are generated from the corresponding amino acids, and are the major source of the bitter taste of roasted coffee. The bitter flavor of diketopiperazines is perceptible at around 20mg/liter of water. The content of diketopiperazines in espresso is about 20 to 30mg, which is responsible for its bitterness.|$|E
25|$|When {{green coffee}} beans are roasted, other {{molecules}} with the typical pleasant aroma of coffee are generated, {{which are not}} present in <b>fresh</b> <b>green</b> coffee. During roasting, the {{major part of the}} unpleasant-tasting volatile compounds are neutralised. Unfortunately, other important molecules such as antioxidants and vitamins present in green coffee are destroyed. Volatile compounds with nauseating odor for humans have been identified, including acetic acid (pungent, unpleasant odor), propionic acid (odor of sour milk, or butter), butanoic acid (odor of rancid butter, present in green coffee with 2mg/100g coffee beans), pentanoic acid (unpleasant fruity flavor, present in green coffee at 40mg/100g in coffee beans), hexanoic acid (fatty-rancid odor), heptanoic acid (fatty odor), octanoic acid (repulsive oily rancid odor); nonanoic acid (mild nut-like fatty odor); decanoic acid (sour repulsive odor), and derivatives of such fatty acids – 3-methyl-valeric acid (sour, green-herbaceous, unpleasant odor), acetaldehyde (pungent-nauseating odor, even when highly diluted, present in dried green coffee beans at concentrations of about 5mg/kg), propanal (choking effect on respiratory system, penetrating-nauseating), butanal (nauseating effect, present in dried green coffee beans at 2 to 7mg/kg), or pentanal (very repulsive nauseating effect).|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} cooking {{utensils}} {{on the total}} and bioavailable iron contents of five green leafy vegetables, along with related promoters and inhibitors, were investigated. The cooked and <b>fresh</b> <b>greens</b> were analysed for moisture, total and bioavailable iron, ascorbic acid. dietary fibre, tannins, total oxalates and soluble oxalates by standard techniques. Moisture content of <b>fresh</b> <b>greens</b> ranged from 80 - 90 %, total dietary fibre (5 - 11 g/ 100 g), oxalates (0. 022 - 1. 37 g/ 100 g) and tannin (41 - 166 mg/ 100 g). Cooking in different utensils {{had no effect on}} these parameters. Ascorbic acid content ranged from 8. 7 to 88. 3 mg/ 100 g in <b>fresh</b> <b>greens</b> and was reduced by 18 - 64 % on cooking. The total and ionisable iron contents of greens ranged from 3 to 13 mg/ 100 g and 0. 43 to 2. 7 mg/ 100 g, respectively, and increased on cooking in iron utensil to 9. 7 to 17. 5 mg/ 100 g and 1. 50 to 8. 56 mg/ 100 g, respectively. The availability of iron, in relation to total iron, of greens cooked in iron utensils was either comparable or marginally higher than those cooked in other metallic utensils. Since the total iron content of greens cooked in iron utensils was high, the actual amount of available iron also increased. It can be concluded that cooking in iron utensils increases the total as well as the available iron content of greens. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
