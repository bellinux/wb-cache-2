5|$|In the men's events, the Korean team shot 12 maximum {{scores of}} 10 {{to win the}} gold medal against Chinese Taipei 251-245.

Defending {{champion}} Simon Fairweather was ousted from the competition in a first round loss due to blustery weather conditions. The wind caused some archers like Fairweather to make one-point shots, and its strength even caused others to miss their targets completely. The final matches of this event also saw competitors coming close in score, with Italian Marco Galiazzo beating the Japanese Hiroshi Yamamoto by only two points to win gold. Even closer still was the bronze medal match, in which Britain's Laurence Godfrey was outshot 112-113 by seventeen-year-old Australian Tim Cuddihy, who himself only managed {{to get into the}} semifinals by one point.|$|E
