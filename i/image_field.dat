25|$|In Late Corinthian times (sometimes {{designated}} Late Corinthian I, 575–550 BC) Corinthian vases had a red coating {{to enhance}} {{the contrast between the}} large white areas and the rather pale color of the clay vessel. This put the Corinthian craftsmen in competition with Attic pottery painters, who had in the meantime taken over {{a leading role in the}} pottery trade. Attic vase forms were also increasingly copied. Oinochoes, whose form had remained basically unchanged up until that time, began to resemble Attic forms; lekythos also started to be increasingly produced. The column krater, a Corinthian invention which was for that reason called a korinthios in the rest of Greece, was modified. Shortening the volutes above the handles gave rise to the Chalcidic krater. The main <b>image</b> <b>field</b> it was decorated with various representations of daily life or mythological scenes, the secondary field contained an animal frieze. The back often showed two large animals. Cups had become deeper already in Mid-Corinthian times and this trend continued. They became just as popular as kotyles. Many of them have mythological scenes on the outside and a gorgon grimace on the inside. This type of painting was also adopted by Attic painters. On their part, Corinthian painters took over framed image fields from Athens. Animal friezes became less important. During this time the third Corinthian painter with a known name, Chares, was active. The Tydeus Painter should also be mentioned, who around 560 BC liked to paint neck amphoras with a red background. Incised rosettes continued to be put on vases; they are lacking on only a few kraters and cups. The most outstanding piece of art in this period is the Amphiaraos Krater, a column krater created around 560 BC as the major work of the Amphiaraos Painter.. It shows several events from the life of the hero Amphiaraos.|$|E

30|$|The only {{input data}} {{is the image}} {{sequences}} to be analyzed. Several test sequences, around 50 images each, have been recorded with a 25 interleaved frames per second camera at 720 × 576 pixels. Therefore, every 40 ms, a complete image frame is generated, after combining two <b>image</b> <b>fields</b> provided by the interleaved camera at 20 -ms intervals. The main problem of using an interleaving camera derives from the delay in capturing both <b>image</b> <b>fields,</b> 20 ms, causing a mismatch in the final image. For example, a car traveling at 90 km/h (25 m/s) will advance 50 cm in 20 ms. One solution to fix this problem is to use only the even or the odd <b>image</b> <b>fields</b> and to ignore {{the other half of}} the original image, or to use a more expensive full-frame camera. The results in this section analyze both 720 × 576 interleaved and 720 × 288 non-interleaved images.|$|R

These cameras have an <b>image</b> <b>field</b> only a few pixels wide, with a single frame forming a narrow image only of the finish line, and anything which is crossing it. During a race, the camera takes images at an extremely high frame rate (the exact rate depends on the system, but can be in the thousands of lines per second). Computer software then arranges these frames horizontally to form a panoramic image which effectively displays a graph of the finish line (and anything crossing it) as time passes, with time denoted on the horizontal axis.|$|E

5000|$|A third characteristic, {{particularly}} of simple anamorphic add-on attachments to prime lenses, is [...] "anamorphic mumps". For reasons of practical optics, the anamorphic squeeze is not uniform across the <b>image</b> <b>field</b> in any system, whether cylindrical, prismatic or mirror-based. This variation resulted {{in some areas}} of the film image appearing more stretched than others. In the case of an actor's face {{in the center of the}} screen their faces look somewhat like they had the mumps, hence the name for the phenomenon. Conversely, at the edges of the screen actors in full length view can become skinny-looking. In medium shots, if they walk across the screen from one side to the other, they increase in apparent girth. Early CinemaScope presentations in particular (using Chrétien's off-the-shelf lenses) suffered from it. The first company to produce an anti-mumps system was Panavision in the late 1950s.|$|E
