500|$|... "Otherworld", {{the opening}} theme of Final Fantasy X, was {{composed}} by Nobuo Uematsu with lyrics by Alexander O. Smith. It was sung by Bill Muir, the frontman of xtillidiex (pronounced [...] "Till I die"), a death metal band active in Tokyo at the time. The song was already fully formed when Smith was tasked with writing lyrics for {{it based on}} a <b>guide</b> <b>track.</b> Smith's lyrics were loosely based on [...] "The Song of Wandering Aengus", a poem by W. B. Yeats. Smith mistook a guitar solo section of the song as another part {{that he had to}} fill with lyrics, and so he wrote in a spoken words part in [...] "one of those Limp Bizkit-style breakdowns". Uematsu liked the result and included it in the final song.|$|E
500|$|Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice {{believed}} that the song failed as an [...] "album opener", but sounds [...] "slightly better" [...] after one finished the whole record. Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot {{believed that}} unlike Madonna's 80s Catholic imagery, [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] does not venture into new territory with its sound. Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald found the song [...] "laughable", calling it a [...] "yawning Catholic-girl-in-heat". In another review of the album for BBC News, Levine called it [...] "charmless genero-banger". Alex Macpherson from Fact panned the track, saying that the [...] "rote, lifeless singing on [...] sounds as though a <b>guide</b> <b>track</b> was mistakenly kept on the finished song, and arguably marks the worst vocal performance Madonna has ever committed to record." [...] Robert Leedham from Drowned in Sound website felt that the song did not represent the album's sound, hence failed as a single to promote it. Jon Pareles from The New York Times called it [...] "shallow, effective club fodder", describing it as containing [...] "blippy stereo-hopping synthesizers and generic title". This view was shared by Emily Mackay of The Quietus, who felt that the song {{would have been better}} for another artist and was below Madonna's level.|$|E
500|$|Simpson's {{publicity}} suffered when {{a performance}} on the October 23–24 edition of Saturday Night Live went awry. According to Simpson's publicists, her father and manager decided to use a vocal <b>guide</b> <b>track</b> because of problems she was having with her voice, beginning earlier in the day, that were caused by acid reflux. Although her first performance of the night—"Pieces of Me"—was successful, her second performance, {{which was supposed to}} be of [...] "Autobiography" [...] (at the time planned as her third single), went wrong: [...] "Pieces of Me" [...] mistakenly began playing, and Simpson's recorded vocals were heard when her microphone was not near her mouth. She subsequently walked off the stage and then apologized for the error during the show's closing. Some viewers accused Simpson of lip synching, and the incident received widespread coverage in the news. Simpson joked about the incident with a performance of [...] "Autobiography" [...] at the Radio Music Awards on October 25. Despite the low points of this period of the album's promotion, there were also significant successes. According to a Geffen press release, her December 6 AOL Music Live performance [...] "had the biggest 1 week audience ever for AOL with 1.6 million plays." ...|$|E

500|$|Jaime Gill from Dot Music {{commented on}} the {{original}} version of [...] "Ironic", on his review of Jagged Little Pill Acoustic (2005), that [...] " [...] gave us pop's greatest parlour game, with spot the genuine irony in 'Ironic'" [...] and calling the song [...] "pretty" [...] and [...] "catchy". But he later criticized the lyrics, calling the song [...] "idiotic", and giving a positive review to the acoustic version saying: [...] "it actually sounds more relaxed and engaging without the hoary loud guitars of the original". Even though Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic marked the track {{as one of the}} [...] "All Media <b>Guide</b> <b>track</b> pick" [...] of the album, in a separate review, from the same website, the CD single release was rated with two-and-a-half out of five stars. Pareles noted that in verses of [...] "Ironic", and another song from the album ("Mary Jane"), [...] "it's easy to envision Morissette on the stage of a club, singing wry couplets backed by acoustic guitar". He also commented in another article he wrote, that the song was actually [...] "unironic". Dave Brecheisen of PopMatters felt that the acoustic version of [...] "Ironic", was much worse than the original version. The single won the Juno Award for Single of the Year at the 1997 ceremony, and in the same year it was nominated for a Grammy Award, in the category of Record of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Rasmussen's {{first task}} was to adjust and arrange the guitar sound with which the band was dissatisfied. A <b>guide</b> <b>track</b> for the tempos and a click track for Ulrich's {{drumming}} were used. The band played in a live room, recording the instruments separately. Each song used three reels: one for drums, a second for bass and guitars and a third for anything else. Hetfield wrote lyrics during the recording sessions; these were occasionally unfinished as recording began, and Rasmussen said that Hetfield [...] "wasn't really interested in singing" [...] but instead [...] "wanted that hard vibe". Metallica's recording process was new to Jason Newsted, who questioned his impact on the overall sound {{and the lack of}} discussion {{with the rest of the}} team. Newsted had a different experience with his previous band, Flotsam and Jetsam, describing their style as [...] "basically everybody playing the same thing like a sonic wall". He recorded his parts separately from the rest of the band, with only the assistant engineer present. Newsted noted that his parts were at the same audio frequency as Hetfield's guitar parts, and this created a [...] " [...] for the same frequency". Steve Thompson, who mixed the album, claims that Ulrich was squarely to blame for the inaudible bass and unusual drums. Thompson wanted to be relieved of his mixing duties when Ulrich presented his ideas on the production, but Thompson was not allowed to leave and received the majority of the criticism for the misrepresentation of bass of the record.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Time and a Word" [...] saw {{the band}} {{searching for an}} anthem-type song. Anderson, who was still musically naive, {{presented}} its basic theme to the group on a guitar, using {{only two or three}} chords, leaving the other band members trying to discern what he was playing. The song was recorded with Foster on acoustic guitar. Again Banks didn't agree and claimed it was not meant {{to be part of the}} final mix, having been intended only as a <b>guide</b> <b>track.</b> On the final version, Banks played his parts over Foster's.|$|E

5000|$|The duo {{started working}} {{together}} mainly as writers and producers in 1998. Madison Avenue recorded their first single, [...] "Fly", featuring Kellie Wolfgram as the vocalist. However, Coates sang on the group's breakthrough single [...] "Don't Call Me Baby", as Van Dorsselaer preferred her version, {{even though the}} song was initially used as the <b>guide</b> <b>track</b> for Wolfgram.|$|E
500|$|Mason's early drum {{sessions}} were performed {{in an open}} space {{on the top floor}} of Britannia Row Studios. The 16-track recordings from these {{sessions were}} mixed down and copied onto a 24-track master, as <b>guide</b> <b>tracks</b> for the rest of the band to play to. This gave the engineers greater flexibility, but also improved the audio quality of the final mix as the original 16-track drum recordings were finally synced to the 24-track master, and the duplicated <b>guide</b> <b>tracks</b> removed. [...] Ezrin later related the band's alarm at this method of working – they apparently viewed the erasure of material from the 24-track master as [...] "witchcraft".|$|R
50|$|In {{electronic}} music, {{some parts}} {{which have been}} programmed are too fast or complex to be played by a live musician. Backing tracks are also used when some or all {{members of a group}} are miming the playing of their instruments, lip-synching or using <b>guide</b> <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Extending flaps often run on <b>guide</b> <b>tracks.</b> Where these run {{outside the}} wing {{structure}} {{they may be}} faired in to streamline them and protect them from damage.

50|$|Vehicle control used {{a moving}} block control system, {{similar to those}} used on {{automated}} railways. Each vehicle had a small computer on board that communicated with the external scheduling systems every 1/2 second or less, sending in its current position with a resolution of less than 2 m. The position was measured by small spiral antennas running in the <b>guide</b> <b>track,</b> which also send position information to the scheduling computers at 1,200 bit/s over an inductive loop in the track.|$|E

Most modern Shoot the Chute rides usually consist of (though not limited to) an oval shaped layout or a figure-eight layout. Many Shoot the Chute installations also have an observation platform or bridge so that spectators, in addition to riders, can get wet from the splash created by the boats.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{signature}} pieces of 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea was the fleet of passenger vehicles, adapted for theme park use from Harper Goff's Nautilus {{design for the}} 1954 Disney live-action version by Disney Imagineer George McGinnis. The basic hulls were constructed by Morgan Yachts in Clearwater, Florida, with the final building work being transferred to Tampa Ship midway through. Another veteran Imagineer, Bob Gurr, oversaw the project. Upon delivery at Walt Disney World in August 1971, the vehicles weighed some forty tons, and were installed into a concrete <b>guide</b> (<b>track),</b> mounted {{on top of a}} mechanism that limited [...] "bumping" [...] accidents.|$|E
40|$|Gliding of {{microtubule}} filaments on surfaces {{coated with}} the motor protein kinesin has potential applications for nano-scale devices. The ability {{to guide the}} gliding direction in three dimensions allows the fabrication of tracks of arbitrary geometry in space. Here, we achieve this by using kinesin-coated glass wires of micrometer diameter range.
