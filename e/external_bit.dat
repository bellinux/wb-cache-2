Initially, the dynamic S boxes are generated using Fisher Yates shuffle method and piece wise linear chaotic map. The algorithm utilizes advantages of keyed Latin square and transformation to substitute highly correlated digital images and yield encrypted image with valued performance. The chaotic behavior is achieved using Logistic map {{which is used to}} select one of thousand S boxes and also decides the row and column of selected S box. The selected S box value is transformed using nonlinear transformation.

40|$|Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) can be {{classified}} into two categories namely Nyquist-rate ADCs and OversampledADCs. Nyquist-rate ADCs can process very high bandwidths while Oversampling ADCs provide high resolution using coarse quantizers and support lower input signal bandwidths. This work describes a Reconfigurable ADC (R-ADC) architecture which models 14 different ADCs utilizing four four-bit flash ADCs and four Reconfigurable Blocks (RBs). Both Nyquist-rate and Oversampled ADCs {{are included in the}} reconfiguration scheme. The R-ADC supports first- and second-order Sigma-Delta (ΣΔ) ADCs. Cascaded ΣΔ ADCs which provide high resolution while avoiding the stability issues related to higher order ΣΔ loops are also included. Among the Nyquist-rate ADCs, pipelined and time interleaved ADCs are modeled. A four-bit flash ADC with calibration is used as the basic building block for all ADC configurations. The R-ADC needs to support very high sampling rates (1 GHz to 2 GHz). Hence switched-capacitor (SC) based circuits are used for realizing the loop filters in the ΣΔ ADCs. The pipelined ADCs also utilize an SC based block called Multiplying Digital-to-Analog Converter (MDAC). By analyzing the similarities in structure and function of the loop filter and MDAC, a RB has been designed which can accomplish the function of either block based on the selected configuration. Utilizing the same block for various configurations reduces power and area requirements for the R-ADC. In SC based circuits, the minimum sampling capacitance is limited by the thermal noise that can be tolerated in order to achieve a specific ENOB. The thermal noise in a ΣΔ ADC is subjected to noise shaping. This results in reduced thermal noise levels at the inputs of successive loop filters in cascaded or multi-order ΣΔ ADCs. This property can be used to reduce the sampling capacitance of successive stages in cascaded and multi-order ΣΔ ADCs. In pipelined ADCs, the thermal noise in successive stages are reduced due to the inter-stage gain of the MDAC in each stage. Hence scaling of sampling capacitors can be applied along the pipeline stages. The RB utilizes the scaling of capacitor values afforded by the noise shaping property of ΣΔ loops and the inter-stage gain of stages in pipelined ADCs to reduce the total capacitance requirement for the specified Effective Number Of Bits (ENOB). The critical component of the RB is the operational amplifier (opamp). The speed of operation and ENOB for different configurations are determined by the 3 dB frequency and DC gain of the opamp. In order to find the specifications of the opamp, the errors introduced in ΣΔ and pipelined ADCs by the finite gain and bandwidth of the opamp were modeled in Matlab. The gain and bandwidth requirements for the opamp were derived from the simulation results. Unlike Nyquist-rate ADCs, the ΣΔ ADCs suffer from stability issues when the input exceeds a certain level. The maximum usable input level is determined by the resolution of the quantizer and the order of the loop filter in the ΣΔADC. Using Matlab models, the maximum value of input for different oversampling ADC configurations in the R-ADC were found. The results obtained from simulation are comparable to the theoretical values. The cascaded ADCs require digital filter functions which enable the cancellation of quantization noise from certain stages. These functions were implemented in Matlab. For the R-ADC, these filter functions need to run at very high sampling rates. The ΣΔ loop filter transfer functions were chosen such that their coefficients are powers of two, which would allow them to be implemented as shift and add operations instead of multiplications. The R-ADC configurations were simulated in Matlab. A schematic for the R-ADC was developed in Cadence using ideal switches and a finite gain, single-pole operational transconductance amplifier model. The ADC configuration was selected by four <b>external</b> <b>bits.</b> Performance parameters such as SNR, SNDR and SFDR obtained from simulations in Cadence agree with those from Matlab for all ADC configurations...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of parts are designed with digital control interfaces, including phase shifters and variable attenuators. When designing an antenna array in which each antenna has independent amplitude and phase control, the number of digital control lines that must be set simultaneously can grow very large. Use of a parallel interface would require separate line drivers, more parts, and thus additional failure points. A convenient form of control where single-phase shifters or attenuators could be set or the whole set could be programmed with an update rate of 100 Hz is needed to solve this problem. A digital interface board with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) can simultaneously control an essentially arbitrary number of digital control lines with a serial command interface requiring only three wires. A small set of short, high-level commands provides a simple programming interface for an <b>external</b> controller. Parity <b>bits</b> are used to validate the control commands. Output timing is controlled within the FPGA to allow for rapid update rates of the phase shifters and attenuators. This technology {{has been used to}} set and monitor eight 5 -bit control signals via a serial UART (universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter) interface. The digital interface board controls the phase and amplitude of the signals for each element in the array. A host computer running Agilent VEE sends commands via serial UART connection to a Xilinx VirtexII FPGA. The commands are decoded, and either outputs are set or telemetry data is sent back to the host computer describing the status and the current phase and amplitude settings. This technology {{is an integral part of}} a closed-loop system in which the angle of arrival of an X-band uplink signal is detected and the appropriate phase shifts are applied to the Ka-band downlink signal to electronically steer the array back in the direction of the uplink signal. It will also be used in the non-beam-steering case to compensate for phase shift variations through power amplifiers. The digital interface board can be used to set four 5 -bit phase shifters and four 5 -bit attenuators and monitor their current settings. Additionally, it is useful outside of the closed-loop system for beamsteering alone. When the VEE program is started, it prompts the user to initialize variables (to zero) or skip initialization. After that, the program enters into a continuous loop waiting for the telemetry period to elapse or a button to be pushed. A telemetry request is sent when the telemetry period is elapsed (every five seconds). Pushing one of the set or reset buttons will send the appropriate command. When a command is sent, the interface status is returned, and the user will be notified by a pop-up window if any error has occurred. The program runs until the End Program button is depressed...|$|R
