5|$|As {{tensions}} mounted {{between the}} <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> the Northwest Territory and settlers on the Kentucky frontier, President Washington began sanctioning joint operations between federal army troops and local frontier militia against the <b>Indians.</b> <b>In</b> April 1790, Scott raised {{a contingent of}} volunteers from Bourbon and Fayette counties to join Josiah Harmar in a raid against the Western Confederacy along the Scioto River in {{what would become the}} U.S. state of Ohio. The combined force of regulars and militia departed from Limestone on April 18, 1790, crossing the Ohio River and marching to the upper Scioto. From there, they headed south, toward the present-day city of Portsmouth, Ohio, and discovered an abandoned Indian camp. Fresh footprints, including those of a well-known Shawnee warrior– nicknamed Reel Foot because of his two club feet– led away from the camp site. Scott sent a small detachment to follow the tracks; ultimately, they discovered and killed four Shawnee, including Reel Foot. Other than this, the expedition accomplished nothing, and it disbanded on August 27, 1790.|$|E

5|$|Protohistoric {{refers to}} the period when American Indians were exposed to European trade items and large {{population}} shifts occurred because of introduced European diseases and warfare, but {{there is very little}} direct written documentation.

American <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> the early Protohistoric period continued many aspects of Oneota culture, but soon almost all indigenous technology disappeared, including ceramics and stone tool production. It was during this period that the Meskwaki (Fox) and Sauk appeared in eastern Iowa, displaced from their homelands in the east.

5|$|Queen conch shells {{were used}} by Native Americans and Caribbean <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> {{a wide variety of}} ways. South Florida bands (such as the Tequesta), the Carib, the Arawak and Taíno used conch shells to {{fabricate}} tools (such as knives, axe heads and chisels), jewelry, cookware and used them as blowing horns. In Mesoamerican history, Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double-headed serpent. The Aztecs also believed that the sound of trumpets made from queen conch shells represented divine manifestations, and used them in religious ceremonies. In central Mexico, during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc, the Maya used conch shells as hand protectors (in a manner similar to boxing gloves) during combat. Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre-Columbian Lucayan <b>Indians</b> <b>in</b> the Bahamas used the queen conch as a food source.|$|E
