25|$|A silver <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> is an {{ordinary}} mirror, coated {{on its back}} surface with silver, which produces images by reflection. This kind of <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> is produced by coating a silver, copper film and two or more layers of waterproof paint on the back surface of float glass, which perfectly resists acid and moisture. A silver <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> provides clear and actual images, is quite durable, and is widely used for furniture, bathroom and other decorative purposes.|$|E
25|$|A safety <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> {{is made by}} {{adhering}} {{a special}} protective film to the back surface of a silver <b>glass</b> <b>mirror,</b> which prevents injuries in case the mirror is broken. This kind of mirror is used for furniture, doors, glass walls, commercial shelves, or public areas.|$|E

40|$|A {{summary of}} the {{cryogenic}} testing of <b>glass</b> and metal <b>mirrors</b> performed at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) and two other places is presented. Recent improvements to the ARC Cryogenic Optics Test Facility are described. The purposes of the tests were to determine: (1) how <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> would perform at cryogenic temperatures compared with metal mirrors and (2) how various mirror mounts would affect the cryogenic performance of mirrors. Details of a cryogenic test of a 50 cm 'double arch', fused-silica mirror with a three-point mount and with a radially-compliant, flexured mount are given. Within {{the accuracy of the}} measurements, it was determined that the flexured mount did not induce appreciable distortion in the double arch mirror. Results of the cryogenic tests of a number of <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> and two beryllium mirrors are included. The cryogenic distortion of the <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> was found to be less than that for the beryllium mirrors. Within the accuracy of the measurements, no hysteresis was found in the <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors.</b> It was possible to measure hysteresis in one of the beryllium mirrors...|$|R
25|$|A low {{aluminium}} <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> is {{manufactured by}} coating silver and {{two layers of}} protective paint on the back surface of glass. A low aluminium <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> is very clear, light transmissive, smooth, and reflects accurate natural colors. This type of glass is widely used for framing presentations and exhibitions in which a precise color representation of the artwork is truly essential or when the background color of the frame is predominantly white.|$|E
25|$|In 1856–57, Karl August von Steinheil and Léon Foucault {{introduced}} {{a process of}} depositing a layer of silver on glass telescope mirrors. The silver layer was not only much more reflective and longer lasting than the finish on speculum mirrors, it {{had the advantage of}} being able to be removed and re-deposited without changing the shape of the glass substrate. Towards the end of the 19th century very large silver on <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> reflecting telescopes were built.|$|E

2500|$|Of Mutability was Chadwick's {{first major}} solo exhibition, {{held at the}} Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1986. Chadwick {{utilised}} the ceremonial character of the elegant neo-classical rooms of the upper galleries to house an installation {{made up of a}} number of autonomous artworks. One room was at the centre of the exhibition and took the name of The Oval Court (1984–86), an ovoid platform that lay {{in the middle of the}} space. The platform presents a twelve-part collage of layered blue toned A4 photocopies made directly of the artist’s naked form, dead animals, plants and drapery suspended in an ovoid pool. The work speaks to the still life, evoking vanitas tradition in its subtle depictions of the transience of the things we surround ourselves with. Twelve figures, according to the artist’s notes, represent the [...] "12 gates to paradise", where she achieves [...] "oneness with all living things". Five golden spheres rest atop the platform corresponding to the finger placing’s of a huge hand, alluding to the touch of divine. On the walls of this room were photographs of the artist weeping, a Venetian <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> and printouts of computer-rendered drawings of the Baroque columns from the baldacchino of St Peter's in Rome. Chadwick’s use of her own body invokes a human attachment to the world, suggesting that the concept of self is infinitely subject to change.|$|E

6000|$|Wellington used to {{say that}} too much was made of it, and that one would imagine that the British Army had never fought a battle before. It was a {{characteristic}} speech, but it must be admitted that the British Army never had, as a matter of fact, for many centuries fought a battle which was finally decisive of a great European war. There lies the perennial interest of the incident, that it was the last act of that long-drawn drama, and that to the very fall of the curtain no man could tell how the play would end--"the nearest run thing that ever you saw"--that was the victor's description. It is a singular thing that during those twenty-five years of incessant fighting the material and methods of warfare made so little progress. So far as I know, there was no great change in either between 1789 and 1805. The breech-loader, heavy artillery, the ironclad, all great advances in the art of war, have been invented in time of peace. There are some improvements so obvious, {{and at the same time}} so valuable, that it is extraordinary that they were not adopted. Signalling, for example, whether by heliograph or by flag-waving, would have made an immense difference in the Napoleonic campaigns. The principle of the semaphore was well known, and Belgium, with its numerous windmills, would seem to be furnished with natural semaphores. Yet in the four days during which the campaign of Waterloo was fought, the whole scheme of military operations on both sides was again and again imperilled, and finally in the case of the French brought to utter ruin by lack of that intelligence which could so easily have been conveyed. June 18th was at intervals a sunshiny day--a four-inch <b>glass</b> <b>mirror</b> would have put Napoleon in communication with Gruchy, and the whole history of Europe might have been altered. Wellington himself suffered dreadfully from defective information which might have been easily supplied. The unexpected presence of the French army was first discovered at four in the morning of June 15. It was of enormous importance to get the news rapidly to Wellington at Brussels that he might instantly concentrate his scattered forces on the best line of resistance--yet, through the folly of sending only a single messenger, this vital information did not reach him until three in the afternoon, the distance being thirty miles. Again, when Blucher was defeated at Ligny on the 16th, it was of enormous importance that Wellington should know at once the line of his retreat so as to prevent the French from driving a wedge between them. The single Prussian officer who was despatched with this information was wounded, and never reached his destination, and it was only next day that Wellington learned the Prussian plans. On what tiny things does History depend! ...|$|E

50|$|Early octants were {{constructed}} primarily in wood, with later versions incorporating ivory and brass components. The earliest mirrors were polished metal, since {{the technology to}} produce silvered <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> with flat, parallel surfaces was limited. As glass polishing techniques improved, <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> began to be provided. These used coatings of mercury-containing tin amalgam; coatings of silver or aluminum were not available until the 19th century. The poor optical quality of the early polished speculum metal mirrors meant that telescopic sights were not practical. For that reason, most early octants employed a simple naked-eye sighting pinnula instead.|$|R

25|$|Glass was a {{desirable}} material for mirrors. Because {{the surface of}} glass is naturally smooth, it produces reflections with very little blur. In addition, glass is very hard and scratch resistant. However, glass by itself has little reflectivity, so people began coating it with metals to increase the reflectivity. Metal-coated <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> are said by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder to have been invented in Sidon (modern-day Lebanon) {{in the first century}} AD, although no archeological evidence of them date from before the third century. According to Pliny, the people of Sidon developed a technique for creating crude mirrors by coating blown glass with molten lead. <b>Glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> backed with gold leaf are mentioned by Pliny in his Natural History, written in about 77 AD. Because there were few ways to make a smooth piece of glass with a uniform thickness, these ancient glass-mirrors were made by blowing a glass bubble, and then cutting off a small, circular section, producing mirrors that were either concave or convex. These circular mirrors were typically small, from only a fraction of an inch to as much as eight inches in diameter. These small mirrors produced distorted images, yet were prized objects of high value. These ancient <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> were very thin, thus very fragile, because the glass needed to be extremely thin to prevent cracking when coated with a hot, molten metal. Due to the poor quality, high cost, and small size of these ancient <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors,</b> solid metal-mirrors primarily of steel were usually preferred until the late nineteenth century.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} mirrors {{were made}} from polished obsidian during the Stone Age. [...] By the Bronze Age most cultures had adopted mirrors made from polished discs of bronze, copper or other metals. Such metal mirrors remained the norm through to Greco-Roman Antiquity and throughout the Middle Ages in Europe. In the 1st century CE <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> began to appear, now believed to have originated in Sidon in present-day Lebanon.Ptolemaic Egypt had manufactured small <b>glass</b> <b>mirrors</b> backed by lead, tin, or antimony. In the early 10th century, the Persian scientist al-Razi described ways of silvering and gilding in a book on alchemy, {{but this was not}} done for the purpose of making mirrors.|$|R
