5|$|There follow {{confusing}} episodes involving Brittany (sometimes called Letia). Padarn finally {{leaves for}} France, where he dies, but his remains are brought back and buried in Vannes. A final chapter tells how Padarn, David and Teilo divide south Wales into three episcopates, with Padarn as bishop of Ceredigion. Then, convinced by a miracle performed by Padarn, a local governor called Eithir is persuaded to give land between the rivers Rheidol and Paith to Padarn. The lands owned by Llanbadarn in {{the twelfth century}} were between the rivers Rheidol and Clarach. The Paith is a minor tributary of the River Ystwyth. The obscure figure of Eithyr is commemorated in the <b>farm</b> <b>name</b> of Llaneithr, which stands a mile east of Devil's Bridge near the river Mynach.|$|E
25|$|Gardermoen is a {{compound}} of the <b>farm</b> <b>name</b> Garder and the finite form of mo 'moor; drill ground' (thus 'the moor belonging to the farm Garder'). The farm is first mentioned in 1328 (Garðar), and the name is the plural of Norse garðr 'fence'. The meaning is probably 'enclosure; fenced fields'.|$|E
25|$|The Stewarton to Torranyard (Torrenzairds in 1613) {{road was}} a turnpike as {{witnessed}} by the <b>farm</b> <b>name</b> Crossgates (Stewarton 3 and Irvine 5 miles), Gateside (near Stacklawhill Farm) and the check bars that are {{shown on the}} 1858 OS at Crossgates and at the Bickethall (previously Bihetland) road end to prevent vehicles, horse riders, etc. turning off the turnpike and avoiding the toll charges. A small toll house is shown at Crossgates, now demolished, on the left when facing Torranyard. In Scots a 'bicket' is a 'pocket', an appropriate description of the area the farm lies in. A modern cottage nearby is called 'Robelle' after the farmers Robert and Isabelle from Bickethall.|$|E

500|$|Tankersley was {{a patron}} of many charities. [...] Upon her death from Parkinson's disease in 2013 she bequeathed her Tucson ranch to the University of Arizona {{and placed the}} Hat Ranch in a {{conservation}} trust. [...] In her final years, she downsized her breeding operation to about 150 horses, and most remaining stock went to her son, Mark Miller, who moved the Al-Marah Arabian <b>farm</b> <b>name</b> and horse operation to his home base near Clermont, Florida.|$|E
500|$|Throughout her {{newspaper}} career, {{she moved}} the Al-Marah <b>farm</b> <b>name</b> with her, to Illinois from 1944 to 1949, {{and outside of}} Washington, DC, in Maryland, where she lived from 1949 to 1975. Thereafter, she returned to Tucson permanently. [...] She consistently used bloodlines from the Crabbet Arabian Stud, both via horses descended from early American importations {{as well as her}} own purchases from the estate of Lady Wentworth in the late 1950s. This unbroken line gives rise to Miller's assertion that the Al-Marah herd is the [...] "oldest continuously-bred, privately-owned band of Arabians in the world".|$|E
500|$|Tankersley died on February 5, 2013. She had Parkinson's disease.

[...] Her son, Mark Miller, inherited many of her remaining horses [...] and moved the Al-Marah Arabian <b>farm</b> <b>name</b> and the horse operation to his home base near Clermont, Florida. [...] Miller had run an entertainment venue called Arabian Nights, in Kissimmee, Florida, near Disney World, from 1988 until 2013. [...] He used Al-Marah-bred horses to present a 90-minute dinner show performance every night of the year that featured 50 Arabian horses. He closed the program in December 2013 {{to focus on the}} transplanted Al-Marah herd on his Florida property.|$|E

500|$|Varian and {{her parents}} began using the <b>farm</b> <b>name</b> [...] "Varian Arabians" [...] in 1954. She {{credited}} her parents for helping her believe that she could do whatever {{she wanted to do}} and for trusting her own judgement, which gave her confidence in her own ability to work with horses. They worked as a team to build a horse business; Eric, an electrical contractor, built fences and managed the land, Wenonah studied pedigrees, and Sheila handled the horses. In time, their ranch expanded from 21 to 150 acres. As a young adult, Varian completed college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and taught high school physical education for three years, until 1963, when running the Varian Arabian ranch became her full-time job. The ranch was self-supporting from 1963 on, with the short-term assistance of loans from Sheila's aunt, Dorothy Varian, which were promptly repaid. Ultimately, the ranch grew to 230 acres.|$|E
500|$|Tankersley {{purchased}} {{her first}} purebred Arabian {{when she was}} 19, and began her horse breeding operation, Al-Marah Arabians, in Tucson, Arizona, in 1941. As she moved across the US for her newspaper career, her horses and <b>farm</b> <b>name</b> went with her. [...] She purchased her program's foundation sire, Indraff, in 1947, while living in Illinois. [...] Upon her move to Washington, DC, her Al-Marah operation relocated to Montgomery County, Maryland, where by 1957 {{it was the largest}} Arabian farm in the United States. Tankersley returned to Tucson in the 1970s, where in addition to horse breeding, she created an apprenticeship program at Al-Marah to train young people for jobs in the horse industry. [...] She set up a second horse operation, the Hat Ranch, near Flagstaff, Arizona. Over her career she bred over 2,800 registered Arabians {{and was one of the}} largest importers of horses from the Crabbet Arabian Stud in England.|$|E
500|$|The Clydesdale {{takes its}} name from Clydesdale, the old name for Lanarkshire, noted for the River Clyde. In the mid-18th century, Flemish stallions were {{imported}} to Scotland and bred to local mares, resulting in foals that were larger than the existing local stock. These included a black unnamed stallion imported from England by a John Paterson of Lochlyloch and an unnamed dark-brown stallion owned by the Duke of Hamilton. Another prominent stallion was a [...] coach horse stallion of unknown lineage named Blaze. Written pedigrees were kept of these foals beginning in the early 19th century, and in 1806 a filly, later known as [...] "Lampits mare" [...] after the <b>farm</b> <b>name</b> of her owner, was born that traced her lineage to the black stallion. This mare is listed in the ancestry of almost every Clydesdale living today. One of her foals was Thompson's Black Horse (known as Glancer), who was to have a significant influence on the Clydesdale breed. The first recorded use of the name [...] "Clydesdale" [...] in reference to the breed was in 1826 at an exhibition in Glasgow. Another theory of their origin, that of them descending from Flemish horses brought to Scotland as early as the 15th century, was also promulgated in the late 18th century. However, even the author of that theory admitted that the common story of their ancestry is more likely.|$|E

2500|$|Finland {{has three}} {{predominant}} surname traditions: the West Finnish, the East Finnish {{and that of}} the Swedish nobility, clergy, bourgeoisie and military. Until the early 20th century, Finland was a predominantly agrarian society and the names of West Finns were based on their association with a particular area, farm, or homestead (e.g., Jaakko Jussila ("Jaakko from the farm of Jussi")). Farm names typically had the suffix -la and could refer to the husband (like Jussila) or describe the location (e.g., Isoaho [...] "large clearing"). This name could change every time the person moved to a different farm. Also, even if one had a surname, one would still be better known by the <b>farm</b> <b>name.</b> Farm names, patronyms and village names could be used to disambiguate between different people, but they were not true inherited surnames. For example, in the novel Seven Brothers (Aleksis Kivi, 1870) the character Juhani was officially summoned as Juhani Juhanin-poika Jukola, Toukolan kylästä; [...] "Juhani, son of Juhani, from Jukola farm, Toukola village".|$|E
2500|$|Even more {{important}} a driver of change was the need, for administrative purposes, {{to develop a}} system under which each individual had a [...] "stable" [...] name from birth to death. In the old days, people would be known by their name, patronymic and the farm they lived at. This last element would change if a person got a new job, bought a new farm, or otherwise came to live somewhere else. (This {{is part of the}} origin, {{in this part of the}} world, of the custom of women changing their names upon marriage. Originally it indicated, basically, a change of address, and from older times, there are numerous examples of men doing the same thing). The many patronymic names may derive from the fact that people who moved from the country to the cities, also gave up the name of the farm they came from. As a worker, you passed by your father's name, and this name passed on to the next generation as a family name. Einar Gerhardsen, the Norwegian prime minister, used a true patronym, as his father was named Gerhard Olsen (Gerhard, the son of Ola). Gerhardsen passed his own patronym on to his children as a family name. This has been common in many working-class families. The tradition of keeping the <b>farm</b> <b>name</b> as a family name got stronger during the first half of the 20th century in Norway.|$|E
