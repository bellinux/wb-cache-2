50|$|When <b>Dixie</b> <b>Mae</b> and the Ellens {{reveal that}} they are all {{actually}} simulations, the researchers explore the email and find a clue that leads them to a 'cookie', a file that is passed from each iteration to the next with messages from the centuries of time they have been simulated over and over. They also find out that it was actually <b>Dixie</b> <b>Mae</b> herself who wrote the email {{in order to make it}} as offensive as possible to herself, allowing each iteration of the researchers to access the cookie. The story ends with a sad <b>Dixie</b> <b>Mae</b> realizing she can't do anything herself to stop the endless cycle they are all in, but through the passing of information and ideas from one iteration to the next someday they will have the ability to stop the simulations.|$|E

50|$|The {{story begins}} {{following}} {{the first day}} of <b>Dixie</b> <b>Mae</b> Leigh's job as a customer support employee at a fictional company called Lotsatech. She receives an insulting and mysterious email and, in a fit of rage, decides to find out who sent it. She and a fellow employee Victor search the Lotsatech campus looking for the author of the email, following clues in the email header. They meet up with Ellen, a grad student in computer science, who decides to try to help <b>Dixie</b> <b>Mae.</b>|$|E

The strip added a popular feature also used by Bill Woggon in his Katy Keene comic books: fashion designs for Dixie were submitted by fans and credited {{to them in the}} strip. In addition, when Dixie opened a small cafe, recipes were requested. When the action occurred on the town's streets, there was always in the background a bass player carrying his instrument on his back.|$|R

FOPEN (Foliage Penetration) radar {{has been used to}} penetrate tree canopies in order to detect objects. On the other hand, spectral differences between targets and backgrounds are used in HSI systems. Both SAR and HSI systems may suffer substantial false alarm and leakage rates due to respective background clutter. It is expected that a combined SAR and HSI system will greatly enhance the detection and identification performance. Based on the features derived from SAR and HSI data, a fusion approach has been established. Data sets of SAR and HSI over a common area from the <b>Dixie</b> data collection (<b>Ma...</b>|$|R
