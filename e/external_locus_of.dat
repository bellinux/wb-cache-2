25|$|The {{previous}} section showed how self-efficacy {{can be related}} to a person's locus of control, and stress also has a relationship in these areas. Self-efficacy can be something that people use to deal with the stress that they are faced with in their everyday lives. Some findings suggest that higher levels of <b>external</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control combined with lower levels self-efficacy are related to higher illness-related psychological distress. In the {{previous section}}, the different types of locus of control, internal and external, were mentioned. Based on the definition of people who have an <b>external</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control, we can see that this can be associated with higher levels of stress. A study conducted by Bollini and others reveals that individuals who have a high <b>external</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control tend to have higher levels of psychological and physical problems. These people are also more vulnerable to external influences and as a result they become more responsive to stress.|$|E

We examined the self-esteem, internal health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control, and <b>external</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control through sociodemographic and neurocognitive factors. Methods: Forty-six schizophrenic patients and 31 healthy residents from the community or hospital were recruited as the control group. All subjects participated in the self-esteem questionnaire, health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control questionnaire, {{and a series of}} neuropychological measures. Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that inhibition of attention and <b>external</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control were predictors for self-esteem (r=− 0. 30, P< 0. 05; r= 0. 41, P< 0. 01); inhibition of attention and <b>external</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control were contributors for internal health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control (r=− 0. 43, P< 0. 01; r= 0. 61, P< 0. 001); and education was related to <b>external</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control (r=− 0. 31, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The current study integrated background characteristics and cognitive function to better understand the impact of self-esteem and health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control in schizophrenia. The findings indicated that inhibition <b>of</b> attention, <b>external</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control, and education contributed to self-esteem, internal health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control and <b>external</b> health <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control.

25|$|Regarding {{locus of}} control, {{there is another}} type of control that entails a mix among the {{internal}} and external types. People that have the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as Bi-locals. People that have Bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and cope with their diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and <b>external</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control. People that have this mix of loci of control can take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to {{the internal and external}} loci of control, respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effect of {{metacognition}} on one’s academic <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control. The study’s sample group consists of 451 university students enrolled in various programs at Sakarya University, Turkey.

2500|$|The New Thought {{movement}} has received criticism akin to that levied against the holistic health movement {{due to this}} assertion: in claiming that sickness {{is caused by a}} person’s attitudes, mental states, and faith in New Thought, it is easy to place blame on patients for not adopting the proper attitude, thought processes, and/or lifestyle, thus causing their disease or disorder [...] By blaming ill individuals for causing their own disease, the New Thought movement is encouraging further victimization of patients well beyond the boundaries of their disease symptoms. Blame can have powerful psychological effects – with stress and isolation seen in victim blaming being the largest issues that arise and the most concerning in terms of effect on patients’ health [...] Further, holding beliefs that health and disease is controlled by faith in a higher power can create an <b>external</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control (i.e., believers may feel as though they themselves cannot prevent disease, and that any illness or disorder that they encounter is an act of the higher power’s will). This <b>external</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control can create learned helplessness in believers which has been shown to exacerbate mental and physical health conditions via several mechanisms – including reduced incidence of help-seeking behaviour [...] Overall, the New Thought movement is not empirically supported and its position on the etiology and treatment of disease is far more harmful than helpful to followers of New Thought.|$|E
2500|$|Rotter (1975) {{cautioned that}} internality and {{externality}} represent two {{ends of a}} continuum, not an either/or typology. Internals tend to attribute outcomes of events to their own control. People who have {{internal locus of control}} believe that the outcomes of their actions are results of their own abilities. Internals believe that their hard work would lead them to obtain positive outcomes. They also believe that every action has its consequence, which makes them accept the fact that things happen and it depends on them if they want to have control over it or not. Externals attribute outcomes of events to external circumstances. People with an <b>external</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control tend to believe that the things which happen in their lives are out of their control, and even that their own actions are a result of external factors, such as fate, luck, the influence of powerful others (such as doctors, the police, or government officials) and/or a belief that the world is too complex for one to predict or successfully control its outcomes. Such people tend to blame others rather than themselves for their lives' outcomes. It should not be thought, however, that internality is linked exclusively with attribution to effort and externality with attribution to luck (as Weiner's work – see below – [...] makes clear). This has obvious implications for differences between internals and externals in terms of their achievement motivation, suggesting that internal locus is linked with higher levels of need for achievement. Due to their locating control outside themselves, externals tend to feel they have less control over their fate. People with an <b>external</b> <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control tend to be more stressed and prone to clinical depression.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explore the}} {{influence}} of maternal Negative Affectivity on child diet and the mechanisms that mediate this influence. For this purposed I used data from a nation-wide birth cohort study of between 15 000 and 30 000 mother-child dyads. The main findings of this study were that the children of mothers {{with a high level of}} Negative Affectivity to a lesser extent are breastfed during the first 6 months of their life, and have a diet of poorer nutritional value at the age of 18 months and 3 years. Moreover, it is suggested in this thesis a causal link between high levels of Negative Affectivity, <b>external</b> Parental <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> Control (i. e. believing not to have control over the child), and control-oriented child-feeding practices of pressuring the child to eat and restricting the child’s food intake. Indeed, <b>external</b> Parental <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> Control was the most important mechanism, entirely mediating the effect of Negative Affectivity on child feeding practices. What is more, <b>external</b> Parental <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> Control partially explained the association between the two child-feeding practices. This implicates that believing not to have control over the child, can be viewed as a common etiological factor for control-oriented child feeding. Child feeding practices showed different associations with child diet. Pressuring the child to eat was associated with a diet of poorer nutritional value. Restricting the child’s food intake, in contrast, was associated with a diet of preferable nutritional value. These findings are important for the understanding of early child-feeding and risk factors for an obesogenic child diet, particularly because belief systems such as Parental <b>Locus</b> <b>of</b> Control are accessible for interventions.

In particular, we hypothesized that <b>external</b> work <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control may have a positive direct relationship with burnout symptoms via positive relationship with emotion-focused and avoidant coping styles, and a negative relationship with problem-focused style. Material and Methods: We tested the mediational hypothesis using structural equation modeling of self-report data from 155 Polish physiotherapists. Results: The relationship between <b>external</b> work <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control and physiotherapists’ burnout was shown to be mediated by a positive relationship with emotion-focused coping and an inverse relationship with problem-focused coping. The variables included in the model explained about 15 % of the variance of emotional exhaustion, 14 % of depersonalization, and 14 % of personal accomplishment. Conclusions: Physiotherapists perceiving the situation as difficult to control, feel more burned out when they use more emotion-focused strategies, and less problem-focused strategies. This indicates the importance of including both, problem-focused coping training and increasing the perception of the situation controllability in preventing physiotherapists’ burnout programs...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{relational}} view to control constructs and entrepreneurship. It introduces the concept 'interaction <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control' {{to the study}} of entrepreneurial agency cognitions. We argue that a better understanding of entrepreneurial agency can be achieved by re-engaging with the psychological constructs of 'locus of control', 'personal control' and 'self-efficacy'. We argue that typically, control constructs neglect how the agent is socially situated. In contrast, our theorizing sheds conceptual light on the situated and relational nature of entrepreneurs' agency cognition, and presents a case for social interaction as a <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control. We analyze agency cognitions in comparative survey data generated in 2001, 2006 and 2012 among farmers and small business owners in Finland (n = 2771). Results show that interaction <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control correlated positively with personal control, self-efficacy and internal <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control, but unlike the latter variables, it did not have negative correlations with <b>external</b> <b>loci</b> <b>of</b> control. Furthermore, belief in interaction <b>locus</b> <b>of</b> control was significantly stronger among small business owners than among farmers, corresponding to the difference between groups in believing in one's agency in business. Our analysis demonstrates the importance <b>of</b> interactive <b>loci</b> <b>of</b> control in entrepreneurship. For entrepreneurs, agency is embedded in the processes of social relationships.
