5000|$|The {{group is}} called {{out on a}} mission to stop Captain Sludge (Jon Polito) a {{diminutive}} super villain with powers of super speed and his minotaur minion, and in a show of panic, Gruberman prays for help. Thinking he has the power of [...] "Prayer" [...] Will sends him out to fight and he supposedly forces a lamppost to fall onto the minotaur, allowing the heroes to be victorious and earning Felicia's eye. However, Gruberman's world begins to fall apart, when he and Brainard attempt to follow the suspicious judge incognito, and Ed is set up for stealing millions in Gold Bullion and sending them to a Swiss Bank account, which the number was found conveniently in his pocket. He is sent to visit the Judge, Red, his accomplice makes an appearance who reveals that the Judge is the Dark Winged Vesper. The Judge reveals himself to be Gruberman's father AND, and that the stunt that killed his parents was orchestrated by him, (but not intended to be fatal). He attempts to lure Gruberman to the dark side (a'la Return of the Jedi). Gruberman manages to escape, and in an ensuing chase with Sludge, he drives the RV off the Mount Rushmore national monument, and when telling God that he will soon be with him, the vehicle reaches 88 miles per hour, sending him back to the date of his first mission 1 week prior (as Will Powers had put the date into the time circuits to mark the event). He travels to the bridge, and learns that should he encounter his past self (before that he saw the judge and imitates the voice of Vito Corleone and the catchphrase [...] "it was not personal, it was only business"), one of them would spontaneously combust. He manages to meet the Super Capers, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of revealing the Judge's plans encounters his younger self. After giving away the events to follow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> <b>ahead,</b> <b>the</b> Judge is arrested and Sludge and his minotaur surrender while Red is defeated and Freeze admits her attraction to Gruberman. The confusion of two Grubermans is resolved, however when the past version combusts, leaving only the one from the future and the day appears to be saved. The Judge, however, escapes in a post-credits scene.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the preparation {{and preservation of}} human amniotic membrane required for transplantation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> management of ocular surface diseases. Informed consent is obtained and the donor is screened to exclude risk of transmissible infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and Treponema pallidum infections. Ideally, the media and washing solutions needed for the preparation of amniotic membrane are prepared only a week to 10 days prior to use and not stored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> freezer <b>weeks</b> <b>ahead.</b> <b>The</b> AM obtained under sterile conditions after elective caesarian section is washed free of blood clots and chorion. With the epithelial surface up, amniotic membrane is spread uniformly without folds or tears on individually sterilized 0. 22 &#x 0026;# 956;m nitrocellulose membranes of the required sizes. The prepared filter membrane with the adherent amniotic membrane is placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preservative medium and stored at - 80 &#x 00 B 0;C. The membranes are released when the repeat serology for HIV after the window period has excluded virus infection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> donor. Depending on consumption they may be used up to 6 months after preparation, though many have recommended storage for an indefinite period. Since the amniotic membrane has only incomplete expression of HLA antigens and amniotic epithelial cells do not express them, it is not rejected after transplantation. The presence of several cytokines <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amniotic membrane promotes epithelialization with reduction of fibrosis during healing...|$|R
500|$|For the French, the {{survival}} of the Corps Mortier seemed nothing short of a miracle. The remainder of Gazan's division crossed the river the next morning and eventually recuperated <b>in</b> Vienna, which <b>the</b> French acquired by deception later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> month. More importantly for them, the French force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions. Initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one French battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft. They had lost control of <b>the</b> boats <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at Krems, overturning their boats. Tossed into the icy river, most had drowned. Despite this initial panic, Gazan's column retained its cohesion, and responded well to various difficult demands. Dupont had demonstrated his tactical acumen: when he heard cannon fire, he directed his troops toward it to support <b>the</b> French division. <b>In</b> terms of French staffing, Mortier's failure to guard his flank, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of Napoleon's direct advice, adversely influenced his relationship with his commander. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate <b>weeks</b> <b>ahead,</b> <b>the</b> flamboyant Murat did more to annoy Napoleon than Mortier had. <b>In</b> assessing <b>the</b> battle and its aftermath, historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on Mortier and Gazan: [...] "Napoleon, aware of Mortier's danger and his own culpability for it, vented his frustration on Murat, whom he unjustly accused of abandoning Mortier for the empty glory of riding through Vienna." ...|$|R
40|$|So let me explore {{with you}} why my {{judgment}} {{on this score}} proved inaccurate. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> proverbial nutshell, whatever happens <b>in</b> Washington <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weeks</b> and months <b>ahead,</b> <b>the</b> United States is fated for the indefinite future to conduct a prolonged and difficult national debate on health care. The reason for this protracted and arduous argument can be summarized in a single word: cost. Yet, paradoxically, the rhetoric of unspecified cost reduction is used to avoid the painful choices needed to prune health care outlays, choices that inevitably involve agonizing denials of medical services {{in a world of}} finite resources. Medical costs cannot be controlled without denying something to somebody. Yet, paradoxically, the term “cost” is used in contemporary political discourse to avoid the difficult choices involved in such denials. It is easier to favor unspecified cost reductions, than to identify particular service denials that would actually reduce medical care expenditures. Elected officials are reluctant to deny medical services to cut costs, but health care costs cannot be meaningfully controlled without such service denials...|$|R
