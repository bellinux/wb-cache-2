5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential <b>for</b> <b>periods</b> of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{the study}} is aimed to {{introduce}} the developing history of gynecology and gynecological nursing in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Study Design: the development of gynecology and gynecological nursing consists of six periods in Chinese history. They are: 1) budding stage represented by the inscriptions of Nü (female) on oracle bones; 2) physiological development stages of women; 3) specialized chapters of gynecology in TCM; 4) features of gynecological nursing; 5) monograph of gynecology and gynecological nursing; 6) integration of ancient gynecological nursing perceptions. Results: TCM has a profound understanding of gynecology and gynecological nursing. <b>For</b> <b>period</b> one, the inscriptions of Nü (female) on oracle bones is {{the symbol of the}} budding stage. <b>For</b> <b>period</b> two, physiogenesis stages of women are recorded in The Yellow Emperor of Classics of Inner Medicine. <b>For</b> <b>period</b> three, the specialized chapters of gynecology appeared, represented by Golden Chamber, Woman. <b>For</b> <b>period</b> four, the features of gynecological nursing were elaborated in Essential Prescriptions Worth A Thousand Gold including menstruation, depression, yin-dampness, and menopause. <b>For</b> <b>period</b> five, monographs of gynecology and gynecological nursing represented by Good Comprehensive Woman Formulae appeared. <b>For</b> <b>period</b> six, Integrative studies of gynecological nursing perceptions were carried out with the representation by Integrated Ancient and Modern Books. Conclusion: TCM gynecology and gynecological nursing harbors a long history of treating and nursing gynecological disorders. With therapeutic and nursing modalities, they are effective systems of un-derstanding and managing woman health as proven by medical literatures, clinical benefits and basic research studies...|$|R

5|$|Due to {{scarcity}} of water, the Namib Desert Horse sometimes goes without water {{for as long}} as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter, significantly longer than most horses, even other feral herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a second study showed that the physiological water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated <b>for</b> <b>periods</b> of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a common occurrence in their feral state.|$|E
