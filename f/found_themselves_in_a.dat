5|$|On 18 December 1944 Massachusetts and {{the other}} ships of TF 38 {{unexpectedly}} <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fight for their lives when Typhoon Cobra overtook the force. At {{the time of the}} typhoon Massachusetts was sailing with the Third Fleet's Task Group 38.1 and reported one injured sailor and two planes lost {{as a result of the}} typhoon.|$|E
5|$|The French {{followed}} after Kutuzov, {{but soon}} <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> difficult position. Prussian intentions were unknown {{and could be}} hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that {{to capitalize on the}} success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.|$|E
5|$|In a 35–3 {{victory against}} the Cincinnati Bengals, Manning threw three {{touchdown}} passes while completing 26-of-32 passes for 277 yards. It marked the 11th straight season Manning had thrown at least 20 touchdown passes, the second longest streak ever. Against the 0–13 Detroit Lions, the Colts <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 21–21 game in the 4th quarter. Manning led his sixth game-winning drive {{of the season and}} the Colts pulled away 31–21. It marked their seventh straight win, seventh straight season with 10+ wins, and they became the only team in NFL history to have a winning streak of at least seven games in five straight seasons. Manning completed 28-of-37 passes for 318 yards and one touchdown.|$|E

60|$|The {{members of}} the Syndicate now <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{embarrassing}} and dangerous position--a position {{in which they were}} placed by the universal incredulity regarding the instantaneous motor; and unless they could make the world believe that they really used such a motor-bomb, the war could not be prosecuted on the plan projected.|$|R
50|$|The Redeemers {{eventually}} <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> all-out {{battle against}} the remaining Squadron members at Squadron City. During this battle, Lamprey tried to absorb the power of Doctor Spectrum, {{who was able to}} overload Lamprey's energy absorbing capacity. Lamprey exploded when he tried to absorb all of the energy of Doctor Spectrum's power prism.|$|R
5|$|The {{general strike}} of 1950 {{began in the}} coal mining centres of Hainaut and quickly spread. Workers were soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, to a lesser extent, Flanders. The port of Antwerp {{was one of the}} key sites {{affected}} and the country was virtually paralysed. On 30 July, four workers were shot dead by the Gendarmerie at Grâce-Berleur, near Liège and the violence intensified. Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> minority, even in the PSC–CVP. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Government threatened to resign en masse.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} sudden {{appearance}} of the overwhelming Chinese forces, the ROK 1st Infantry Division tried to establish defensive positions by capturing the hills around Unsan. The South Koreans soon <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> seesaw battle with the PVA 360th Regiment during the night of 25 October. The next day, the PVA 39th Corps arrived at the west of Unsan while cutting the road between Unsan and Yongsan-dong, completely surrounding the ROK 1st Infantry Division. Aided by airdrops, the US 6th Medium Tank Battalion and the US 10th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group, the ROK 1st Infantry Division reopened the road on 27 October. Several more attempts to advance north by the Koreans made little progress, and the fighting stopped by 28 October.|$|E
5|$|In April 2006, MNM {{were placed}} in an angle in which they <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> losing streak against the team of Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In non-title tag team matches, singles matches, and even a six-man tag match, London and Kendrick {{defeated}} the duo every time. At the Judgment Day pay-per-view in May 2006, MNM lost the tag team championship to London and Kendrick. After the match, Nitro and Mercury started brawling, disbanding the group. Later that night, Melina lost a singles match against Jillian Hall and after slapping General Manager Theodore Long in anger, she and Nitro were fired from the SmackDown! brand in storyline. Off-screen, Nitro and Mercury did not get along, and WWE management decided to split the tag team and send Nitro and Melina to the Raw brand. In addition, Mercury {{was about to begin}} serving a suspension for violating the WWE Wellness program.|$|E

6000|$|... “Coast Line Express!” was the cry {{at one of}} the {{numerous}} gates to the tracks, and thither the party hurried. Willing porters took their baggage, and a minute later they <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> elegant Pullman car. Dunston Porter had telegraphed ahead for sleeping accommodations, and they had two double seats opposite each other, directly {{in the middle of the}} car.|$|R
50|$|U-221 only sank one ship on this patrol, Sandanger; the {{survivors}} had a remarkable escape. Occupying the only intact lifeboat, they <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{area of low pressure}} {{created by the}} ship's burning fuel cargo. The flames were split in two by strong winds which also kept them above the men's heads by only a few feet as they rowed clear of the location.|$|R
5|$|In Gortyn, in Crete, {{according}} to a code engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BC, slaves (doulos or oikeus) <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master. The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others. In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, the rape of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 staters (400 drachms), while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).|$|E
5|$|Some foreign volunteers had no {{military}} experience and <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar situation to the Rhodesian teenagers. These foreigners were generally motivated to enlist by anti-communist political views, hunger for adventure, turbulent personal lives {{in their home}} countries or some combination of these factors. The Canadian Mathew Charles Lamb joined 3 Commando, RLI in 1973, having just spent six years in a psychiatric hospital. In June 1966, aged 18, he had killed two strangers in a shooting spree in his home-town, but avoided the death penalty on a court ruling {{that at the time of}} the incident he had been insane. Keeping his past life a secret, he became a popular and well-regarded soldier in 3 Commando, and eventually rose to the rank of Lance-Corporal, taking command of a Fireforce stick on Operation Thrasher shortly before he was killed in action on 7 November 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd (Lahore) Division's 7th and 8th Brigades {{began their}} advance at 05:00. The 7th Brigade's 91st Punjabis (Light Infantry) began their advance towards 'Azzun, while the 8th Brigade moved along the Wadi 'Azzun. As the 1st Battalion Manchester Regiment moved {{along the south}} bank, and the 47th Sikhs moved along on the north bank, with the 59th Scinde Rifles in the rear; they quickly <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{critical}} position. The leading battalions encountered about 200 German soldiers and 12 machine guns in a well-sited rearguard position south of the wadi. Without any artillery support, an extended battle followed. The 59th Scinde Rifles were ordered to join the fight and a howitzer was rushed forward from the 428th Battery, coming into effective action at 12:30, when resistance almost immediately ceased.|$|E

6000|$|... "We're <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shower, lad, {{even though}} we are underground," [...] remarked Leroy. [...] "I must say I hope this don't last. If it does, we'll soon be wet to the skin." [...] The vaulted cave soon came to an end, however, and now they <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> opening cut up into a hundred {{different}} chambers, like a coal mine supported by arches. Each looked at the other in perplexity.|$|R
50|$|These differing stances did {{not remain}} on the {{declarative}} level alone. With no second UN resolution forthcoming, the UK, along with Spain, Poland, Italy, and the Netherlands, committed troops to the invasion of Iraq. The war thus proceeded without the second UN resolution desired by the UK and with the open opposition of France and Germany. These latter countries <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unlikely alliance with Russia over the war.|$|R
5|$|The {{next morning}} the Australians sent out patrols and as they probed forward through the dense bamboo it became {{apparent}} to them that the Japanese had established themselves in strength along a ridge line that stretched off to a position called Peak Hill. In response to the Australian patrols, the Japanese raked the jungle with machine gun fire to which the Australians responded by calling in an artillery and mortar bombardment. As the sun began to set, the Japanese launched a quick attack on the lead Australian company, forcing them back. In order to regain the initiative, the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion launched a night attack, which, although supported by very accurate artillery fire from the 2/12th Field Regiment, proved unsuccessful. As {{a result of the}} failed attack, in the morning the Australians <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position overlooked by the Japanese. Throughout the day, both sides exchanged sniper fire and the Australians had to re-route their supply lines after they came under fire from the high ground. A company from the 2/24th was released from their portage tasks and were brought up to bolster the 2/23rd, taking up a position to the south in close proximity. During the night, however, the Japanese began to encircle the Australian position. In response, the company from the 2/24th moved to link up with the 2/23rd. Just short of the position, their advance was checked when they came under heavy fire; the Australians eventually managed to send out a patrol which outflanked the Japanese positions and linked up with the 2/23rd.|$|E

25|$|The Carpenters <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unusual {{alliance}} with {{a coalition of}} other craft unions in Hollywood, the Conference of Studio Unions, led by Herbert Sorrell of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. After a long and drawn out strike caused by a divide and conquer strategy of the producers, CSU found itself forced out of Hollywood, leaving the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees as the primary representative of back lot crafts.|$|R
2500|$|Council members {{suddenly}} <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> inconvenient {{position of}} [...] "a state authority rather than His Majesty's chancery".

50|$|By August 1916 the Central Powers <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{increasingly}} difficult military situation - in the West the German offensive at Verdun {{had turned into}} a costly battle of attrition, in the East the Brusilov Offensive was crippling the Austro-Hungarian Army, and in the South the Italian Army was increasing the pressure on the Austro-Hungarians, while General Sarrail's Allied expeditionary force in northern Greece seemed poised for a major offensive against the Bulgarian Army.|$|R
25|$|Once they arrived, they <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> country {{devastated by}} war. Housing {{shortages}} lasted until the 1960s, which {{along with other}} shortages led to conflicts with the local population. The situation eased only with the West German economic boom in the 1950s that drove unemployment rates close to zero.|$|E
25|$|Gregory {{would have}} been nearby, in the House of Commons, at Westminster, {{when his father was}} arrested and must have hastily sent word to his wife Elizabeth, who was at court {{attending}} Queen Anne.

25|$|The 1904 {{club was}} {{almost as good as}} the {{previous}} year's team, but due to the emergence of the New York Highlanders as a strong contender, the Americans <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tight pennant race through the last games of the season. Foreshadowing what would eventually become a storied rivalry, the 1904 race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for Bob Unglaub.|$|E

60|$|The {{two boys}} <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{irregular}} {{opening of the}} rocks, fifty feet wide and perhaps twice that in length. On one side was the smooth slope down which they had come; on the other a dark hole {{that looked as if}} it might lead to some bottomless pit. <b>A</b> jagged rock <b>in</b> the center of the underground chamber had been the means of stopping them from dropping to the unknown depths below them.|$|R
25|$|The layouts of both {{floors of}} “Maxim’s” have been preserved.

25|$|At the XIVth Conference of the Communist Party in April 1925, Zinoviev and Kamenev <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{minority}} {{when their}} motion to specify that socialism {{could only be}} achieved internationally was rejected, resulting in the triumvirate of recent years breaking up. At this time, Stalin was moving more and more into a political alliance with Nikolai Bukharin and the Right Opposition, with Bukharin having elaborated on Stalin's Socialism in One Country policy, giving it a theoretical justification.|$|E
25|$|When peace {{returned}} to Europe, Blackpool <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stronger position {{than before the}} intervention of war, even with the sales of Jock Dodds to Shamrock Rovers and Hugh O'Donnell to Rochdale. Manager Joe Smith gathered around him {{some of the most}} talented footballers in the country, {{and with the help of}} Stan Mortensen's 28 goals, the team finished the 1946–47 season in fifth position, by far the highest final position that they had achieved up to that point.|$|E

50|$|Since 2006, {{the archaeologists}} {{working for the}} Merowe Dam Archaeological Salvage Project became accused by {{environmental}} and human rights activists {{as well as the}} representatives of the affected people of facilitating the political legitimatization of the project. The archaeologists working for the dam project <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ethical dilemma since they were undertaking salvage excavations while the local people were in opposition to the building of the dam that necessitates both their resettlement and the archaeological campaign.|$|R

The resulting album was named Colours You Can Hear and only 100 copies were made.|$|R
