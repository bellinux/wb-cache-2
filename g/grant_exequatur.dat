50|$|Philip II's decree was {{provoked}} by the Sardinian parliament, the Stamenti, which requested a local {{court for the}} more prompt administration of justice, since at the time Sardinians {{had to go to}} the Supreme Council of Aragon to make an appeal. A second decree of 3 March 1573 gave concrete organisation to the nascent institution. Designed on the audiencias of Aragon and Catalonia, initially it heard civil and criminal cases brought by those exempt from ecclesial and baronial courts. Gradually it usurped authority over these, and even came to exercise viceregal authority when the post was vacant and to <b>grant</b> <b>exequatur</b> for ecclesiastical acts.|$|E

50|$|A {{declaration}} of nullity made by the Catholic Church is distinct from a civil divorce. A civil divorce may serve as proof for the ecclesiastical tribunal that the marriage community cannot be rebuilt. In some countries, such as Italy, in which Catholic Church marriages are automatically transcribed to the civil records, a Church {{declaration of}} nullity may be <b>granted</b> the <b>exequatur</b> and treated as {{the equivalent of a}} civil divorce.|$|R
50|$|The Superior Court of Justice (Superior Tribunal de Justiça) is the Brazilian {{highest court}} in non-constitutional issues {{concerning}} both states and Federal ordinary courts. It grants the Special Appeal (Recurso Especial) when a judgement {{of a court}} of second instance offends a federal statute disposition or when two or more second instance courts make different rulings on the same federal statute. Other roles include deciding over most jurisdiction conflicts and <b>granting</b> the <b>exequatur</b> to foreign judicial decisions.|$|R
50|$|The United States <b>granted</b> the <b>exequatur.</b> Gallatin {{advised the}} Diet {{on how to}} divide the {{territory}} to be administered by the two new consuls. De Rham assumed responsibility for a district encompassing the New England states, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and the states north of the Ohio River. Cazenove managed {{the remainder of the}} United States. Their main charge was to protect the interests and property of Swiss immigrants and traveler, particularly merchants. Both performed their duties in an honorary capacity outside of their regular business, with de Rham serving until 1842 and Cazenove until 1852. The latter's responsibilities in his later service became increasingly diplomatic.|$|R
50|$|Rota succeeded Bishop Giovanni Corti in Mantua, {{a liberal}} who had {{strongly}} supported {{the unification of}} Italy and hoped that the Pope would voluntarily give up his temporal powers. Corti had died three years earlier, {{and it had been}} difficult to find a successor.Rota had the mandate of restoring the diocese to order and orthodoxy, and used strong language - so strong that the civil authorities jailed him for six days and imposed a fine.Pietro Rota was not <b>granted</b> the <b>exequatur</b> from the civil authorities, and therefore was not allowed to reside in the bishop's palace.The authorities closed the seminary in Mantua.Rota founded the periodical Il Vessillo Cattolico (The Catholic Banner), which was published from 1872 to 1876.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} specific quesitons {{in relation}} to the arbitral award. A first question dealt with, concerned the consequences and effects an arbitral award may have before a state court <b>grants</b> it <b>exequatur.</b> Two sub-questions are discussed : whether such award may have res judicata, and, if yes, what consequences may follow from the res judicata and second whether provisional measures may be ordered {{on the basis of the}} award before the <b>exequatur</b> is <b>granted.</b> In a second chapter, attention is devoted to the seminal question of the possibility to enforce an award which has been annulled. This is done by exploring the effects of a request for annulment on the effects of an award and then discussing the consequences the annulment proper may have on the award. Finally, the position of the award debtor is also discussed {{in relation to}} enforcement proceedings. In particular, the possibility for the debtor to file a negative declaratory action and to request to be joined in enforcement proceedings are discussed...|$|R
