Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology utilizing frequency band of 3. 168 GHz ? 10. 6 GHz is an emerging solution to this with data rates of 110, 200 and 480 Mbps. Initially, UWB mode I devices using only 3. 168 GHz ? 4. 752 GHz have been proposed. Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) and I-Q mixers are key components constituting the RF front-end. Performance of these blocks is very critical to the overall performance of the receiver. In general, main considerations for the LNA are low noise, 50 broadband input matching, high <b>gain</b> with maximum <b>flatness</b> and good linearity. For the mixers, it is essential to attain low flicker noise performance coupled with good conversion gain. Proposed LNA architecture is a derivative of inductive source degenerated topology. Broadband matching at the LNA output is achieved using LC band-pass filter. To obtain high <b>gain</b> with maximum <b>flatness,</b> an LC band-pass filter is used at its output.

Also we have investigated the effects of many parameters on the gain and bandwidth of Raman amplifier such as: pumping wavelength, offset wavelength, the relative refractive index difference and the number and location of the cascaded units used in the amplifier model design. The gain is computed over the spectral optical wavelengths (1. 45 μm ≤ λ signal ≤ 1. 65 μm).

In [12], WLP was shown to outperform conventional LP in terms of resolving adjacent peaks in the signal spectrum, however, no <b>gain</b> in spectral <b>flatness</b> of the LP residual was obtained. We will review the SLP and WLP models, as well as three other LP models {{that appear to be}} suited for tonal audio signals, and show how all of these models are capable of solving the frequency distribution issue described above. More specifically, we will also consider high-order all-pole models [22], constrained pole-zero models [24, 25, 31 – 37], and pitch prediction models. Pitch prediction (PLP), also known as long-term prediction, was originally proposed for speech modeling and coding, and was more recently applied to audio signal modeling {{in the context of the}} MPEG- 4 advanced audio coder (AAC)[*][*][38, 39]. High-order (HOLP) and pole-zero (PZLP) linear prediction models have not been applied to audio modeling before, however, some speech analysis techniques rely on a PZLP model [40 – 42]. All considered approaches result in stable LP models, and some outperform the WLP model both in terms of conventional measures, such as frequency estimation error and residual spectral flatness [43, Chapter 6], and in terms of perceptually motivated measures, such as interpeak dip depth (IDD) [12]. Moreover, many of these alternative models perform even better when cascaded with a conventional LP model. The LP models described in this paper were evaluated and compared experimentally for a synthetic audio signal in [44]. This work is extended here by also performing a mathematical analysis of the different LP models, and describing additional simulation results for synthetic signals and true monophonic and polyphonic audio signals.|$|R
