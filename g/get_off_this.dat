500|$|Black onlookers in {{the area}} of Kelly Ingram Park {{abandoned}} nonviolence on May 5. Spectators taunted police, and SCLC leaders begged them to be peaceful or go home. James Bevel borrowed a bullhorn from the police and shouted, [...] "Everybody <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>this</b> corner. If you're not going to demonstrate in a nonviolent way, then leave!" [...] Commissioner Connor was overheard saying, [...] "If you'd ask half of them what freedom means, they couldn't tell you." [...] To prevent further marches, Connor ordered the doors to the churches blocked to prevent students from leaving.|$|E
500|$|Juliet {{explains}} that Ethan kept {{a stash of}} the serum at a nearby drop point. She goes out into the jungle and retrieves the serum, but Sayid and Sawyer have followed her, and they want answers. Juliet tells them there is no time, and realizing {{they are not going}} to budge, she stands up to them and says she finds it interesting that they are the camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he will not be able to protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>this</b> island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Another media {{incident}} started {{during the}} New Hampshire primary September 27, 2003, when Clark {{was asked by}} space shuttle astronaut Jay C. Buckey what his vision for the space program was after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. Clark responded {{he was a great}} believer in the exploration of space but wanted a vision well beyond that of a new shuttle or space plane. [...] "I would like to see mankind <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>this</b> planet. I'd like to know what's out there beyond the solar system." [...] Clark thought such a vision could probably require a lifetime of research and development in various fields of science and technology. Then {{at the end of his}} remarks, Clark dropped a bombshell when he said [...] "I still believe in [...] But I can't believe that in all of human history we'll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go. I happen to believe that mankind can do it. I've argued with physicists about it. I've argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It's my only faith-based initiative." [...] These comments prompted a series of derisive headlines, such as [...] "Beam Us Up, General Clark" [...] in The New York Times, [...] "Clark is Light-Years Ahead of the Competition" [...] in The Washington Post, [...] "General Relativity (Retired)" [...] on the U.S. News & World Report website, and [...] "Clark Campaigns at Light Speed" [...] in Wired magazine.|$|E

60|$|Whereupon, I presume, {{one would}} first ask, have we {{any chance of}} <b>getting</b> <b>off</b> <b>this</b> ball of ours, and getting on {{to one of those}} finer ones?

6000|$|The {{people on}} board the yacht, who watched eagerly the first sail they had seen since they had been ashore on that deserted part of the coast, soon made her out, with some disappointment, {{to be a small}} {{merchant}} brig beating up tack for tack along the inner edge of the reef--probably with the intention to communicate and offer assistance. The general opinion among the seafaring portion of her crew was that little effective assistance could be expected from a vessel of that description. Only the sailing-master of the yacht remarked to the boatswain (who had the advantage of being his first cousin): [...] "This man is well acquainted here; you can see that by the way he handles his brig. I shan't be sorry to have somebody to stand by us. Can't tell when we will <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>this</b> mud, George." ...|$|E
60|$|Nothing happened. For {{hours and}} hours I sat there, with {{frequent}} intermissions away from my hard, rocky seat. Toward the close of afternoon, when the wind began to get cold, I saw that R.C. had left his stand. He had undoubtedly gone back to camp, which was some miles nearer his stand than mine. At last I gave up any hope of hearing either the hounds or the horn, as the roar of wind had increased. Once I thought I heard a distant rifle shot. So I got on my horse {{and set out to}} find camp. I was on a promontory, the sides of which were indented by long ravines that were impassable except near their heads. In fact I had been told there was only one narrow space where it was possible to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>this</b> promontory. Lucky indeed that I remembered Haught telling of this! Anyway I soon found myself lost in a maze of forested heads of ravines. Finally I went back to the rim on the west side, and then working along I found our horse-tracks. These I followed, with difficulty, and after an hour's travel I crossed the narrow neck of the promontory, and back-tracked myself to camp, arriving there at sunset.|$|E

5000|$|On November 13, 1977, two girls, twelve-year-old Dolores Ann [...] "Dolly" [...] Cepeda and fourteen-year-old Sonja Marie Johnson, {{boarded a}} school bus from St. Ignatius School and headed home. The last time they were seen was <b>getting</b> <b>off</b> <b>this</b> bus and {{approaching}} a two-tone sedan which reportedly had two men inside. The two corpses were found by a nine-year-old boy who had been treasure hunting in a trash heap on the hillside near Dodger Stadium, on November 20, 1977. Both of the girls' bodies {{had already begun to}} decompose, but it was still determined that they had been strangled and raped.|$|R

60|$|At {{the amount}} of food which a man can <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>this</b> little patch I dare not guess. Well says Humboldt, that an European lately arrived in the torrid zone is struck with nothing so much as the extreme {{smallness}} of the spots under cultivation round a cabin which contains a numerous family. The plantains alone ought, according to Humboldt, to give one hundred and thirty-three times as much food as the same space of ground sown with wheat, and forty-four times as much as if it grew potatoes. True, the plantain is by no means as nourishing as wheat: which reduces the actual difference between their value per acre to twenty-five to one. But under his plantains he can grow other vegetables. He has no winter, and therefore some crop or other is always coming forward. From whence it comes, that, as I just hinted, his wife and children seem to have always something to eat in their mouths, if it be only the berries and nuts which abound in every hedge and wood. Neither dare I guess at the profit which he might make, and I hope will some day make, out of his land, if he would cultivate somewhat more for exportation, and not merely for home consumption. If any one wishes to know more on this matter, let him consult the catalogue of contributions from British Guiana to the London Exhibition of 1862; especially the pages from lix. to lxviii. on the starch-producing plants of the West Indies.|$|E
6000|$|Free mercy, utter pardon, pardon for all, {{even for}} the worst. And what is the {{argument}} which Isaiah uses to make his countrymen repent? Is it [...] "Repent, or you shall be damned: Repent because God's wrath and curse is against you. The Lord hates you and despises you, and you must crawl to His feet like beaten hounds, and entreat Him not to strike you into hell as He intends"? Not so; it was because God loved the Jews, {{that they were to}} repent. It is because God loves you that you must repent. [...] "Incline your ear," [...] saith the Lord, [...] "and come unto me, hear, and your soul shall live; and you shall eat that which is good, and your soul shall delight itself in fatness." [...] Yes, God is love. God's delight and glory is to give; in spite of all our sins He gives and gives, sending rain and fruitful seasons to just and unjust, to fill their hearts with joy and gladness; and all the while men fancy that it is not God that gives, but they who take. God has not left Himself, as St. Paul says, without a witness; every fruitful shower and quickening gleam of sunshine cries to us--See! God is love: He is the giver. And men will not hear that voice. They say in their hearts, [...] "The Lord is far away above the skies; He does not care for us: we must help ourselves, each man to what he can <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>this</b> earth; nay, even, when we are hard put to it for a living, we must break God's laws to keep ourselves alive, and so steal from God's table the very good things which He offers us freely." ...|$|E
