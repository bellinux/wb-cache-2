40|$|The {{progress}} of any creative discipline changes significantly {{with the quality}} of the tools available. As the diversity of user <b>interfaces</b> <b>multiplies</b> in the shift away from personal desktop computing, yesterday’s tools and concepts are insufficient to serve the designers of tomorrow’s interfaces. My research in human-computer interaction focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of authoring environments for novel user interfaces. My dissertation research is concerned with the earliest stages in ui creation- activities that take a novel idea and transform it into a concrete, interactive artifact that can be experienced, tested, and compared against other ideas. The dissertation addresses two research questions: How can tools enable a wider range of designers to create functional prototypes of ubiquitous computing interfaces? And how can design tools support the larger process of learning from these prototypes? improving how prototypes are built Prototyping is the fundamental activity that structures innovation in design. While prototyping tools are now common for graphical user interfaces o...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a Lagrange {{multiplier}} method for the finite element solution of elliptic partial di#erential equations using domain decomposition with non-matching meshes. The <b>interface</b> Lagrange <b>multiplier</b> is discretized by means of global polynomials, {{in order to avoid the}} cumbersome integration of products of unrelated mesh functions. The ideas are illustrated using Poisson's equation as a model, and the proposed method is shown to be stable and optimally convergent. Numerical experiments demonstrating the theoretical results are also presented...|$|R

This is still {{less than half of}} the 68 grid functions which a brute-force approach would yield. The need for efficient storage management becomes apparent when we consider that the metric is required in the barycenter as well as on the <b>interfaces,</b> thus <b>multiplying</b> the required grid functions by a factor of four for three-dimensional simulations (yielding 116 grid functions in the KS case).|$|R

40|$|The {{peptides}} {{released from}} beta-casein by {{the action of}} PI-type proteinase (PrtP) from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg 2 have been identified by on-line coupling of liquid chromatography to mass spectrometry. After 24 h of incubation of beta-casein with purified PrtP, a stable mixture of peptides was obtained. The trifluoroacetic acid-soluble peptides of this beta-casein hydrolysate were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography and introduced into the liquid chromatography-ion spray mass spectrometry <b>interface.</b> <b>Multiply</b> charged ions were generated from trifluoroacetic acid-soluble peptides under low nozzle voltage conditions, yielding the MH+ mass of each eluted peptide. All peptides corresponding to each of the MH+ calculated masses were determined. In those cases in which different peptides were possible, further identification was achieved by collision-induced dissociation under higher nozzle voltage conditions. Hydrolysis of beta-casein by PrtP was observed to proceed much further than reported previously. More than 40 % of the peptide bonds are cleaved by PrtP, resulting in the formation of more than 100 different oligopeptides. With the exception of Phe, significant release of amino acids or di- and tripeptides could not be observed. Interestingly, one-fifth of the identified oligopeptides are small enough to be taken up by the oligopeptide transport system. Uptake of these peptides could supply L. lactis with all amino acids, including the essential ones, indicating that growth of L. lactis might be possible on peptides released from beta-casein by proteinase only...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{lays the}} {{necessary}} groundwork {{for measuring the}} complexity of systems architecture models. We propose a set of complexity measures, which are usable with models defined using the Object-Process Model (OPM). In order to do this, we introduce a new concept of <b>interface</b> complexity <b>multiplier</b> for compensating the hidden information at interfaces. We also define a set of complexity metrics for system architecture models. We also develop models for three different systems for mobile entertainment. The purpose of these models is to show how OPM is suitable for modeling such systems and also to provide some comparative material for complexity measurements. We use the new metrics to determine {{the complexity of the}} models of mobile entertainment systems. The thesis also contains a rigorous definition of complexity and a survey of existing complexity measurement methods. by Matti J. Kinnunen. Thesis (S. M.)

2500|$|ESI {{interface}} for LC-MS systems {{was developed}} by Fenn and collaborators in 1988. This ion source/ interface [...] {{can be used for}} the analysis of moderately polar molecules (e.g., metabolites, xenobiotics, and peptides). The liquid eluate coming out of the LC column is pumped through a metal capillary kept at 3 to 5 kV. The liquid is nebulized {{at the tip of the}} capillary and a fine spray of charged droplets is formed. To avoid contamination, this capillary is usually perpendicularly located at the inlet of the MS system. The heat created by the electric potential is used to rapidly evaporate the droplets in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Later, the ionized analytes are transferred into the high vacuum chamber of the MS as the charged ions flow through a series of small apertures with the aid of focusing voltages. Positively and negatively charged ions can be detected and it is possible to switch between the negative and positive modes of operation. Most ions produced in the ESI <b>interface</b> are <b>multiply</b> charged. The use of 1–3nbsp&mm ID microbore columns is recommended for LC-MS systems using electrospray ionization (ESI) interfaces because optimal operation [...] is achieved with flow rates in the 50-200 μl/min range.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of {{graphical user interfaces}} in a computerized work environment is often considered to substantially improve the work situation. The outcome is, however, very often the opposite. The possibilities for bad design and inefficient user <b>interfaces</b> are <b>multiplied</b> {{with the help of}} windowing techniques, scrolling and colours. However, the now established de facto standards and complementary style guides have meant a step forward towards improved quality of user interfaces. They are helpful for basic design but prove to be insufficient for design decisions concerning higher abstraction layers. Here detailed domain knowledge is absolutely essential for the design of efficient user interfaces. It is almost impossible for a designer to be an expert in even one single domain. Therefore domain knowledge must be obtained from the real domain experts, i. e. from the professionals performing the work. To accomplish this we have used methods based on detailed analysis of work activities, analysis of information utilization and user expectations. The design of a user interface must always be based on an analysis of both the work situation as such and of the users working there, mainly focused on the involved cognitive processes. Our work is concentrated on the design of the interface and the resulting requirements on style guides and user interface components...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFretting fatigue is a {{critical}} load that appears on many structures, such as the blade/disk contact of aircraft engines, train wheel assemblies, etc. Predicting crack nucleation risk is essential for safety, but is particularly complex. Fretting contact stress is multiaxial, with severe stress gradients. To palliate this difficulty, a common approach consists in computing multiaxial fatigue at {{a critical}} distance, thus correcting the stress gradient effect and achieving stable pertinent predictions. However, this strategy is very costly in FEM computation due to very fine FEM mesh size, which may be < 10 μm, and application needs to be limited in large 3 D industrial contacts. Investigating the partial slip fretting crack nucleation boundaries of 35 NCD 16 steel (plane) fretted against 52100 steel cylinders, a new semi-empirical contact loading parameter was introduced, defined as the maximum shear stress generated in the <b>interface</b> (qmax) <b>multiplied</b> by the square-root of the sliding size (s) of the partial slip interface (i. e., ϕ = qmax ×√s). Using this very simple parameter inspired by “crack analog strategy”, {{it was found that}} all the crack nucleation data obtained for a wide spectrum of contact pressures and cylinder radii were aligned along a single master curve. Scatter was very low, even less than for the costly “fatigue-critical distance method”. The approach was extended to various fretting-fatigue loading conditions, confirming stability of prediction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a hybridized formulation for the weak Galerkin {{finite element method}} for the biharmonic equation based on the discrete weak Hessian recently proposed by the authors. The hybridized weak Galerkin scheme {{is based on the}} use of a Lagrange multiplier defined on the element <b>interfaces.</b> The Lagrange <b>multiplier</b> is verified to provide a numerical approximation for certain derivatives of the exact solution. An error estimate of optimal order is established for the numerical approximations arising from the hybridized weak Galerkin finite element method. The paper also derives a computational algorithm (Schur complement) by eliminating all the unknowns associated with the interior variables on each element, yielding a significantly reduced system of linear equations for unknowns on the element interfaces.

40|$|On October 24 th, 1998, the Deep Space One (DS- 1) {{spacecraft}} launched {{aboard a}} Delta II rocket {{as the first}} step towards the bold task of testing and validating 12 new technologies for future missions. This launch also represented yet another thrilling event; namely, the successful test and validation of a 13 th heretofore undisclosed technology: model-based code-generation of the spacecraft's system-level fault-protection (FP) software from behavioral state diagrams and structural models. In this paper, we describe the process we used to leverage model-based code generation from state diagrams and structural specifications to better respond to the evolving requirements and scope of DS- I's system-level fault-protection design, development, test and operation. The evolution of the high-level design and the low-level changes in the flight software architecture and <b>interfaces</b> contributed to <b>multiplying</b> the number and frequency of fault-protection software releases thereby creating a multitude of software integration issues. To address the resulting software integration issues, we broadened the scope of code -eneration to other forms of model- based analysis techniques more traditionally associated with first-principle's reasoning about physical models. Additionally, we describe our in-flight launch and initial acquisition experience...|$|R
40|$|The sonic {{reaction}} zone length may {{be measured by}} four methods: (1) size effect, (2) detonation front curvature, (3) crystal interface velocity and (4) in-situ gauges. The amount of data decreases exponentially from (1) to (4) with there being almost no gauge data for prompt detonation at steady state. The ease and clarity of obtaining the {{reaction zone}} length increases from (1) to (4). The method of getting the reaction zone length, , is described for the four methods. A measure of non-ideality is proposed: the reaction zone length divided by the cylinder radius. N = /R{sub o}. N = 0 for true ideality. It also decreases with increasing radius as it should. For N 0. 10, a time-dependent description is essential. The crystal experiment, which measures the particle velocity of an explosive-transparent material interface, is presently rising in importance. We examine the data from three experiments and apply: (1) an impedance correction that transfers the explosive C-J particle velocity to the corresponding value for the <b>interface,</b> and (2) <b>multiplies</b> the <b>interface</b> time by 3 / 4 to simulate the explosive speed of sound. The result is a reaction zone length comparable to those obtained by other means.
