25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked {{to the front of the}} property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

[...] The men threatened to kill Bocel {{if he did not}} show them Rother and so Bocel led them downstairs and knocked on a door near the staircase saying: [...] "Father. They are looking for you." [...] Rother opened the door and a struggle ensued as Bocel ran upstairs hearing Rother yell: [...] "Kill me here!"

5000|$|The {{follow up}} to [...] "Branded Man" [...] was the Haggard-penned [...] "I Threw Away the Rose," [...] which rose to number 2, {{and it was}} this song that brought Haggard to the {{attention}} of George Jones. In his 1981 autobiography Merle Haggard: Sing Me Back Home, Haggard recalls playing somewhere in Texas when someone handed him a phone saying Jones was on the line. Jones slurred his appreciation for the song and said he was coming to see him immediately. [...] "It wasn't hard to see that ol' George was pretty wasted," [...] Haggard wrote.

5000|$|Among Iris' many schemes was {{the hiring}} of a man to give Rachel horse-riding lessons, hoping the man would try to seduce her. When that didn't work, Iris hired someone at the mansion to cause trouble for Mac and Rachel. A wedge was being driven between Mac and Rachel, but things looked {{brighter}} when Rachel became pregnant. In {{one of her most}} despicable acts, when Rachel called Iris looking for Mac when she was in terrible pain, Iris just <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> never told her Daddy. Rachel sadly ended up miscarrying the baby. Mac and Rachel then began to drift apart. He spent his time focusing on moving his company completely to Bay City, while she focused on her art. Over the next decade, Mac and Rachel would divorce twice. However, after each divorce, they would eventually rekindle their romance and then get married again. They also had a child of their own together, a daughter named Amanda. They both also had other lovers and spouses along the way (Janice Frame, Mitch Blake, Alice Frame, and Steve Frame, among others). Having already remarried for the third and final time in 1983, Mac and Rachel renewed their wedding vows in 1986. The two spent the next few years together, committed and in love with each other.|$|E
5000|$|Jones and Haggard had {{previously}} recorded one album together in 1982, A Taste of Yesterday's Wine, which produced {{the number one}} single [...] "Yesterday's Wine".

5000|$|Another part of {{the same}} study was the {{question}} [...] "Do you have a price on a fifth of Jim Beam?" [...] Out of 100 merchants, 40 answered [...] "Yes".

5000|$|When {{journalist}} Murat Halstead telephoned McKinley from Chicago {{to inform}} him that Bryan would be nominated, he responded dismissively and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> Bryan's nomination briefly gratified the Republicans, believing that his selection {{would lead to}} an easy victory for McKinley. In those days when the presidential campaign did not begin in earnest until September, Hanna had planned a vacation while McKinley anticipated a quiet summer.

500|$|When McKinley {{heard that}} Bryan {{was likely to}} be the nominee, he called the report [...] "rot" [...] and <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> <b>The</b> Republican nominee was slow to realize the surge of support for Bryan after the nomination, stating his view that the silver {{sentiment}} would be gone in a month. When McKinley and his advisers, such as industrialist and future senator Mark Hanna, realized that the views were more than transitory, they began intensive fundraising from corporations and the wealthy. The money went for speakers, pamphlets, and other means of conveying their [...] "sound money" [...] campaign to the voter. With far less money than McKinley, Bryan embarked on a nationwide campaign tour by train on a then-unprecedented scale. [...] McKinley on the other hand, opted for a front porch campaign.

5000|$|Newman {{was born}} in Los Angeles, the son of Adele [...] "Dixie" [...] (née Fox; August 30, 1916 - October 4, 1988), a secretary, and Irving George Newman (November 28, 1913 - February 1, 1990), an internist. He lived in New Orleans as a small child and spent summers there until he was 11 years old, his family having by then {{returned}} to Los Angeles. Newman also shares the same birthday as his father. The paternal side of his family includes grandparents Luba (née Koskoff) (July 21, 1883 - March 3, 1954) and Michael Newman (Nemorofsky) (1874-1948), and three uncles who were noted Hollywood film-score composers: Alfred Newman, Lionel Newman and Emil Newman. Newman's cousins Thomas, Maria, David, and Joey are also composers for motion pictures. He graduated from University High School in Los Angeles. Newman studied music at the University of California, Los Angeles, but dropped out one semester shy of a B.A. His parents were both from Jewish families, but Newman's household was not observant; he has since become an atheist. Newman has said that religion and any sense of religious identity were completely absent in his childhood. To illustrate this, he has often recounted in interviews an antisemitic incident that occurred when he was young: he was invited by a classmate to be her date to a cotillion at her Los Angeles country club. He accepted the invitation but was subsequently disinvited by the girl's father, who told Newman that his daughter should never have invited Newman because Jews were not allowed at the country club. Newman thanked the girl's father, <b>hung</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> <b>and</b> then went to ask his own father what a [...] "Jew" [...] was.|$|E

She just got off the phone with one of the salesmen. He was {{urgently}} pushing for her decision to whether or not to place any orders for an assortment of top designer eyewear. It was to be an assortment that was rather exclusive by the Malaysian eyewear retail industry standard. To compound to the urgency of her decision, it was not every day that salesmen carrying such top designer eyewear would travel all the way to small towns like Changlun to promote such products. It was only due to intense road-shows by the top brands, as part of their concerted large-scale promotion in Asia, that the salesmen were carrying such exclusive high-end brands. If Tracy were to postpone her decision and not place any orders, it could be a long wait for her before the next chance came by. That was why Tracy had to make up her mind overnight, though she had been mulling over it for the past week...|$|E
