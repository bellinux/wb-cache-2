5|$|The {{operation}} achieved some {{surprise and}} tactical success, but was ultimately a failure. A great many Allied aircraft were destroyed {{on the ground}} but replaced within a week. Allied aircrew casualties were quite small, since the majority of Allied losses were <b>grounded</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The Germans, however, lost many pilots {{that they could not}} readily replace.|$|E

25|$|The Sabre was a {{technically}} demanding aircraft, both {{to operate}} and to maintain. Assistance was needed through 1957 {{to train the}} crews. In the first years technical faults caused a high portion of <b>grounded</b> <b>aircraft.</b> In particular the electronic fuel controller and the radar would frequently break down. Lack of sufficient hangar capacity, forcing the aircraft to be stored outdoors, and insufficient training of mechanics contributed to the issues. These issues were aggravated by a high turnover amongst mechanics at Gardermoen.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Justice {{started the}} process of {{establishing}} a {{search and rescue service}} in the late 1960s. The plans to order ten Westland Sea Kings were passed by Parliament in 1970. The 330 Squadron was recreated on 25 April 1973 and based at Bodø. Three detachments were created, at Sola, Ørland and Banak. This allowed any part of the coast to be reached within ninety minutes. From the 1970s, NATO became increasingly concerned about protecting <b>grounded</b> <b>aircraft</b> for nuclear warfare and sixteen underground hangars were built between 1973 and 1975.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Aero Squadron of the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps {{received}} eight JN-2s at San Diego in July 1915. The squadron {{was transferred}} to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in August {{to work with the}} Field Artillery School, during which one JN-2 crashed, resulting in a fatality. The pilots of the squadron met with its commander, Capt. Benjamin Foulois, to advise that the JN-2 was unsafe because of low power, shoddy construction, lack of stability, and overly sensitive rudder. Foulois and his executive officer Capt. Thomas D. Milling disagreed, and flights continued until a second JN-2 crashed in early September, resulting in the grounding of the six remaining JN-2s until mid-October. When two new JN-3s were delivered, the <b>grounded</b> <b>aircraft</b> were then upgraded in accordance with the new design. In March 1916, these eight JN-3s were deployed to Mexico for aerial observation during the Pancho Villa Expedition of 1916–1917.|$|E

25|$|On 5 February 1944, {{the unit}} moved to Nadzab Airfield, New Guinea. On 1 February 1944, the Squadron had a {{strength}} of 40 officers and 270 enlisted men with 17 A-20Gs and 1 B-25G. This included 19 trained combat pilots and 39 trained combat gunners and photographers. The squadron continued its primary mission of interdiction. The first mission {{performed by the}} squadron {{during the month of}} April was a bombing and strafing mission against <b>grounded</b> <b>aircraft</b> and anti-aircraft positions at Hollandia and Cyclops Airdromes, in Dutch New Guinea. Fifteen A-20G aircraft took off, with all planes reaching the target, dropping 130 hundred-pound parachute demolition bombs on the target area. Bombs were seen to fall directly among 20 to 25 twin-engine unidentified airplanes off the northwest end of Hollandia Airdrome, causing many of these planes to blow up or burn fiercely. Six to eight apparently serviceable aircraft on the northeast end of Hollandia Airdrome were bombed. They are believed to have been heavily damaged or destroyed. Two twin-engine bombers were left burning on the south end of Hollandia Airdrome. Several other bombers and single-seater fighters were heavily strafed. The entire area of Sentani and Cyclops Airdromes was strafed, with many parked aircraft set afire. All the US planes returned safely, but one was forced to land at Dumpu, New Guinea, damaged by anti-aircraft fire. In May 1944, the same routine followed with the strafing and bombing along the coastal areas.|$|E
25|$|Rawlinson {{discussed}} {{the situation with}} the commanders of the 55th, 2nd and 24th divisions and ordered that the next attack must be thoroughly prepared. Haig intervened to urge no delay on strategic grounds and {{discussed the}} problem posed by German defenders hiding in shell-holes and the débris of the village. Rawlinson met Fayolle later, to discuss the combined attack due on 11 August. On 10 August, XIII Corps reported that the attack would be ready by 17 August. The day was misty and rainy, which <b>grounded</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{and led to the}} attack being postponed for a day and ground taken by an advance of two companies of the 55th Division was abandoned, after the French attack was repulsed. Foch and Rawlinson met on 13 August, to plan an operation in which XIV Corps would attack Guillemont, after the French captured Maurepas and Angle Wood, followed by an attack by XIV Corps on Wedge Wood and Falfemont Farm, at dawn on 19 August. A combined attack on 22 August, from Le Forêt to Bois Douage by the French, prolonged from Leuze Wood to Ginchy by the British, was also arranged. Rawlinson and Fayolle agreed a preliminary attack for 16 August, from Angle Wood to south of Guillemont, which took place in hot weather, with special arrangements for counter-battery fire and communication. The British and French made a small advance but most of the captured ground was lost to a counter-attack overnight.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} September, the Anglo-French armies {{had crossed}} the Péronne–Bapaume road around Bouchavesnes, taken Morval, Lesbœufs and Geuedecourt in the centre and {{captured}} most of Thiepval Ridge on the northern flank. On 29 September, Sir Douglas Haig instructed the Fourth Army to plan operations to advance towards Bapaume, reaching Le Transloy {{on the right and}} Loupart Wood north of the Albert–Bapaume road on the left. The Reserve Army was to extend the attacks of the Fourth Army by making converging attacks on the Ancre valley, attacking northwards from Thiepval Ridge towards Loupart Wood–Irles–Miraumont and eastwards on the north bank of the Ancre, by attacking towards Puisieux on a front from Beaumont Hamel to Hébuterne, with the right flank meeting the attacks from the south at Miraumont, to envelop German troops in the upper Ancre valley. The Third Army was to provide a flank guard north of the Reserve Army, by occupying a spur south of Gommecourt. The Reserve Army operations were to begin by 12 October, after the Fourth Army had attacked towards Le Transloy and Beaulencourt and the French Sixth Army had attacked Sailly-Saillisel around 7 October. The French Tenth Army south of the Somme was to attack on 10 October north of Chaulnes. Normal autumn weather in the Somme region would be an obstacle but an exceptional amount of rain and mist <b>grounded</b> <b>aircraft</b> and created vast mud fields, which caused many attacks to be postponed. Haig issued a much less ambitious directive on 7 October but the poor weather, German tactical changes and reinforcements on the Somme front, led to the costly failure of many attacks by both sides.|$|E

2500|$|The Battle of Le Transloy was {{the last}} {{offensive}} of the Fourth Army of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in the 1916 Battle of the Somme in France, during the First World War. The battle was fought in conjunction with attacks by the French Tenth and Sixth armies on the southern flank and the Reserve/5th Army on the northern flank, against [...] (Field Marshal Rupprecht of Bavaria) created on 28 August, from the 1st and 2nd armies of the dissolved [...] and the 6th and 7th armies. General Ferdinand Foch the commander of groupe des armées du nord (Northern Army Group) and co-ordinator of the armies on the Somme, was unable to continue the sequential attacks by the Anglo-French armies achieved in September, because persistent rain, mist and fog <b>grounded</b> <b>aircraft,</b> turned the battlefield into a swamp and greatly increased the difficulty of transporting supplies to the front over the few roads {{in the area and}} the land that had been devastated since 1 July.|$|E
2500|$|During {{periods of}} fine weather in October 1916, British {{reconnaissance}} flights had reported new defences being built {{far behind the}} Somme front; on 9 November, reconnaissance aircraft found {{a new line of}} defences from Bourlon Wood to Quéant, Bullecourt, the river Sensée and Héninel, to the German third line near Arras. Next day, an escaped Russian prisoner of war, reported that [...] were working on concrete dug-outs near St Quentin. Behind the Fifth and Fourth army fronts, the course of the Hindenburg Line was further away and the winter weather was exceptionally bad, which <b>grounded</b> <b>aircraft</b> and made air observation unreliable. On 11 December, a reconnaissance in the area of Marcoing reported nothing unusual, despite flying over the new diggings. German fighter opposition in the area became much worse, with more aircraft and the arrival in service of superior aircraft types in the late summer of 1916. Three intermediate defensive lines begun in late 1916, much closer to the Somme front, were observed by British reconnaissance aircraft, which made fragmentary reports of digging further back unexceptional.|$|E
2500|$|Both sides {{had many}} {{casualties}} and chronic communication problems; inclement weather <b>grounded</b> <b>aircraft,</b> obscured the view and slowed {{movement on the}} roads, which had been severely bombarded and turned to mud {{as soon as it}} rained. Trenches and shell holes filled with water, which made infantry movement exceedingly difficult and exhausted trench garrisons. The British and French found it impossible to arrange co-ordinated attacks and fought many small piecemeal actions, rather than general attacks until 15 September. British-French co-operation broke down again and the French did not attack on 15 September, when the British captured the wood during the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September). The German defenders had great difficulty finding fresh troops for the Somme front, despite ending the Battle of Verdun [...] and had to send divisions to the Eastern Front and to Rumania after it declared war on 27 August. Turnover of German divisions was high and many had to be withdrawn and replaced after fourteen days in the front line. The Germans lacked the resources to make many big organised counter-attacks and those at High Wood and the vicinity were often as costly and ineffective as corresponding British attacks.|$|E

2500|$|Combles, Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt were {{captured}} and many casualties inflicted on the Germans. The French made slower progress near the inter-army boundary, {{due to the}} obstruction of St Pierre Vaast Wood to the French attack north towards Sailly and Sailly-Saillisel. The inter-army boundary was moved north from [...] to allow the French more room to deploy their forces but the great quantity of German artillery-fire limited the French advance. The Fourth Army advance on 25 September was its deepest since 14 July and left the Germans in severe difficulties, particularly in a salient which developed to the north-east of Combles. Tiredness and lack of reserves prevented the Fourth Army exploiting its success beyond patrolling and cavalry probes. The Reserve Army attack began on 26 September, at the Battle of Thiepval Ridge. Deteriorating weather and the shorter days, greatly increased British and French transport difficulties; rain and fog <b>grounded</b> <b>aircraft</b> and impeded artillery observation. Mud reduced the blast effect of shells and immobilised infantry, which was an advantage to the defenders. A small number of tanks joined in the battle later in the afternoon, after having been held back because of the later start and reduced a number of German strong points which had withstood earlier attacks.|$|E
2500|$|On August 28, {{the fire}} {{continued}} burning {{on the west}} side through the day while areas inside the fire line also continued to burn actively.
