Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots.

25|$|After Helms {{left the}} {{leadership}} of the CIA, he began his service as U.S. ambassador to Iran as designated by President Nixon.

After being confirmed by the Senate, in April 1973 Helms proceeded to his new residence in Tehran, where he served as the American representative until resigning effective January 1977.

25|$|Papen was {{a member}} of the highly {{exclusive}} Deutscher Herrenklub (German Gentlemen's Club) of Arthur Moeller van den Bruck. Papen, a man completely unknown to the general public, was well known in elite circles in Berlin for his sense of style which together with his colorful and much embellished recounting of his adventures in Mexico, the United States, Canada, Flanders, France and the Ottoman Empire in the World War and <b>his</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> tell a seemingly endless number of jokes all combined to make a much sought after dinner guest among the elite. Most people knew that the more fanciful exploits Papen described were exaggerations, if not fabrications, but Papen was such an entertaining raconteur who excelled at light conversation that few cared. At the Deutscher Herrenklub, Papen would spend hours drinking and talking with his best friend General Kurt von Schleicher who enjoyed his company. Schleicher and his friends liked to call Papen Fränzchen, a somewhat disparaging diminutive of his name Franz, but the French ambassador André François-Poncet who also a member of the Herrenklub noted:"Papen sometimes served as the butt of their jokes; they enjoyed making fun of and teasing him, without him taking the least offense".|$|E

500|$|Descriptions of Farmer's playing style {{typically}} stress his lyricism and {{the warmth}} of his sound. The Los Angeles Times obituary writers noted that his playing had [...] "a sweetly lyrical tone and a melodic approach to phrasing, neither of which minimized <b>his</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> produce rhythmically swinging phrases". The equivalent comments in The Guardian were that [...] "Farmer avoided the bright, penetrating sound of orthodox trumpet playing and was influenced by the more reserved articulation of Miles Davis and Kenny Dorham", and that, although he could seem more restrained than Davis or Lee Morgan, [...] "Farmer was in his way a true original. His phrasing was always distinctive, letting the beat run ahead of him rather in the manner of Billie Holiday's vocals".|$|E

The parish was named for Saint Procopius of Sázava, who founded a monastery in Bohemia in the eleventh century and became the first saint from Czechoslovakia. Vilém Čoka served as the first pastor. Planning to build a school, Čoka left it to the community to decide if the school would be secular or Catholic. They chose a Catholic school, despite the fact that only 25percent of Pilsen's Czech population was Catholic.

Blamey [...] "was always attractive to women and attracted by them.

The party travelled by train to Washington, DC, where Blamey was warmly greeted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and briefed the Combined Chiefs of Staff on the progress of the war in SWPA. In London Blamey had a series of meetings with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, and was briefed on Operation Overlord by General Sir Bernard Montgomery and Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder. Blamey was disappointed to have to turn down an offer to accompany the invasion as a guest of General Dwight Eisenhower because Curtin feared that the invasion would lead to retaliatory German bombing, and wanted to be far away before it started.|$|E
