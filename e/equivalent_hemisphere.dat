40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of statistical analyses of large climate datasets from two time intervals – the 20 th century instrumental record and the proxy record of the last deglaciation – {{in order to understand the}} forcings and mechanisms of past climate variability. A longstanding question in climate dynamics concerns the origin of Pacific decadal variability (PDV). This issue is addressed by calculating the Southern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>equivalent</b> of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index from Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the 20 th century, which is found to be similar to its Northern Hemisphere counterpart. The Northern and Southern PDO indices both exhibit pronounced seasonality in autocorrelation with interannual persistence of winter SST anomalies despite their absence during the intervening summer, suggesting a role for reemergence. These two indices can be reasonably well reproduced using a first-order autoregressive model forced by the El Niño-Souther...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the leading mode of sea surface {{temperature}} variability for the North Pacific, {{is a matter of}} considerable debate. One paradigm views the PDO as an independent mode centered in the North Pacific, while another regards it as a largely reddened response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forcing from the tropics. We calculate the Southern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>equivalent</b> of the PDO index based on the leading mode of sea surface temperature variability for the South Pacific and find that it adequately explains the spatial structure of the PDO in the North Pacific. A first-order autoregressive model forced by ENSO is used to reproduce the observed PDO indices in the North and South Pacific. These results highlight the strong similarity in Pacific decadal variability {{on either side of the}} equator and suggest it may best be viewed as a reddened response to ENSO...|$|R
40|$|Sustained {{attention}} develops {{during childhood}} {{and has been}} linked to the right fronto-parietal cortices in functional imaging studies; however, less is known about its relation to white matter (WM) characteristics. Here we investigated whether the microstructure of the WM underlying and connecting the right fronto-parietal cortices was associated with sustained attention performance in a group of 76 typically developing children aged 7 - 13 years. Sustained attention was assessed using a rapid visual information processing paradigm. The two behavioral measures of interest were the sensitivity index d′ and the coefficient of variation in reaction times (RT CV). Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) was extracted from the WM underlying right dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) and parietal cortex (PC), and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), as well as equivalent anatomical regions-of-interest (ROIs) in the left hemisphere and mean global WM FA. When analyzed collectively, right hemisphere ROIs FA was significantly associated with d′ independently of age. Follow-up analyses revealed that only FA of right SLF and the superior part of the right PC contributed significantly to this association. RT CV was significantly associated with right superior PC FA, but not with right SLF FA. Observed associations remained significant after controlling for FA of <b>equivalent</b> left <b>hemisphere</b> ROIs or global mean FA. In conclusion, better sustained attention performance was associated with higher FA of WM in regions connecting right frontal and parietal cortices. Further studies are needed to clarify to which extent these associations are driven by maturational processes, stable characteristics and/or experience. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{intonation}} accompanying an utterance provides a powerful cue as to a speaker’s emotional state of mind. Most prior lesion {{studies have demonstrated}} that the nodal point for decoding these prosodic emotion cues is mediated by unimodal auditory cortex in the right posterior lateral temporal lobe. However, functional neuroimaging has brought with it increasing attention to the <b>equivalent</b> left <b>hemisphere</b> region in this role. This study used fMRI to quantitatively assess the hypothesis that involvement of the left posterior lateral temporal lobe depended on the linguistic load or verbal complexity of the prosodic emotion stimuli. BOLD contrast data was acquired on a 3 T scanner whilst 16 healthy young adults identified the prosodic emotion in three conditions: ‘sentences’ comprised of words, a repeated monosyllable, and a single prolonged syllable (asyllabic). Whole brain analyses were performed using SPM 5 and supplemented by posterior lateral temporal lobe region of interest (ROI) analyses. The whole brain analyses appeared to show bilateral temporal lobe activation across the conditions, however, the ROI analyses indicated a highly significant decrease in activity in the left ROI as verbal complexity decreased. Changes in right ROI activity were not statistically significant. Our results indicate that the likelihood of observing a notable left temporal lobe response in functional neuroimaging studies of emotional prosody comprehension depends on the verbal complexity of the prosodic emotion stimuli. Despite the right hemisphere dominance underlying this task, the left hemisphere region may be co-activated in its attempt to extract phonetic-segmental information from the acoustic stimuli whether or not the stimuli contain meaningful phonetic-segmental information...|$|R
40|$|A palaeosurface {{with one}} megatheropod {{trackway}} and several theropod tracks and trackways from the Lower Jurassic upper Elliot Formation (Stormberg Group, Karoo Supergroup) in western Lesotho is described. The {{majority of the}} theropod tracks are referable to either Eubrontes or Kayentapus based on their morphological characteristics. The larger megatheropod tracks are 57 cm long and have no Southern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>equivalent.</b> Morphologically, they are more similar to the Early Jurassic Kayentapus, {{as well as the}} much younger Upper Cretaceous ichnogenus Irenesauripus, than to other contemporaneous ichnogenera in southern Africa. Herein they have been placed within the ichnogenus Kayentapus and described as a new ichnospecies (Kayentapus ambrokholohali). The tracks are preserved on ripple marked, very fine-grained sandstone of the Lower Jurassic upper Elliot Formation, and thus were made after the end-Triassic mass extinction event (ETE). This new megatheropod trackway site marks the first occurrence of very large carnivorous dinosaurs (estimated body length > 8 - 9 meters) in the Early Jurassic of southern Gondwana, an evolutionary strategy that was repeatedly pursued and amplified in the following ~ 135 million years, until the next major biotic crisis at the end-Cretaceous...|$|R
40|$|Robert Tilney] {{makes the}} point that few navigators made old bones, but the great {{survivor}} among his generation was the contentious William Bligh. Bligh was also the central character of John Toohey's first novel. Toohey seems to retain his fascination for driven and eccentric ships' captains, as his second novel, Quiros, is based on the voyage of the Spaniard who, in 1605, went in quest of the Great South Land to claim it for Christ. The story of Quiros provided inspiration 40 years ago for the Catholic poet James McAuley, but Toohey's Quiros is a darker and more tormented figure. The historical narrative states that Quiros, having sailed as lieutenant with an older navigator, Mendocca, in two voyages to the Solomon Islands, became convinced that they had not been far from the Southern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>equivalent</b> of the Eurasian landmass. In Toohey's hands Quiros figures as an obsessed idealist planning Utopian cities in the new land that awaits his party and deteriorating under disappointment to become a crazed and vindictive tyrant. On the journey they encounter islands where the inhabitants are hostile and others where hospitable pagans offer fleshly temptations, but they continue to a point of no return where the crew rejects Quiros's authority and return home...|$|R
40|$|Frullania is a {{large and}} taxonomically complex genus. Here a new Frullania, F. toropuku von Konrat, de Lange & Larraín, sp. nov. is {{described}} from New Zealand. Frullania toropuku is placed in F. subg. Microfrullania. The new species is readily recognised {{by a combination of}} morphological characters associated with branching, the perianth, sexuality, and sporophyte, which distinguish it from all other New Zealand and regional species of Frullania. However, morphologically F. toropuku most closely resembles the widespread F. rostrata, which might well be regarded as a Southern <b>Hemisphere</b> <b>equivalent</b> of the Holarctic F. tamarisci species-complex in terms of its cryptic diversity. A combination of morphological characters associated with branching, the perianth, sexuality, and sporophyte distinguish F. toropuku from all other New Zealand and regional species of Frullania. A comparison is made between F. toropuku and morphologically allied species of botanical regions outside the New Zealand region and an artificial key is provided. In a prior investigation, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of nuclear ribosomal ITS 2 and plastidic trnL-trnF sequences from purported related species confirms its independent taxonomic status and corroborates its placement within F. subg. Microfrullania. The ongoing studies of Frullania species-complexes reveal the urgent need for more species-level phylogenies with extensive population sampling to approximate the actual diversity of Frullania, and to elucidate speciation processes and distribution range formation...|$|R
40|$|The Greenland {{ice sheet}} (GrIS) {{contains}} the largest store {{of fresh water}} in the Northern <b>Hemisphere,</b> <b>equivalent</b> to ∼ 7. 4 m of eustatic sea-level rise, but its impacts on current, past, and future sea level, ocean circulation, and European climate are poorly understood. Previous estimates of GrIS melt, from 26 yr of satellite observations and temperature-driven melt models over 48 yr, show increasing melt trends. There are, however, no runoff data of comparable duration with which to validate {{the relationship between the}} spatial extent of melting and runoff or temperature-based runoff models. Further, longer runoff records are needed to extend the melt pattern of Greenland to centennial timescales, enabling recent observations and trends to be put into a better historical context. We have developed a new GrIS runoff proxy by extracting information on relative salinity changes from annual growth bands of red coralline algae. We observed significant negative relationships between historic runoff, relative salinity, and marine summer temperature in Søndre Strømfjord, Greenland. We produce the first reconstruction of runoff from a section of the GrIS that discharges into Søndre Strømfjord over several decades (1939 – 2002) and record a trend of increasing reconstructed runoff since the mid 1980 s. In situ summer marine temperatures followed an equivalent trend. We suggest that since A. D. 1939, atmospheric temperatures have been important in forcing runoff. These results show that our technique has significant potential to enhance understanding of runoff from large ice sheets as it will enable melt reconstruction over centennial to millennial timescales...|$|R
2500|$|Flooding is a {{recurring}} problem in Houston. [...] It is especially severe in low-lying {{areas on the}} far east end of town along the San Jacinto River. The flat wetlands and paved-over coastal prairie around Houston drain slowly and easily flood. The area is drained by a network of bayous (small, slow-moving rivers, often dredged and enlarged to increase volume) and man-made drainage ditches, which are usually dry most of the year. [...] Due to the ubiquity of overdevelopment and the huge amounts of concrete in the city, drainage is insufficient during times of especially heavy rainfall. [...] In fall, cool fronts bring in rainstorms and flooding is not uncommon. This might flood certain low-lying intersections, but doesn't generally affect citizens or {{the business of the}} city. [...] However, occasionally very heavy thunderstorms dump so much water on the city that widespread congestion and even property damage in low-lying areas result. [...] Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 was so severe that many parts of town that had never flooded before were flooded seriously. [...] Interstate 10 near downtown, which is below grade, was covered by over [...] of water. Another storm happened in June 2015 (Tropical Storm Bill) that had a similar impact on Houston, causing several highways to be closed due to the bayou overflowing; this event followed flooding from May 24-26. Another similar storm in April 2016 resulted in widespread, severe flooding across Houston and surrounding suburbs in an event later known as the [...] "Tax Day Floods". On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston causing severe widespread damage and at least 14 deaths.

These two indices can be reasonably well reproduced using a first-order autoregressive model forced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, suggesting that Pacific decadal variability on both sides of the equator may largely be a reddened response to tropical forcing. Over 100 high-resolution proxy climate time series spanning parts or all of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to Holocene interval are analyzed to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of glacial-interglacial climate change. Peak glacial and interglacial conditions occurred statistically synchronously between the Northern (22. 1 ± 4. 3 ka and 8. 0 ± 3. 2 ka) and Southern (22. 3 ± 3. 6 ka and 7. 4 ± 3. 7 ka) Hemispheres, suggesting that the hemispheres were synchronized by greenhouse gases, local insolation, and/or ocean circulation. Global cooling during the LGM was likely ≥ 4. 9 °C, but only 0. 6 °C during the Younger Dryas. Younger Dryas climate anomalies exhibit a general hemispheric seesaw pattern with the largest negative anomalies in the high northern latitudes, mixed sign anomalies in the low latitudes, and modest positive anomalies in the high southern latitudes, consistent with an ocean circulation driver of this event. Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis of 71 records from 19 - 11 ka indicates that 72...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} {{a study of the}} family Strophariaceae {{utilizing}} comparative morphology, electrophoresis of extracellular enzymes and mating compatibility approaches. The study has found macromorphology to be effective in the delineation of taxa in the majority of cases. Isozyme profiles of extracellular laccase, pectinesterase and polygalacturonase are found to be species distinctive in most species across the genera of this family. The one exception found is Hypholoma whose species show a certain degree of conservativeness in the enzymes examined in the study. This approach is found to be useful in establishing putative species groups which can then be further investigated through mating studies. The multifaceted approach employed in the study has successfully resolved the relationships between Psi locybe subaeruginosa and P. australiana, P. eucalypta and P. tasmaniana, identified sibling species in both Stropharia and Pholiota, and established Pholiota. squarrosipes Clel. and P. multicingulata Horak as species showing a wide range of morphological variations. It is suggested from this study that P. multicingulata sensu lato may encompass P. multicingulata Horak and P. austrospumosa Hongo forming the southern <b>hemisphere</b> <b>equivalent</b> of Pholiota spumosa complex. In addition, a multifaceted approach such as that adopted in the study also lends support to the applicability of the common species concept proposed for Hymenomycetes in the family Strophariaceae. Results gained have enabled a confident approach to the separation and enumeration of species within the family. Results from electrophoresis show that delineation of taxa can be achieved through distinctions in zymogram patterns. For example, the recently described species Psilocybe australiana Guzman & Wading, P. eucalypta Guzman & Watling and P. tasrnaniana Guzman & Wading are shown to be synonymous with P. subaeruginosa Clel. In this particular case, the considerable degree of similarity in zymogram patterns is highly indicative of a single species and this conclusion is supported by mating studies. Diagnostic morphological characters used in previous studies to differentiate these taxa are shown to be invalid. The phenomenon of sibling species is not uncommon in fungi. Electrophoretic analyses showed that within the genera of Stropharia and Pholiota sibling species were concealed within common morphological entities. This is exemplified in the semiglobata-like forms in Stropharia. Within this single morphological entity, two distinct species were identified by comparison of isozyrne profiles and UPGMA cluster analysis using band frequencies, later the segregation was confirmed by mating compatibility studies. The study has confirmed the use of enzyme electrophoresis as a useful technique when applied {{to a wide range of}} species across a family from the Agaricales. When this technique is used in conjunction with mating compatibility study, findings from electrophoresis have been complimented and confirmed by those from mating. Thus, the study has avoided some of the problems associated with a purely morphological approach, and as illustrated by the case of Psilocybe subaeruginosa the multifaceted approach employed here allows much more confidence to be placed on the described boundaries of the species studied. 31 taxa are delineated from the study, and of these, eight are previously undescribed species and one being a new variety...|$|R

The visual system consists of two distinct networks [...] the structural and functional networks. Defined anatomically by the physical connections between neurons, the structural network provides the architectural framework for information processing. The functional network, however, is determined by the situation-dependent activation of connections either set by or independent of the structural network. Therefore, these two networks are linked. Individually, these networks can be mapped and analyzed using graph theory [...] a specialized branch of mathematics that is used to determine characteristics of complex networks. In the case of the visual system, nodes (objects of interest) are represented by specific brain regions of the visual network, and edges represent the structural (anatomical) or functional (physiological) connections between visual regions. The objective {{of this study was to}} use graph theory to determine the extent to which the structural and functional networks of the cat visual system are linked and to use this information to generate a hierarchy of visual information flow and processing through the visual system. Using five intact and six lesioned subjects, we analyzed sixteen visual cortical areas as well as nine sub-cortical areas and their connections. These regions include cortical areas A 17, A 18, A 19, A 20 a, A 20 b, A 21 a, A 21 b, 7, PMLS, PLLS, AMLS, ALLS, DLS, VLS, PS, and SVA and sub-cortical areas LGN, LPL, LPM, PUL, CAUD, SGS, SO, SGI, and SGP. Structural connectivity data was obtained from literary sources. Functional connectivity data was obtained from 2 -Deoxy-D-Glucose stained images of the subjects' brains. We first looked at the functional networks of the intact subjects to determine the functional influence of one hemisphere on the other and to observe general trends in network connections. We found that functional connections across hemispheres were not symmetrical and that two distinct connectional patterns emerged - visual areas, or clusters, may connect to their <b>equivalent</b> areas across <b>hemispheres</b> or they may connect to a many non-equivalent areas. There also emerged a distinct clustering pattern across and within both hemispheres. Clusters were seen within the primary visual cortical areas (17, 18) and area 19; between areas PMLS, PLLS, DLS, and VLS; and between the superior colliculi and all of these regions. We also used this data to determine which functional and structural connections are linked in resting state visual network and how strongly they are linked. We found that areas 17, 18, 19, 21 a, PMLS, PLLS, DLS, and VLS are the ones primarily involved in visual processing in the passive state. The second group we looked at consisted of the subjects with a lesioned hemisphere either receiving sham or real trans-cranial magnetic stimulation. This group allowed us to determine the validity of predictions concerning the existence and influence of intrinsic inhibition between hemispheres. We found that when one hemisphere is lesioned, inhibition is released and there is an increase in functional connectivity within the remaining hemisphere. When TMS was performed and inhibition reinstated, this increase in functional connectivity was lost. This confirmed that there is an inhibitory influence of the visual system between hemispheres in the cat [...] meaning that in intact brains, one hemisphere decreases the functional activity of the other. These finding confirmed that, functionally, there are both inter- and intra-hemispheric influences between hemispheres and that altering part of the network will subsequently alter the functional organization and activity of the whole network...|$|R
