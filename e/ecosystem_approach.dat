50|$|The <b>ecosystem</b> <b>approach</b> is a {{conceptual}} framework for resolving ecosystem issues. The idea is to protect and manage the environment {{through the use of}} scientific reasoning. Another point of the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>approach</b> is preserving the Earth and its inhabitants from potential harm or permanent damage to the planet itself. With the preservation and management of the planet through an <b>ecosystem</b> <b>approach,</b> the future monetary and planetary gain are the by-product of sustaining and/or increasing the capacity of that particular environment. This is possible as the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>approach</b> incorporates humans, the economy, and ecology to the solution of any given problem. The initial idea for an <b>ecosystem</b> <b>approach</b> would come to light during the second meeting (November 1995) at the Conference of the Parties (COP) it was the central topic in implementation and framework for the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), it would further elaborate on the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>approach</b> as using varies methodologies for solving complex issues.|$|E

50|$|The <b>ecosystem</b> <b>approach</b> is {{currently}} {{being used in the}} fields of environmental and ocean management (i.e. the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>approach</b> does not stop there; it is being used in various fields and sub-fields as well). The goal is to address the current problems facing those fields through the use of conceptual thinking and approach that would determine a viable and sustaining solution. One example, in particular, would be pertaining to Fishery (a commercial industry in capturing and selling of fishes). In recent years, inland fisheries have quintupled from 2 million metric tons to 11 million metric tons in the span of 60 years from 1950 to 2010. Through the use of the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>approach</b> more specifically the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>approach</b> to fisheries (EAF), sometimes referred to as Ecosystem-based fisheries. EAF is seen as a framework to creating local strategies for each specific fishery ecosystem and implementing the new strategies gradually with the already existing rules and regulation. With the use of EAF if successful fishery industries could generate substantial income; as well as, improve the fragile ecosystem of aquarium species.|$|E

The ecological dimension of vector-borne disease research and management is a pervasive element because this issue is essentially an ecological problem with biophysical, social, and economic dimensions.
