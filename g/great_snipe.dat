It has also been suggested that reviews should be conducted of records of <b>great</b> <b>snipe,</b> as older records show a very different temporal occurrence pattern than more recent birds, {{the large numbers of}} gull-billed tern records from the English south coast from the 1960s, and desert wheatears, to establish racial identifications.|$|E

40|$|Migratory land birds perform extreme {{endurance}} flights when crossing ecological barriers, such as deserts, {{oceans and}} ice-caps. When travelling over benign areas, birds {{are expected to}} migrate by shorter flight steps, since carrying the heavy fuel loads needed for long non-stop flights comes at considerable cost. Here, we show that <b>great</b> <b>snipes</b> Gallinago media made long and fast non-stop flights (4300 - 6800 km in 48 - 96 h), not only over deserts and seas but also over wide areas of suitable habitats, which represents a previously unknown migration strategy among land birds. Furthermore, the <b>great</b> <b>snipes</b> achieved very high ground speeds (15 - 27 m s(- 1)), which was not an effect of strong tailwind support, and we know of no other animal that travels this rapidly over such a long distance. Our results demonstrate that some migratory birds are prepared to accept extreme costs of strenuous exercise and large fuel loads, even when stopover sites are available along the route {{and there is little}} tailwind assistance. A strategy of storing a lot of energy before departure, even if migration is over benign habitats, may be advantageous owing to differential conditions of fuel deposition, predation or infection risk along the migration route...|$|R

60|$|Sometimes, again, we went hawking, a pastime that is {{in great}} favour among the Zu-Vendi, who {{generally}} fly their birds at a species of partridge which is remarkable for the swiftness and strength of its flight. When attacked by the hawk this bird appears to lose its head, and, instead of seeking cover, flies high into the sky, thus offering wonderful sport. I have seen one of these partridges soar up almost out of sight when followed by the hawk. Still better sport is offered {{by a variety of}} solitary snipe as big as a small woodcock, which is plentiful in this country, and which is flown at with a very small, agile, and highly-trained hawk with an almost red tail. The zigzagging of the <b>great</b> <b>snipe</b> and the lightning rapidity of the flight and movements of the red-tailed hawk make the pastime a delightful one. Another variety of the same amusement is the hunting of a very small species of antelope with trained eagles; and it certainly is a marvellous sight to see the great bird soar and soar till he is nothing but a black speck in the sunlight, and then suddenly come dashing down like a cannon-ball upon some cowering buck that is hidden in a patch of grass from everything but that piercing eye. Still finer is the spectacle when the eagle takes the buck running.|$|E

5|$|Both Crex crakes are omnivorous, {{but mainly}} feed on invertebrates, {{including}} earthworms, slugs and snails, spiders, beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects.

40|$|Animal {{movements}} in {{air and water}} can be strongly affected by experienced flow. While various flow-orientation strategies have been proposed and observed, their performance in variable flow conditions remains unclear. We apply control theory to establish a benchmark for time-minimizing (optimal) orientation. We then define optimal orientation for movement in steady flow patterns and, using dynamic wind data, for short-distance mass movements of thrushes (Turdus sp.) and 6000 km non-stop migratory flights by <b>great</b> <b>snipes,</b> Gallinago media. Relative to the optimal benchmark, we assess the efficiency (travel speed) and reliability (success rate) of three generic orientation strategies: full compensation for lateral drift, vector orientation (single-heading movement) and goal orientation (continually heading towards the goal). Optimal orientation is characterized by detours to regions of high flow support, especially when flow speeds approach and exceed the animal's self-propelled speed. In strong predictable flow (short distance thrush flights), vector orientation adjusted to flow on departure is nearly optimal, whereas for unpredictable flow (inter-continental snipe flights), only goal orientation was near-optimally reliable and efficient. Optimal orientation provides a benchmark for assessing efficiency of responses to complex flow conditions, thereby offering insight into adaptive flow-orientation across taxa {{in the light of}} flow strength, predictability and navigation capacity. flow orientationanimal navigationmigrationlateral driftoptimizationmovement ecologyReceived June 3, 2014.

50|$|Lek {{territories of}} {{different}} taxa are stable {{and do not}} vary in terms of size and location. Males often return to the same mating sites because of female fidelity.

Successful males congregate in the same area as the previous breeding season because it is familiar to them, while females return to reunite with said males. Females do not return to a mating site if their male partner is not present. Another possible explanation for lek stability is from male hierarchies within a lek. In manakins, subordinate betas may inherit an alpha's display site, increasing the chances of female visitation. Rank may also contribute to the stability of lek size, as lower ranking males may congregate to achieve a perceived optimal size as a way to attract females.|$|E
