40|$|A pH-sensitive cAMP-gated cation current (INa,cAMP) {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in neurons of the <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> networks of gastropods. In the sea slug Pleurobranchaea this current is potentiated by nitric oxide (NO), which itself {{is produced by}} many feeding neurons. The action of NO is not dependent on either cGMP or cAMP signaling pathways. However, we found that NO potentiation of INa,cAMP in the serotonergic metacerebral cells could be blocked by intracellular injection of MOPS buffer (pH 7. 2). In neurons injected with the pH indicator BCECF, NO induced rapid intracellular acidification to several tenths of a pH unit. Intracellular pH has not previously {{been identified as a}} specific target of NO, but in this system NO modulation of INa,cAMP via pHi may be an important regulator of the excitability of the <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> network...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Previous {{research}} {{indicated that}} the evolution of <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> pat-terns across major taxonomic groups might have occurred without large modifi-cations of {{the control of the}} jaw and hyolingual muscles. However, the proposal of this evolutionary scheme was hampered by the lack of data for some key taxa such as lizards. Recent data on jaw and hyolingual <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> patterns of a number of lizard families suggest extensive variability within and among species. Although most lizards respond to changes in the structural properties of food items by mod-ulating the activation of the jaw and hyolingual muscles, some food specialists might have lost this ability. Whereas the overall similarity in motor patterns across different lineages of lizards is large for the hyolingual muscles, jaw muscle acti-vation patterns seem to be more flexible. Nevertheless, all data suggest that both the jaw and hyolingual system are complexly integrated. The elimination of feed-back pathways from the hyolingual system through nerve transection experiments clearly shows that feeding cycles are largely shaped by feedback interactions. Yet, novel motor patterns including unilateral control seem to have emerged in the evolution from lizards to snakes...|$|E
40|$|Small cardioactive peptide B (SCPB) has an {{excitatory}} {{effect on}} both buccal neurons and musculature in numerous molluscan species. The present study reports {{the effects of}} SCPB on the activity of specified buccal neurons and {{the expression of the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> program of the terrestrial slug, Limax maximums. Superfusion of an isolated CNS preparation with 10 − 6 M SCPB results in a 3 – 4 -fold increase in the burst frequency of the fast salivary burster neuron (FSB), while having no effect on the activity of another endogenous burster, the bilateral salivary neuron (BSN). The response of the FSB to SCPBiS dose dependent, with a threshold concentration of 2 × 10 − 8 M. The response of the FSB to SCPB showed no indication of desensitization, even after long-term exposure (20 min). The <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> program (FMP) in Limax is a discrete pattern of cyclical motor activity that can be initiated by lip nerve stimulation. In the presence of SCPB a previously subthreshold stimulus can initiate the full FMP. The pattern of the FMP, once initiated, appears unaffected by SCPB. Thus it is the responsiveness of the initiation process that is enhanced by SCPB. Histochemical studies revealed a number of buccal neuron somata and fibers that stain for SCPB-like immunoreactive material (SLIM) ...|$|E

40|$|The buccal ganglia {{of seven}} nudibranches (Aeolidia papillosa, Armina californica, Dirona albolineata, D. picta, Hermissenda crassicornis, Melibe leonina, and Tritonia diomedea) were {{examined}} to explore possible homologies between large cells that reacted with antibodies directed against small cardioactive peptide B (SCPB). The buccal ganglion of each species possessed {{a pair of}} large, dorsal–lateral, whitish neurons that contained an SCPB-like peptide. We refer to these neurons as the SLB (SCPB-immunoreactive Large Buccal) cells. In all species examined, the SLB cells project out the gastroesophageal nerves and appear to innervate the esophagus. In each species, an apparent rhythmic <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> program (FMP) was observed by intracellular recording from both SLB neurons and other neurons in isolated preparations of the buccal ganglia. SLB cells often fire at a high frequency, and usually burst in a specific phase relation to the FMP activity. Stimulation of SLB cells enhances expression of the <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> program, either by potentiating existing activity or eliciting the FMP in quiescent preparations. Finally, perfusion of isolated buccal ganglia with SCPB excites the SLB cells and activates FMPs. Thus, both the immunohistochemical and electrophysiological {{data suggest that the}} SLB cells within three suborders of the opistobranchia (Dendronotacea, Arminacea, and Aeolidacea) are homologous.

40|$|Animals {{interact}} with their environment based on stereotypical movement patterns, such as those performed during running, breathing or feeding. Hox regulatory genes had been known to be essential for establishing coordinated movements, but the molecular underpinnings of feeding behaviour were not well understood. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system, the present work demonstrates that a specific Hox gene, Deformed, controls {{the establishment of a}} motor unit in the fly's head during embryonic development. This unit comprises a muscle and a set of stimulating neurons and enables feeding-related movements. The loss of functional Deformed caused severe defects {{in the formation of the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> unit and subsequently led to death. Furthermore, inactivation of Deformed at the end of embryogenesis, once the motor unit was successfully assembled, uncovered a novel role for Deformed in maintaining the functionality and integrity of the motor unit later in life. Finally, perturbations in motor behaviour were pinned to the role of Deformed in the control of molecules essential for synapse stability at the junctions between neurons and muscles. One of the identified direct targets of Deformed is Ankyrin, a molecule previously shown to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Hence, the results presented here suggest that Hox genes might have a neuroprotective function and once this function is gone, the neurons degenerate, a hypothesis that will be of interest to study in the future. Interestingly, Deformed is co-expressed in muscles and neurons forming the functional <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> unit, pointing at its role as a master regulator of feeding behaviour. In support of this hypothesis, Deformed was shown to act as one of the negative upstream regulators of Connectin, a molecule essentially required for the correct matching between the two partners. Is the function of Hox transcription factors in the establishment of <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> units conserved across the animal phylogeny? This work uncovered a fly neural regulatory element of Deformed, which contains highly conserved Hox-binding sites, to be active in neurons located within the hindbrain of the vertebrate fish model Oryzias latipes, suggesting that the transcriptional network controlling the assembly and function of the feeding unit in fish and flies is conserved...|$|E

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is an {{unconventional}} membrane-permeable messenger molecule {{that has been}} shown to play various roles in the nervous system. How NO modulates ion channels to affect neuronal functions is not well understood. In gastropods, NO has been implicated in regulating the <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> program. The buccal motoneuron, B 19, of the freshwater pond snail Helisoma trivolvis is active during the hyper-retraction phase of the <b>feeding</b> <b>motor</b> program and is located in the vicinity of NO-producing neurons in the buccal ganglion. Here, we asked whether B 19 neurons might serve as direct targets of NO signaling. Previous work established NO as a key regulator of growth cone motility and neuronal excitability in another buccal neuron involved in feeding, the B 5 neuron. This raised the question whether NO might modulate the electrical activity and neuronal excitability of B 19 neurons as well, and if so whether NO acted on the same or a different set of ion channels in both neurons. To study specific responses of NO on B 19 neurons and to eliminate indirect effects contributed by other cells, the majority of experiments were performed on single cultured B 19 neurons. Addition of NO donors caused a prolonged depolarization of the membrane potential and an increase in neuronal excitability. The effects of NO could mainly be attributed to the inhibition of two types of calcium-activated potassium channels, apamin-sensitive and iberiotoxin-sensitive potassium channels. NO was found to also cause a depolarization in B 19 neurons in situ, but only after NO synthase activity in buccal ganglia had been blocked. The results suggest that NO acts as a critica...|$|E

The continuous demand for higher productivity and product quality asks for better understanding and control of machining processes by reducing machining time {{with the increase of}} cutting force and material removal rate.

One of the methods of improving productivity and quality lies in fact, to develop monitoring system which can control and maintain the cutting force at a prescribed level by adjusting cutting parameters using adaptive control technique.

However, technical limitations have prevented detailed study of the functional role of these neurons, a common problem for vertebrate organisms. Complexities involved in studies of whole-animal behaviour can be resolved in Drosophila, in which remote activation of brain cells by genetic means enables us to examine the nervous system in freely moving animals to identify neurons that govern a specific behaviour, and then to repeatedly target and manipulate these neurons to characterize their function.

During <b>feeding,</b> <b>motor</b> withdrawal responses to noxious paw heat either did not occur or were greatly delayed. To investigate the neural basis of sensory suppression accompanying feeding, we recorded from brainstem pain-modulatory neurons involved in the descending control of pain transmission.

When a nonpainful somatosensory stimulus preactivated ON cells and preinhibited OFF cells, rats interrupted eating to react to painful stimuli.
