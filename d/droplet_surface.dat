25|$|ESI has a {{more complex}} {{ionisation}} mechanism, relying heavily on droplet charge excess and as such {{there are many more}} factors to consider when exploring the cause of ion suppression. It has been widely observed that for many analytes, at high concentrations, ESI exhibits a loss of detector response linearity, perhaps due to reduced charge excess caused by analyte saturation at the <b>droplet</b> <b>surface,</b> inhibiting subsequent ejection of gas phase ions from further inside the droplet. Thus competition for space and/or charge may be considered as a source of ion suppression in ESI. Both physical and chemical properties of analytes (e.g. basicity and surface activity) determine their inherent ionisation efficiency. Biological sample matrices naturally tend to contain many endogenous species with high basicity and surface activity, hence the total concentration of these species in the sample will quickly reach levels at which ion suppression should be expected.|$|E

40|$|An {{evaporating}} droplet is {{a dynamic}} system in which flow is spontaneously generated to minimize the surface energy, dragging particles to the borders and ultimately resulting in the so-called "coffee-stain effect". The situation becomes more complex at the <b>droplet's</b> <b>surface,</b> where surface tension gradients of different nature can {{compete with each other}} yielding different scenarios. With careful experiments and with the aid of 3 D particle tracking techniques, we are able to show that different types of surfactants turn the <b>droplet's</b> <b>surface</b> either rigid or elastic, which alters the evaporating fluid flow, either enhancing the classical coffee-stain effect or leading to a total flow inversion. Our measurements lead to unprecedented and detailed measurements of the surface tension difference along an evaporating <b>droplet's</b> <b>surface</b> with good temporal and spatial resolution.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this preliminary study was to obtain {{a better understanding of}} the influence of dietary fiber on the digestibility of emulsified lipids. The influence of fiber type (pectin and chitosan), fiber concentration (0 – 0. 5 wt%), and fiber molecular weight (15 and 2500 kDa chitosan) was examined on the ζ-potential, particle size and creaming stability of 5 wt% corn oil-in-water emulsions (1 wt% Tween 80) subjected to an in vitro digestion model (pH∼ 7, 1 h; pH∼ 2, 1 h; pH∼ 5. 3,+bile salts, 2 h; pH∼ 7. 5, 2 h: 37 °C). In the absence of dietary fiber, the emulsion droplets were anionic and remained stable to aggregation throughout the digestion model. Anionic pectin did not adsorb to the anionic <b>droplet</b> <b>surfaces</b> at any pH, but it promoted extensive droplet flocculation through a depletion mechanism. Cationic chitosan adsorbed to the <b>droplet</b> <b>surfaces</b> at some pH values and promoted droplet flocculation through a bridging mechanism. For example, at pH 5. 3, the electrical charge for the emulsion containing 0. 5 wt% chitosan (MW= 2500 kDa) was highly cationic (ζ≈+ 19 mV), whereas it was anionic (ζ≈− 12 mV) for the emulsion containing no chitosan, which indicated that chitosan bound to the <b>droplet</b> <b>surfaces.</b> On the other hand, low molecular weight chitosan (15 kDa) did not absorb to the <b>droplet</b> <b>surfaces</b> under the same conditions. These results may have important implications for understanding the influence of dietary fibers on lipid digestion, since they show that chitosan is able to bind to the <b>droplet</b> <b>surfaces</b> and pectin is able to promote droplet aggregation, which may decrease the access of digestive enzymes to the lipids, and therefore, decrease lipid digestion. This study could therefore be used to create food emulsions with low caloric level, or to optimize diets for individuals with lipid digestion problems...|$|R

When the iron tip is introduced a redox reaction starts in which iron is oxidized to the ferric ion. At the same time the oxidizing reagent is spent for instance when hydrogen peroxide together with hydronium ions is reduced to water.

50|$|In {{electrospray}} ionization (ESI), coeluted matrix components {{can influence}} signal intensity through a competition for available charges {{and for the}} access to the <b>droplet</b> <b>surface</b> for gas-phase emission, thus creating the so-called matrix effects. Matrix effects can occur {{at different stages of}} the interfacing process leading to unpredictably enhanced or suppressed signal response. Direct-EI interface, using a gas phase ionization technique, can eliminate most matrix effects observed with ESI. In fact, it is influenced neither by the mobile phase nor by other matrix components so that the signal response is always proportional only to analyte concentration. This simplifies sample preparation procedures that can be very complex and time consuming prior to ESI.|$|E
50|$|In the {{schematic}} to {{the right}} the contact angle between the <b>droplet</b> <b>surface</b> and the surface decreases {{from left to right}} (A to C), and we see that the surface area of the droplet decreases as the contact angle decreases. This geometrical effect reduces the barrier and hence results in faster nucleation on surfaces with smaller contact angles. Also, if instead of the surface being flat it curves towards fluid, then this also reduces the interfacial area and so the nucleation barrier. There are expressions for this reduction for simple surface geometries. In practice, this means we expect nucleation to be fastest on pits or cracks in surfaces made of material such that the nucleus forms a small contact angle on its surface.|$|E

The zeta-potential, mean particle diameter, microstructure, and creaming stability of emulsions containing beta-lactoglobulin-coated droplets and/or carrageenan molecules {{that had previously been}} heat treated at temperatures ranging from 30 to 90 degrees C for 20 min were measured (pH 6. 0, 150 mM NaCl). Three different heat treatments were used to establish the physicochemical origin of the {{influence of}} thermal history on the adsorption of carrageenan molecules to the protein coated droplets: (i) droplets and carrageenan were mixed at room temperature, then heated together; (ii) droplets were heated, cooled to room temperature, then mixed with carrageenan; (iii) carrageenan was heated, cooled to room temperature, then mixed with droplets. For treatments i and ii appreciably more carrageenan adsorbed to the protein-coated <b>droplet</b> <b>surfaces</b> at temperatures 3 ̆c or = 60 degrees C than at higher temperatures. For treatment iii, carrageenan adsorbed to the <b>droplet</b> <b>surfaces</b> across the whole temperature range. These results suggest that an irreversible thermal denaturation of the adsorbed beta-lactoglobulin molecules inhibited the adsorption of carrageenan molecules to the <b>droplet</b> <b>surfaces.</b> We postulate that there is a patch of positive charge {{on the surface of the}} native globular protein molecules which becomes more diffuse upon thermal denaturation. We found that the carrageenan molecules were unable to protect the beta-lactoglobulin-coated droplets at high temperatures (T 3 ̆e 60 degrees C) because they desorbed from the <b>droplet</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Nevertheless, adsorption of iota-carrageenan was capable of protecting the droplets against flocculation caused by surface denaturation of the adsorbed proteins at lower temperatures (T 3 ̆c or = 50 degrees C) ...|$|R

In this study, emulsion {{heat stability}} was evaluated with a special focus on the contributionof WPM adsorbed at the fat <b>droplet</b> <b>surface</b> and in the continuous phase of the emulsion. Dairyemulsions were prepared with 30 % milk fat and 70 % suspension of WPM in the dispersed phase of milk. The protein interfacial load and the composition of the fat <b>droplet</b> <b>surface</b> were determined immediatelyafter emulsion formation, and the heat stability of the emulsions at 120 C was assessed visually and atmicroscopic scale. WPM are heat stable in the continuous phase of the emulsion, but the presence ofWPM at the surface of the fat droplets is responsible for a rapid gelation of the emulsions. In the heatedemulsions, the fat droplets seemed to be crosslinked by WPM.

The focus of the present study is in the organic compounds that are surface active i. e. they concentrate on <b>droplet</b> <b>surface</b> and decrease <b>droplet</b> <b>surface</b> tension. Gibbsian surface thermodynamics were used to find out how partitioning in binary and ternary aqueous solutions affects the <b>droplet</b> <b>surface</b> tension and the droplet bulk concentration in droplets large enough to act as cloud condensation nuclei. Sodium dodecyl sulfate was used as a model compound together with sodium chloride to find out the effect the correct evaluation of surfactant partitioning has on the solute effect (Raoult effect). While the partitioning is known to lead to higher surface tension compared to a case in which partitioning is neglected, the present results show that the partitioning also alters the solute effect, and that the change is large enough to further increase the critical supersaturation and hence decrease the droplet activation. The fraction of surfactant partitioned to <b>droplet</b> <b>surface</b> increases with decreasing droplet size, which suggests that surfactants might enhance the activation of larger particles relatively more thus leading to less dense clouds. Cis-pinonic acid-ammonium sulfate aqueous solution was studied in order to relate the partitioning to more realistic atmospheric situation and to find out the combined effects of dissolution and partitioning behaviour.

The influence of droplet concentration, mean droplet diameter, droplet charge and polyelectrolyte concentration on the aggregation stability of the emulsions was examined. Emulsions stabilized by a globular protein (β-lactoglobulin) were prepared with different oil droplet (0. 5 − 10 wt %) and pectin (0 − 0. 5 wt %) concentrations at pH 7 (where lipid droplets and pectin molecules were both anionic) and pH 3. 5 (where lipid droplets were cationic and pectin molecules anionic).

At pH 7, there was no evidence of pectin adsorption to <b>droplet</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and the emulsions were stable to bridging flocculation, but depletion flocculation occurred when the pectin concentration exceeded about 0. 1 wt % (independent of droplet concentration).
