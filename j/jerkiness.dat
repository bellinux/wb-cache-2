25|$|The {{mechanics}} of drag systems usually consist of {{any number of}} discs (drag washers) arranged in a stack on the spool shaft or in some cases, on the drive shaft. There is generally a screw or lever mechanism that presses against the washers—the higher the pressure, the greater the resistance. Drag washers are commonly made of materials such as steel, Teflon, carbon fiber, other reinforced plastics or metal alloys. Since large fish can generate a lot of pulling power, reels with higher available drag forces (which generate greater heat) for higher-test lines will use stronger and more heat-resistant materials than reels designed for low-test lines. A good drag system is consistent (generates the same force over and over), durable and smooth (no <b>jerkiness).</b>|$|E

60|$|Jimmy {{looked over}} his shoulder. Down the lower terrace was {{approaching}} the long form of his lordship. He walked with pensive <b>jerkiness,</b> not as one hurrying to a welcome tryst. As Jimmy looked, he vanished behind the great clump of laurels that stood on the lowest terrace. In another minute, he would reappear round them.|$|E
60|$|Betty said nothing, {{but rather}} thought Kit another man. He looked {{stronger}} {{and his skin}} was brown. Then something about his voice and carriage indicated quiet confidence. At Liverpool when Kit was resolute he was, so to speak, aggressive, {{as if he wanted}} others to remark his firmness. Now his glance was calm, his nervous <b>jerkiness</b> had gone. All the same, she thought he had not got fresh qualities but developed those he had. Betty knew Kit.|$|E
60|$|His Eminence {{rested his}} elbow {{on the arm}} of his chair and his head in his {{delicate}} white hands. The purple robes fell round him in majestic folds, the gold crucifix at his breast sparkled with jewels: he was a past master in the art of mise-en-scène, and knew the full value of impressive pauses and of effective attitudes during a momentous conversation, more especially when he had to deal with a woman. His present silence helped to set the young girl's aching nerves on edge, and he noticed with a sense of inward satisfaction that her composure was not as profound as she would have him think: there was a distinct tremor in the delicate nostrils, a <b>jerkiness</b> in the movements of her hand, as she smoothed out the folds of her sombre gown.|$|E
6000|$|... "This 'ere Burma fever is a {{bad thing}} to have. It's pulled me down awful; an' now I am going to Peshawar. Are you the Station-master?" [...] It was Thomas--white-cheeked, sunken-eyed, drawn-mouthed Thomas--travelling from Nasirabad to Peshawar on pass; and with him was a Corporal new to his stripes and doing station duty. Every Thomas is interesting, except when he is too drunk to speak. This Thomas was an enthusiast. He had volunteered, from a Home-going {{regiment}} shattered by Burma fever, into a regiment at Peshawar, had broken down at Nasirabad on his way up with his draft, and was now journeying into the unknown to pick up another medal. [...] "There's sure to be something on the Frontier," [...] said this gaunt, haggard boy--he was little more, though he reckoned four years' service and considered himself somebody. [...] "When there's anything going, Peshawar's the place to be in, they tell me; but I hear we shall have to march down to Calcutta in no time." [...] The Corporal was a little man and showed his friend off with great pride: [...] "Ah, you should have come to us," [...] said he; [...] "we're the regiment, we are." [...] "Well, I went with the rest of our men," [...] said Thomas. [...] "There's three hundred of us volunteered to stay on, and we all went for the same regiment. Not but what I'm saying yours is a good regiment," [...] he added with grave courtesy. This loosed the Corporal's tongue, and he descanted on the virtues of the regiment and the merits of the officers. It has been written that Thomas is devoid of esprit de corps, because of the <b>jerkiness</b> of the arrangements under which he now serves. If this be true, he manages to conceal his feelings very well; for he speaks most fluently in praise of his own regiment; and, for all his youth, has a keen appreciation of the merits of his officers. Go to him when his heart is opened, and hear him going through the roll of the subalterns, by a grading totally unknown in the Army List, and you will pick up something worth the hearing. Thomas, with the Burma fever on him, tried to cut in, from time to time, with stories of his officers and what they had done [...] "when we was marchin' all up and down Burma," [...] but the little Corporal went on gayly.|$|E

50|$|<b>Jerkiness,</b> {{sometimes}} called strobing or choppy, describes {{the perception of}} individual still images in a motion picture.|$|E
50|$|Another {{option for}} {{reducing}} the impression of <b>jerkiness</b> {{is to reduce the}} time between the frames of a wiggle image.|$|E
5000|$|A spatial {{application}} is a technological application (such as video) requiring high spatial resolution, possibly {{at the expense}} of reduced temporal positioning accuracy, i.e., increased <b>jerkiness.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{conventional}} cinematography, {{the images}} are filmed and displayed at 24 frames per second, at which speed <b>jerkiness</b> is not normally discernible.Television screens refresh at even higher frequencies. PAL and SÉCAM television (the standards in Europe) refresh at 25 or 50 (HDTV) frames per second. NTSC television displays (the standard in North America) refresh at 29.97 frames per second.Animated cartoon films are typically made at reduced frame rates (accomplished by shooting several film frames of the individual drawings) so as to limit production costs, {{with the result that}} <b>jerkiness</b> tends to be apparent, especially on older limited animation features.|$|E
50|$|Attempts {{to convert}} the NTSC version back to PAL format using {{traditional}} conversion processes yielded unsatisfactory results. Such double conversions produce artifacts that manifest themselves as <b>jerkiness</b> in the picture where movement is present, and in soft-looking pictures.|$|E
50|$|Positional alcohol {{nystagmus}} (PAN) is nystagmus (visible <b>jerkiness</b> in eye movement) produced {{when the}} head is placed in a sideways position. PAN occurs when the specific gravity of the membrane space of the semicircular canals in the ear differs from the specific gravity of the fluid in the canals {{because of the presence}} of alcohol.|$|E

5000|$|David Lifton {{wrote that}} the Zapruder film was in the {{possession}} of the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center by the night of the assassination.

50|$|Motion {{pictures}} {{are made from}} still images shown in rapid sequence. Provided there is sufficient continuity between the images and provided the sequence is shown fast enough, {{the central nervous system}} interprets the sequence as continuous motion. However, some technologies cannot process or carry data fast enough for sufficiently high frame rates. For example, viewing motion pictures by Internet connection generally necessitates a greatly reduced frame rate, making <b>jerkiness</b> clearly apparent.|$|E
50|$|The {{mismatch}} between NTSC's 30 {{frames per second}} and film's 24 frames is overcome by a process that capitalizes on the field rate of the interlaced NTSC signal, thus avoiding the film playback speedup used for 576i systems at 25 frames per second (which causes the accompanying audio to increase in pitch slightly, sometimes rectified {{with the use of}} a pitch shifter) at the price of some <b>jerkiness</b> in the video. See Frame rate conversion above.|$|E
5000|$|Phil Tippett built a {{model for}} the scenes in which the dragon would be {{required}} to walk. Tippett did not want to use standard stop motion animation techniques, and had his team build a dragon model which would move during each exposure rather than in between as was once the standard. This process, named [...] "go motion" [...] by Tippett, recorded the creature's movements in motion as a real animal would move, and removed the <b>jerkiness</b> common in prior stop motion films.|$|E
50|$|Fluid {{heads are}} the {{dominant}} tripod heads {{used in the}} motion picture industry. They provide extremely smooth free movement, even with the heaviest of filmmaking and professional video cameras. The fluid {{reduces the risk of}} the camera operator introducing any <b>jerkiness</b> or vibration to the shot during a pan or tilt through dampening, and also reduces the friction between moving parts of the head. As the size of high-quality video cameras has become greatly reduced, there are now fluid heads designed even for consumer camcorders, which are being used increasingly in television production environments.|$|E
50|$|Deep Zoom is a {{technology}} developed by Microsoft for efficiently transmitting and viewing images. It {{allows users to}} pan around and zoom in a large, high resolution image or a large collection of images. It reduces the time required for initial load by downloading only the region being viewed or only at the resolution it is displayed at. Subsequent regions are downloaded as the user pans to (or zooms into them); animations are used to hide any <b>jerkiness</b> in the transition. The libraries are also available in other platforms including Java and Flash.|$|E
50|$|The {{driving wheels}} of the S6 had the rather unusual {{diameter}} of 2,100 mm {{in order to keep}} the rpm down and to guarantee the smooth running of the driving gear. Originally a diameter of 2,200 mm had been planned, but in the end it was reduced by 100 mm. The heavy balancing masses of the driving gear were badly affected by weight savings. That resulted in serious <b>jerkiness</b> when running. A remedy was achieved by coupling the tender closer to the locomotive and thus raising the compression of the buffer springs.|$|E
50|$|Other head types {{include the}} gimbal head, fluid head, gear head, alt-azimuth, and {{equatorial}} heads. Fluid heads and gear heads move very smoothly, avoiding the <b>jerkiness</b> {{caused by the}} stick-slip effect found in other types of tripod heads. Gimbal heads are single-axis heads used {{in order to allow}} a balanced movement for camera and lenses. This proves useful in wildlife photography as well as in any other case where very long and heavy telephoto lenses are adopted: a gimbal head rotates a lens around its center of gravity, thus allowing for easy and smooth manipulation while tracking moving subjects.|$|E

50|$|Cogging torque of {{electrical}} motors is the torque {{due to the}} interaction between the permanent magnets of the rotor and the stator slots of a Permanent Magnet (PM) machine. It is also known as detent or 'no-current' torque. This torque is position dependent and its periodicity per revolution depends on the number of magnetic poles and the number of teeth on the stator. Cogging torque is an undesirable component for the operation of such a motor. It is especially prominent at lower speeds, with the symptom of <b>jerkiness.</b> Cogging torque results in torque as well as speed ripple; however, at high speed the motor moment of inertia filters out the effect of cogging torque.|$|E

PAL and SECAM are less complex and demanding than NTSC for film-out. PAL and SECAM conversions do agitate, though, with the unpleasant choice between slowing down video (and audio pitch, noticeably) by four percent, from 25 to 24 frames per second, {{in order to maintain}} a 1:1 frame match, slightly changing the rhythm and feel of the program; or maintaining original speed by periodically dropping frames, thereby creating <b>jerkiness</b> and possible loss of vital detail in fast-moving action or precise edits.|$|E
5000|$|Quick-Draw McGraw of GamePro {{reviewed}} {{that the}} 3DO version has better graphics and audio than the earlier Genesis and SNES versions, {{but not to}} the extent that one would expect from the far more powerful hardware. He also criticized the <b>jerkiness</b> of the characters' moves, but acknowledged that there were very few street-ball games to offer competition, especially on the 3DO. A reviewer for Next Generation gave it two out of five stars, likewise stating that the 3DO version fails to offer significant enhancement over the versions on less powerful consoles. He added that [...] "In the end though, what kills this one is that the controls are so sluggish you'd think your Nikes had melted to the blacktop." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dick's {{screenplay}} {{differs from}} the source material, featuring numerous scenes {{that are not in}} the novel. According to the foreword of Ubik: The Screenplay (by Tim Powers, a friend of Dick's and fellow science fiction writer), Dick had an idea for the film which involved [...] "the film itself appearing to undergo a series of reversions: to black-and-white, then to the awkward <b>jerkiness</b> of very early movies, then to a crookedly jammed frame which proceeds to blacken, bubble and melt away, leaving only the white glare of the projection bulb, which in turn deteriorates to leave the theater in darkness, and might almost leave the moviegoer wondering what sort of dilapidated, antique jalopy he'll find his car-keys fitting when he goes outside." ...|$|E
5000|$|Canadians {{have contributed}} {{greatly to the}} {{technology}} and practices used to create animated television shows, movies and special effects. Starting in 1912, Canadian cartoonist and painter Raoul Barre introduced standard perforations in the drawing paper and [...] "peg bars" [...] to hold them in place which eliminated <b>jerkiness</b> when going from one image to the next. He also introduced the slash system, a method of drawing the background only once (instead of with each frame as had been done previously) on a separate sheet, leaving blank spaces for character movement. In 1913, Barre organized a systematic method of producing animated cartoons in an assembly line fashion. The assembly line method is essentially how all commercial animations (television, film etc.) are created to this day.|$|E

50|$|To trick {{the eye and}} {{the brain}} into {{thinking}} they are seeing a smoothly moving object, the pictures should be drawn at around 12 frames per second or faster. (A frame is one complete image.) With rates above 75-120 frames per second, no improvement in realism or smoothness is perceivable due {{to the way the}} eye and the brain both process images. At rates below 12 frames per second, most people can detect <b>jerkiness</b> associated with the drawing of new images that detracts from the illusion of realistic movement. Conventional hand-drawn cartoon animation often uses 15 frames per second in order to save on the number of drawings needed, but this is usually accepted because of the stylized nature of cartoons. To produce more realistic imagery, computer animation demands higher frame rates.|$|E
5000|$|Stop-motion {{animation}} is {{the last}} point Halberstam touches on in this chapter. She goes into examples of [...] "Spongebob Squarepants", [...] "Mr. Fox", [...] "Chicken Run" [...] and [...] "Coraline" [...] explaining how ideas of racism, entrapment, masculinity and political progression are present heavily in stop-motion films. Themes of remote control and imprisonment are also heavily present in stop-motion animation. The use of stop-motion animation can help evoke different emotions as well. For example, in Chicken Run, the start-stop <b>jerkiness</b> allows the narrative {{to be even more}} humorous.
