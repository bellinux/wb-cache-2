Wick and Lonnie Trumbull, both 20, were bludgeoned with a {{piece of}} lumber as they slept in their {{basement}} apartment in Seattle's Queen Anne Hill district on June 23, 1966 near the Safeway store where Bundy worked at the time, and where the women regularly shopped. Trumbull died. In retrospect, Keppel noted many similarities to the Chi Omega crime scene. Wick, who suffered permanent memory loss {{as a result of the}} attack, later contacted Ann Rule: [...] "I know that it was Ted Bundy who <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> us," [...] she wrote, [...] "but I can't tell you how I know." [...] In the absence of incriminating evidence, Bundy's involvement remains speculative.|$|E
500|$|Aguilera's {{new image}} was so widely {{rejected}} by the public that it began to overshadow her music. Tim Walker from The Independent wrote: [...] " [...] simulated masturbation while wearing {{little more than a}} pair of leather chaps." [...] Entertainment Weekly described Aguilera's image in the video as [...] "the world's skeeziest reptile woman," [...] and The Village Voice captioned her as a xenomorph from the Alien series. Aguilera's contemporaries Shakira, Kelly Osbourne, and Jessica Simpson expressed disapproval of the video. Time magazine commented that [...] "she appeared to have arrived on the set... direct from an intergalactic hooker convention." [...] Jancee Dunn of Rolling Stone dubbed the video [...] "Girls Gone Wild: Beyond Thunderdome". Writer Emma Forrest remarked: [...] "What she's depicting is subcultures within sexuality, and {{to say that this is}} normal young woman's sexuality is just not fair. ...

500|$|Timberlake and Scott Storch wrote [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] with Timbaland, who {{produced}} the song. Storch found working with Timberlake easy {{because of the}} song's meaning. Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, [...] "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal {{with a couple of}} things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you." [...] In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [...] could tell I was visibly angry." [...] Timbaland recalled, [...] "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth'".|$|E

500|$|The film {{features}} both {{original and}} existing music tracks. Tracks composed {{specifically for the}} film include [...] "100 Black Coffins" [...] by Rick Ross and produced by and featuring Jamie Foxx, [...] "Who <b>Did</b> <b>That</b> <b>To</b> You?" [...] by John Legend, [...] "Ancora Qui" [...] by Ennio Morricone and Elisa, and [...] "Freedom" [...] by Anthony Hamilton and Elayna Boynton. The theme, [...] "Django", was also the theme song of the 1966 film. Musician Frank Ocean wrote an original song for the film's soundtrack, but it was rejected by Tarantino, who explained that [...] "Ocean wrote a fantastic ballad that was truly lovely and poetic in every way, there just wasn't a scene for it." [...] Frank Ocean later published the song, entitled [...] "Wiseman", on his Tumblr blog. The film also features a few famous pieces of western classical music, including Beethoven's [...] "Für Elise" [...] and [...] "Dies Irae" [...] from Verdi's Requiem. Tarantino has stated that he avoids using full scores of original music: [...] "I just don't {{like the idea of}} giving that much power to anybody on one of my movies." [...] The film's soundtrack album was released on December 18, 2012. Ennio Morricone made statements criticizing Tarantino's use of his music in Django Unchained and stated that he would [...] "never work" [...] with the director after this film, but later agreed to compose an original film score for Tarantino's The Hateful Eight in 2015. In a scholarly essay on the film's music, Hollis Robbins notes {{that the vast majority of}} film music borrowings come from films made between 1966 and 1974 and argues that the political and musical resonances of these allusions situate Django Unchained squarely in the Vietnam and Watergate era, during the rise and decline of Black Power cinema. Jim Croce's hit I Got A Name was featured in the soundtrack.|$|E

Furthermore, [...] "the State never {{announced that it was}} relying exclusively upon the burning."

2500|$|Pang Tong later {{served as}} an Officer of Merit (功曹) in Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jiangling County, Hubei). He was an appraiser. When he {{reviewed}} people, he focused more on their personal virtues rather than their abilities. He was fond of ethical lessons and consistently strove to maintain high moral standards. He usually overpraised {{when he was asked}} to assess a person. At times, people were puzzled so they questioned him on why he <b>did</b> <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> which he replied, [...] "The world is currently in disorder. Good people are overwhelmed by the evil.

French philosopher Jean Guitton said that Pope Paul VI's intention was to assimilate the Catholic liturgy to the Protestant: [...] "The intention of Paul VI with regard to what is commonly called the Mass, was to reform the Catholic liturgy in such a way that it should almost coincide with the Protestant liturgy – but what is curious is that Paul VI <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> get as close as possible to the Protestant Lord's Supper, ... there was with Paul VI an ecumenical intention to remove, or at least to correct, or to relax, what was too Catholic, in the traditional sense, in the Mass and, I repeat, to get the Catholic Mass closer to the Calvinist Mass." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1974 French Open, Evert {{would play}} {{good friend and}} doubles partner Olga Morozova in the final, who just {{happened}} to be her doubles partner at the event, which they won doubles together as a team. In the final, Evert dominated the first set to the tune of a 40 lead before Morozova was able to get on the board on her third service game, which was the fifth game of the set, but Evert would win the set 61. The second set was just an inkling more competitive because Morozova broke Evert's serve in the fifth and seventh games of the set, but would never hold onto her serve during the entire set, which allowed Evert to win it at 6 games to 2. This was the first ever Grand Slam victory for Evert that came because Morozova was regularly going to the net, which gave Evert ample room to pass or lob, and Evert <b>did</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> get effect in [...] "the biggest title I've ever won" [...] stated Evert.|$|E

Whilst it has never been clarified, the city in the background is believed to depict Los Angeles in the United States where the album was recorded and mixed. Ian Watkins said that he regarded artwork as [...] "just as important as the music", and in January 2010 reflected back on some of the Lostprophets' artwork saying [...] "I remember doing the ‘Start Something’ record and compiling the inlay which is a collage of two years of our lives.
