40|$|With the {{combination}} of micropumps and flow sensors, highly accurate and secure closed-loop controlled micro <b>dosing</b> <b>systems</b> for liquids are possible. Implementing a single stroke based control mode with piezoelectrically driven micro diaphragm pumps can provide a solution for dosing of volumes down to nanoliters or variable average flow rates {{in the range of}} nL/min to μL/min. However, sensor technologies feature a yet undetermined accuracy for measuring highly pulsatile micropump flow. Two miniaturizable in-line sensor types providing electrical readout differential pressure based flow sensors and thermal calorimetric flow sensors are evaluated for their suitability of combining them with mircopumps. Single stroke based calibration of the sensors was carried out with a new method, com paring displacement volumes and sensor flow volumes. Limitations of accuracy and performance for single stroke based flow control are described. Results showed that besides particle robustness of sensors, controlling resistive and capacitive damping are key aspects for setting up reproducible and reliable liquid <b>dosing</b> <b>systems.</b> Depending on the required average flow or defined volume, <b>dosing</b> <b>systems</b> with an accuracy of better than 5 % for the differential pressure based sensor and better than 6. 5 % for the thermal calorimeter were achieved...|$|R

40|$|With {{the future}} {{prospect}} of {{increased levels of}} resistance in pest populations {{there is a need}} to use longer exposures for phosphine fumigation of commodities to retain treatment efficacy. Trials in grain bins and on floor-stored grain have shown that it is possible to maintain adequate concentrations of gas throughout the bulk for lengthy periods using phosphine in carbon dioxide from cylinders. An automated <b>dosing</b> <b>system</b> for cylinder-based phosphine has been developed and tested by the Central Science Laboratory. The performance of the <b>dosing</b> <b>system</b> was compared with the SirofloR system that has been developed by CSIRO in Australia. Both systems were tested in a silo containing 700 tonnes of feed wheat and in a floor store containing 150 tonnes of feed wheat. The automated <b>dosing</b> <b>system</b> coupled with re-circulation gave comparable results to the SirofloR system. It may not be possible to maintain an even gas distribution using the automated <b>dosing</b> <b>system</b> without circulation in windy weather or during times of widely fluctuating diurnal temperatures. An alternative to phosphine for grain treatments developed at CSL is the use of the exhaust gas from propane combustion, using a purpose-designed self-cooling burner.

40|$|Purpose: To analyze {{temporal}} {{changes in}} human {{resources in the}} radiotherapy section, quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) and dose difference for radiotherapy in the Hokuriku area {{based on the results}} of past investigations and our investigation. Method: We visited radiotherapy sections of 17 hospitals in the Hokuriku area (5 in Toyama, 9 in Ishikawa and 3 in Fukui) to measure the dose at the reference point of a linear accelerator (LINAC), as we asked questions to a radiotherapist about human resources, QA/QC of LINAC, etc. We compared our results with past reports (1992 to 2007) on the dose difference, human resources and frequency of <b>dose</b> monitor <b>system</b> calibration. Results: The number of physicians has not changed since 1999, but the number of radiotherapists was significantly increased. Weekly <b>dose</b> monitor <b>system</b> calibration has been achieved in 80 % of the institutions in our survey. This percentage was significantly higher than in the past surveys. The dose difference distribution from our onsite dosimetry did not significantly differ from that from the onsite dosimetry in 2007. 91 % of the institutions have accomplished within 2 % of the dose difference. Conclusion: We found that the number of physicians has not increased since 1999, but the number of radiotherapists has increased. We conclude that the increment of radiotherapists led to 80 % achievement of the weekly <b>dose</b> monitor <b>system</b> calibration.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{traditional}} and the unit <b>dose</b> pharmacy distribution <b>system</b> {{were compared to}} determine which one, in thd opinion of hospital pharmacists and administrators, is best suited {{to the needs of}} hospitals of less than 200 beds. The comparison was made by having the pharmacists rate the alternative distribution systems on five criteria at four hospital size categories. The hospital size categories were less than 50 beds, 50 to 100 beds, 100 to 150 beds and greater than 150 beds. The comparison criteria were cost, control of medication, pharmacist utilization, patient safety and loss and pilferage. Each criterion had a certain amount of weight in determining the final rating of each distribution system. This weight was determined by the administrators' and pharmacists' rating of the importance of each criteria in governing the type of distribution system used in a hospital. The final rating given each distribution system at a given hospital size was the sum of the products of the rating of each criterion and its respective importance rating, for all the criteria. The final results showed that the unit <b>dose</b> distribution <b>system</b> was felt to be substantially more suited to the needs of small hospitals.
