We used X-ray computed tomography (XCT) to acquire cross-sectional images of the floating liquid marble and interface between the different phases.

However, the contact angles formed and deformation of the liquid marble resemble that of a sessile liquid droplet on a thin, elastic solid. For small liquid marbles, the contact angle varies with volume due to the deformability of the interface. Griffith Sciences, School of Natural SciencesFull Tex...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this article, a new {{proportional}} pneumatic floating {{vacuum pad}} is developed and constructed. There are two features concerning this new vacuum pad. The {{first is the}} inclusion of a proportional solenoid, which enables the continuously variable control of the suction force output. The <b>floating</b> <b>mechanism</b> design between the vacuum pad and the work-piece is the second feature, which is more preferable in real industries because it can protect the surface of the work-piece from scratches or other damage. Moreover, in addition to the open-loop gap control mode, two closed-loop gap control schemes are proposed in this paper. The first is the constant gap control. A preset gap is input to the controller as the command input that further drives the proportional solenoid to maintain a steady-state gap between the vacuum pad and the work-piece. In the second control approach, the gap between the vacuum pad and the work-piece is kept as large as possible to minimize the energy consumption. Both closed-loop control schemes are successfully implemented in this study...|$|E

Present {{investigation was}} to formulate, evaluate and optimize gastro retentive tablet of DiltiazemHCl. This tablets released drug till 24 hrs due to <b>floating</b> <b>mechanism</b> of polymers. Gastro retentive floating tablets were prepared by direct compression method using various proportions of polymersHPMC K 4 M, HPMC K 100 M,Carbopol 934, Ethyl cellulose, Xanthan gum along with Sodium bicarbonatethe sustained release behaviour of the fabricated tablets was investigated. Tablets were prepared by directcompretiontechnique. Formulation was optimized on the basis of acceptable tablet properties and in vitro drug release. The resulting formulation produced robust tablets with optimum hardness, consistent weight uniformity and low friability. All tablets but one exhibited gradual and near-complete sustained release for DiltiazemHCl (90 - 100 %) at the end of 24 h. The results of dissolution studies indicated that formulation Dtz 15 was found to be most successful as it exhibits drug release pattern very close to theoretical release profile.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Gastroretentive drug {{delivery}} systems (GRDDS) {{play an important}} role in the delivery of drug substances to the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract; they offer a possibility to overcome the limited gastric residence time of conventional dosage forms. AIMS: The aim of the study was to understand drug-release and floatation mechanisms of a floating GRDDS based on functionalized calcium carbonate (FCC). The inherently low apparent density of the excipient (approx. 0. 6 g/cm(3)) enabled a mechanism of floatation. The higher specific surface of FCC (approx. 70 m(2)) allowed sufficient hardness of resulting compacts. The <b>floating</b> <b>mechanism</b> of GRDDS was simulated in silico under simulated acidic and neutral conditions, and the results were compared to those obtained in vitro. METHODS: United States Pharmacopeia (USP) dissolution methods are of limited usefulness for evaluating floating behavior and drug release of floating dosage forms. Therefore, we developed a custom-built stomach model to simultaneously analyze floating characteristics and drug release. In silico dissolution and floatation profiles of the FCC-based tablet were simulated using a three-dimensional cellular automata-based model. RESULTS: In simulated gastric fluid, the FCC-based tablets showed instant floatation. The compacts stayed afloat during the measurement in 0. 1 N HCl and eroded completely while releasing the model drug substance. When water was used as dissolution medium, the tablets had no floating lag time and sank down during the measurement, resulting in a change of release kinetics. CONCLUSIONS: Floating dosage forms based on FCC appear promising. It was possible to manufacture floating tablets featuring a density of less than unity and sufficient hardness for further processing. In silico dissolution simulation offered a possibility to understand floating behavior and drug-release mechanism...|$|E

Furthermore, the relatively low production costs of the privately owned Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (FPCC) disclosed the pricing mechanism of CPC, which inspired FPCC to adopt pricing strategy in order to increase the market share. This study aims to establish a system dynamics model to analyze the effects of the <b>floating</b> price <b>mechanism</b> on Taiwan's gasoline and diesel markets. This Model is divided into four sub-systems. The model of this study passed several validation tests, and hence, is able to provide a "virtual laboratory" for policy-makers to conduct simulation and scenario analysis. The simulation results indicate (a) feedback mechanism of expected revenues and pricing strategy could efficiently simulate the FPCC pricing mechanism, (b) price competition strategy could increase FPCC revenues, although the effect on market share is not remarkable, and (c) FPCC has a higher gas-station growth rate.

Sodium alginate-based in-situ gelling systems were prepared by dissolving various concentrations of sodium alginate in deionized water, to which varying concentrations of drug and calcium bicarbonate were added. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to check the presence of any interaction between the drug and the excipients. A 32 full factorial design was used for optimization. The concentrations of sodium alginate (X 1) and calcium bicarbonate (X 2) were selected as the independent variables. The amount of the drug released after 1 h (Q 1) and 10 h (Q 10) and the viscosity of the solution were selected as the dependent variables. The gels were studied for their viscosity, in-vitro buoyancy and drug release. Contour plots were drawn for each dependent variable and check-point batches were prepared {{in order to get}} desirable release profiles. The drug release profiles were fitted into different kinetic models. The floating lag time and floating time found to be 2 min and 12 h respectively. A decreasing trend in drug release was observed with increasing concentrations of CaCO 3. The computed values of Q 1 and Q 10 for the check-point batch were 25 % and 86 % respectively, compared to the experimental values of 27. 1 % and 88. 34 %. The similarity factor (f 2) for the check-point batch being 80. 25 showed that the two dissolution profiles were similar.
