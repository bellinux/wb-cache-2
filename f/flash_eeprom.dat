50|$|The Program and Debug Interface (PDI) is an Atmel {{proprietary}} interface {{for external}} programming and on-chip debugging of XMEGA devices. The PDI supports high-speed programming of all non-volatile memory (NVM) spaces; <b>flash,</b> <b>EEPROM,</b> fuses, lock-bits and the User Signature Row. This {{is done by}} accessing the XMEGA NVM controller through the PDI interface, and executing NVM controller commands. The PDI is a 2-pin interface using the Reset pin for clock input (PDI_CLK) and a dedicated data pin (PDI_DATA) for input and output.|$|E
50|$|Because {{they are}} written by forcing {{electrons}} through {{a layer of}} electrical insulation onto a floating transistor gate, rewriteable ROMs can withstand {{only a limited number}} of write and erase cycles before the insulation is permanently damaged. In the earliest EPROMs, this might occur after as few as 1,000 write cycles, while in modern <b>Flash</b> <b>EEPROM</b> the endurance may exceed 1,000,000. The limited endurance, as well as the higher cost per bit, means that Flash-based storage is unlikely to completely supplant magnetic disk drives in the near future.|$|E
50|$|On many Alpha {{computer}} systems - for example, the Digital Personal Workstation - both SRM and ARC could be loaded onto the EEPROM which held the boot firmware. However, on some smaller systems (or large systems which were {{never intended to}} boot Windows), {{only one of the}} two boot firmware variants could fit onto the EEPROM at one time. For example, the <b>flash</b> <b>EEPROM</b> of the DEC Multia, which was a small, personal Alpha AXP workstation designed to run Windows NT, was only large enough to hold a single firmware.|$|E

5000|$|Flash memory (or simply flash) is {{a modern}} type of EEPROM invented in 1984. Flash memory can be erased and rewritten faster than {{ordinary}} EEPROM, and newer designs feature very high endurance (exceeding 1,000,000 cycles). Modern NAND flash makes efficient use of silicon chip area, resulting in individual ICs with a capacity as high as 32 GB this feature, along with its endurance and physical durability, has allowed NAND flash to replace magnetic in some applications (such as USB flash drives). Flash memory is sometimes called flash ROM or <b>flash</b> <b>EEPROM</b> when used {{as a replacement for}} older ROM types, but not in applications that take advantage of its ability to be modified quickly and frequently.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 Andre LaMothe {{launched}} his new HYDRA Game Development Kit, {{a much more}} powerful system than the XGS Micro Edition. Unlike the other systems by Nurve, the Hydra does not carry the XGS branding. The Hydra uses the multi-core Parallax Propeller microcontroller, which has an architecture resembling the Cell microprocessor used in the PlayStation 3. The Propeller runs at 80 MHz and uses eight processor cores, called COGs, to reach a performance of 160 MIPS. It also has much more memory than the Micro Edition's SX52: 32K RAM and a 32K ROM which contains a bitmap font for the video display generator, (the Propeller can generate a high quality VGA or PAL/NTSC color picture using software and some special support logic built into each CPU core), tables for mathematical function, and an interpreter for the multi threaded SPIN language. Each CPU core also has its own 2K RAM (512 32bit words) of dedicated memory. For input, the system has two PS/2 ports for a mouse and keyboard (which are sold with the system) and two NES compatible game controller ports (one game controller is included). The system also has a mini USB interface for programming the system, an RJ-11 Ethernet port, and a 128K serial <b>Flash</b> <b>EEPROM</b> for storage. There are also add-ons, such as a 512K external RAM card.|$|E
40|$|A new physics-based {{model of}} leakage current {{suitable}} for MOS and Flash memory gate oxide {{is presented in}} this paper. This model, which assumes the multi-Phonon Trap-Assisted Tunneling as conduction mechanism, calculates the total leakage current summing {{the contributions of the}} percolation paths formed by one or more aligned traps. Spatial positions and energetic levels of traps have been randomly generated within the oxide by a random number generator which has been integrated into the model. Using this model, statistical simulations of leakage currents measured from both MOS and <b>Flash</b> <b>EEPROM</b> memory tunnel oxides have been carried out. In this way, experimental leakage current distributions can be directly reproduced, thus opening a wide range of useful applications in MOS and <b>Flash</b> <b>EEPROM</b> memory reliability prediction...|$|E
40|$|A novel scheme called soft {{secondary}} electron programming (SSEP) is introduced and {{shown to be}} a promising programming mechanism for scaled NOR <b>flash</b> <b>EEPROMs.</b> SSEP involves use of an "optimum" VB that results in a lower drain disturb compared to both channel hot electron (CHE) and channel initiated {{secondary electron}} (CHISEL) mechanisms. The concept behind minimizing drain disturb is discussed.

40|$|Cycling induced {{performance}} degradation of <b>flash</b> <b>EEPROMs</b> {{has been reported}} for VB= 0 and VB< 0 programming operation.

As a consequence, programming under VB< 0 condition has been found to cause lower degradation of programming time and programmed VT due to cycling. © IEE...|$|R
40|$|The {{programming}} performance, {{cycling endurance}} and scaling of CHISEL NOR <b>flash</b> <b>EEPROMs</b> is studied for two different (halo and no-halo) channel engineering schemes. Programming speed under identical bias, bias requirements under similar programming time, cycling endurance and drain disturb are compared. The scaling properties of programming time (at a fixed bias), bias (at a fixed programming time) and program/disturb margin are studied as cell floating gate length is scaled.

40|$|A new <b>flash</b> <b>EEPROM</b> {{cell and}} a novel erasing scheme on SOI {{substrates}} are reported. This <b>flash</b> <b>EEPROM</b> cell incorporates two separate control gates, located an {{opposite sides of}} the silicon film. One is a conventional control gate fabricated on top of the film as in bulk cells. The second control gate is the back gate itself, which is located underneath the silicon film and is inherent to all SOI MOSFET structures. As usual, the front control gate is used to WRITE the cell. By contrast, the back control gate is used to ERASE the cell in a new erasing scheme arrangement. In this scheme the back gate and the drain are used to invert the back channel and operate it in the impact ionization regime, such as to produce electron/hole pairs. Most of the generated electrons flow into the drain and some are injected into the back (buried) oxide. The holes, however, are accelerated towards the front gate, and many are finally injected into the floating gate, sandwiched between the front gate dioxide and front control gate. A prototype <b>flash</b> <b>EEPROM</b> cell was fabricated using a standard 1 -metal, 1 -poly CMOS SOI process and tested for concept proof.

40|$|Multi-level (ML) {{storage is}} {{becoming}} an important option to achieve high-density <b>flash</b> <b>EEPROMs.</b> This is done by storing different amount of charges in the floating gate (FG) to reliably distinguish different levels and treating these levels as different combination of bits. Since large amount of charges need to be stored in FG for ML operation, faster programming is required so that the overall writing speed is not compromised. In addition, {{this needs to be}} done without much increase in programming power. Recently, CHannel Initiated Secondary ELectron (CHISEL) injection was shown as an excellent low power and fast programming scheme for NOR <b>flash</b> <b>EEPROMs.</b> The performance, scalability and reliability of CHISEL were demonstrated for bi-level programming. However {{to the best of our}} knowledge, very few studies have focused on the feasibility of using CHISEL mechanism for ML programming. This paper demonstrates the performance and reliability of flash cells under ML CHISEL programming operation. Program transients show excellent self-convergence leading to accurate VT control. Six different bitcell doping schemes were studied and optimized doping is identified based on their program and drain-disturb performance. Cycling endurance was studied on the optimized bitcell. Programmed VT levels show very little degradation, program transients retain their self-convergence, program/disturb margin remains within limit while only the erased VT level shows some degradation after 100 K cycling. The impact of bitcell scaling on the performance and reliability of ML CHISEL programming is also explored. © IEE...|$|R
