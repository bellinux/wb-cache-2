2500|$|For {{standing}} castration, {{the colt}} or stallion is sedated, typically with detomidine {{with or without}} butorphanol, and often physically restrained. [...] Local anaesthetic is injected into the parenchyma of both testes. An incision is made through the scrotum and the testes are removed, then the spermatic cord is crushed, most commonly with either ligatures or <b>emasculators,</b> or both. The <b>emasculators</b> are applied {{for two to three}} minutes, then removed, and a careful check is made for signs of haemorrhage. Assuming that bleeding is at a minimum, the other side is castrated in the same manner. Most veterinarians remove the testis held most [...] "tightly" [...] (or close to the body) by the cremaster muscle first, so as to minimize the risk of the horse withdrawing it {{to the point where it}} is inaccessible. The horse, now a gelding, is allowed to recover.|$|R
50|$|Male {{horses are}} usually {{castrated}} (gelded) using <b>emasculators,</b> because stallions are rather aggressive and troublesome.

Salon {{appreciated}} the [...] "effortless comic chemistry" [...] between Sudeikis, Bateman and Day and singled out Bateman, Aniston and Spacey for their performances. O'Hehir was however critical of the perceived homophobia, sexism and racism. The Hollywood Reporters Kirk Honeycutt responded negatively, stating the jokes failed to be funny, stating [...] "Seth Gordon shows no flair for turning the absurdities and cartoonish characters in the script...into {{anything more than a}} collection of moments in search of laughs." [...] Karina Longworth of The Village Voice was critical of the premise, which she felt lacked any legitimate [...] "rage" [...] against the characters' bosses, stating [...] "...there's every sign that, even without these particular <b>emasculators,</b> Dale, Kurt and Nick would still be—for lack of a better word—total pussies." [...] Longworth felt that the humor was [...] "rarely actually laugh-out-loud funny, and never truly dark or daring". She particularly criticized the all-white, male protagonists and a plot she deemed racist and filled with [...] "stereotypes". Justin Chang of Variety praised the performance of the ensemble cast, but considered the plot to be [...] "predictably moronic, vulgar and juvenile". Chang echoed the sentiments of The Village Voice in lamenting that the film failed to pursue the premise to [...] "darker, more daring territory" [...] and faulted it for falling back on [...] "over-the-top comic exaggeration".|$|R

5000|$|Ram lambs not {{intended}} for breeding are castrated, though some shepherds choose {{to avoid the}} procedure for ethical, economic or practical reasons. Ram lambs that will be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. In most breeds, lambs' tails are docked for health reasons. The tail may be removed just below the lamb's caudal tail flaps (docking shorter than this may cause health problems such as rectal prolapse), but in some breeds the tail is left longer, or is not docked at all. Docking is not necessary in short-tailed breeds, {{and it is not}} usually done in breeds in which a long tail is valued, such as Zwartbles.Though docking is often considered cruel and unnatural by animal rights activists, it is considered by sheep producers large and small alike to be a critical step in maintaining the health of sheep.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the practical implementation of the painless castration under injection anaesthesia in Switzerland. 30 swine farms were visited and 60 farmers answered a questionnaire. 34 % of the piglets showed movements during castration under injection anaesthesia and 17 % had excitations during recovery from anaesthesia. After 48 minutes half of the piglets were in sternal position and after 112 minutes half of them showed coordinated movements. The body temperature decreased by 3. 1 °C until 60 minutes after castration, especially small piglets reached critical temperature levels. 38 % of the piglets showed strong bleeding after castration. The healing of the wound was good according to 82 % of the farmers. 83 % of the farmers reported piglet losses, especially at the beginning of the anaesthesia period. The anaesthesia may be improved by using butorphanol in addition to the combination of ketamine and azaperone. The recovery of the piglets should be in a warm place without any risk of injury by obstacles or the sow. Increased bleeding can be controlled by using an <b>emasculator...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} in stallions {{the impact of}} castration on total differential count of leukocytes and the classical pathway of complement activation (CPCA), blood vitamins A and E levels. The stallions were castrated with an <b>emasculator,</b> while in standing position, using the open technique. The number of leukocytes was counted in the Burker chamber, and the leukogram on blood smear. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (N/L) was counted; CPCA was shown with Mayer’s method adapted for horses. Vitamins E and A concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. The castration led {{to an increase in}} neutrophil bands number 3 hours later and on days 3 and 7; monocytes band number increased also 3 hours post castration. The N/L ratio increased on the 24 th hour. The CPCA was reduced on the 0 hour, and the amount of vitamin E- on the 24 th hour. The applied castration caused temporary and quantitative changes in the examined parameters of innate defence by suppressing its humoral component – complement (0 hour) and caused an increase of the cell elements – neutrophilsband and monocytes and the N/L ratio.

40|$|Given the ubiquity and {{evolutionary}} importance of parasites, {{their effect on}} the energy budget of mammals remains surprisingly unclear. The eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus (L., 1758)) is a burrowing rodent that is commonly infected by cuterebrid bot fly (Cuterebra <b>emasculator</b> Fitch, 1856) larvae. We measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) and cold-induced [Vo. sub. 2]-max (under heliox atmosphere) in 20 free-ranging individuals, of which 4 individuals were infected by one or two larva. We found that RMR was significantly higher in chipmunks infected by bot fly larvae (mean [+ or -] SE = 0. 88 [+ or -] 0. 05 W) than in uninfected individuals (0. 74 [+ or -] 0. 02 W). In contrast, V[O. sub. 2]-max was significantly lower in chipmunks infected by bot fly larvae (4. 96 [+ or -] 0. 70 W) than in uninfected individuals (6. 37 [+ or -] 0. 16 W). Consequently, the aerobic scope (ratio of [Vo. sub. 2]-max to RMR) was negatively correlated {{with the number of}} bot fly larvae (infected individuals = 5. 74 [+ or -] 1. 03 W; noninfected individuals = 8. 67 [+ or -] 0. 26 W). Finally, after accounting for the effects of body mass and bot fly parasitism on RMR and [Vo. sub. 2]-max, there was no correlation between the two variables among individuals within our population. In addition to providing the first estimate of [Vo. sub. 2]-max in T. striatus, these results offer additional evidence that bot fly parasitism has significant impacts on the metabolic ecology of this host species...|$|E
40|$|Literature was {{reviewed}} to substantiate the authors' concept that the F₂ hybrid in Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is a usable product. Obstacles to hybrid cotton production include effective emasculation techniques, economical methods to produce F₁s, including pollen transfer by insect vectors, and identification of parental combinations that demonstrate useful heterosis. F₁ hybrids useful in commercial agricultural crops {{became the focus}} of attention of plant breeders in the 1940 's when, through mechanical emasculation of one monecious parent, a hybrid could be easily produced and the maximum expression of heterosis exploited. The complete flower of cotton, however, dictates chemical or biological rather than mechanical emasculation and the techniques available create problems of phytotoxicity, cytoplasmic incompatibility, and/or restoration. The author therefore abandoned the use of the F₁ hybrid concept for cotton hybrids and began to evaluate an alternative, the F₂ hybrid. The problems associated with genetic segregation in F₂ generations in other crops delayed acceptance of a F₂ hybrid concept for cotton until the 1980 's when the research discussed herein and supported by University of Arizona, Pennwalt Corporation, and American Cyanamid Corporation was made. Trade secret constraints allow only the reporting of summarized data and not the detailed information appropriately on file with the companies. In the 26 year period between 1947 to 1973, only 70 hybrids were created by cotton researchers and evaluated in the F₂ generation for yield performance. Olvey and team created 467 hybrids using chemical emasculation techniques which were evaluated and reported in 1985 and 1986. Other researchers throughout the cotton belt have now studied 69 F₂ hybrids since 1986. The acceptance of the F₂ hybrid concept traces directly to the specific program developed by the author. Research cited substantiates that the chemical TD- 1123 (3, 4 -dicloroisothiazole- 5 -carbolic acid) is an effective <b>emasculator,</b> that production costs can be reduced considerably by marketing the F₂ hybrid, and that extensive F₂ hybrid yield testing has shown that the F₂ hybrid has promise as a commercially feasible product...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Science and IndustryL. N. Edwards-CallawayThis thesis {{includes}} two studies that assessed pain responses to husbandry procedures in order develop mitigation tools. The {{objective of the}} first trial was to identify method-related differences in behavioral pain responses in calves of two ages (6 week and 6 months) subjected to castration: surgical cut (CP; n= 18), surgical cut and <b>emasculator</b> (CC; n= 20), rubber banding (BAND; n= 18), or control manipulation of the scrotum (CONT; n= 20). Behavior was evaluated pre- and post-castration to record foot stamps, tail flicks, kicks, elimination, in addition to standing and lying post-castration. For 6 week calves, the probability of kicking and eliminations was greater for surgical castrates and all castrated animals, respectively. The probability of kicking was greatest for all 6 month castrates while BAND and CONT had greater probability of elimination. Both age groups increased standing post-castration. Lying decreased in 6 week calves but was unchanged for 6 month calves. Six week calves displayed more tail flicks and tended to display less foot stamps than 6 month calves. Six week calves showed a decrease in tail flicks and foot stamps in response to castration while 6 month calves showed an increase in both behaviors. CP and CC, but not BAND, resulted in less tail flicks than CONT post castration. The second trial compared the effects of preemptive analgesics administered to calves subjected to dehorning with local anesthesia. Six month Holstein steers {{were randomly assigned to}} receive one of the following treatments (n= 8 /group) : meloxicam (1 mg/kg PO), gabapentin (15 mg/kg PO), meloxicam (1 mg/kg) and gabapentin (15 mg/kg) PO, flunixin (2. 2 mg/kg IV), or a placebo. Drug, cortisol, ex-vivo prostaglandin, haptoglobin, and substance P concentrations, ocular thermography, algometry, and average daily gain were evaluated. Analgesic-treated calves had lower plasma SP concentrations and improved ADG compared with controls. Flunixin calves had reduced cortisol and ex-vivo prostaglandin concentrations for 24 h compared to controls. Meloxicam treated calves showed an increase in MNT at two horn bud sites compared with the other treatments. Overall, the results provide validation of responses to noxious stimuli {{that can be used to}} develop pain alleviation for livestock...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this clinical study was to establish {{for the first time}} a quantitative assessment of analgesia under practice common general anaesthesia of pigs induced by Ketamine-Azaperone using electromyography (EMG) to record the Nociceptive Flexor Reflex (NFR) but also using Elektroencephalography (EEG) to derive the Bispectral Index (BIS), both under surveillance of the previous traditional pain specific defense behaviour. In case of suitability the NFR should be applied also to test the Interdigital Claw Reflex (ZKR) which is in practice commonly used to assertain surgical tolerance before operations. Furthermore, the possibility to control the consciousness in pigs with aid of the BIS should be investigated for the first time, too. With the NFR and the blood levels of Ketamine, Norketamine and Azaperone it should be checked, if Cortisol can function as a reliable parameter for pain or stress during Ketamine-Azaperone-anaesthesia. Possible negative side effects of the anaesthesia on heart, cardiovascular system and respiration, particularly the risk of catalepsis by Ketamine should be controlled in addition. As a model for monitoring somatic and visceral analgesia the castration of 30 clinically healthy male pigs with a body weight between 42 and 60 kg was used. As somatic and visceral pain stimuli served the incision of the scrotal skin, of the tunica vaginalis and of the testis, the draw, the squeezing and the cutting off the spermatic cord with an <b>emasculator,</b> and finally the disinfection of the wound. The general anaesthesia was induced with an initial intramuscular dose of 20 mg/kg Ketamine (Ursotamine®) and 2 mg/kg Azaperone (Stresnil®). Right after laying down the NFR was recorded every minute using the EMG of the deltoid muscle. Additional records were taken exactly at the time of a certain manipulation or a specific pain stimulus. The stimulation of the NFR was performed by electric irritation of the ulnar nerve distal from the carpal joint. The irritation consisted of five terms of 0. 5 s distance, each, with five square impulses of 1 ms duration and a distance of 4 ms. The strength of irritation was limited to 45 mA. The threshold for nociception of 40 µV was determined from the arithmetic mean of the baseline-rushing (15 µV) plus it´s sixfold standard deviation. For control of consciousness and/or analgesia the BIS was evaluated from current EEG derivation of the frontal region. The serum concentrations of Cortisol, Ketamine and Azaperone were determined in 13 pigs with ear vein catheters before and during surgery, and up to four hours afterwards with the Liquid Chromatography coupled Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). The pain-specific defense behaviour was evaluated using a standardized semi-quantitative scoring on the basis of defense-movements and vocalization. The lack of both is defined as surgical tolerance (Score 0). The ZKR was manually tested as common in practice. The vital parameters oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide saturation, heart rate, mean arterial pressure and respiratory rate were currently recorded using the usual surveillance equipment in human anaesthesiology. To control catalepsis the EMG was also currently recorded from the deltoid muscle using another record channel. As an important result the NFR monitoring demonstrated that the initial dosage of Ketamine-Azaperone interrupts the conduction of pain signals to the effectors (muscles) following somatic as well as visceral pain stimuli. Related to surgical tolerance (Score 0) the test sensitivity and specifity of the NFR were 93 % and 98 %. Post operationem, up to two hours after inducing anaesthesia (maximum time of recording), a significant pain relief (74 µV) was also shown by NFR, corresponding with Score 1. The persistent high BIS values over time showed that this monitoring was not suited to estimate the state of analgesia and of consciousness in pigs. The vital parameters and Cortisol were also inappropiate indicators for analgesia. The test sensitivity and specifity of the ZKR with regard to the NFR-threshold (40 µV) were 92 % and 89 %. The EMG-values for control of catalepsis remained persistently on the low level of the baseline-rushing. All pigs demonstrated in accordance with this clinically an atonic muscle tone. Even with repeated post-dosing of Ketamine (up to 60 mg/kg in total) no negative side effects were observed regarding the vital parameters. Only the respiratory rate during the monitoring was marginally above the reference range due to the central-stimulating effect of Ketamine...|$|E
