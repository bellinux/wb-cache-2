5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in <b>keeping</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, {{it is common to}} take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Keeping</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E

500|$|As {{commanding}} officer of No.3 Squadron, Jeffrey came up with innovative ways of improving morale {{in the face of}} living conditions that were [...] "primitive at best". On one occasion he arranged accommodation for his men near a beach, well away from the din of night-time bombing that was causing them to lose sleep on a regular basis. Another of his more [...] "radical ideas" [...] and lasting legacies was a combined mess for all pilots in the combat zone, whether commissioned or non-commissioned. The concept was initially frowned upon by Royal Air Force units, but when Air Vice Marshal [...] "Mary" [...] Coningham dined at the shared mess on 11October 1941 and gave his approval, it took root across the entire Desert Air Force; leading ace Clive Caldwell later put the same idea into practice as commander of the RAAF's No.1 (Fighter) Wing in Darwin, Northern Territory. One of No.3 Squadron's flight sergeants recalled that Jeffrey made it a rule for new pilots to get to know their ground crew to increase their sense of comradeship, and also gave one of his senior warrant officers special responsibility for <b>keeping</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> location of Allied airfields and petrol supplies to ensure that the unit was never short of fuel or places to land in an emergency.|$|E
500|$|As with Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, Aksys Games {{localized}} Virtue's Last Reward for its North American release. Nobara Nakayama {{translated the}} game's text from Japanese to English, {{which was then}} localized by editor Ben Bateman. Bateman later stated that overcoming various translation issues {{was one of the}} hardest aspects of editing Virtue's Last Reward. Although Uchikoshi had written the game with the English-language audience in mind, which avoided several plot-related translation problems, a few jokes did not translate properly and had to be changed during localization. There were also two characters who [...] "talked like animals" [...] in the Japanese version of the game: Zero III, who added [...] "-usa" [...] to the end of its sentences, which is the first half of usagi (the Japanese word for [...] "rabbit"); and Sigma, who added [...] "-nya" [...] (the Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound cats make) {{to the end of his}} sentences whenever he talked about cats. Bateman solved this by writing rabbit and cat themed puns. Another challenge for Bateman was <b>keeping</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story moments from each branching path. It was important to know whether information regarding each character had been revealed yet to the player in that timeline, as this would ultimately affect the word choice and attitude of each line of dialogue.|$|E
500|$|When {{the design}} team was {{deciding}} {{on the number}} of Hunters in a match, they chose four as they believed it was the optimal number in a team, as players would not lose track of the stats and health of other players. It also allowed the players to work collaboratively with each other, so that no character would get left behind, or neglected, by the team. From the Monster's perspective, the design team thought that having four Hunters engaging in combat with the Monster would provide a challenge for the Monster, as they could find difficulties in <b>keeping</b> <b>track</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hunters, and this would make a match feel more balanced. The Hunter team was divided into several different classes because it [...] "makes senses" [...] according to Turtle Rock. In order to showcase the features and abilities of different classes, each class has different variations, in both appearances and costume colors. It was designed to make characters more recognizable and memorable. Another reason was that the design team wanted the Monster to adapt and use different strategies when dealing with different Hunters. Turtle Rock considered this a way to effectively extend Evolves replayability and would add more variety to the gameplay. There were originally four Hunter characters in Evolve, but after the design team experimented with the free-to-play model, the list of characters was expanded to 16.|$|E
