2500|$|One author criticizes {{this theory}} as being [...] "problematic" [...] because [...] "Moroni {{makes it clear}} that he buried the plates in the {{vicinity}} of the Nephites' destruction, not [...] away in some remote region." [...] To support this assumption, it is postulated that Moroni buried the plates near the scene of the final battle and then returned 20 years later to retrieve them and add information to them before his final farewell, in which he states that his intention to [...] "seal up these records" [...] The assumption that Moroni hid the plates at the time of the final battle is based upon , in which Moroni states [...] "Therefore I will write and hide up the records in the earth; and whither I go it mattereth not." [...] Continued reading of the text reveals that Moroni abridged the Book of Ether and added it to the record after making this statement. Moroni later writes [...] "wherefore, <b>I</b> <b>wander</b> whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life. Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary to that which I had supposed; for I had supposed not to have written any more." [...] (...) There is no explicit mention in the Book of Mormon of Moroni either having hidden the plates at the time of the final battle or having returned to this location to add more to them years later.|$|E
