5000|$|As William Ainsworth Inc., Brunton {{continued}} {{production of}} the Pocket Transit™, later adopted by the U.S. Army as the M2 Artillery Compass. The Pocket Transit remains in production today, and is offered in numerous versions and configurations. In 1970, the company introduced the Brunton Cadet, a much-simplified evolution of the Pocket Transit incorporating a compass and clinometer, intended for use in training students {{in the fields of}} geology, forestry, mining, and surveying. [...] The company soon began marketing the Cadet to instruct Boy Scouts in the principles of surveying. [...] In 1972, the newly formed Brunton Company, Inc. began compass and transit production in Riverton, Wyoming. Compasses included the Pocket Transit, Cadet, and an <b>emergency</b> <b>compass</b> called the Life Card, designed to float in a bowl of water. This was followed in 1981 by the Model 8040 Sportsman's Compass™, a map (baseplate) compass with folding cover and mirror sight, and the Model 9020, a small baseplate compass intended for general use by hikers, outdoorsmen, and hunters.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, in {{response}} to the burgeoning crisis of family homelessness, the agency opened an <b>emergency</b> shelter program, <b>Compass</b> Family Center (CFC), providing homeless families with short-term housing, counseling and referrals and assistance in obtaining permanent housing. Homeless families represent the fastest growing segment of homeless people in the U.S. and forty percent of the entire population are children and families [...] In 1995 an aftercare component was added along with pre-employment and psychotherapy services.|$|R
5000|$|In her 1988 essay, White Privilege and Male Privilege: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences Through Work in Women’s Studies, McIntosh {{describes}} {{her understanding of}} [...] "white privilege" [...] (unearned advantage based on race) which can be observed systemically and individually, like all unearned privileges in society (e.g. privilege related to class, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, ability). After observing and investigating what she calls [...] "unacknowledged male privilege," [...] McIntosh concluded that since hierarchies in society are inter-related, she probably experienced a “white privilege” analogous to male privilege. McIntosh used the metaphor of white privilege as [...] "an invisible weightless knapsack of assurances, tools, maps, guides, codebooks, passports, visas, clothes, <b>compass,</b> <b>emergency</b> gear, and blank checks".|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the term gained new {{popularity}} in academic circles and public discourse after Peggy McIntosh's 1987 essay White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack. In this essay, McIntosh described white privilege as “an invisible weightless knapsack of assurances, tools, maps, guides, codebooks, passports, visas, clothes, <b>compass,</b> <b>emergency</b> gear, and blank checks," [...] and also discussed {{the relationships between}} different social hierarchies in which experiencing oppression in one hierarchy did not negate unearned privilege experienced in another. In later years, the theory of intersectionality also gained prominence, with black feminists like Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw arguing that black women experienced {{a different type of}} oppression from male privilege distinct from that experienced by white women because of white privilege. The essay is still routinely cited as a key influence by later generations of academics and journalists.|$|R
40|$|It {{has become}} {{increasingly}} clear {{in the last few}} years that the vast majority of municipal solid waste landfills produce leachate that contains elevated levels of tritium. The authors recently conducted a study of landfills in New York and New Jersey and found that the mean concentration of tritium in ten municipal solid waste landfills was 33, 800 pCi/L with a peak value of 192, 000 pCi/L. A 2003 study in California reported a mean tritium concentration of 99, 000 pCi/L with a peak value of 304, 000 pCi/L. Studies in Pennsylvania and the UK produced similar results. The USEPA MCL for tritium is 20, 000 pCi/L. Tritium is also manifesting itself in landfill gas and landfill gas condensate. Landfill gas condensate samples from landfills in the UK and California were found to have tritium concentrations as high as 54, 400 and 513, 000 pCi/L, respectively. The tritium found in MSW leachate is believed to derive principally from gaseous tritium lighting devices used in some <b>emergency</b> exit signs, <b>compasses,</b> watches, and even novelty items, such as “glow stick ” key chains. This study reports the findings of recent surveys of leachate from a number of municipal solid waste landfills, both open and closed, from throughout the United States and Europe. The study evaluates the human health and ecological risks posed by elevated tritium levels in municipal solid waste leachate and landfill gas and the implications to their safe management. We also assess the potential risks posed to solid waste management facility workers exposed to tritium-containing waste materials in transfer stations and other solid waste management facilities...|$|R
