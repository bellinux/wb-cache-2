50|$|However, {{the events}} had been {{discussed}} within Finnair, especially in pilot training. One Finnair official from the flights direction team, {{who chose to}} remain anonymous, told Helsingin Sanomat {{that he had heard}} about the incident at the time: “It was talked about. Other pilots also said that they saw explosions on that particular route. Were they perhaps missile tests?” Kaukiainen also related the incident to at least one official within the Finnish Civil Aviation Administration which in 2014 is called Finavia. But it turned out that there was little interest in the matter within the Finnish government, because “people were so damned Finlandized back then, especially within the Finnish Government”. In 2014 the Finnish Transport Safety Agency TraFi had no knowledge of the matter, and reports or <b>flight</b> <b>log</b> <b>books</b> for 1987 no longer existed.|$|R

This aircraft has nearly 4,000 take-offs and more than 1,000 flying hours under its belt, appearing at numerous national and international competitions, flown by pilots from different countries, in Germany, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, France, Turkey, Belgium and the Netherlands, with only about 5% of <b>flights</b> in the <b>log</b> <b>book</b> from the Akaflieg München home base at Königsdorf.|$|R

40|$|This final project {{report is}} based on the job {{training}} in information unit. The final project was conducted to describe the activities of the information unit in Adi Sumarmo International Airport, and to describe the problem faced by information unit and to give solutions to overcome the problem. Activities of Information Unit in Adi Sumarmo International airport are receiving all incoming calls, announcing information about flight schedule for the passenger, being customers service, selling platform, serving pass visitor card, writing all of <b>flights</b> activities into <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> depositing the platform, checking and booking airplane ticket, and giving the letters to AMC. There were some problems faced by information unit, such as lacking the number of employees in the information unit, lacking of knowledge and insight, lacking of supporting facilities in the tourist information counters, and technical problems. Finally, I would like to give suggestions for Adi Sumarmo International Airport. The information unit should add more employees, update some important telephone numbers and extentions, cooperate with the TIC in terms of information on tourism, and fix immediately all equipment which is damaged or replaced with a new one...|$|R

40|$|Objective While many jurisdictions internationally now require learner {{drivers to}} {{complete}} a specified number of hours of supervised driving practice before being able to drive unaccompanied, very few require learner drivers {{to complete a}} <b>log</b> <b>book</b> to record this practice and then present it to the licensing authority. Learner drivers in most Australian jurisdictions must complete a <b>log</b> <b>book</b> that records their practice thereby confirming to the licensing authority that they have met the mandated hours of practice requirement. These <b>log</b> <b>books</b> facilitate the management and enforcement of minimum supervised hours of driving requirements. Method Parents of learner drivers in two Australian states, Queensland and New South Wales, completed an online survey assessing a range of factors, including {{their perceptions of the}} accuracy of their child’s learner <b>log</b> <b>book</b> and the effectiveness of the <b>log</b> <b>book</b> system. Results The study indicates that the large majority of parents believe that their child’s learner <b>log</b> <b>book</b> is accurate. However, they generally report that the <b>log</b> <b>book</b> system is only moderately effective as a system to measure the number of hours of supervised practice a learner driver has completed. Conclusions The {{results of this study suggest}} the presence of a paradox with many parents possibly believing that others are not as diligent in the use of <b>log</b> <b>books</b> as they are or that the system is too open to misuse. Given that many parents report that their child’s <b>log</b> <b>book</b> is accurate, this study has important implications for the development and ongoing monitoring of hours of practice requirements in graduated driver licensing systems...|$|R
5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic <b>log</b> <b>book.</b> An ELD records the same information as a manual paper <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper <b>log</b> <b>book.</b>|$|R
5|$|Keeping {{track of}} a driver's HOS {{requires}} {{the use of}} a <b>log</b> <b>book.</b> A truck driver's <b>log</b> <b>book</b> is a legally defined form containing a grid outlining the 24-hour day into 15-minute increments. The driver must specify where and when he/she stopped between driving shifts, what duties were performed (if any), along with the driver's name, truck number, company info, and other information. The driver must also present his or her <b>log</b> <b>book</b> to authorities upon request, for inspection. In lieu of a <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> a motor carrier may substitute an electronic on-board recorder to record the driver's hours.|$|R
5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based <b>log</b> <b>books.</b> As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel, there is very little to stop them from forging their <b>log</b> <b>books.</b> There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|R
