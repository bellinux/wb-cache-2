40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 106 - 121) Ground-water contamination by sewage {{waste is}} a major problem in the United States. A known technology for reducing this contamination is <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> of wastewater instead of the more typical sand-bed filtration. This study involves the application of a ground-water flow and contaminant transport model to compare the ground-water contamination from <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> versus sand bed filtration at the Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod. To develop the ground-water flow model, site- specific parameters were input and the model was calibrated to observed water-level elevations. The transport model was developed by simulating known concentrations and loading rates and estimating values of dispersivity. In addition, data from the existing wastewater plume were used in the model calibration. The contaminant transport model predicts that, for the Cape Cod site, the <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> method results in lower concentrations of contaminants over a smaller area.

50|$|Irrigation is {{the process}} of artificially {{applying}} water to soil to allow plant growth. This term is preferably used when large amounts of water is applied to dry, arid regions in order to facilitate plant growth. The process of irrigation not only increases the growth rate of the plant bust also increments the yield amount. In temperate and tropical areas rainfall and snowfall are the main suppliers of irrigation water, but in dry places with unfavourable weather conditions, groundwater serves as an essential source. Groundwater collects in basins made up of gravel and aquifers which are water-holding rocks.Dams also act as an essential distributive source of irrigation water. Underground wells also {{play an important role in}} storing water for irrigation, specifically in America and Arizona. Water and debris from streams filled by water accumulated during storms, also collects into underground basins.

In this study, we add a novel irrigation module to the recently released community land model 4. 0 and simulate irrigation in two ways: first, by spraying water above a canopy similar to precipitation to simulate spray irrigation; second, by directly adding water on the ground to simulate flood irrigation. Differences between coupled irrigation and control runs and differences between two irrigation patterns are analyzed globally and in three heavily irrigated countries: the USA, India, and China. Our results show that <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> has greater impacts than flood irrigation on nearsurface climate. <b>Spray</b> and flood <b>irrigation</b> respectively increase evapotranspiration by 4. 33 w/m 2 and 3. 36 w/m 2 and 2 m relative humidity by 0. 36 % and 0. 14 %.

Waste water analyses showed that the KMCAS Sewage Treatment Plant, employing the trickling filter process with a final polishing pond, is capable of removing a high percentage of biodegradable substances and suspended solids. The effluent appears to be of good quality for agricultural irrigation use. High concentrations of sodium and chloride, due to brackish groundwater infiltration into the sewage system, were not considered to be a hazard to the salt-tolerant bermudagrass. The two predominant soils on the KMCAS Klipper Golf Course, the Ewa silty clay loam (Low Humic Latosols) and the Jaucas (Regosols), appeared to be very effective in removing nitrogen, phosphorus, and fecal coliforms from the applied effluent. The quality of the percolate does not present a hazard to the groundwater quality. Runoff from the golf course does not present a hazard to the adjacent surface waters. Analyses of <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> fallout samples at the KMCAS Klipper Golf Course resulted in the isolation of coliform bacteria up to 91 m (300 ft) downwind of the sprinkler sources.

40|$|Human {{demand for}} food {{influences}} the water cycle through diversion and extraction {{of fresh water}} needed to support agriculture. Future population growth and economic development alone will substantially increase water demand {{and much of it}} for agricultural uses. For many semi-arid lands, socio-economic shifts are likely to exacerbate changes in climate as a driver of future water supply and demand. For these areas in particular, where the balance between water supply and demand is fragile, variations in regional climate can have potentially predictable effect on agricultural production. Satellite data and biophysically-based models provide a powerful method to quantify the interactions between local climate, plant growth and water resource requirements. In irrigated agricultural lands, satellite observations indicate high vegetation density while the precipitation amount indicates otherwise. This inconsistency between the observed precipitation and the observed canopy leaf density triggers the possibility that the observed high leaf density is due to an alternate source of water, irrigation. We explore an inverse process approach using observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), climatological data, and the NASA's Simple Biosphere model, SiB 2, to quantitatively assess water demand in a semi-arid agricultural land by constraining the carbon and water cycles modeled under both equilibrium (balance between vegetation and prevailing local climate) and nonequilibrium (water added through irrigation) conditions. We postulate that the degree to which irrigated lands vary from equilibrium conditions is related to the amount of irrigation water used. We added water using two distribution methods: The first method adds water on top of the canopy and is a proxy for the traditional <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation.</b> The second method allows water to be applied directly into the soil layer and serves as proxy for drip irrigation. Our approach indicates that over the study site, for the month of July, <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> resulted in an irrigation amount of about 1. 4 mm per occurrence with an average frequency of occurrence of 24. 6 hours.

As part of those discussions, Argonne outlined preliminary recommendations for a long-term monitoring program to verify and document (1) the performance of the <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> treatment process for the removal of carbon tetrachloride from extracted groundwater, (2) the geochemical quality of the extracted and treated groundwater delivered to the wetlands, and (3) the hydrogeologic and inorganic geochemical impacts of the groundwater delivery. General activities recommended included the following: (1) Periodic sampling and analysis for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater extracted at each pumping well and in water discharged from the <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> treatment units. (2) Periodic sampling of groundwater from each pumping well and directly from the sprinkler discharge, for analysis for selected inorganic water quality parameters. The CCC/USDA and Argonne also requested at the March 2001 meeting that the wetlands agencies accept responsibility for developing the ecological and biological monitoring programs needed to meet environmental requirements for the wetlands restoration program. The preliminary recommendations for monitoring outlined above were generally accepted by the wetlands agencies. Since the March 2001, meeting, however, no further discussions have taken place (to Argonne's knowledge) regarding potential monitoring at this site. As the design of the Utica project has evolved, more detailed technical information has become available regarding the specific restoration activities to be performed in association with the aquifer and the wetlands basin.

A threeâyear study was conducted at Bushland, Texas, in the Southern High Plains to compare SDI, LEPA, and <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> for grain sorghum on a slowly permeable Pullman clay loam soil. Performance measures were grain yield, seed mass, soil water depletion, seasonal water use, water use efficiency (WUE), and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE). Each irrigation method was compared at five irrigation levels: 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % of crop evapotranspiration. The irrigation levels simulated varying well capacities typically found {{in the region and}} dryland conditions. In all three years, SDI had greater yield, WUE, and IWUE than other irrigation methods at the 50 % irrigation level and especially at the 25 % level, whereas spray outperformed SDI and LEPA at the 75 % and 100 % levels. Differences in seed mass, soil water depletion, and seasonal water use were usually insignificant at the 25 % and 50 % levels and inconsistent at the 75 % and 100 % levels. Performance was most sensitive to irrigation level, then year, and then irrigation method, although relative rankings of performance for each irrigation method within an irrigation level were consistent across years.

Risk estimates secured using a modified air box model are reported 14 for a hypothetical worker exposed to selected chemicals within a generalised conceptual exposure 15 model of <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Consistent with pesticide spray exposure studies, the key risk driver is 16 dermal exposure to the more toxic components of leachate. Changes in spray droplet diameter 17 (0. 02 - 0. 2 cm) and to spray flow rate (50 - 1000 l/min) have little influence on dermal exposure, 18 although the lesser routes of aerosol ingestion and inhalation are markedly affected. The risk 19 estimates modelled using this conservative worst case exposure scenario are not of sufficient 20 magnitude to warrant major concerns about chemical risks to workers or bystanders from this 21 practice in the general sense. However, the modelling made use of generic concentration data for 22 {{only a limited number}} of potential landfill leachate contaminants, such that individual practices 23 may require assessment on the basis of their own merits...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} a conceptual model of groundwater flow {{and the effects}} of nitrate (NO 3 -) loading and transport on shallow groundwater quality in a portion of the Indian River watershed, eastern Sussex County, Delaware. Three-dimensional, numerical simulations of groundwater flow, particle tracking, and contaminant transport were constructed and tested against data collected in previous hydrogeological and water-quality studies. The simulations show a bimodal distribution of groundwater residence time in the study area, with the largest grouping at less than 10 years, the second largest grouping at more than 100 years, and a median of approximately 29 years. Historically, the principal source of nitrate to the shallow groundwater in the study area has been from the chemical- and manure-based fertilizers used in agriculture. A total mass of NO 3 - -nitrogen (N) of about 169 kg/day is currently simulated to discharge to surface water. As the result of improved N-management practices, after 45 years a 20 percent decrease in the mass of NO 3 - -N reaching the water table would result in an approximately 4 percent decrease in the mass of simulated N discharge to streams. The disproportionally smaller decrease in N discharge reflects the large mass of N in the aquifer coupled with long groundwater residence times. Currently, there are two large wastewater <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> facilities located in the study domain: the Mountaire Wastewater Treatment Facility and Inland Bays Wastewater Facility. The effects of wastewater application through <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> were simulated with a two-step process. First, under different operations and soil conditions, evaporation and water flux, NO 3 - -N uptake by plants, and NO 3 - -N leaching were simulated using an unsaturated flow model, Hydrus- 1 D. Next, the range of simulated NO 3 - -N loads were input into the flow and transport model to study the impacts on groundwater elevation and NO 3 - -N conditions. Over the long term, the <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> of wastewater may increase water-table elevations up to 2. 5 m and impact large volumes of groundwater with NO 3 -. Reducing the concentration of NO 3 - in effluent and increasing the irrigation rate may reduce the volumes of water impacted by high concentrations of NO 3 -, but may facilitate the lateral and vertical migration of NO 3 -. Simulations indicate that NO 3 - will eventually impact deeper aquifers. An optimal practice of wastewater irrigation can be achieved by adjusting irrigation rate and effluent concentration. Further work is needed to determine these optimum application rates and concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Producers in the North Texas High Plains (Amarillo and north) are {{considering}} cotton {{as an alternative}} crop to corn because cotton has a similar profit potential for about one-half the irrigation requirement. However, limited heat units pose some risk for cotton production. We hypothesized that cotton under subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) would undergo less evaporative cooling following an irrigation event compared with low energy precision applicators (LEPA) or <b>spray</b> <b>irrigation</b> and, therefore, would increase heat unit accumulation and lead to earlier maturation. We did not observe any differences in cotton maturity between irrigation methods in 2003; however, preliminary data in 2004 showed that soil temperatures were greater for SDI than LEPA or spay following an irrigation event. In the 2003 season, lint yield and water use efficiency were greater with SDI under low irrigation capacities (25 % and 50 % of full irrigation), but were greater with LEPA and <b>spray</b> under full <b>irrigation.</b> Fiber quality, as indicated by total discount, was greater with SDI for all capacities except full irrigation. We are continuing this experiment for two more seasons...|$|R
