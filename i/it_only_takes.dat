The adult robin gives alarm calls and dives in a threatening manner towards creatures it considers potential predators, such as approaching cats, dogs and humans. The fledglings are able to fly short distances after leaving the nest. The wings of juvenile birds develop rapidly, and <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> {{a couple of weeks}} for them to become proficient at flying. The cryptically colored young birds perch in bushes or trees for protection from predators.|$|E
5|$|On April9, CSU also {{released}} its first quantitative forecast for the 2015 hurricane season, predicting 7 named storms, 3 hurricanes, 1 major hurricane, and a cumulative ACE index of 40 units. The combination of cooler than average {{waters in the}} tropical and subtropical Atlantic, {{as well as a}} developing El Niño predicted to reach at least moderate intensity, were expected to favor one of the least active seasons since the mid-1990s. The probabilities of a major hurricane striking various coastal areas across the Atlantic were lower than average, although CSU stressed that <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> one landfalling hurricane to make it an active season for residents involved. On April13, North Carolina State University (NCSU) {{released its}} forecast, predicting a near record-low season with just 4 to 6 named storms, 1 to 3 hurricanes, and 1 major hurricane.|$|E

25|$|Baxter {{is a new}} robot {{introduced}} in 2012 which learns by guidance. A worker could teach Baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having Baxter memorize them. Extra dials, buttons, and controls are available on Baxter's arm for more precision and features. Any regular worker could program Baxter and <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> a matter of minutes, unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding {{in order to be}} used. This means Baxter needs no programming in order to operate. No software engineers are needed. This also means Baxter can be taught to perform multiple, more complicated tasks. Sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller, more precise tasks.|$|E
25|$|The {{average time}} to death once a lethal {{injection}} protocol has been started is about 7 to 11 minutes. Since <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> about 30 seconds for the thiopental to induce anesthesia, 30–45 seconds for the pancuronium to cause paralysis, and about 30 seconds for the potassium {{to stop the}} heart, death can theoretically be attained {{in as little as}} 90 seconds. Given that it takes time to administer the drug, time for the line to flush itself, time for the change of the drug being administered, and time to ensure that death has occurred, the whole procedure takes about 7–11 minutes. Procedural aspects in pronouncing death also contribute to delay, so the condemned is usually pronounced dead within 10 to 20 minutes of starting the drugs. Supporters of the death penalty say that a huge dose of thiopental, which is between 14 and 20 times the anesthetic induction dose and which has the potential to induce a medical coma lasting 60 hours, could never wear off in only 10 to 20 minutes.|$|E

(Tyrell states: [...] "Capillary dilation of the so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary dilation of the iris?") In the film two replicants take the test, Leon and Rachael, and Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> [...] "six or seven" [...] questions to make a determination.

It won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, and was later {{included}} on Rolling Stone list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Almost all of the writing and producing for it was done by Jean. The Score garnered praise for being a strong alternative to the gangsta idiom, and Hill stated, [...] "We're trying to do something positive with the music because it seems like only the negative is rising to the top these days. <b>It</b> <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> a drop of purity to clean a cesspool." ...|$|E

Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by Angela Punch McGregor). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, [...] "a tribal elder,... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe".

500|$|Batman: The Killing Joke (1988) {{built on}} the Joker's 1951 origin story, portraying him as a failed comedian {{pressured}} into committing crime as the Red Hood to support his pregnant wife. Batman's interference causes him to leap into a chemical vat, which disfigures him. This, combined with the trauma of his wife's earlier accidental death, causes him to go insane and become the Joker. However, the Joker says that this story may not be true, as he prefers his past to be [...] "multiple choice". In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon and tortures her father, Commissioner James Gordon, to prove that <b>it</b> <b>only</b> <b>takes</b> one bad day to drive a normal man insane. After Batman rescues Gordon and subdues the Joker, he offers to rehabilitate his old foe and end their rivalry. Although the Joker refuses, he shows his appreciation by sharing a joke with Batman. Following the character's maiming of Barbara, she became a more important character in the DC Universe: Oracle, a data gatherer and superhero informant, who has her revenge in Birds of Prey by shattering the Joker's teeth and destroying his smile.|$|E
