40|$|Power {{systems are}} {{designed}} to operate at nominal frequencies of 50 Hz or 60 Hz. However, certain types of loads produce currents and voltages with frequencies that are higher than the nominal, resulting in the following: voltage and current distortion, low voltage notching, communication systems interference and high voltages and currents in case of resonance. Harmonics can also cause relay malfunction, programmable logic controller (PLC) <b>interference,</b> <b>capacitor</b> fuse interruptions and high overall system losses. Moreover, the interruption of a capacitive current causes dielectric problems for the switching device. The major concern arising {{from the use of}} capacitors is the possibility of system resonance {{which is one of the}} main consequences of harmonics in power systems. This paper investigates the frequent capacitor bank tripping and damages in a distribution substation of the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) with the aid of a fixed capacitor bank. The study was conducted using the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) software for the simulation. The results showed that, the damages and failures had a direct bearing with harmonic resonance. Carefully selected series-connected inductors were recommended to move the resonant frequencies of the network below characteristics harmonic frequencies. The significance of the study is to investigate the effect of harmonic resonance o...|$|E

The noise level and non-linear distortions in capacitors {{can be established}} as a new criteria for reliability selection of <b>interference</b> suppressor <b>capacitors.</b> New tasks (measurement of third harmonic and noise) and their realization in the system have been proposed.

40|$|Abstract: Non-linearity {{and noise}} phenomena, also partial {{discharge}} properties of a capacitor have been analysed to established criteria for segregation of <b>interference</b> suppressor <b>capacitors</b> into different endurance (sustainability) and reliability groups. It {{can improve the}} process of quality estimation of high reliability capacitors. The system for production testing of high reliability <b>interference</b> suppressor <b>capacitors</b> with implementation of this testing technique has been described.

25|$|Suppression <b>capacitors</b> are {{effective}} <b>interference</b> reduction components because their electrical impedance decreases with increasing frequency, {{so that at}} higher frequencies they short circuit electrical noise and transients between the lines, or to ground. They therefore prevent equipment and machinery (including motors, inverters, and electronic ballasts, as well as solid-state relay snubbers and spark quenchers) from sending and receiving electromagnetic and radio frequency interference as well as transients in across-the-line (X capacitors) and line-to-ground (Y capacitors) connections. X capacitors effectively absorb symmetrical, balanced, or differential <b>interference.</b> Y <b>capacitors</b> are connected in a line bypass between a line phase and a point of zero potential, to absorb asymmetrical, unbalanced, or common-mode interference.|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} a new {{implementation}} of a compact smart resistive sensor based on a microcontroller with internal ADCs is proposed and analysed. The solution is based only on a (already existing in the system) microcontroller and a simple sensor interface circuit working as a voltage divider consisting of a reference resistor and a resistive sensor connected in parallel with an <b>interference</b> suppression <b>capacitor.</b> The measurement method is based on stimulation of the sensor interface circuit by a single square voltage pulse and on sampling the resulting voltage on the resistive sensor. The proposed solution is illustrated by a complete application of the compact smart resistive sensor used for temperature measurements, based on an 8 -bit ATxmega 32 A 4 microcontroller with a 12 -bit ADC and a Pt 100 resistive sensor. The results of experimental research confirm that the compact smart resistive sensor has 1 °C resolution of temperature measurement for {{the whole range of}} changes of measured temperatures...|$|R
