40|$|In the {{semi-arid}} tropics (SAT), 33 % {{area are}} occupied by Alfisols and related soils. In SAT these soils have low structural stability and thereby tend to form seal and crusts at the surface. Due to this {{a large proportion}} of the rain that falls on Alfisols during the early part of the rainy season,is normally lost as runoff thus causing high soil loss as well as moisture stress to crops. Two tillage studies were conducted first at plot scale (320 m 2) during 1991 - 95 and second at small watershed scale (1. 45 ha) during 2007 - 10,at ICRISAT research station,Hyderabad,India. These studies were conducted to find out whether the problem of excessive runoff and soil loss during the early part of the rainy season can be controlled by various inter-row tillage systems in addition to normal <b>intercultivation</b> by breaking the crust or seal and thereby improving infiltration and soil moisture and reducing runoff and soil loss. The observations on rainfall,runoff,soil moisture,soil loss,soil surface roughness and crop yields were collected from both the studies. Results from these studies have shown that inter-row tillage in addition to normal <b>intercultivation</b> is found effective in controlling early season runoff and soil loss and increasing crop yields. The additional tillage systems are found most effective during low and medium rainfall years and not so much during high rainfall years. The additional tillage with shoe cultivators,which creates rough soil surface (11 mm depression storage),is found most effective in increasing crop yields and reducing runoff and soil loss. The additional tillage with blade harrow which generates smooth soil surface is relatively less effective. In most rainfall conditions,the normal <b>intercultivation</b> with one additional tillage is found adequate for controlling early season runoff and improving soil moisture and crop yields...|$|E
40|$|The power tillers or hand {{tractors}} are extensively used {{by small}} (1 - 2 ha holdings) and medium (2 - 4 ha holdings) farmers in predominantly rice-growing states in India for roto-tilling, plowing, puddling, <b>intercultivation,</b> harvesting, transportation etc. The vertical deflection and contact {{area of a}} pneumatic tyre (6. 00 x 12 - 4 ply rating) of a popular 6. 7 kW power tiller were determined at 2. 38 - 2. 87 kN normal loads and 80 - 200 kPa inflation pressure on a rigid flat surface. Both deflection and contact area varied linearly with inflation pressure {{in the range of}} normal loads selected for the study. The empirical equations were developed to predict the deflection and contact area of the tyre. Further, the power tiller tyre considered for the study followed the modified universal characteristics of a tyre. However, both empirical equations and universal characteristics equation of tyres could be used to predict tyre behaviour under various operational parameters...|$|E
40|$|Groundnut is a {{labour-intensive}} crop, {{especially for}} operations like sowing, weeding, harvesting, and drying. But, of-late, due to timely unavailability of labour, many farmers {{are not able}} to exercise timely operations resulting in low yield realization. The present study conducted in two major groundnut-growing states, viz. Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, has revealed that farmers employ more human labour in weeding and harvesting operations in groundnut than in other operations. The practise of manual decortication and stripping is followed by a larger number of farmers in Andhra Pradesh than in Gujarat, indicating less mechanization in the former. For weeding, though, the human labour-use in weedicide + bullock <b>intercultivation</b> + hand weeding technique is almost half of that of the bullock inter-cultivation + hand weeding, only 13 per cent of the farmers practise this labour-saving technique and hence this method should be disseminated in both the regions to reduce human-labour demand. In Andhra Pradesh, for all the operations in groundnut cultivation except harvesting, the cost as well as labour-use has been reduced substantially due to use of partial/complete mechanization methods. Hence, the necessary infrastructure (labour-saving machineries) should be created at the village or block level to reduce the human-labour demand.

40|$|Sixteen on-farm {{trials in}} 2002 and 9 trials in 2003 were {{conducted}} during the post-wet season in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh, India, to demonstrate the beneficial effects of improved production technologies over farmers' practice. The improved technology package included improved chickpea cv. ICCC 37, a seed rate of 60 kg/ha, seed treatment with thiram (3 g/kg seed), inoculation with Rhizobium, a fertilizer dose of 20 kg N and 50 kg P/ha, basal application of micronutrient mixture of 0. 5 kg B, 10 kg Zn and 30 kg S/ha, together with need-based pest and disease control measures. The farmers' method included a local cultivar, a seed rate of 50 kg/ha and a fertilizer dose of 14 kg N and 35 kg P/ha. The improved production technology gave higher grain yield and recorded a mean yield of 2. 09 t/ha, which was 53 % higher than that obtained with farmers' practice yields of 1. 37 t/ha. The increased grain yield with improved production technology was mainly because of increased total dry matter, higher 100 -grain weight and harvest index. An additional cost of $ 56 /ha incurred in the improved technology compared to farmers' practice was mainly due to balanced fertilizer application (micronutrients and additional N and P), additional seed cost, seed treatment, integrated pest management and one additional <b>intercultivation.</b> However, the improved technology increased the mean income to $ 190 with a cost benefit ratio of 2. ...|$|E
40|$|Rice {{is one of}} {{the staple}} food crops of India, and Karnataka {{is one of the}} major rice-producing states. The primary method of rice {{establishment}} in Karnataka is transplanting, but farmers are opting to shift to direct-seeding of rice. Weed management is critical for realizing optimal yield of direct-seeded rice (DSR). The objective of this review was to synthesize the published literature on weeds and weed management in rice in Karnataka, identify improved weed-management technologies for delivery to farmers, and suggest research needs. Some 98 weed species are reported to be associated with rice in Karnataka. Weed control to date in Karnataka has mostly been based on herbicides. Hand-weeding was found to be effective in all methods of rice establishment. However, it is time-consuming, tedious, and costly because labor is becoming scarce and unavailable, and labor wages are higher. Several PRE and POST herbicides that were effective in other Asian countries were also found to be effective in managing weeds in rice established by different methods in Karnataka. Bensulfuron plus pretilachlor and pyrazosulfuron in aerobic rice and pendimethalin, thiobencarb, bispyribac-sodium, cyhalofop, fenoxaprop plus chlorimuron plus metsulfuron, and fenoxaprop plus ethoxysulfuron in dry-DSR were found effective in managing weeds. In wet-DSR, butachlor plus safener and pretilachlor plus safener were effective. Thiobencarb, pendimethalin, pretilachlor, azimsulfuron plus metsulfuron, bispyribac-sodium, butachlor, cinosulfuron, oxadiazon, and quinclorac were found promising for weed management in transplanted rice. Integration of herbicides with hand-weeding or <b>intercultivation</b> was found to be effective in rice established by different methods. Options that were found economical in managing weeds varied across the different rice-establishment methods. The need for developing location-specific, sustainable, integrated weed management and extension of available technologies for the farming community in Karnataka is emphasized...|$|E
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1984. Bibliography: leaves [187]- 199. Microfiche. xvii, 199 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmComputer {{simulation}} {{of water and}} solute movement provides a means of optimizing water management with less field experimentation. Reliable estimates of soil hydraulic properties, which are the input parameters in numerical simulation models, are difficult to obtain because of spatial and temporal variability. Spatial variability has received much attention in recent years. On the other hand little information {{is available on the}} changes in soil hydraulic properties subsequent to tillage. Temporal variability of five soil physical properties for two soils, Molokai series (Typic Torrox) and Waialua series (Vertic Haplustolls), were measured under controlled field conditions. Properties of particular interest were hydraulic conductivity as a function of soil water content and suction, sorptivity, water-content suction relationship, porosity and macroporosity. All external compaction components such as traffic, <b>intercultivation</b> and rainfall impact, that cause temporal variability, were eliminated. Thus, changes in hydraulic properties were imposed principally by internal forces, that is, the changes in the pore water component of effective stress resulting from wetting and drying. A drip irrigation system provided controlled water application at desired intervals. Soil water suction was monitored during the drainage periods between irrigations. Hydraulic conductivity near saturation was the property which showed the greatest decrease with wetting and drying following tillage. Sorptivity and soil water retention also decreased significantly for both the soils. The first and second wetting and drying cycles caused the most compaction. Waialua soil showed greater compaction than the Molokai soil perhaps due to the vertic characteristics of the former. The most promising simple measurement, sorptivity with negative head, was further evaluated and recommended as a rapid and inexpensive method to characterize variability of soil hydrologic behavior before other more demanding methods are undertaken. The importance of temporal variability (from wetting and drying) relative to spatial variability was evaluated by comparing temporal changes in sorptivity measured on small plots with spatial changes measured in a large sugarcane field. Geostatistical analysis of the field sorptivity data indicated no structure in the variance with measured distances. The geometric mean and standard deviation of log sorptivity were considered sufficient to characterize the distribution. The comparison of temporal and spatial variability showed that temporal variability may in some cases be of greater consequence than spatial variability. The importance of temporal variability of hydraulic properties in modeling soil water movement was further illustrated with a numerical simulation model using K(8) and h(8) data for the Molokai and Waialua soils. The computed water content profiles for infiltration and redistribution showed considerable differences for the pre-irrigation and post-irrigation input functions. These results illustrate that modeling soil water movement for the entire cropping cycle using the parameters measured at only one stage may result in unrealistic predictions for other parts of the cycle...|$|E
