6000|$|It {{was from}} this lady, {{who was very}} free in her conversation, that Huxter {{presently}} learnt what was the illness which was evidently preying upon little Fan, and what had been Pen's behaviour regarding her. Mrs. Bolton's account of the transaction was not, it may be imagined, entirely an impartial narrative. One would have thought from her story that the young gentleman had employed a course of the most persevering and flagitious artifices to win the girl's heart, had broken the most solemn promises made to her and was a wretch to be hated and chastised by every champion of woman. Huxter, in his present frame of mind respecting Arthur, and suffering under the latter's contumely, was ready, of course, to take all for granted that was said in the disfavour of this unfortunate convalescent. But why did he not write home to Clavering, {{as he had done}} previously, giving an account of Pen's misconduct, and of the particulars regarding it, which had now come to his knowledge? He soon, {{in a letter to his}} brother-in-law, announced that that nice young man, Mr. Pendennis, had escaped narrowly from a fever, and that no doubt all Clavering, where he was so popular, would be pleased at his recovery; and he mentioned that he had an interesting case of compound fracture, an officer of distinction, which kept him in town; but as for Fanny Bolton, he made no more mention of her in his letters--no more than Pen himself had made mention of her.

6000|$|... (I.) I say {{first we}} have despised literature. What do we, as a nation, care about books? <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we spend {{altogether}} on our libraries, public or private, {{as compared with}} what we spend on our horses? If a man spends lavishly on his library, you call him mad--a bibliomaniac. But you never call any one a horsemaniac, though men ruin themselves every day by their horses, {{and you do not}} hear of people ruining themselves by their books. Or, to go lower still, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the contents of the book-shelves of the United Kingdom, public and private, would fetch, as compared with the contents of its wine-cellars? What position would its expenditure on literature take, as compared with its expenditure on luxurious eating? We talk of food for the mind, as of food for the body: now a good book contains such food inexhaustibly; it is a provision for life, and for the best part of us; yet how long most people would look at the best book before they would give the price of a large turbot for it? Though there have been men who have pinched their stomachs and bared their backs to buy a book, whose libraries were cheaper to them, I think, in the end, than most men's dinners are. We are few of us put to such trial, and more the pity; for, indeed, a precious thing is all the more precious to us if it has been won by work or economy; and if public libraries were half so costly as public dinners, or books cost the tenth part of what bracelets do, even foolish men and women might sometimes suspect there was good in reading, as well as in munching and sparkling: whereas the very cheapness of literature is making even wise people forget that if a book is worth reading, it is worth buying. No book is worth anything which is not worth MUCH; nor is it serviceable, until it has been read, and re-read, and loved, and loved again; and marked, so that you can refer to the passages you want in it, as a soldier can seize the weapon he needs in an armoury, or a housewife bring the spice she needs from her store. Bread of flour is good; but there is bread, sweet as honey, if we would eat it, in a good book; and the family must be poor indeed, which, once in their lives, cannot, for, such multipliable barley-loaves, pay their baker's bill. We call ourselves a rich nation, and we are filthy and foolish enough to thumb each other's books out of circulating libraries! ...|$|E
60|$|Supposing, then, {{we have it}} {{determined}} {{with appropriate}} justice, who is to do the hand work, the next questions must be how the hand-workers are to be paid, {{and how they are}} to be refreshed, and what play they are to have. Now, the possible quantity of play depends on the possible quantity of pay; and the quantity of pay is not a matter for consideration to hand-workers only, but to all workers. Generally, good, useful work, whether of the hand or head, is either ill-paid, or not paid at all. I don't say it should be so, but it always is so. People, as a rule, only pay for being amused or being cheated, not for being served. Five thousand a year to your talker, and a shilling a day to your fighter, digger, and thinker, is the rule. None of the best head work in art, literature, or science, is ever paid for. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> Homer got for his Iliad? or Dante for his Paradise? only bitter bread and salt, and going up and down other people's stairs. In science, the man who discovered the telescope, and first saw heaven, was paid with a dungeon; the man who invented the microscope, and first saw earth, died of starvation, driven from his home: it is indeed very clear that God means all thoroughly good work and talk to be done for nothing. Baruch, the scribe, did not get a penny a line for writing Jeremiah's second roll for him, I fancy; and St. Stephen did not get bishop's pay for that long sermon of his to the Pharisees; nothing but stones. For indeed that is the world-father's proper payment. So surely as any of the world's children work for the world's good, honestly, with head and heart; and come to it, saying, 'Give us a little bread, just to keep the life in us,' the world-father answers them, 'No, my children, not bread; a stone, if you like, or as many as you need, to keep you quiet.' But the hand-workers are not so ill off as all this comes to. The worst that can happen to you is to break stones; not be broken by them. And for you there will come a time for better payment; some day, assuredly, more pence will be paid to Peter the Fisherman, and fewer to Peter the Pope; we shall pay people not quite so much for talking in Parliament and doing nothing, as for holding their tongues out of it and doing something; we shall pay our ploughman a little more and our lawyer a little less, and so on: but, at least, we may even now take care that whatever work is done shall be fully paid for; and the man who does it paid for it, not somebody else; and that it shall be done in an orderly, soldierly, well-guided, wholesome way, under good captains and lieutenants of labour; and that it shall have its appointed times of rest, and enough of them; and that in those times the play shall be wholesome play, not in theatrical gardens, with tin flowers and gas sunshine, and girls dancing because of their misery; but in true gardens, with real flowers, and real sunshine, and children dancing because of their gladness; so that truly the streets shall be full (the 'streets,' mind you, not the gutters) of children, playing in the midst thereof. We may take care that working-men shall have at least as good books to read as anybody else, when they've time to read them; and as comfortable fire-sides to sit at as anybody else, when they've time to sit at them. This, I think, can be managed for you, my working friends, in the good time.|$|E

5000|$|Either on {{the plane}} or after the Yankees reached Boston, Linz went to Berra and apologized.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study was to make a {{comparative}} analysis of student attitudes and learning in relation to the selected academic subject of English when it is applied to certain Oregon occupational clusters. The occupational clusters selected were agriculture, electricity-electronics, industrial mechanics, and stenographersecretarial occupations. Method The comparisons made were centered around the three key questions (1) "How do you feel about having English taught as a part of the occupational subject?" (2) <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you learn when English is taught as part of the occupational subject?" (3) "How easy or difficult do you think English is when taught as a part of the occupational subject?" Findings The findings of this study revealed that the students in the experimental group indicated that (1) they responded positively as to how they felt about interdisciplinary English. (2) they did not respond in a significantly positive manner as to how much they learned from interdisciplinary English. (3) they responded positively as to the difficulty or ease of interdisciplinary English. This study also indicated that the students had a high performance in vocabulary skills when the vocabulary words were related to an occupational area they were studying. The students also indicated that both English and the occupational courses were effective in preparing them for a career...|$|E
