He contributed to the {{development}} of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the asymptotic notation. In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of theoretical computer science, Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, the related METAFONT font <b>definition</b> <b>language</b> and rendering system, and the Computer Modern family of typefaces.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{place in}} which SQL three-valued logic intersects with SQL Data <b>Definition</b> <b>Language</b> (DDL) {{is in the form}} of check {{constraint}}s. A check constraint placed on a column operates under a slightly different set of rules than those for the DML WHERE clause. While a DML WHERE clause must evaluate to True for a row, a check constraint must not evaluate to False. (From a logic perspective, the designated values are True and Unknown.) This means that a check constraint will succeed if the result of the check is either True or Unknown. [...] The following example table with a check constraint will prohibit any integer values from being inserted into column i, but will allow Null to be inserted since the result of the check will always evaluate to Unknown for Nulls.|$|E

Unlike the traditional <b>definition</b> of a <b>language</b> given as a syntax and semantics, a definition by abstract design in invertible, meaning that one {{can use it to}} map evaluated meanings to terms in the language, {{as well as for the}} more usual task of mapping terms in the language to evaluated meanings...|$|R

40|$|Motivation {{to write}} {{this article is based}} on Component Based Software Engineering concepts. Problem is in Component Based Software Engineering Interfaces defined in {{standard}} component technologies using such as Interface <b>Definition</b> <b>Languages</b> (IDLs). These IDLs are sufficient in describing functional properties but insufficient in describing non-functional properties such as quality attributes and not suitable for Architecture Based Development. This article clearly describes the fact of huge improvement in this area and why Interface <b>Definition</b> <b>Languages</b> are not suitable for Architecture-Based development. However as explained in detail we the approach to overcome this situation is using dynamic invocation schemes like Remote invocation scheme or reflection. These methods make our Architecture more suitable for IDLs...|$|R
40|$|As {{the number}} and {{complexity}} of workflow <b>definition</b> <b>languages</b> grows, ensuring interoperability between them becomes more difficult, with most effort being concentrated on achieving run-time interoperability. The contribution {{of this paper is}} to argue for an alternative approach-with interoperation being achieved during build-time, through the use of what we term an Intermediate Workflow Representation (IWR) format, with this format acting as a mediator to carry out language-to-language conversions. In this paper we identify the requirements of such an approach, with the main benefit being that legacy workflows, defined in different workflow <b>definition</b> <b>languages,</b> might be used in conjunction - and in a fashion that is seamless to the user. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
