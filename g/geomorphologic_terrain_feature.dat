50|$|There {{are many}} misconceptions {{involving}} {{the effect of}} <b>terrain</b> <b>features</b> - bodies of water, mountains, valleys, and others - on tornado formation and behavior. Most of these beliefs stem from the idea that tornadoes cannot cross or form near these <b>terrain</b> <b>features.</b> While most modes of tornadogenesis are poorly understood, no <b>terrain</b> <b>feature</b> can prevent the occurrence of a tornado.|$|R
40|$|There are no author-identified {{significant}} results in this report. Studies of relationships of vegetation distribution to geomorphic {{characteristics of the}} landscape and of plant phenological patterns to vegetation identification of satellite imagery indicate that there exists positive relationships between certain plant species and certain <b>terrain</b> <b>features.</b> Not all species were found to exhibit positive relationships with all <b>terrain</b> <b>feature</b> variables, but enough positive relationships seem to exist to indicate that <b>terrain</b> <b>feature</b> variable-vegetation relationship studies have a definite place in plant ecological investigations. Even more importantly, the vegetation groups examined appeared to be successfully discriminated by the <b>terrain</b> <b>feature</b> variables. This would {{seem to indicate that}} spatial interpretations of vegetation groups may be possible. While vegetational distributions aren't determined by <b>terrain</b> <b>feature</b> differences, <b>terrain</b> <b>features</b> do mirror factors which directly influence vegetational response and hence distribution. As a result, those environmental features which can be readily and rapidly ascertained on relatively small-scale imagery may prove to be valuable indicators of vegetation distribution...|$|R

The main contribution of our system is the development of a novel user interface that allows the user to interrogate the environment by sweeping a standard (unmodified) white cane back and forth: the system continuously tracks the cane location and sounds an alert if a <b>terrain</b> <b>feature</b> is detected in the direction the cane is pointing.
