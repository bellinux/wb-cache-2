500|$|Supported by gentry and nobility in East Anglia and the Thames Valley, Mary's {{military}} {{camp was}} gathering strength daily and, through luck, came into possession of powerful artillery from the royal navy. In the circumstances the Duke deemed fighting a campaign hopeless. The army proceeded from Cambridge to Bury St Edmunds and retreated again to Cambridge. On 20 July {{a letter from}} the Council in London arrived, declaring that they had proclaimed Queen Mary and commanding Northumberland to disband the army and await events. Dudley did not contemplate resistance. He explained to his fellow-commanders that they had acted on the Council's orders all the time and that he did not now wish [...] "to combat the Council's decisions, supposing that they have been moved by good reasons ... and I beg your lordships to do the same." [...] Proclaiming Mary Tudor at the market place, he threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran down his cheeks for grief." [...] The next morning the Earl of Arundel arrived to arrest him. A week earlier Arundel had assured Northumberland of his wish to spill his blood even at the Duke's feet; now Dudley went down on his knees as soon as <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of him.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of William Bannister, who having wriggled free of Steve, {{was being}} made much of by the maids.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! there's another," [...] {{said the}} man, {{with a certain}} {{satisfaction}} in his tone, as if <b>he</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of something expected.|$|R
6000|$|... "Estelle," [...] he cried, more puzzled than {{angry when}} <b>he</b> {{suddenly}} <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of us both, [...] "what {{are you doing}} here with that lout?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of Fenn and Kennedy at the gate, {{and stopped}} in his stride.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of Marguerite, and {{his pale}} face took on {{suddenly}} a more ashen hue.|$|E
60|$|Petru {{stopped for}} a moment when <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of this terrible creature. Then he found his voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll stay wi' Zavy," [...] shouted Jacob, as <b>he,</b> too, <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of {{his eldest}} brother; and, running behind the counter, he {{clutched}} David hard.|$|R
60|$|Baxter was not listening. He {{was on the}} trail. <b>He</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of a small {{closet in}} the wall, next to the mantelpiece, and it had stimulated him.|$|R
60|$|At {{that instant}} he stopped short. <b>He</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of us, {{and his face}} turned a sickly green. No doubt he felt that for once he had been {{thoroughly}} sold.|$|R
60|$|Theriere plunged {{through the}} jungle at a run for several minutes before <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of the mucker.|$|E
60|$|The {{little boy}} crowed with delight at {{the success of}} his dialectic. Then <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of Philip's feet.|$|E
60|$|The captain growled out {{something}} under his breath. He {{was about to}} speak when <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of Noel Urner.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> only <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of the jongejuffrouw {{later on}} in the morning when she came out of the molens and stepped into the sledge which stood waiting for her at the door.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Vickers turned, {{and with}} a little {{dramatic}} start intimated that <b>he</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of Mr. Russell {{for the first time}} that evening. Mr. Russell himself sought to improve the occasion.|$|R
60|$|But Considine {{heard him}} not. <b>He</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> {{of one of}} the bandits who seemed to be losing strength, and, being himself sound in wind and limb, he {{recklessly}} determined to push on.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of Erling, and {{the head}} was at once withdrawn. Next moment Erling stood outside of the house.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of the cupboard, and {{something}} seemed {{to tell him}} that there was the place to look.|$|E
60|$|The deputy had {{his foot}} on the threshold. <b>He</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of the face of Miss Carvel within, and stopped abruptly.|$|E

6000|$|... "Boys! boys! Be quiet!" [...] {{cried the}} teacher. [...] "What {{is the meaning}} of so much noise?" [...] And then <b>he,</b> too, <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of the {{dangling}} teeth. [...] "Who placed those there?" [...] he asked.|$|R
60|$|Ferris {{was not in}} view, but <b>he</b> soon <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of {{the fellow}} {{coming out of a}} {{tenement}} across the way. He crossed over and followed Ferris toward Park Row, and then to the boarding house.|$|R
60|$|The {{fallen tree}} {{obstructed}} his view, {{and it was}} several seconds before <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of his brothers in the water.|$|E
60|$|And he {{actually}} came. But he stopped when <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> {{of the open}} trap and of the mattress beneath it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hs’h! Stop!" [...] {{cried the}} frantic Mr. Burton, as <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of a woman’s figure bidding {{farewell}} in a lighted doorway.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lud love me!" [...] whispered his Royal Highness to Marguerite, {{as soon as}} <b>he</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of {{the rigid}} figure of the old lady; [...] "Lud love me! she looks very virtuous and very melancholy." ...|$|R
60|$|Satisfied {{with this}} {{explanation}} of the situation, he was quite inclined to be amiable to Juliette. Moreover, <b>he</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of the valise, and almost thought that the young girl's eyes had directed his attention towards it.|$|R
60|$|I {{know what}} it is; <b>he</b> has <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of a church. I pretend not to notice any change in him, and {{endeavour}} to hurry him on. He lags more and more behind, however, and at last stops altogether.|$|R
60|$|The hunter did {{not finish}} his sentence, for {{at that moment}} <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of the {{recumbent}} form of Wapaw in the camp.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of me, and came up, pleased to find me, but vexed {{with me for}} having got lost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he cried, startled when, {{having come}} near the fire, <b>he</b> <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of her. And he said something, frightened, in Italian.|$|E
60|$|Peters {{had been}} looking astern when the last gun was fired, and said that by its flash he {{believed}} that <b>he</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of three craft of some kind or other outside the ships moored off the port.|$|R
60|$|He came on fast; <b>he</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> {{of her and}} was urging his mule. When {{he pulled}} up beside her and dropped from the animal, muttering exclamations in an unknown tongue, Evelyn staggered. It was an Indian from the hills.|$|R
60|$|But Mr. Riley--since {{that was}} the brute's name--paid no {{attention}} to Alexander Abraham. <b>He</b> had <b>caught</b> <b>sight</b> of William Adolphus {{curled up on the}} cushion, and he started across the room to investigate him. William Adolphus sat up and began to take notice.|$|R
