5|$|Barcelona were {{expected}} to line up in a 4–2–3–1 formation, with Ronaldinho, Ludovic Giuly and Deco supporting Samuel Eto'o who would be deployed as the lone striker. They had doubts about the fitness of Lionel Messi going into the final. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> a thigh muscle during the second leg of their match with Chelsea, and had not played since, though he {{was included in the}} 22 man squad for the final. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard stated he would leave it late before deciding whether to select him. Despite being included in the squad Messi did not feature in the final. Arsenal {{were expected}} to line up in a 4–5–1 formation, with Thierry Henry as the sole striker. There was much discussion about whether José Antonio Reyes would take the place of Robert Pirès on the left of midfield. It had been announced before the match that this would be Pirès' last match as he had agreed to join Villarreal next season.|$|E
5|$|Gravel did {{not compete}} in the initial 2008 vote, the Iowa caucuses, but was still {{subjected}} to a false report from MSNBC that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> {{out of the race}} afterward. Gravel did focus his attention on the second 2008 vote, the New Hampshire primary. There he received about 400 votes out of some 280,000 cast, or 0.14percent, before taking time off to improve his health. He resumed campaigning, but fared no better in subsequent states. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running; Gravel vowed to stay in the presidential campaign until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying he wanted to help Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader. By late March, Gravel had almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten Democratic primaries.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} match, against North Zone, he unleashed {{a barrage of}} beamers against Swaranjit Singh, whom Alexander had known at Cambridge. He ignored his captain's instruction to cease this form of attack. During the lunch interval Alexander substituted him, and he was subsequently sent home, while the other players proceeded to Pakistan {{for the remainder of}} the tour. Alexander told him: “You will leave by the next flight. Good afternoon.” This marked the end of his Test career. There were suggestions that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> a knife on Alexander.|$|E

25|$|In April 1993, in the New York State Police Troop C scandal, Craig D. Harvey, a New York State Police trooper, {{was charged}} with {{fabricating}} evidence. Harvey admitted he and another trooper lifted fingerprints from items the suspect, John Spencer, touched while in Troop C headquarters during booking. He attached the fingerprints to evidence cards and later claimed that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> the fingerprints {{from the scene of}} the murder. The forged evidence was presented during John Spencer's trial and his subsequent conviction resulted in a term of 50 years to life in prison at his sentencing. Three state troopers were found guilty of fabricating fingerprint evidence and served prison sentences.|$|E
25|$|Other {{cases that}} locals can recall include that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> the snorkel from another boy while diving and had once cut down trees on a neighbour's property. He was {{described}} by teachers as being distant from reality and unemotional. At school he was a disruptive and sometimes violent child who suffered severe bullying by other children. After he was suspended from New Town Primary School in 1977, psychological assessments of Bryant noted his torturing of animals. He returned to school the following year with improved behaviour; however, he persisted in teasing younger children. He was transferred to a special education unit at New Town High School in 1980 where he deteriorated both academically and in behaviour throughout his remaining school years.|$|E
25|$|At around 9am on {{the morning}} of 17 June he flew to London on a British {{aircraft}} with Edward Spears. The escape was hair-raising, with Spears’ aide having to run to the hangar at the last minute to fetch a rope to tie on the luggage. Spears claimed that de Gaulle had been reluctant to come, and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> him into the aircraft at the last minute, although de Gaulle’s biographer does not accept this. Jean Laurent brought 100,000 gold francs in secret funds provided to him by Reynaud. De Gaulle later told André Malraux of the mental anguish which his flight to London – a break with the French Army and with the recognised government, which would inevitably be seen as treason by many - had caused him.|$|E

25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E
25|$|The post-shooting {{investigation}} found no weapons on Diallo's body; the item <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> {{out of his}} jacket was not a gun, but a rectangular black wallet. The internal NYPD investigation ruled the officers had acted within policy, based on what a reasonable police officer would {{have done in the}} same circumstances with the information they had. The Diallo shooting led to a review of police training policy and the use of full metal jacket (FMJ) bullets. On March 25, 1999, a Bronx grand jury indicted the four officers on charges of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment. All four officers' bail were set at $100,000. On December 16, an appellate court ordered a change of venue to Albany, New York, stating that pretrial publicity had made a fair trial in New York City impossible. On February 25, 2000, after two days of deliberation, a jury in Albany acquitted the officers of all charges. Officer Kenneth Boss had been previously involved in an incident where an unarmed man was shot. Another black man, 22-year-old Patrick Bailey, died after Boss shot him on October 31, 1997. As of 2012, Boss is the only remaining officer working for the NYPD. After his acquittal, Boss was disarmed and reassigned to desk duty. In October 2012, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly restored Boss' ability to carry a firearm against the protests of Diallo's family. On December 17, 2015, Kenneth Boss, received a promotion to the rank of sergeant despite objections from the victim’s mother and civil rights activists. Boss was promoted in accordance to police policy, which is not subject to review by top department officials.|$|E

500|$|Mugford {{said she}} had spent the weekend before the murders with Bamber in his cottage in Goldhanger, where he had dyed his hair black. She had seen his mother's bicycle there, she said; the {{prosecution}} later alleged that he had used this bicycle to cycle between his cottage and the farmhouse {{on the night of}} the murders, to avoid being seen in his car on the road. She told police Bamber had telephoned her at 9:50pm on 6 August to say he had been thinking about the crime all day, was [...] "pissed off", and that it was [...] "tonight or never". A few hours later, at 3:00–3:30am on 7 August, she said he phoned her again to say: [...] "Everything is going well. Something is wrong at the farm. I haven't had any sleep all night... bye honey and I love you lots." [...] Her flatmates' evidence suggested that call had come through closer to 3:00am. He called her later in the morning to tell her that Sheila had gone mad, and that a police car was coming to pick her up. When she arrived with the police at Bamber's cottage, she said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> her to one side and said: [...] "I should have been an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2011, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph told MTV News {{that the}} tour {{would have a}} [...] "post-apocalyptic vibe", and commented that [...] "Till The World Ends" [...] "keeps {{becoming}} a theme for us." [...] He also confirmed Jamie King as the tour director and Brian Friedman as the choreographer. The following month, Friedman announced that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> out of the tour due to scheduling conflicts with his own reality series. In a video interview posted on Spears's official website, she said, [...] "The Femme Fatale Tour will hopefully just be outrageously spectacular. I'm just hoping that the choreographers {{will come up with}} just the most outrageous things, and I'm really excited. This {{is one of the most}} excited I've been about a project in a really long time, so I can't wait." [...] The script of the show was created by Jamie King, and was inspired by the concept of the femme fatale and femme fatales throughout the ages. Rudolph stated that the idea for the show was to have Spears as an [...] "international woman of mystery". The setlist was composed mostly of songs from Femme Fatale, but also included hits from her previous albums, as Spears explained, [...] "The fans really like a lot of the old songs, because that's what they are used to. So it's just about finding the balance, and how many songs I wanna incorporate from the past and from the present." ...|$|E

McKinney implicated the president of District Union No. 1, the president of the Altman local, and a WFM activist in an alleged conspiracy to wreck the train.

2500|$|Beginning in July 1861, Pendleton led the {{artillery}} of the Confederate Army of the Potomac, and on March 14, 1862, he continued {{in this role}} after the army was renamed the Army of Northern Virginia. On March 26 {{he was promoted to}} brigadier general.After Robert E. Lee took over command of the army in June 1862, he attempted to remove Pendleton as chief of artillery, however he was a personal friend of Jefferson Davis, which ensured the security of his position. On July 3, Pendleton was again wounded when a mule from his artillery kicked him in the leg and possibly breaking one of his bones there. His most noted Civil War performance occurred during the 1862 Maryland Campaign. On the evening September 19 Lee gave Pendleton command of the rearguard infantry following the Battle of Shepherdstown, ordering him to hold the Potomac River crossings until the morning. Despite a commanding position from which to defend the fords, [...] "Pendleton lost track of his forces and lost control of the situation." [...] Awakening Lee after midnight, he frantically reported his position lost and all of his guns captured. This {{turned out to be a}} highly exaggerated and hasty account, as he lost only four guns, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>pulled</b> out the infantry [...] "without sufficient cause." [...] Richmond newspapers viciously reported on this incident for the remainder of the war, and unflattering rumors and jokes were spread by his own soldiers and throughout the army. At least one military court of inquiry was held to investigate Pendleton's actions at Shepherdstown. Pendleton was not particularly well-liked by the enlisted men, and it was said that [...] "while the soldiers would gladly cheer most higher officers, they remained silent when Pendleton rode past them." ...|$|E
