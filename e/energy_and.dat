5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> {{use it to}} synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device {{that is used to}} illustrate and study pathways of <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> material flows.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} network resource management, we research energy cooperation schemes by exploiting both <b>energy</b> harvesting <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> transfer strategies. Based on save-then-transmit protocol, we proposed two energy cooperation schemes for throughput optimization: two-node communication model with <b>energy</b> harvesting <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> transfer (TCM-EH-ET) <b>and</b> three-node relay communication model with <b>energy</b> harvesting <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> transfer (TRCM-EH-ET). Where, nodes in TCM-EH-ET model can harvest <b>energy</b> from nature <b>and</b> transfer <b>energy</b> to each other. In TRCM-EH-ET model, <b>energy</b> harvesting <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> transfer are only considered on source node and relay node. We {{assume that the}} nodes transmitting information have independent exogenous energy arrival processes to recharge their batteries <b>and</b> without considering <b>energy</b> expenditures on computation and sensing.|$|R

5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to momentum. Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must be a source as well. The same is true for quantities that are directly related to <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> momentum, namely internal pressure and tension. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension that serve as sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E

The results for <b>energies</b> <b>and</b> $g$-factors are in excellent agreement with experiment, with accuracy sufficient to positively assign theoretical states of given angular momentum and parity to experimental levels.
