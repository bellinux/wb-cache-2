50|$|<b>Frenching</b> a {{headlight}} or taillight {{is done in}} one of two ways: either {{removing the}} bezel, mounting the light deeper in the car's head or taillight nacelle and using the headlight rings from another car (or an aftermarket kit) to mount it deeper into the body. Or it can be done by modifying the light's mountings {{so that they can be}} removed from behind, welding the bezel to the body once the chrome plating is removed and painting it body colour. This gives the effect of visually lengthening the car, as well as smoothing out the body. Many customs have lights from another car transplanted in place of the original factory items, but even these are frenched as well.|$|E

[...] The band released a series of well-received singles on local independent record labels from 1990 to 1991.

In 1992, the band released its debut album <b>Frenching</b> the Bully.

50|$|Drummer Lelah Maupin and guitarist Eric Randall {{first met}} in Longview, Washington while working {{together}} at a Safeway grocery store. Randall met bassist Bree McKenna while his band was practicing {{in the basement of}} the punk house she lived in. Lelah Maupin met Emily Nokes in a graphic design class. The four bonded over their mutual affection for 1990s music, the riot grrrl movement, and Kevin Costner's Waterworld. They started making music together, performing at small shows and releasing singles. They released their DIY debut album Shame Spiral in 2010. That year, they also signed with Subpop imprint Hardly Art and released their second EP Take Me to Your Dealer. The Woman's Day EP followed in 2011. The band would exhaustively tour the United States over the next few years, playing basements and house shows. Other notable releases include a Ghost Mice/Tacocat split 7", a riot grrrl cover compilation album released on Teenage Teardrops Records (featuring cover art by Jessica Hopper), and the much coveted DIY tour tapes such as <b>Frenching</b> and Food Stamps and OMG.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992 Mia Zapata and her {{punk rock}} group The Gits {{released}} <b>Frenching</b> the Bully, their first album, on C/Z Records. The group members met {{one another and}} formed the band in Yellow Springs, Ohio during the mid-1980s. Their music quickly became popular throughout the area and on the Antioch College campus. Band member Moriarty describes punk rock as a combination of emotion, temperament, rage and music. The Gits moved from Ohio to San Francisco and finally to Seattle, but {{not because of the}} up-and-coming music scene. Moriarty explains that “the idea was to just go up and pour your guts out” and to play their music and express their emotion. The group dissolved after Mia Zapata was murdered on July 7, 1993 by Jesus Mezquia. The remaining members went on to team up with Joan Jett to issue the album Zapata's death had interrupted. Proceeds from the album, titled Evil Stig (Gits Live spelled backwards) went to fund an investigator into Zapata's death, which had become a cold case.′ ...|$|E

50|$|With {{the change}} in {{automobile}} design to encase the wheels in fenders and to extend the hood to the full width of the car, the former practices were no longer possible. In addition, there was tremendous automotive advertising and subsequent public interest in the new models in the 1950s. Hence custom cars came into existence, swapping headlamp rings, grilles, bumpers, chrome side strips, and tail lights, as well as <b>frenching</b> and tunnelling head- and taillights. The bodies of the cars were changed by cutting through the sheet metal, removing bits to make the car lower, welding it back together, and adding a lot of lead to make the resulting form smooth (hence the term lead sled; lead has since been replaced by Bondo). By this means, chopping made the roof lower; sectioning made the body thinner from top to bottom. Channeling was cutting notches in the floorpan where the body touches the frame to lower the whole body. Fins were often added from other cars, or made up from sheet steel. In the custom car culture, someone who merely changed the appearance without also substantially improving the performance was looked down upon.|$|E
40|$|Numerous host-specific plant {{pathogens}} suppress weed species, but do {{not provide}} control comparable to chemical herbicides. We have developed a novel method to increase the virulence of these plant pathogens. Certain amino acids, such as valine, are inhibitory to plants. Spontaneous Fusarium oxysporum Sclecht. mutants that are resistant to toxic analogs of the amino acid valine excrete high levels of valine. Growth chamber pathogenicity studies of these mutants showed increased pathogenicity to the target weed. Target plants inoculated with these mutants demonstrated symptoms similar to <b>frenching</b> disease of tobacco, a disease caused by an amino acid-excreting root saprophyte. The host range of these mutants was not altered. In addition, resistance of the mutant strains to the toxic analog marks the strains for field release. Thus, we propose this method {{as a means to}} enhance the virulence of all mycoherbicides...|$|E
