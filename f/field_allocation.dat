5000|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} began to be interested in developing MPFMs in the early 1980's, as measurement technology improved, and wellhead seperators were costly. Depleting oil reserves, (More water and gas in the produced oil) along with smaller, deeper wells with higher water contents, saw the advent of increasingly frequent occurrences of multiphase flow where the single-phase meters were unable to provide accurate answers. After a lengthy gestation period, MPFMs capable of performing the required measurements became commercially available. Much of the early research was done at the Christian Michelsen research center in Bergen, Norway, [...] and this work spawned a number of spin off companies leading to the Roxar / Emerson, Schlumberger, Framo and MPM meters. Haimo introduced a meter with partial seperation, making accurate measurement simpler. Since 1994, MPFM installation numbers have steadily increased as technology in the field has advanced, with substantial growth witnessed from 1999 onwards.

So far, many alternative metering systems have been developed, but none of them can be referred to as generally applicable or universally accurate. Both established and novel technologies suitable to measure the flow rates of gas, oil and water in a three-phase flow are reviewed and assessed within this book. Those technologies already implemented in the various commercial meters are evaluated in terms of operational and economical advantages or shortcomings from an operator point of view. The lessons learned about the practical reliability, accuracy and use of the available technology is discussed.

The book provides a critical and independent review of the current status and future trends of MFM, supported by the authors strong background on multiphase flow and by practical examples.

We address this problem in the outcrossing simultaneous hermaphroditic polychaete Ophryotrocha diadema, which shifts sex allocation by suppressing the female function in the presence of reproductive competitors or multiple partners. We document that O. diadema hermaphrodites can evaluate group size by means of a species-specific chemical released by mature individuals in water. The perception of such a water-borne signal is sufficient to trigger the observed shift in sex allocation, i. e., a suppression of the female function, irrespective of the frequency of encounters with conspecifics.

40|$|For iteroparous {{organisms in}} which {{fecundity}} is {{positively related to}} body size, a trade-off exists between allocation of energy to gonads, thus ensuring some reproductive output, and allocation to somatic growth, thus increasing potential fecundity in the future. This tradeoff can influence several life-history patterns, including when, for organisms that grow after maturity, allocation to gonads begins following the previous reproductive event. White crappie Pomoxis annularis, a spring-spawning freshwater fish, began allocating energy to ovaries in autumn {{at the expense of}} continued somatic growth and higher potential fecundity. Within five populations, the amount of early allocation varied between years. We combined dynamic programming with an individual-based model to determine how summer and spring feeding conditions interact to influence when allocation to reproduction should begin. Model results indicated that autumn allocation to ovaries was in response to future spring feeding conditions rather than recent summer feeding conditions.

Ectomycorrhizal fungi form symbioses {{with most}} {{temperate}} and boreal tree species, but difficulties in measuring carbon allocation to these symbionts {{have prevented the}} assessment of their importance in forest ecosystems. Here, I surveyed allocation patterns in 14 culture studies and five field studies of ectomycorrhizal plants. In culture studies, allocation to ectomycorrhizal fungi (NPPf) was linearly related to total belowground net primary production (NPPb) by the equation NPPf 5 41. 5 % 3 NPPb 2 11. 3 % (r 2 5 0. 55, P, 0. 001) and ranged from 1 – 21 % of total net primary production. As a percentage of NPP, allocation to ectomycorrhizal fungi was highest at lowest plant growth rates and lowest nutrient availabilities. Because total belowground allocation can be estimated using carbon balance techniques, these relationships should allow ecologists to incorporate mycorrhizal fungi into existing ecosystem models. In <b>field</b> studies, <b>allocation</b> to ectomycorrhizal fungi ranged from 0 % to 22 % of total allocation, but wide differences in measurement techniques made intercomparisons difficult.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we tackle {{the issue of}} the {{automatic}} recognition of functional dependencies among guessed predicates in constraint problem specifications. Functional dependencies arise frequently in pure declarative specifications, because of the intermediate results that need to be computed in order to express some of the constraints, or due to precise modelling choices, e. g., to provide multiple viewpoints of the search space in order to increase propagation. In either way, the recognition of dependencies greatly helps solvers, letting them avoid spending search on unfruitful branches, while maintaining the highest degree of declarativeness. By modelling constraint problem specifications as second-order formulae, we provide a characterization of functional dependencies in terms of semantic properties of first-order ones. Additionally, we show how suitable search procedures can be automatically synthesized in order to exploit recognized dependencies. We present opl examples of various problems, from bio-informatics, planning and resource <b>allocation</b> <b>fields,</b> and show how in many cases opl greatly benefits from the addition of such search procedures. ...|$|R
