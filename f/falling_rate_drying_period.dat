The popcorn kernels initially conditioned to 25 % moisture content were dried in a bench scale rotary drier to 14 % moisture content at various air flow rates (0. 83, 1. 397, 2. 79 m/s) and temperatures (50 oC, 60 oC, 70 oC and 80 oC). <b>Falling</b> <b>rate</b> <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> was observed {{for the three}} popcorn varieties with Pin popcorn having the highest drying rate.

40|$|PROJECT GOALS: To {{understand}} and quantify moisture transport in textile structures so that novel/improved materials for fluid management and novel/improved drying processes may be developed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other techniques {{are being used}} to investigate moisture transport in textiles.

The experimental drying time of sweet potato cubes dehydrated by three drying methods, i. e., air-drying, freeze-drying, and freeze-drying with far-infrared radiation, were compared, and freeze-drying with far-infrared radiation {{was found to be}} able to reduce the drying time of sweet potato. Both constant and <b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> <b>drying</b> <b>periods</b> were observed, and empirical equations were developed to study the behavior of <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> in <b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> <b>period.</b> On the other hand, four mathematical models were used to describe the drying characteristics of sweet potato during freeze-drying with far-infrared radiation. The coefficients of determination (R- 2) in the exponential, Page, and approximate diffusion model were found to be above 0. 98, and that of diffusion model was above 0. 92. The rank of fitness of those models was Page, approximate diffusion, exponential and diffusion model. The choice of Page model was evident because of the lowest residual as well as RMSE.

40|$|Moisture {{control of}} {{industrial}} processes {{is often difficult}} and complex. The product composition and moisture content changes as disturbances affect the upstream production processes. When there are changes in the product content, simple control configurations may not work due {{to changes in the}} drying characteristics of the product. This thesis presents a general conveyor-belt dryer model describing a six-zone multiple-pass dryer, accounting for the <b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> <b>drying</b> <b>period,</b> input disturbances, conveyor-belts with different belt speeds and product bed heights. In addition, a description is presented of how linear input dynamics can be included in the dryer model. Furthermore, open loop simulations are performed in order to investigate the behavior of the model. The model is linearized and reduced, in order to be utilized in a model-based control solution (MPC), where stability and feasibility is ensured through an algorithm based on known techniques within the field of model predictive control (e. g. infinite horizon optimalization, target optimalization routine, soft constraints and a Kalman filter). Several closed loop simulation examples are presented, illustrating reference steps and disturbance rejection. Furthermore, a modeling error is introduced in order to investigate the limitations imposed by model uncertainty. Finally, a basic control solution (PI control) is compared to the model-based control. </p...|$|E

The traditional protocol which consists in carrying out drying experimental tests at constant temperatures 40 – 45 – 50 – 55 °C and a new protocol which consists in carrying out these tests at variable temperatures in an increasing and decreasing way between 40 °C and 55 °C. All the experimental drying curves show only a <b>falling</b> <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> <b>period.</b> The main factor in controlling this rate {{is found to be}} the drying air temperature. The mode at variable temperatures in an increasing way is more performant and more efficient than the mode at decreasing way or at constant temperature. These experimental curves are fitted to a number of mathematical models. The Midilli–Kucuk drying model is found as the best model which suitably follows the drying curves of spearmint. The characteristic drying curve of spearmint is determined and compared with the modes at variable temperatures. Those at constant temperature and increasing temperature are very close with a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 8 and Chi-square (χ 2) of 0. 014, whereas the decreasing mode is a little distant due to the problem of rehumidification at the drying end.

40|$|Atmospheric or {{convective}} {{freeze drying}} (AFD) is a dehydration process mostly {{employed in the}} food industry. It is also a promising process for the freeze drying of high-end products in the biological and pharmaceutical industry. Proteolytic and lipolytic activity as well as changes in lipid classes and lipid oxidation for products from AFD were investigated and the general potential of the drying method is described. The <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> in AFD is generally low. In order to accelerate the drying process, the application of high intensity, airborne ultrasound in AFD (US-AFD) was investigated for different products and under different drying conditions. The <b>drying</b> <b>rates</b> obtained in AFD and US-AFD show that both processes occur in the <b>falling</b> <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> <b>period</b> and no <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> with a constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> occurs. A modification of the Weibull model was developed and showed high accuracy for modelling and evaluating <b>drying</b> <b>rates</b> in AFD and US-AFD. In general, US-AFD investigations showed a faster <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> than AFD. The effective mass transfer for the sublimation of pure ice particles increased by 38 % and the effective diffusion for peas is increased by 24. 7 % at an approach velocity of 1 m sec- 1. Airborne ultrasound increased AFD processes especially at low temperatures and low approach velocities during the first hours of drying. Even a minor ultrasonic field increased the effective diffusion significantly. The product quality (shrinkage and colour) is not affected by {{the application of the}} ultrasonic field. A higher mass transfer rate at the solid-gas interface, caused by a reduced boundary layer due to a higher turbulent interface, is identified as the cause for the higher effective diffusion in US-AFD. Hence high intensity, airborne ultrasound has great potential to accelerate <b>drying</b> <b>rates</b> and reduce investment and production costs associated with AFD. It can be expected that other low temperature processes that are based on convective heat and/or mass transfer (such as blast freezing) can be improved in presence of airborne ultrasound.

40|$|Traditionally, {{textiles}} were dried outdoors {{with the}} wind and the sun enhancing the drying process. Tumble dryers offer a fast and convenient way of drying textiles independent of weather conditions. Tumble dryers, however, consume large amounts of electrical energy. Over 4 million tumble dryers are sold each year in Europe and a considerable amount of energy is used for drying of clothes. Increasing energy costs and the awareness about environmental problems related to a large energy use has increased the demand for dryers with better energy efficiency. The aim with this thesis is to show how to improve the energy efficiency of domestic tumble dryers. Two types of tumble dryers are available on the market today: the open cycle dryer and the closed cycle dryer. In the open cycle dryer room air is heated and led into the drying drum. The exhaust air leaves the dryer and is often evacuated outside the building. In the closed cycle dryer an internal airflow is recirculated inside the dryer. When the hot air has passed through the drying drum it is led through a heat exchanger where the water vapour is condensed before the air is heated again and led to the drum. The heat exchanger is cooled with room air. Drying at low temperature has been shown to reduce the specific energy use for an open cycle tumble dryer. In Paper I a correlation between the specific energy use, the drying time and the heat supply was established for a specific load by using the exhaust air temperature. It was shown that the total drying time and specific energy use could be predicted from data during the first hour of the process. This result indicated a possibility to create a control system that makes it possible for the user to choose between low energy use or short drying time. The focus of Paper II is to reduce the energy use for a closed cycle tumble dryer. Energy and mass balances were established in order to determine feasible improvements. Energy and mass flows in the dryer indicated that reducing leakage from the internal system of the dryer gave the largest reduction of specific energy use. Insulation of the back cover of the dryer and opening the internal system during the <b>falling</b> <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> <b>period</b> also gave positive results on the energy use.

40|$|During {{convective}} drying, {{the existence}} of a constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> <b>period</b> (first <b>drying</b> <b>period)</b> is of great importance as it denotes an efficient internal mass transfer through capillary forces. Below the domain of free water, internal moisture movement is much slower and the mechanical properties may change, leading to a significant effect on product quality. The existence of this first <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> is usually demonstrated by the observation of a constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> stage. However, with highly deformeable materials, the overall <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> is misleading due to the substantial decrease of the exchange surface.

40|$|Air drying {{of paper}} by pure impingement, pure through flow and by {{combination}} of impingement and through flow was studied. For the combined process the inlet and both outlet air flow rates were held constant throughout drying, thereby providing results appropriate {{for analysis of}} the complex and interacting kinetics. Pure impingement <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> curves were quantified with three parameters which were related to drying process conditions: constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate,</b> critical moisture content and the exponent for a power law relationship over the <b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> period. The Churchill - Usagi asymptotic approach model was tested and found not applicable. For pure through drying the constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> <b>period</b> disappears at higher drying intensities leaving two <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> <b>periods,</b> the increasing <b>rate</b> and <b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> periods. A theoretically based exponential relationship was obtained for the increasing rate period, where up to 47 % of the drying may occur. <b>Drying</b> <b>rate</b> curves were quantified with no subjective judgements, using five parameters: moisture contents {{at the end of}} the increasing rate and constant <b>rate</b> <b>periods,</b> constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate,</b> and exponents for the increasing and <b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> period relations. A universal normalized <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> curve was obtained. Through <b>drying</b> <b>rates</b> are the same with or without impinging jets. In combined impingement and through air drying, an adiabatic process, removal of impingement boundary layer humidity by through flow makes both components of the process nonadiabatic. Relative to pure impingement drying, impingement water removal rates are sensitively reduced by through flow. Because critical moisture content is intrinsically lower for through drying than impingement drying, through flow water removal rate curves can be strikingly different from pure through drying, with addition of a unique feature, a secondary increasing rate period when paper temperature is driven up by the <b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> period of impingement water removal. Parameters for quantitative representation were determined, analyzed and related to drying process conditions. Of two prior models for the combined impingement and through air drying of paper, trends assumed by Randall (1984) are now found contrary to actual rates while the Crotogino and Allenger (1979) model has the trends correct but over predicts the <b>drying</b> <b>rates</b> now measured.

Highly refined pulps with microfibrils were determined to have two critical drying points, i. e., two minima in the second derivative of weight versus time, not before reported in the literature. Also in this study, hard-to-remove (HR) water content is related to the area above the first derivative curve in the constant <b>rate</b> and <b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> <b>drying</b> zones. This measure of HR water correlates with a previous measurement method of HR water but is less ambiguous for materials that lack a constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> zone. Blends of unbeaten fibers and microfibril containing samples were prepared and show potential as composite materials...|$|R

Results indicated that drying {{took place in the}} <b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> <b>period.</b> The <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> increased with <b>drying</b> microwave power, but decreased with moisture content. The effective diffusivity varied from 1. 54 × 10 - 10 to 1. 43 × 10 - 9 m 2 /s. About 22. 54 % increase in drying efficiency and about 28. 94 % (0. 937 MJ/kg[H 2 O]) decrease in specific energy consumption could be obtainable by increasing the microwave power from 200 to 500 W. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the <b>drying</b> <b>rates</b> of solar <b>dried</b> pears were {{investigated}} for {{fruits of the}} varieties Amêndoa, Amorim, Carapinheira Branca and S. Bartolomeu, all originating from Portugal. From the results {{it was possible to}} conclude that all varieties showed a similar drying behaviour, characterised by the absence of the constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> <b>period</b> and by a <b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> period involving two different stages, according to the degree of moisture removal. The experimental data for the variations in water content over time was fitted to two different empirical models with the better performance coming from the sigmoid function. The data for the curves of <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> versus moisture content was fitted to one model, with good results. The variations of the <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> with time were fitted to two models with the first order kinetic function fitting the experimental data better than a second degree polynomial. The experimental data was used to predict effective diffusivity according to Fick’s law with the values of diffusivity obtained ranging from 9. 756 e- 10 m 2 s- 1 for the variety S.

40|$|Convective drying of two {{different}} types of wastewater sludges is investigated. Experiments are realised in a micro-dryer, for air temperatures of 80 °C, 140 °C and 200 °C, the velocity and humidity remaining the same. The product drying kinetics presents, for all studied cases, three main phases, which are: adaptation phase, constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> phase and <b>falling</b> <b>drying</b> <b>rate.</b> A comparison between two mathematical approaches allows determination of the diffusion coefficient. The value of this coefficient depends on the origin of the wastewater sludge and the operating temperatures. Physical changes such as shrinkage are introduced into the mathematical model...|$|R
5000|$|In some {{products}} having {{a relatively high}} initial moisture content, an initial linear reduction of the average product moisture content {{as a function of}} time may be observed for a limited time, often known as a [...] "constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> period". Usually, in this period, it is surface moisture outside individual particles that is being removed. The <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> during this <b>period</b> is mostly dependent on the rate of heat transfer to the material being dried. Therefore, the maximum achievable <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> is considered to be heat-transfer limited. If drying is continued, the slope of the curve, the <b>drying</b> <b>rate,</b> becomes less steep (<b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> period) and eventually tends to nearly horizontal at very long times. The product moisture content is then constant at the [...] "equilibrium moisture content", where it is, in practice, in equilibrium with the dehydrating medium. In the falling-rate period, water migration from the product interior to the surface is mostly by molecular diffusion, i,e. the water flux is proportional to the moisture content gradient. This means that water moves from zones with higher moisture content to zones with lower values, a phenomenon explained by the second law of thermodynamics. If water removal is considerable, the products usually undergo shrinkage and deformation, except in a well-designed freeze-drying process. The <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> in the falling-rate period is controlled by the rate of removal of moisture or solvent from the interior of the solid being dried and is referred to as being [...] "mass-transfer limited". This is widely noticed in hygroscopic products such as fruits and vegetables, where drying occurs in the <b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> period with the constant <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> <b>period</b> said to be negligible.|$|R
40|$|New understanding, theories, and {{techniques}} for moisture flow and distribution {{were developed in}} this research on wood and wood fiber. Improved understanding of the mechanisms of flake drying has been provided. Observations of flake <b>drying</b> and <b>drying</b> <b>rate</b> curves revealed that rate of moisture loss consisted of two <b>falling</b> <b>rate</b> periods and no constant <b>rate</b> <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> was observed. Convective heat transfer controls the first period, and bound water diffusion controls the second period. Influence of lower drying temperatures on bending properties of wood flakes was investigated. Drying temperature {{was found to have}} a significant influence on bending stiffness and strength. A worksheet for calculation of the energy required to dry a single strandboard flake was developed but has not been tested in an industrial setting yet. A more complete understanding of anisotropic transverse shrinkage of wood is proposed based on test results and statistical analysis. A simplified mod el of a wood cell's cross-section was drawn for calculating differential transverse shrinkage. The model utilizes cell wall thickness and microfibrillar packing density and orientation. In spite of some phenomena of cell wall structure not yet understood completely, the results might explain anisotropic transverse shrinkage to a major extent. Boundary layer theory was found useful for evaluating external moisture resistance during drying. Simulated moisture gradients were quire comparable to the actual gradients in dried wood. A mathematical procedure for determining diffusion and surface emission coefficients was also developed. Thermal conductivity models of wood derived from its anatomical structure were created and tested against experimental values. Model estimations provide insights into changes in heat transfer parameters during drying. Two new techniques for measuring moisture gradients created in wood during drying were developed. A new technique that utilizes optical properties of cobalt chloride was developed for nondestructive determination of surface moisture content. Fundamental new understanding of drying characteristics in wood and fiber has been provided that can be used by researchers to improve drying of wood and fiber. The three techniques for measuring moisture content and gradients provided in this study are efficient, practical, and economical - easy to apply by industry and researchers. An energy consumption worksheet is provided as a first step toward reducing energy consumed during drying of lumber and strandboard flakes. However, it will need additional verification and testing...|$|R

Due to legislative rules antibiotic therapy plays only a small role in combating mastitis. Therefore working standards which are able to reduce the new infection rate must be implemented in dairy herds.
