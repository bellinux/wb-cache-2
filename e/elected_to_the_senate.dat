50|$|Illuzzi {{was first}} <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Vermont <b>Senate</b> in 1980.

He did not run for reelection in 2012, and was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for Vermont Auditor of Accounts.|$|R
5|$|In 1874, Parker was {{the caucus}} nominee of the Republican Party for a Missouri Senate seat. However, the {{political}} tide had shifted in Missouri; it seemed unlikely {{that he would}} be <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> so he sought a presidential appointment as judge for the Western District of Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|After {{being forced}} from Goldman Sachs in January 1999, Corzine campaigned for a New Jersey Senate seat after Frank Lautenberg {{announced}} his retirement. Despite initially trailing behind his {{opponent in the}} Democratic primary by 30 percentage points, Corzine won the nomination and was subsequently <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> by a four-percent margin over his Republican opponent, four-term United States Congressman Bob Franks, in the November 2000 election and was sworn into the Senate in January 2001.|$|E
5|$|James Abram Garfield (November 19, 1831– September 19, 1881) was the 20th President of the United States, serving from March 4, 1881, {{until his}} {{assassination}} later that year. Garfield had served nine {{terms in the}} House of Representatives, and had been <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> before his candidacy for the White House, though he declined the Senate seat once he was elected President. He is the only sitting House member to be elected president.|$|E
50|$|Henry I.

5|$|Mathias was <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1968, {{unseating}} {{the incumbent}} Democrat, Daniel Brewster, who twenty years earlier {{had been his}} roommate while attending the University of Maryland School of Law. He continued his record as a liberal Republican in the Senate, and frequently clashed with the conservative wing of his party. For {{a few months in}} late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to stave off the increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2010, Massachusetts Republican Scott Brown was <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in {{a special}} {{election}} to replace Kennedy, having campaigned on giving the Republican minority the 41st vote needed to sustain Republican filibusters. His victory had become significant because of its effects on the legislative process. The first was psychological: the symbolic importance of losing Kennedy's traditionally Democratic Massachusetts seat made many Congressional Democrats concerned about the political cost of passing a bill.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Tennessee {{after his}} presidency, Johnson sought {{political}} vindication, and gained {{it in his}} eyes when he was <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> again in 1875, making Johnson the only former president {{to serve in the}} Senate. He died just months into his term. While some admire Johnson's strict constitutionalism, his strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for African Americans is widely criticized. He is regarded by many historians as one of the worst presidents in American history.|$|E

5|$|By early July, Butler had {{realized}} {{the futility of}} his race, and took to ignoring Tillman in his speeches, which the governor reciprocated, taking much of the drama from the debates. The two men even rode in the same carriage on July 4. Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was overwhelmingly won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest before the Senate. On December 11, 1894, Benjamin Tillman was <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> by the new legislature with 131 votes. Butler received 21 and three votes were scattered.|$|E
5|$|Having {{just been}} <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> with Sherman's support, Garfield entered the 1880 {{campaign}} season committed to Sherman as his {{choice for the}} Republican presidential nominee. Even before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia, thought Garfield {{the best choice for}} the nomination. Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions. Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former president Grant, but several other candidates attracted delegates as well.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2013, Booker was {{declared}} {{the winner of}} the Democratic primary, with approximately 59% of the vote. On October 16, 2013, he defeated Republican Steve Lonegan in the general election 55% to 44%, making him the first African-American U.S. Senator from New Jersey and the first African-American to be <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> since Barack Obama in 2004. The night before his victory, Booker visited the gravesite of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, where he offered his prayers and lit a vigil in memory of his father.|$|E

5|$|Pulsford {{established}} a successful business {{with his father}} as commission agents in Yorkshire before moving his interests to New South Wales in 1883. There he became a vigorous campaigner for free trade, and was a co-founder of the Free Trade and Liberal Association in that colony, the body that would later become the machine behind the Free Trade Party. Although his attempts to enter the New South Wales Legislative Assembly were abortive, he {{was appointed to the}} Legislative Council in 1895 and served until 1901, when he was <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> An uncompromising opponent of all forms of protectionism, following the 1909 Fusion of the anti-Labour forces he joined the Liberal Party only with reluctance.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{during this}} time {{purchased}} the property in Mentor that reporters later dubbed Lawnfield, and from which he would conduct the first successful front porch campaign for the presidency. Hayes suggested that Garfield run for governor in 1879, seeing that as a road that would likely put Garfield in the White House. Garfield preferred to seek election as senator, and devoted his efforts to seeing that Republicans won the 1879 election for the General Assembly, with the likely Democratic candidate the incumbent, Allen G. Thurman. The Republicans swept the legislative elections. Rivals were spoken of for the seat, such as Secretary Sherman, but he had presidential ambitions (for which he sought Garfield's support), and other candidates fell by the wayside. Garfield was <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> by the General Assembly in January 1880, though his term was not to begin until March 4, 1881.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Tillman accused {{his junior}} {{colleague}} from South Carolina, John L. McLaurin, {{of corruption in}} a speech to the Senate. McLaurin, who had been a Tillmanite before breaking from him after being <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> called him a liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across the Senate floor and punched McLaurin in the face. McLaurin reciprocated, giving Tillman a bloody nose before the Sergeant at Arms and senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt. The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman argued that it was unfair to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the body could certainly expel the two men—knowing he had enough Democratic votes to prevent it. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.|$|E

5|$|With Butler's {{chances for}} the presidential {{nomination}} waning, Breckinridge convinced the Kentucky delegation to the 1852 Democratic National Convention not to nominate Butler until later balloting when he might become a compromise candidate. He urged restraint when Lewis Cass's support dropped sharply on the twentieth ballot, but Kentucky's delegates would wait no longer; on the next ballot, they nominated Butler, but he failed to gain support. After Franklin Pierce, Breckinridge's second choice, was nominated, Breckinridge tried, unsuccessfully, to recruit Douglas to Pierce's cause. Pierce lost by 3,200 votes in Kentucky—one of four states won by Winfield Scott—but {{was elected to the}} presidency, and appointed Breckinridge governor of Washington Territory in recognition of his efforts. Unsure of his re-election chances in Kentucky, Breckinridge had sought the appointment, but after John J. Crittenden, rumored to be his challenger, was <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1853, he decided to decline it and run for re-election.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{supporters}} {{believed he}} would again seek the governorship of Kentucky or be {{appointed to the}} Supreme Court of the United States in the early 1950s; some even formed a committee to elect Cooper president. Cooper considered running for governor in 1951, but when Chapman {{was killed in an}} automobile accident on March 8, 1951, he decided to make another run for the Senate against Thomas R. Underwood, Governor Lawrence Wetherby's appointee to fill the vacancy. Underwood was considered a heavy favorite in the race. Some Republicans faulted Cooper for taking an appointment from Democrat Truman. Both the Louisville Times and the Louisville Courier-Journal recanted their statements in 1950 for Cooper to seek election to the Senate in 1954. They now feared that the election of a Republican would allow that party to organize the Senate, giving key committee chairmanships to isolationists opposed to continued US involvement in the Korean War. Nevertheless, Cooper defeated Underwood by 29,000 votes in the election and served out the remainder of Chapman's term. His victory marked the first time in Kentucky's history that a Republican had been <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> more than once.|$|E
5|$|Governor Broward {{ran for the}} U.S. Senate in 1908 but lost. Broward and his predecessor, William Jennings, {{were paid}} by Richard Bolles to tour the state to promote drainage. Broward was <b>elected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1910, but died before he could take office. He was eulogized across Florida for his {{leadership}} and progressive inspiration. Rapidly growing Fort Lauderdale paid him tribute by naming Broward County after him (the town's original plan had been to name it Everglades County). Land in the Everglades was being sold for $15 an acre a month after Broward died. Meanwhile, Henry Flagler continued to build railway stations at towns {{as soon as the}} populations warranted them. News of the Panama Canal inspired him to connect his rail line to the closest deep water port. Biscayne Bay was too shallow, so Flagler sent railway scouts to explore the possibility of building the line through to the tip of mainland Florida. The scouts reported that not enough land was present to build through the Everglades, so Flagler instead changed the plan to build to Key West in 1912.|$|E
