5|$|Soon {{complications}} {{arise from}} these curses. Boomblehardt finds Sergeant Klooque's curse hilarious and decides {{that if he}} must give out money, the sergeant <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as any other. The shy Pipette throws herself at Sergeant, who unwillingly ducks and dodges, trying to avoid her. When Peter arrives, he is forced {{to get into a}} fight with the sergeant over her, at which, to his surprise, the brave sergeant cowers, dodges, and ducks. Boomblehardt continues passing out guineas, his fortune dribbling away. Then Martha chases her customers out of the inn with a broom: She too has been cursed. Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced to behave in a manner contrary to his or her intrinsic nature.|$|E

25|$|Chiropractors often {{argue that}} this {{education}} <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as or better than medical physicians', but most chiropractic training is confined to classrooms with much time spent learning theory, adjustment, and marketing. The fourth year of chiropractic education persistently showed the highest stress levels. Every student, irrespective of year, experienced different ranges of stress when studying. The chiropractic leaders and colleges have had internal struggles. Rather than cooperation, there has been infighting between different factions. A number of actions were posturing due to the confidential nature of the chiropractic colleges {{in an attempt to}} enroll students.|$|E

25|$|Despite expectations, {{prior to}} and during the season a total of sevenUT players were {{suspended}} for various infractions. Brown said “I am extremely disappointed that four of our student-athletes have had issues with the law this summer. That is not reflective of the high standard of class, character and integrity we have established at Texas for many years. It’s a shame that these recent events have generated {{a great deal of}} negative attention, because I do think that overall, this <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> of a group of kids that I’ve ever coached. I think that will show over time.” The negative publicity was more extensive than in past instances but Mack Brown publicly supported the players while denouncing their actions.|$|E
25|$|Darine contrives a ruse to win Sir Ethais's love. She {{tells him}} that Sir Phyllon had accused him of exaggerating the {{severity}} of his wound, {{so that he could}} avoid fighting again. Sir Ethais is outraged at being called a coward, and wants to challenge Sir Phyllon if he ever recovers. Darine {{tells him that}} she has the cure, but she will give it to him only if he promises to love her. Sir Ethais agrees, and observing that one beautiful woman <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as another, gives Selene's ring to Darine. He takes the potion, and is cured. Sir Phyllon enters, and Sir Ethais accosts him. Their argument escalates, and Sir Ethais turns to Darine to confirm that Sir Phyllon had accused him of cowardice. Darine admits that this was only an artifice. Sir Ethais asks Sir Phyllon's forgiveness and renounces Darine. She implores him to reconsider.|$|E
25|$|The {{method used}} to read NANDflash memory can cause nearby cells in the same memory block to change over time (become programmed). This is known as read disturb. The {{threshold}} number of reads is generally {{in the hundreds of}} thousands of reads between intervening erase operations. If reading continually from one cell, that cell will not fail but rather one of the surrounding cells on a subsequent read. To avoid the read disturb problem the flash controller will typically count the total number of reads to a block since the last erase. When the count exceeds a target limit, the affected block is copied over to a new block, erased, then released to the block pool. The original block <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as new after the erase. If the flash controller does not intervene in time, however, a read disturb error will occur with possible data loss if the errors are too numerous to correct with an error-correcting code.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

They felt that the game attempts to appeal to gamers rather than aspiring chefs, concluding, [...] " [...] some great recipes but the experience is marred by some fiddly cooking games." ...|$|E

He did get full recognition for the discovery of the two moons, Hiiaka and Namaka. On the fifth anniversary of the discovery he wrote a blog post with his thoughts on the importance of the discovery, but did not mention any events regarding the controversy.|$|E

[...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that the lyric [...] "God gave you style and gave you grace," [...] Martin sings as if [...] "cataloguing the attributes he only wishes he had". When the song is performed live, guitarist Jonny Buckland begins a long ripping off guitar riff while Chris Martin plays an acoustic guitar.|$|E

[...] Ted Kessler of NME wrote: [...] "Over a pounding garage tattoo Martin poses a deep, mortality-based teaser ('where {{do we go from}} here?'), asserts some self-belief ('God gave me style, God gave me grace') and then hits upon the bottom line as the song's mood suddenly improves with another fat and glorious chorus: 'Yeah, when you work it out I'm the same as you....your guess <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as mine.'" ...|$|E
