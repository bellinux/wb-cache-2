5|$|Feeling {{the need}} to seek out truth creates a {{separation}} between {{the mind of a}} poet and the mind of a philosopher. The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God's presence. However, the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> help humanity. Nature can be soothing, but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate. The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry. In Reflections, to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward. Instead, the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all.|$|E

60|$|Walter {{had some}} idle notion {{in his head}} that it was Puritanical to speak courteously to servants, and despising Diggory for his cowardice and stupidity, he was {{especially}} overbearing with him, and went on rating {{him all the time}} he was putting on his boots, to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> catch some fish for the morrow's dinner, which was likely to be but scanty.

60|$|He is dead but thirty years, and one {{asks how}} a great society could have tolerated him? Would we bear him now? In this {{quarter of a}} century, what a silent {{revolution}} has been working! how it has separated us from old times and manners! How it has changed men themselves! I can see old gentlemen now among us, of perfect good breeding, of quiet lives, with venerable grey heads, fondling their grandchildren; and look at them, and wonder at what they were once. That gentleman of the grand old school, {{when he was in}} the 10th Hussars, and dined at the prince’s table, would fall under it night after night. Night after night, that gentleman sat at Brookes’s or Raggett’s over the dice. If, in the petulance of play or drink, that gentleman spoke a sharp word to his neighbour, he and the other would infallibly <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> shoot each other the next morning. That gentleman would drive his friend Richmond the black boxer down to Moulsey, and hold his coat, and shout and swear, and hurrah with delight, whilst the black man was beating Dutch Sam the Jew. That gentleman would take a manly pleasure in pulling his own coat off, and thrashing a bargeman in a street row. That gentleman has been in a watchhouse. That gentleman, so exquisitely polite with ladies in a drawing-room, so loftily courteous, if he talked now as he used among men in his youth, would swear so as to make your hair stand on end. I met lately a very old German gentleman, who had served in our army at the beginning of the century. Since then he has lived on his own estate, but rarely meeting with an Englishman, whose language—the language of fifty years ago that is—he possesses perfectly. When this highly bred old man began to speak English to me, almost every other word he uttered was an oath: as they used it (they swore dreadfully in Flanders) with the Duke of York before Valenciennes, or at Carlton House over the supper and cards. Read Byron’s letters. So accustomed is the young man to oaths that he employs them even in writing to his friends, and swears by the post. Read his account of the doings of young men at Cambridge, of the ribald professors, one of whom “could pour out Greek like a drunken helot”, and whose excesses surpassed even those of the young men. Read Matthews’s description of the boyish lordling’s housekeeping at Newstead, the skull-cup passed round, the monks’ dresses from the masquerade warehouse, in which the young scapegraces used to sit until daylight, chanting appropriate songs round their wine. “We come to breakfast at two or three o’clock,” Matthews says. “There are gloves and foils for those who like to amuse themselves, or we fire pistols at a mark in the hall, or we worry the wolf.” A jolly life truly! The noble young owner of the mansion writes about such affairs himself in letters to his friend, Mr. John Jackson, pugilist, in London.|$|E

Instead, Benno retreats more and more into Sandra's dream, where he is free to do whatever he wants, but in real life, the sand in his apartment is piling up, eventually trapping him. In desperation, he asks Sandra for help in her dream.|$|R

50|$|Released as {{an attempt}} to break the {{international}} market, the album was originally intended to be released all over Europe, including France and the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, North Africa and Asia, in at least 45 countries initially, with a possible release in the United States. However, after little to no promotional performances by Paparizou, and the failure of the album in Sweden and lack of success of the singles, the international release of the album became an aborted project by Sony BMG and thus it was released in only 14 countries. Paparizou had also stated at the time, that she did not wish to leave her family and loved ones behind in Greece, to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> make a career internationally.

50|$|One day {{the village}} of Flake falls under attack, and all the {{children}} - including Vicky’s girlfriend Ylvi (Mercedes Jadea Diaz) - are kidnapped except for Vicky himself, so Vicky, his father Halvar and the other Vikings of the village decide to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> rescue them. The kidnappers {{turn out to be}} Sven the Terrible and his band of Viking pirates, who are hunting for a legendary treasure, and in order to gain it, they need the assistance of a child who has never spoken a lie in his or her life. Whilst in pursuit, the Flake Vikings pick up a young Chinese girl and an obnoxious bard (Michael Herbig) for company, and together they succeed in rescuing the children, outsmarting Sven and escaping back to Flake with the treasure (though it is not as bountiful as they might have imagined).|$|E
6000|$|I {{used to be}} {{an honest}} man. I am crumbling. No--I have crumbled. When they {{assessed}} me at $75,000 a fortnight ago I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>tried</b> to borrow the money, and couldn't; then when I found they were letting a whole crop of millionaires live in New York at a third of the price they were charging me I was hurt, I was indignant, and said: [...] "This is the last feather. I am not going to run this town all by myself." [...] In that moment--in that memorable moment--I began to crumble. In fifteen minutes the disintegration was complete. In fifteen minutes I had become just a mere moral sand-pile; and I lifted up my hand along with those seasoned and experienced deacons and swore off every rag of personal property I've got in the world, clear down to cork leg, glass eye, and what is left of my wig.|$|R
5000|$|Olivier Peslier {{took over}} from Doyle on 2 August when Amazing Maria, as predicted, {{was sent to}} France for the Group One Prix Rothschild over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse and started the 5.5/1 third choice in the betting behind Ervedya and Bawina. The other five runners were Rizeena, Fintry, the unbeaten three-year-old Usherette, Odeliz (a Group Three winner in Germany) and Amulet. Amazing Maria raced in mid {{division}} before moving up into second place behind Avenir Certain 300 metres from the finish. She overtook the favourite 100 metres <b>out</b> <b>and</b> drew ahead to win by one and a quarter lengths. O'Meara commented [...] "It’s brilliant, she is obviously a very good filly. There was probably some doubt about whether she was truly a Group One filly after Royal Ascot, but she’s done it again twice since then and you’d have to say she’s among the best fillies in Europe now... {{there was no real}} plan going out.

60|$|Accordingly, the sloop of war Sophia, {{commanded}} by Captain Lockyer, {{was sent to}} Barrataria to treat with Lafitte, and when this vessel arrived off {{the mouth of the}} harbor, which she could not enter, she began firing signal guns in order {{to attract the attention of}} the people of the colony. Naturally enough, the report of the Sophia's guns created a great excitement in Barrataria, and all the people who happened to be at the settlement at that time crowded out upon the beach to see what they could see. But the war-vessel was too far away for them to distinguish her nationality, and Lafitte quickly made up his mind that the only thing for him to do was to row out to the mouth of the harbor and see what was the matter. Without doubt he feared that this was the United States vessel which had come to break up his settlement. But whether this was the case or not, he must <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>try</b> the effect of fair words, for he had no desire whatever to defend his interests by hard blows.|$|R
