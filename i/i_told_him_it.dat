25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and}} so on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E
500|$|Despite his mixed {{feelings}} on joining the club, Gunn's overall impression {{of his time}} in Edinburgh is upbeat: [...] "I only played 12 games for the Hibees but it was great. We beat Hearts in my only derby game 2–1 (John Robertson scored his 50th goal for Hearts in derbies but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was worth nothing as we had won) and had a clean sheet at Celtic Park (stopping them from winning the SPL that day)." [...] He received what he described as a [...] "wonderful reception" [...] from Aberdeen fans when playing for Hibernian against his former club.|$|E

[...] He asked me what it was, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was the white man’s religion which was discussed in that room. [...] He came in and sat with us boys. [...] During the preaching he sat very reverently and listened attentively to all that was said, although he could not understand a single word. [...] His attention to the service pleased Captain Pratt exceedingly. [...] When my father was ready to depart, he was presented with a well-made top-buggy and a set of harness, all of which were made at the school. I was delighted at seeing my father so well treated and recognized. [...] Other chiefs had visited us, but my father was the first Indian to receive such courteous recognition and agreeable presents.|$|E

5000|$|Smoltz counts Doc Rivers as a {{personal}} friend dating back to Rivers' playing days in Atlanta. In the edition of January 12, 2008 of the Boston Globe, Rivers is quoted as saying, [...] "I offered him my apartment... <b>I</b> just <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about Terry and the Red Sox organization. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it's</b> a no-brainer." ...|$|R

2500|$|When {{principal}} photography {{began on}} March 22, 1976 in the Tunisian desert for the scenes on Tatooine, the project faced several problems. Lucas fell behind schedule {{in the first}} week of shooting due to malfunctioning props and electronic breakdowns. Moreover, a rare Tunisian rainstorm struck the country, which further disrupted filming. Taylor said, [...] "you couldn't really see where the land ended and the sky began. It was all a gray mess, and the robots were just a blur." [...] Given this situation, Lucas requested for heavy filtration, which Taylor rejected, who said: [...] "I thought the look of the film should be absolutely clean ... But George saw it differently, so we tried using nets and other diffusion. He asked to set up one shot on the robots with a 300mm, and the sand and sky just mushed together. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> wouldn't work, but he said that was the way he wanted to do the entire film, all diffused." [...] This difference was later settled by 20th Century Fox executives, who backed Taylor's suggestion.|$|E

60|$|WOODER. Visitor who's {{been seeing}} Q 3007 asks {{to speak to}} you, sir. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> wasn't usual.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have not}} been false to him. I have been false to myself, but never to <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how <b>it</b> was. When you drove me on--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For the blackbeetles. There's {{nothing like}} a {{hedgehog}} for beetles. It will eat blackbeetles till it's sick, till it dies of surfeit. That {{reminds me of the}} time when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> my poor great master Haydon--in joke, of course--that he ought to send in a cartoon of King John dying of a surfeit of lampreys for the frescoes in the new Houses of Parliament. As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>it's</b> a most notable event in the annals of British liberty--the providential and exemplary removal of a tyrant." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} my promise to Hester--that promise give by her deathbed. I could not break <b>it,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so. <b>It</b> was the hardest thing I had ever done.|$|R
60|$|That was the point, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>It</b> {{was to be}} a {{surprise}} for my father; I was to take the examinations first, and inform him afterwards.|$|E

6000|$|... "And after that. I {{have refused}} to do anything;--to say a word. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>it</b> must be between you and him. What else could I say? And now he tells me nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{all about}} <b>it</b> and how her first entreaties had {{referred}} to his forgiveness.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh yes. He doesn't understand. He's desperately jealous. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> doesn't matter. Will {{you please}} let me hold your hand? I believe I'm {{beginning}} to get the chill.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Janet is to {{come over}} for you. However, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was quite {{unnecessary}} to disturb another old woman, for that I should of course see you home." ...|$|E
2500|$|Renzi was an {{opponent}} of embryonic stem cell research. In May 2005, he engaged in an argument on the House floor with Congressman Mark Kirk (R-IL). The argument ensued after Renzi had learned that Kirk and the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership commissioned secret polling in the districts of Renzi {{and other members of}} Congress who oppose stem cell research. Renzi said, [...] "I was yelling at <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it's</b> absolutely unprecedented that Republicans would pay for a push poll to attack another Republican on such a core belief of mine... You're not going to change my view on the issue, as a father of 12." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Indeed!' said Tancred; {{and then}} he continued, 'I offered him every {{inducement}} to come, for <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> was to meet you; but perhaps if he had known that you had {{so many things to}} say to him, he might have relented.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I went {{round to}} his house," [...] said Julius. [...] "I said that I {{reckoned}} a car {{like that was}} worth every penny of twenty thousand dollars. Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>it</b> was worth just about fifty thousand dollars to me if he'd get out." ...|$|R
