5|$|The two-storey {{house and}} the chapel are built of the local Blue Lias stone. Parts of the house have mellow honey-coloured Hamstone <b>dressings,</b> {{especially}} around windows and at quoins; the later 18th century additions have brick <b>dressings.</b> The roofs are stone tiled with some later terracotta tiles.|$|E
5|$|Butternut squash seed oil, {{from the}} seeds of Cucurbita moschata, has a nutty flavor that is used for salad <b>dressings,</b> marinades, and sautéeing.|$|E

5|$|Pumpkin seed oil, a {{specialty}} cooking oil, produced in Austria, Slovenia and Croatia. Used mostly in salad <b>dressings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Christchurch, Turnham Green is {{an early}} Victorian Gothic {{building}} of flint with stone <b>dressings.</b> The {{main part of the}} building, by George Gilbert Scott and W. B. Moffat, is from 1843; the chancel and northeast chapel were added in 1887 by J. Brooks.|$|E
5|$|The Methodist Chapel {{was built}} in 1815/16 after {{religious}} services had been established at Fairseat Farm, and the chapel was rebuilt in the late 19th century with limestone walls with stone <b>dressings</b> and a slate hipped roof with brick eaves stacks and crestings.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandwich}} {{is sometimes}} served with <b>dressings,</b> like mayonnaise. The bread {{can be of}} any variety, white or wholemeal, toasted or not, depending on personal preference.|$|E
5|$|Apart from colony {{collapse}} disorder, losses {{outside the}} US {{have been attributed}} to causes including pesticide seed <b>dressings,</b> such as Clothianidin, Imidacloprid and Thiamethoxam. From 2013 the European Union restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further. In 2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of global warming.|$|E
5|$|Brighton Forum {{is built}} on a high, {{prominent}} corner position, giving it good visibility from the west and south and long southward views. Knapped flint is the main building material, augmented by stone <b>dressings</b> and some yellow brickwork to the quoins. The roof is laid with tiles.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, {{the use of}} cyclodienes as seed <b>dressings</b> for autumn-sown cereals {{was banned}} in 1975 and the levels of the {{chemicals}} present in the bird population began to fall. The population has largely recovered to pre-decline levels, with an increase seen in many areas, for example northern Europe. In Sweden, the population also decreased drastically from the 1950s, but recovered again once organochlorines were banned in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} {{originally}} constructed of flint with stone <b>dressings,</b> but was substantially refaced with knapped flint in the 1880s; the tower was restored {{at the same}} time. A wall was built behind the altar in 1886 to create a separate sacristy for storing vestments and other items. The west tower was restored again in 1989, and the current doors to the sacristy were added in the same year.|$|E
5|$|The grounds {{included}} The Bishop's Barn {{which was}} built as a tithe barn in the 15th century, and the area next to it which is now a public park and play area. The barn was built of local stone roughly squared, with Doulting ashlar <b>dressings</b> and a Westmorland slate roof. Royalist troops were quartered in the barn during the Bloody Assizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} two gate lodges; both are listed at grade II. The {{northern}} lodge at Slaughter Hill is by Blore and dates from 1847. In red brick with darker-brick diapering, stone <b>dressings</b> and a slate roof, {{it has a}} T-shaped plan with a single storey, and is Jacobean in style. It features two shaped gables, each decorated with a panel carved with Crewe Estate emblems, and a hexagonal central bay with a pyramidal roof which forms a porch. The Elizabethan-style Weston or Golden Gates Lodge {{to the south of}} the house dates from before 1865 and is attributed to William Eden Nesfield, although it is not typical of his style. In red brick with blue-brick zig–zag diapering, ashlar <b>dressings</b> and a slate roof, the lodge has two storeys, with a projecting canted bay to the road face. The driveway face has an ashlar panel with a shield bearing the Crewe family coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|To {{the right}} of the {{building}} is an aisless chapel in the early Decorated Gothic style of the late 13th century, built of local stone with Doulting Stone <b>dressings.</b> The remains of the 13th century great hall are the north wall and some column bases of an internal arcade, indicating that it was a five bayed aisled hall with crenellations and tall windows in the Decorated Gothic style.|$|E
5|$|A large workhouse such as Whitechapel, {{accommodating}} {{several thousand}} paupers, employed {{a staff of}} almost 200; the smallest may only have had a porter and perhaps an assistant nurse {{in addition to the}} master and matron. A typical workhouse accommodating 225 inmates had a staff of five, which included a part-time chaplain and a part-time medical officer. The low pay meant that many medical officers were young and inexperienced. To add to their difficulties, in most unions they were obliged to pay out of their own pockets for any drugs, <b>dressings</b> or other medical supplies needed to treat their patients.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, {{the church}} was rebuilt with a west tower, 3-bay nave and south porch, in squared and coursed lias with red brick and Hamstone <b>dressings.</b> The attempt at total {{rebuilding}} ended in failure to collect enough money, despite donations from William Pitt the Younger and Admiral Hood, and a church for the community was built instead {{at the foot of}} the hill (Burrowbridge) in 1838. In the mid 20th century the ruin on Burrow Mump underwent some repairs to the north west corner.|$|E
5|$|St Eugrad's {{is built}} in Decorated style using rubble masonry with gritstone <b>dressings.</b> The roof {{is made of}} slate and has stone coping. It has a 17th-century bellcote at the west end {{containing}} one bell, and stone crosses at {{the tops of the}} gables. All of the church's external walls have been pebbledashed apart from the north and west wall of the chapel and the south porch. The vestry and the porch both have flat roofs and battlements.|$|E
5|$|The local Pennant {{sandstone}} {{is frequently}} used as walling material, often with limestone <b>dressings,</b> as {{found on the}} old Temple Meads railway station and Clifton Down railway station. Pennant sandstone is also used as large rock-faced squared blocks, described as Pennant rubble, which are used alone, eked out with plain brickwork, or incorporated into the more rugged examples of Bristol Byzantine. Much of the local transport infrastructure including the Clifton Suspension Bridge and the original Temple Meads railway station—now used as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum—were designed or built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel.|$|E
5|$|The {{onion fly}} (Delia antiqua) lays eggs on {{the leaves and}} stems {{and on the ground}} close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is {{attracted}} to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed <b>dressings,</b> early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.|$|E
5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic <b>dressings,</b> which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
5|$|Built as the Mont Dore Hotel in 1881, Bournemouth Town Hall was {{designated}} a Grade II listed building in 2001. Designed by Alfred Bedborough in the French, Italian and neo-classical styles, the foundation stone was laid by King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway {{and the hotel}} opened in 1885. The buff brick exterior features Bath stone <b>dressings</b> and terracotta friezes. The main entrance is sited within a projected façade that reaches to the eaves and is topped with a pediment, while above sits a belvedere with turrets and a pavilion roof. During the First World War the hotel {{was used as a}} hospital for British and Indian soldiers and after as a convalescent home. It never opened as a hotel again and was purchased by Bournemouth Borough Council in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by <b>dressings.</b> It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E
5|$|Major {{landmarks}} in Leigh are the red sandstone parish {{church and}} across the civic square, Leigh Town Hall and its associated shops on Market Street. The Grade II listed Obelisk that replaced the original market cross is also situated here. Many town centre buildings including the Boar's Head public house are in red Ruabon or Accrington bricks, often with gables and terracotta <b>dressings.</b> There are several large multi-storey cotton mills built along the Bridgewater Canal that are a reminder of Leigh's textile industry but most are now underused and deteriorating despite listed building status. Leigh's War Memorial by local architect J.C. Prestwich is at the junction of Church Street and Silk Street and is a Grade II listed structure. St Joseph's Church and St Thomas's Church {{on opposite sides of}} Chapel Street are both imposing churches using different materials and styles.|$|E
5|$|Neck rot is a {{fungal disease}} {{affecting}} onions in storage. It {{is caused by}} Botrytis allii, which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of spores are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. Antifungal seed <b>dressings</b> are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.|$|E
5|$|Parish {{churches have}} been built {{in each of the}} former townships. The first St Thomas's Church in Bedford was consecrated in 1840 and {{replaced}} by the present church in 1909. It is built of Accrington red brick with Runcorn red sandstone facings, to designs by J. S. Crowther. Christ Church, Pennington, designed by architect E.H.Shellard, was built in Yorkshire stone and was consecrated in 1854. The site to the south of the canal was a rapidly growing area at this time. It is Grade II listed. Westleigh St Paul, founded in 1847 is on Westleigh Lane. Westleigh St Peter, a Grade II* listed building by Paley and Austin, built in brick with red sandstone <b>dressings,</b> was founded 1881 is on Firs Lane.|$|E
5|$|Pesticides {{are applied}} to crops by {{agricultural}} aircraft, tractor-mounted crop sprayers or as seed <b>dressings</b> to control pests. However, successful control by pesticides is not easy; the right formulation must be chosen, the timing is often critical, the method of application is important, adequate coverage and retention on the crop are necessary. The killing of natural enemies of the target pest should be minimised. This is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in the countryside surrounding plantation crops, and these co-exist in a delicate balance. Often in less-developed countries, the crops are well adapted to the local situation and no pesticides are needed. Where progressive farmers are using fertilisers to grow improved crop varieties, these are often more susceptible to pest damage, but the indiscriminate application of pesticides may be detrimental in the longer term.|$|E
5|$|Salford {{is linked}} to Manchester {{by a series of}} bridges, {{including}} the Grade II listed Blackfriars Bridge, completed in 1820. The settlement is dominated by the several railway viaducts built in the 19th century. Salford (Old) Town Hall, situated in Bexley Square off Chapel Street, is a Neo-classical brick building dressed in stone, designed by Richard Lane. Public swimming baths were provided, on Blackfriars Road. Now in commercial use, the two-storey building was constructed in about 1890 from brick, with terracotta <b>dressings</b> and a part-glazed roof. The Salford University Campus, visible partly from the Crescent, contains a number of interesting buildings including the Royal Art Gallery and the Peel Building.|$|E
5|$|Sutton Court {{is built}} of squared and coursed {{sandstone}} rubble throughout with freestone and ashlar <b>dressings,</b> copings, slate roofs. The north front comprises a central three-storey fourteenth century pele tower with a taller circular stair turret and two-storey ranges linking {{it to the}} 1558 'Bess of Hardwick Building' {{to the left and}} a four bay 1858–1860 servants' wing of three storeys to the right. Windows to the pele tower and right-hand linking range are 15th century, of two cusped lights with hood moulds, some of which have been renewed, and some relocated from other areas. The doorway to the tower dates from 1858–60. The windows to the left-hand linking range and the 'Hardwick Building' are four and six lights, with chamfered mullions. The two-storey 'Hardwick' range has diagonal offset buttresses. There are eighteenth-century battlements to the pele tower, with tall octagonal ashlar stacks.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{population in}} Europe crashed {{in the second}} half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene insecticides – aldrin, dieldrin and heptachlor – used as seed <b>dressings</b> in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were too thin, causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides. Sub-lethal effects of these substances include irritability, convulsions and disorientation. In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built on the Bronze Age puddingstone circle, which has been {{incorporated}} into {{the foundations of the}} church. Built of knapped flint with limestone <b>dressings,</b> it has a roughly cruciform shape. The present day church building comprises a chancel, a clerestoried nave, north and south aisles and transepts and a south porch with a tierceron vault. The church is topped by a square central crenellated steeple with an octagonal wooden spire covered with lead. Although the current stone church of St.Mary's contains a mixture of architectural styles, mainly Gothic and dating from later periods, a Romanesque window between the north transept and north aisle has been dated to the 12th century, indicating that the church was already a stone building by this time.|$|E
5|$|The east {{window in}} the chancel is {{in the shape of}} a pointed arch and dates from the 15th century; it has three lights topped with cinquefoils and a hood mould. On the north side of the nave there is a {{rectangular}} window from 1865. The 16th-century south transept has windows in the south and east walls: the south window has three lights topped with trefoils in a 16th-century arch, and the east window is small and rectangular, using some <b>dressings</b> from the 14th century. The wide opening between the transept and the rest of the church is spanned with a large wooden beam.|$|E
5|$|The main approach, {{from the}} north, is defended by earthworks, {{comprising}} three ditches, with a rampart, or earthen wall, between. Also outside the castle walls is a vaulted passage, traditionally said to lead into the castle, {{but in fact}} accessing an 18th-century ice house. There are no openings within {{the lower part of}} the castle's walls, excepting the entrance and the postern, or side gate, to the west, although there are relatively large windows on the upper storeys. Windows in the south wall suggest that further buildings were intended within the courtyard, but were never built. The stonework is of coursed sandstone rubble, with <b>dressings</b> in lighter Ballengeich stone.|$|E
5|$|The plan of {{the house}} is unusual, partly because of its {{incorporation}} of the earlier building; it extends at right angles to the primary (southern) façade. The elevations are symmetrical, facing outwards, but the interior court is narrow, and projecting wings lie {{at either end of the}} eastern and western sides. Bramshill House is three storeys high on the southern main entrance side and two storeys high to the north and east. There are three vaulted cellars to the west. The house is built of red brick laid in English bond dressed with stone, with ashlar quoining at the corners of the wings. Stone <b>dressings</b> are featured on numerous large mullion windows. An open carved parapet surmounts the building. The roof consists of red tiles, and there are large gables on the west side. The chimney stacks are rectangular.|$|E
5|$|This {{section is}} crossed by King Street, which follows {{the course of}} a Roman road. Where it crosses the Maxey Cut, to the south of the {{original}} channels, there are a series of 14 arches which comprise Lolham Bridges. They are grouped into five structures to cross the channels in the area, and were funded by the County of Northamptonshire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The longest span is , and the cutwaters carry inscribed stones recording the County's involvement. To the north, an early nineteenth century stone rubble arched bridge carries the road over a drainage ditch near Lolham Mill, while an eighteenth-century bridge, probably rebuilt in the following century, crosses the mill stream. Another pair of early nineteenth-century bridges, built of coursed limestone with ashlar <b>dressings,</b> carry the road over the northernmost channel.|$|E
5|$|Two {{to three}} tablespoons of ReaLemon lemon juice has the {{equivalent}} of the juice from one average-sized lemon. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime are used as ingredients in various recipes, such as in baking, grilling, and as an ingredient in marinades and salad <b>dressings.</b> ReaLemon can be used as an ingredient in hot tea, lemonade and hot lemonade, and in various cooked dishes and baked goods such as pies. ReaLemon and other lemon juices can be used to prevent browning discoloration from occurring in peeled or sliced potatoes. This is performed by soaking the sliced potatoes in a mixture of the lemon juice and water. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime must be refrigerated after the bottles are opened.|$|E
5|$|Wounds {{were treated}} by bandaging with raw meat, white linen, sutures, nets, pads, and swabs soaked with honey to prevent infection, while opium thyme and {{belladona}} {{were used to}} relieve pain. The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn <b>dressings</b> that use the milk from mothers of male babies. Prayers {{were made to the}} goddess Isis. Moldy bread, honey and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns. Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms. Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred.|$|E
