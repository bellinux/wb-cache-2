25|$|The {{organisation}} of Brown's Congo, as {{it became}} known at the time, follows that of his earlier essay on the flora of Australia, <b>General</b> <b>remarks,</b> geographical and systematical, on the botany of Terra Australis. It begins with remarks on the floristic composition of the collection, considering the relative proportions of monocots to dicots, and comparing the floristic richness with that of other equatorial regions.|$|E
25|$|Cauchy {{makes some}} <b>general</b> <b>remarks</b> about {{functions}} in Chapter I, Section 1 of his Analyse algébrique (1821). From {{what he says}} there, {{it is clear that}} he normally regards a function as being defined by an analytic expression (if it is explicit) or by an equation or a system of equations (if it is implicit); where he differs from his predecessors is that he is prepared to consider the possibility that a function may be defined only for a restricted range of the independent variable.|$|E

25|$|Brown then {{considers}} the biogeographic affinities of the region, emphasising the {{close relationship between}} the Swan River Colony flora and that of King George Sound and Lucky Bay on the south coast. On the other hand, he found very few species {{in common with the}} east coast at similar latitudes. Focussing on Proteaceae, he reiterates the assertion first made in his 1814 <b>General</b> <b>remarks,</b> geographical and systematical, on the botany of Terra Australis, that the flora of the west coast of Australia has a strong South African element, whereas the flora of the east coast has a strong South American element.|$|E

500|$|Besides his further <b>general</b> <b>remarks,</b> Hazlitt lingers appreciatively over {{a number}} of amusing scenes and poetic passages, {{including}} the songs, all showing how [...] "Shakespear's comedy is of a pastoral and poetical cast. Folly is indigenous to the soil [...] Absurdity has every encouragement afforded it; and nonsense has room to flourish in." [...] Characters of vastly different types are all welcome and fit into his scheme: [...] "the same house is big enough to hold Malvolio, the Countess, Maria, Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew Ague-cheek." [...] He particularly admires the character of Viola, whom Shakespeare gives many speeches of [...] "impassioned sweetness". Characterising the play as a whole by quoting the author's own words in it—"Shakespear alone could describe the effect of his own poetry."—he reflects that the play's poetry comes o'er the ear like the sweet south/That breathes upon a bank of violets,/Stealing and giving odour.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} dateable and unambiguous {{reference to}} the iconic cult of Anahita is from the Babylonian scholar-priest Berosus, who – although writing over 70 years after the reign of Artaxerxes II Mnemon – records that the emperor {{had been the first}} to make cult statues of Aphrodite Anaitis and place them in the temples of many of the empire's major cities, including Babylon, Susa, Ecbatana, Persepolis, Damascus and Sardis. Also according to Berosus, the Persians knew of no images of gods until Artaxerxes II erected those images. This is substantiated by Herodotus, whose mid-5th-century-BCE <b>general</b> <b>remarks</b> on the usages of the Perses, Herodotus notes that [...] "it is not their custom to make and set up statues and images and altars, and those that make such they deem foolish, as I suppose, because they never believed the gods, as do the Greeks, to be the likeness of men." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his success}} at cricket, Ranjitsinhji was more widely {{accepted}} within Trinity. His new-found popularity {{led to the}} creation by his friends of a nickname; finding his name difficult, they initially dubbed him [...] "Smith", then shortened his full name to [...] "Ranji", which remained with him {{for the rest of his}} life. At this time, Ranjitsinhji may have furthered rumours of his royal background or great wealth, and he was further encouraged to spend money to entertain others and reinforce the impression of his status. Several English first-class counties made enquiries over his availability to play for them, and he was invited to make a speech at a Cambridge club dinner, attended by prominent figures in Cambridge; his <b>general</b> <b>remarks</b> about the good treatment of Indians in England were reported in the press as being in support of Indian federation and suggested the public were eager to hear his words. However, Ranjitsinhji was unable to continue his cricket with Cambridge as he had to leave before the start of the 1894 season.|$|E

2500|$|Meek's {{manuscript}} {{volume of}} Journal and register of the weather, kept at Cambuslang 1st Jan. 1785 to 30 April 1809, bound in leather, is a detailed record of daily notes taken by Meek of barometer and thermometer readings, wind direction, rainfall and {{remarks about the}} weather and the conditions for farming. At the end of each month and year there are tabulatd summaries and <b>general</b> <b>remarks</b> on weather {{in different parts of the}} country and world, notes of unusual conditions and the effects on crops, harvests, markets, etc. His first remark, for Saturday 1 January 1785 was [...] "Cloudy with some slight showers of snow". His first month summary, January 1785, for example, noted [...] "Fair days 12- rainy or snowy days 19. A pretty good weather month. Not much high wind. Some snow but little rain. Thow was very little ploughed after harvest, & thow have been only 10 or 12 days this month, on which ploughs could go. The rate of the markets of Glasgow - best wheat 19 shil per bol. Best of oatmeal 13 pence per peck, peasemeal 9½ per peck." [...] He later noted the particularly cold weather - there was skating on the Rhone at Avignon in the south of France. June, though, was very different. [...] "A remarkably warm and pleasant month. In this climate, nobody remembers so many extraordinary warm days in succession. The heat both during the day and night time there was to many almost insupportable.". Meek produced these tables and summaries for almost 24 years, until the year before his death. Until 1792, he took readings three times a day, at 8am, 10am and 8pm. After 1792, he only took one reading at 10am. The Journal continues for 388 pages until 30 April 1809. His summary of that month is short [...] "Dry days 18 - Wet and windy do. 12". He died the following year. This detailed and scholarly document is still consulted and quoted by modern climate historians search for evidence of climate change.|$|E
