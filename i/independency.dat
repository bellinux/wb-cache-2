40|$|The {{implication}} {{problem is}} the problem of deciding whether a given set of dependencies entails other dependencies. Up to now, the entailment of excluded dependencies or <b>independencies</b> is only regarded on a metalogical level, which is not suitable for an automatic inference process. But, the inference of <b>independencies</b> is of great importance for new topics in database research like knowledge discovery in databases. In this paper, the expanded implication problem is discussed in order to decide entailment of dependencies and <b>independencies.</b> The main results are axiomatizations of functional, inclusion and multivalued <b>independencies</b> and the corresponding inference relations. Also, we discuss the use of <b>independencies</b> in knowledge discovery in databases and semantic query optimization. ...|$|R

25|$|Krepost Sveaborg {{never did}} see action against Germany in Russian hands. After the Russian {{revolution}} {{the treaty of}} Brest-Litovsk ended Russia's participation in the First World War. The treaty affirmed the independence of Finland and required Russian troops to leave from the country. Of the approximately 35 000 Russian soldiers and sailors who were around Helsinki in January 1918 most were demobilized and sent home or simply left by 15 March. Around one thousand joined the Finnish Red Guards in the Finnish Civil War. The Soviet leadership ordered Krepost Sveaborg headquarters to begin preparations to abandon the fortress and destroy what could not be evacuated in case it would fall into German hands. Some field guns were transported to Russia, but all the coastal guns were left. On 3 April 1918 German Baltic Sea Division landed in Hanko, after being requested by the White Senate of Vaasa {{to participate in the}} Finnish Civil War against the Reds. Russian Baltic fleet officers had made an agreement with the Germans allowing a safe departure for the warships and disarming the fortress. Most of the Russian ships left by mid-April, but the last ships left only in May–June 1918. The disarmament - removing locks from the guns, cutting the cables controlling the mines and destroying the mine control stations - had to be done in secret as an agreement between Soviet government and Finnish Red Guards had promised the latter all the fortifications. When the Germans arrived in Helsinki the Red Guard could only use some of the land front fortifications in Leppävaara and Ruskeasuo, and the Germans with a well equipped and trained numerically superior force quickly captured Helsinki between 11th and 13 April. The Russian guards ceded the coastal forts to Germans according to their agreement. The disarmament of Krepost Sveaborg, denying the Reds from using it, was used in White propaganda by how Allan Staffans had duped the Russians and removed the locks without authorization; but actually the disarmament occurred with the order of the fortress commander and with the knowledge of naval headquarters. On 12 May Krepost Sveaborg was renamed Suomenlinna to celebrate the new <b>independency.</b>|$|E

Aiming at its challenging features because of, 1) interactions and <b>independencies</b> among weapon systems, 2) the uncertainty of the sample data set for assessment, and 3) the missing target value of the assessment criteria, the WSPS problem is solved form four perspectives: portfolio without the <b>independencies</b> or target value, portfolio with the <b>independencies</b> but without target value, portfolio with the <b>independencies</b> and target value, portfolio in a incomplete sample data with the <b>independencies</b> and with target value.

Three hybrid multiobjective programming algorithms are proposed as GT-MOP 1, GT-MOP 2 and PCA-MOP 2 and non-dominated portfolios are generated as by sorting algorithm as a set of Pareto-optimal solutions.

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} a partial axiomatic {{characterization of the}} predicate I(X, Z, Y), to read "X is conditionally independent of Y, given Z". The main aim of such a characterization is to facilitate a solution of the implication problem namely, deciding whether an arbitrary independence statement I(X, Z, Y) logically follows from a given set Z of such statements. In this paper, we provide a complete axiomatization and efficient algorithms for deciding implications in the case where, ~ is limited to one of four types of independencies: marginal <b>independencies,</b> fixed context <b>independencies,</b> a recursive set of <b>independencies</b> or a functional set of <b>independencies.</b> The recursive and functional sets of <b>independencies</b> are the basic building blocks used {{in the construction of}} Bayesian networks. For these models, we show that the implication algorithm can be used to efficiently identify which propositions are relevant to a task at hand at any given state of knowledge. We also show that conditional independence is an Armstrong relation [10], i. e., checking consistency of a mixed set of <b>independencies</b> and dependencies can be reduced to a sequence of implication problems.

2500|$|In June 1646, in {{fulfilment}} of the Solemn League and Covenant {{that had}} secured its {{alliance with the}} Scottish Covenanters, Parliament required each county to plan and secure approval for a Presbyterian polity. Only eight counties both drew up a plan and tried to implement it, Shropshire being one of them. The structure is summarised in a document dated 29 April 1647 and entitled: The Severall Divisions and Person for Classicall Presbyteries in the County of Salop. Shrewsbury formed the centre of its first classis and Mackworth was named {{as one of its}} ruling elders. As the title [...] "Saint" [...] was now restricted to the Apostles, St Chad's was now referred to as Chad's (although rendered Cedds), and St Mary's and St Alkmund's also lost their titles: village churches were referred to simply by the name of the parish, not the dedication. Other committee members were distributed as elders throughout the other classes, with Robert Corbet and Andrew Lloyd, as well as Thomas Mytton in the second. It seems that much of the structure was a dead letter and that only the fourth classis, based on Wem and Whitchurch functioned fully. A substantial proportion of the classis ministers signed a protest against toleration of <b>Independency</b> or Congregationalism in 1648. However, the Scottish Covenanters' invasion of England in an attempt to restore the king discredited Presbyterianism {{in the eyes of the}} New Model Army which began to gain the upper hand politically, favouring <b>Independency</b> and the execution of the king. Mackworth increasingly supported this radical tendency. Owen and Blakeway assumed he had always been an Independent, but the Presbyterian blueprint for the county, revealed in Auden's much later sketch for an ecclesiastical history of the county, suggests an evolution.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} aims to {{show how}} the log-mean linear parameterization for a set of categorical data can be used to specify models of marginal independence including also independence constraints in partial tables. The collection of these <b>independencies</b> can be jointly specified in a single log-mean linear model preserving the smoothness property. In the graphical modelling area, this approach allows us to define a class of parsimonious bi-directed graph models where all the constraints have a clear interpretation in terms of <b>independencies.</b> Moreover, whenever the data at hand seem to satisfy both marginal and conditional <b>independencies</b> that jointly result in a non-smooth model, the log-mean linear parameterization provides a partial solution which allows us to preserve smoothness by specifying the conditional independence statements only in partial tables. Finally, we suggest a criterion for variable coding such that these <b>independencies</b> are tested in partial tables with many observations.

40|$|The present paper {{considers}} discrete probability {{models with}} exact computational properties. In relation to contingency tables this means closed form {{expressions of the}} maksimum likelihood estimate and its distribution. The model class includes {{what is known as}} decomposable graphical models, which can be characterized by a structured set of conditional <b>independencies</b> between some variables given some other variables. We term the new model class decomposable log-linear models, which is illustrated to be a much richer class than decomposable graphical models. It covers a wide range of non-hierarchical models, models with structural zeroes, models described by quasi independence and models for level merging. Also, they have a very natural interpretation as they may be formulated by a structured set of conditional <b>independencies</b> between two events given some other event. In relation to contingency tables we term such <b>independencies</b> as context specific <b>independencies.</b> Key words: decomposable model, log-linear model, exact inference, context specific independence, quasi independence, level merging, incomplete contingency table. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{conditions and}} procedures for deciding if patterns of <b>independencies</b> found in covariance and concentration matrices can be generated by a stepwise recursive process represented by some directed acyclic graph. If such an agreement is found, we know that one or several causal processes could {{be responsible for the}} observed <b>independencies,</b> and our procedures could then be used to elucidate the graphical structure common to these processes, so as to evaluate their compatibility against substantive knowledge of the domain. If we find that the observed pattern of <b>independencies</b> does not agree with any stepwise recursive process, then {{there are a number of}} different possibilities. For instance, [...] some weak dependencies could have been mistaken for <b>independencies</b> and led to the wrong omission of edges from the covariance or concentration graphs. [...] some of the observed linear dependencies reflect accidental cancellations or hide actual nonlinear relations, or [...] the process responsible for the data is non-recursive, involving aggregated variables, simultenous reciprocal interactions, or mixtures of several causal processes. In order to recognize accidental <b>independencies</b> it would be helpful to conduct several longitudinal studies under slightly varying conditions. In such studies the covariances for the same set of variables is estimated under different conditions and the variations in the conditions would typically affect the numerical values of the parameters. But, if the data were generated by a causal process represented by some directed acyclic graph, then the basic structural properties reflected in the missing edges of that graph should remain unchanged.

The {{leaders of the}} English Parliament, worsted in the English Civil War, implored {{the aid of the}} Scots, which was promised on condition that the Scottish system of church government would be adopted in England. Following considerable debate, a document called the Solemn League and Covenant was drawn up. This was in effect a treaty between England and Scotland which called for the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland and the reformation of religion in England and Ireland [...] "according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches", and the extirpation of popery and prelacy. It did not explicitly mention Presbyterianism and included some ambiguous formulations that left the door open to <b>Independency.</b> It was subscribed to by many in both kingdoms and also in Ireland, and was approved by the English Parliament, and with some slight modifications by the Westminster Assembly of Divines. This agreement meant that the Covenanters sent another army south to England to fight on the Parliamentarian side in the First English Civil War. The Scottish armies in England were instrumental in bringing about the victory of the English Parliament over the King.|$|E

40|$|The {{construction}} of causal graphs from non-experimental data {{rests on a}} set of constraints that the graph structure imposes on all probability distributions compatible with the graph. These constraints are of two types: conditional inde pendencies and algebraic constraints, first noted by Verma. While conditional <b>independencies</b> are well studied and frequently used in causal induction algorithms, Verma constraints are still poorly understood, and rarely applied. In this paper we examine a special subset of Verma constraints which are easy to understand, easy to identify and easy to apply; they arise from “dormant independencies,” namely, conditional <b>independencies</b> that hold in interventional distributions. We give a complete algorithm for determining if a dormant independence between two sets of variables is entailed by the causal graph, such that this independence is identifiable, in other words if it resides in an interventional distribution that can be predicted without resorting to interventions. We further show the usefulness of dormant <b>independencies</b> in model testing and induction by giving an algorithm that uses constraints entailed by dormant <b>independencies</b> to prune extraneous edges from a given causal graph...|$|R

2500|$|The Puritan {{coalition}} {{was soon}} in trouble, locally {{as well as}} nationally. In 1648 Mackworth was forced to play {{an active part in}} the Second English Civil War, precipitated by the king's conspiracy with the Scottish Engagers to regain his throne. Fisher, described as [...] "pastor of Marye's Salop", was one of 57 ministers to sign a document entitled A Testimony of the Ministers in the Province of Salop to the Truth of Jesus Christ and to the Solemn League and Covenant: as also against the Errors, Heresies and Blasphemies of these times and the Toleration of them. This was a denunciation by committed Presbyterians of <b>Independency</b> or Congregationalism, an alternative Puritan model of church government that did away with structures above the local level. While Betton and Blake were also prominent among the signatories, Paget, Mackworth's own parish minister, did not sign. After Pride's Purge, the army coup that removed the moderate Presbyterians from the House of Commons, Mackworth backed the regicide and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Commonwealth of England. Fisher and Blake remained with the Presbyterian mainstream, as the Covenant had envisaged a Presbyterian national Church with the monarch as its head. However, the Presbyterian polity in Shropshire withered rapidly, with only the fourth classis remaining as a fully functioning structure. This was based on Whitchurch and Wem, although often known as the Bradford North Classis, after the hundred in which it fell, and was dominated by the stalwart Presbyterian Sir John Corbet, one of the purged MPs.|$|E
2500|$|Betton Strange was in {{the parish}} of St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, then {{the largest of the}} town's parishes. There had been a {{tradition}} of learned and radically Protestant preaching at St Chad's for some decades. However, Peter Studley, the incumbent (then termed curate) appointed in 1622, although a local man was of the High Church and Arminian persuasion then becoming increasingly influential at Court. Conflict between himself and the congregation escalated as he steadily imposed his views and practices. An episcopal visitation in 1626 found that some parishioners, particularly in St Julian's parish, which Studley also served, objected to his failure to preach and pointed out that, under the Act of Uniformity 1558, they had to attend his services and were not able to hear the preaching provided in neighbouring churches at the same time. Some had begun to gather on Sunday evenings in private houses to hear sermons read: Studley questioned whether these assemblies counted as conventicles. Seven women, including Katherine Chidley, refused to undergo the churching of women: she was later to write polemics in support of <b>Independency</b> and her son Samuel was to become a leading Leveller. However Mackworth's puritan leanings only slowly brought him notoriety. It was during an autumn 1633 visitation by Robert Wright, the Bishop of Lichfield and a close associate of William Laud, that Studley denounced Mackworth among the heads of twenty families. They refused to bow at the name of Jesus or to kneel at the altar rail – a refusal which meant they were [...] "wilful refusers to communicate for the gestures sake." [...] Studley went on to write a bitter polemic against puritanism: The Looking-Glasse of Schisme, published in London in 1634. This focussed on the sensational murder by a young farmer, Enoch ap-Evans of Clun, of his own mother and brother, which Studley claimed was a symptom of his known puritan beliefs. He pointedly referred to what must have been a solid and growing opposition in his own parish, {{and at the same time}} conflated puritanism with opposition to monarchy: ...|$|E
