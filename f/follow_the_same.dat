5|$|A Nightmare on Elm Street was {{originally}} going to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> design as Platinum Dunes' other remake, Friday the 13th, with the writers taking {{what they thought}} were the best elements {{from each of the}} films and creating a single storyline with them. Eventually, they decided to use Craven's original storyline, and try to create a scarier film. That being, they decided to remove the one-line quipping Freddy, who had become less scary and more comical over the years, and bring him back to a darker nature; this included developing the character as a true child molester, something that Craven wanted to do originally in 1984 but changed to a child killer instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{facade of}} the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the {{instructions}} of the Fatimid caliph al-Mustansir Billah. It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns. The Crusaders damaged the facade, but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids. One addition was the covering of the facade with tiles. The second-hand material of the facade's arches includes sculpted, ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem. The facade consists of fourteen stone arches, {{most of which are}} of a Romanesque style. The outer arches added by the Mamluks <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> general design. The entrance to the mosque is through the facade's central arch.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} the {{expedition}} had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen {{to believe that a}} specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> track as the Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole.|$|E
5|$|White Plume Mountain {{is set in}} the World of Greyhawk, a {{campaign}} setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The module is a dungeon crawl, precipitated by the theft of three magical, sentient weapons: a trident named Wave, a war hammer named Whelm, and a sword named Blackrazor (all three were introduced in this adventure). The weapons' former owners each received a copy of a taunting poem, instructing them that the weapons are located in White Plume Mountain. The poem is signed by the wizard Keraptis, who thirteen hundred years ago descended into the volcanic mountain with a company of gnomes and disappeared. The player characters goal is to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> path and retrieve the weapons from Keraptis' lair.|$|E
5|$|An {{engineering}} report {{dating back}} to 1961 suggested that building a bypass around the last two mainline tunnels {{was the best way}} to solve the congestion. The Commission awarded three contracts to construct the bypass from July 1966 to March 1967. The contracts cost $17.2 million for roadway and another $2.5 million for construction of a new Sideling Hill Service Plaza to replace the Cove Valley Service Plaza, which was along the to-be-bypassed alignment. The $2.5 million project was to include ramps from both directions to the service plaza, so it could serve both directions. The style of the tunnel bypass was to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> style as the Laurel Hill bypass. On November 26, 1968, the three twinned tunnels opened, and the bypass of the Rays Hill and Sideling Hill Tunnels opened. The new bypass also opened the Breezewood Interchange and the number of lanes along the turnpike expanded to four (two in each direction) or five (two in each direction, plus a climbing lane going uphill).|$|E

5|$|Philip began besieging Amphipolis in 357 BC; the Amphipolitans, abandoning their anti-Athenian policy, {{promptly}} {{appealed to}} Athens, offering {{to return to}} its control. However, during the siege, Philip {{sent a letter to}} Athens saying that he would hand over the city once he captured it (thus appearing to <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> policy as he had in 359 BC). The Athenians, thus lulled, waited to see whether he would. The Athenians may also have been unable to send help to Amphipolis. During the summer months, strong northerly winds blew into the Aegean Sea, making it difficult for the Athenians to send ships north. Philip was to make repeated use of the Etesian winds, campaigning during those months (or in winter), when the Athenian navy would be unable to send assistance to his enemies.|$|E
5|$|The River Rother {{rises from}} several springs near Empshott in Hampshire. The main one {{supplies}} watercress beds, before passing under Mill Lane, {{to the south}} of the village. It continues eastwards, to reach Greatham Mill. The mill, together with the mill house and an attached barn, date from the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries, and are built of brick. Now Grade II listed. All of the original machinery of the mill is still in situ, but is not operational, as the water supply has been diverted. The stream turns to the south-east, and passes under the A3 West Liss bypass, and Greatham Bridge, on the old route. It is joined by other streams, and turns south to reach Liss railway station. The railway and the river <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> general route, and the river crosses under the railway five times before reaching Sheet. At the northern edge of the village, the river is joined by the Ashford Stream, and there is another mill. After passing under the A272 road, to the east of the village, it reaches Sheet Mill.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish monarchy {{appointed}} {{their own}} candidates {{to most of}} the political offices in the viceroyalty, usually favoring Spaniards from Europe. In most cases, the appointees had little knowledge of or interest in local issues. Consequently, there was a growing rivalry between criollos and peninsulars (those born in Spain). Most criollos thought that peninsulars had undeserved advantages and received preferential treatment in politics and society. The lower clergy had a similar sentiment about the higher echelons of the religious hierarchy. Events developed at a slower pace than in the United States independence movement. This was in part because the clergy controlled the entire educational system in Spanish America, which led the population to hold the same conservative ideas and <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> customs as in Spain.|$|E
