25|$|Union busting in the United States dates {{at least}} to the 19th century, when a rapid {{expansion}} in factories and manufacturing capabilities caused a migration of workers from agricultural work to the mining, manufacturing and transportation industries. Conditions were often unsafe, women worked for lower wages than men, and child labor was rampant. Because employers and governments did little to address these issues, labor movements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>world</b> were formed to seek better wages, hours, and working conditions. The clashes between labor and management were often adversarial and were deeply affected by wars, economic conditions, government policies, and court proceedings.|$|E

It is also often pointed out that, unlike <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>world,</b> the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs.

25|$|The {{difference}} between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject.

From 1991 to 2005, the percentage of teens reporting that they had ever had sex or were currently sexually active showed small declines.

In building construction today some lead flashing is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, oxyacetylene gas torch welding was seldom used to weld sheetmetal, since warpage was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until MIG welding became the industry standard. Since the 1970s, when high strength steel became the standard for automotive manufacturing, electric welding became the preferred method.

In West Coast Hotel Co v Parrish Hughes CJ held (over four dissenters still arguing for [...] "freedom of contract") that a Washington law setting minimum wages for women was constitutional because the state legislatures should be enabled to adopt legislation in the public interest. This ended the [...] "Lochner era", and Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

Under §207(a)(1), most employees (but with many exceptions) working over 40 hours a week must receive 50 per cent more overtime pay on their hourly wage. Nobody may pay lower than the minimum wage, but under §218(a) states and municipal governments may enact higher wages. This is frequently done to reflect local productivity and requirements for decent living in each region. However the federal minimum wage has no automatic mechanism to update with inflation. Because the Republican Party has opposed raising wages, the federal real minimum wage is over 33 per cent lower today than in 1968, among the lowest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrialized</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
