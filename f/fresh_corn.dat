Each of these churches have their own patron saint, which is celebrated each year during an event called a “vela.” Velas are {{celebrations}} of pre Hispanic origin which occur in each neighborhood in the Isthmus area which consist of processions in the main streets and the offering of a ceremonial candle to the patron saint. Each of the “velas” are organized by a mayordomo and includes a “queen” who is crowned with flowers. [...] These velas became annual events starting in the 19th century with European elements such as balls or dances added. These dances have fabrics for decoration, like in Europe in the 19th century, but these have been modified with include indigenous designs, many laboriously embroidered by hand. [...] For these and other special events, women may wear traditional Tehuana dress, with consists of heavily embroidered garments accessorized with large amounts of gold jewelry.

[...] In addition, local specialties such as various mole sauces such as negro, rojo, amarillo, coloradito, chichilo as well as tasajo, <b>fresh</b> <b>corn</b> quesadillas and tamales are served. While they began as religious festivals, today, most have lost their religious basis. Most of these velas occur in the summer. [...] The vela of Santa María Reoloteca occurs between 13 and 18 August.

The neighborhood is divided into north and south into a friendly rivalry of who can bring the best musicians from various parts of the state.

6000|$|It was {{a heavenly}} {{place for a}} boy, that farm of my uncle John's. The house was a double log one, with a spacious floor (roofed in) {{connecting}} it with the kitchen. In the summer the table was set {{in the middle of}} that shady and breezy floor, and the sumptuous meals--well, it makes me cry to think of them. Fried chicken, roast pig, wild and tame turkeys, ducks and geese; venison just killed; squirrels, rabbits, pheasants, partridges, prairie-chickens; biscuits, hot batter cakes, hot buckwheat cakes, hot [...] "wheat bread," [...] hot rolls, hot corn pone; <b>fresh</b> <b>corn</b> boiled on the ear, succotash, butter-beans, string-beans, tomatoes, pease, Irish potatoes, sweet-potatoes; buttermilk, sweet milk, [...] "clabber"; watermelons, musk-melons, cantaloups--all fresh from the garden--apple pie, peach pie, pumpkin pie, apple dumplings, peach cobbler--I can't remember the rest. The way that the things were cooked was perhaps the main splendor--particularly a certain few of the dishes. For instance, the corn bread, the hot biscuits and wheat bread, and the fried chicken. These things have never been properly cooked in the North--in fact, no one there is able to learn the art, so far as my experience goes. The North thinks it knows how to make corn bread, but this is gross superstition. Perhaps no bread in the world is quite as good as Southern corn bread, and perhaps no bread in the world is quite so bad as the Northern imitation of it. The North seldom tries to fry chicken, and this is well; the art cannot be learned north of the line of Mason and Dixon, nor anywhere in Europe. This is not hearsay; it is experience that is speaking. In Europe it is imagined that the custom of serving various kinds of bread blazing hot is [...] "American," [...] but that is too broad a spread; it is custom in the South, but is much less than that in the North. In the North and in Europe hot bread is considered unhealthy. This is probably another fussy superstition, like the European superstition that ice-water is unhealthy. Europe does not need ice-water, and does not drink it; and yet, notwithstanding this, its word for it is better than ours, because it describes it, whereas ours doesn't. Europe calls it [...] "iced" [...] water. Our word describes water made from melted ice--a drink which we have but little acquaintance with.|$|E

The five maize cultivars being used were: KKU# 1, R 1 -KKU SRC 6, BC# 1 DMR, SW 2, and CMB. These maize varieties were used as parental materials. Both direct and reciprocal crosses produced 20 off-springs and the seeds of both direct and reciprocal crosses and parents were sown for progeny test and this was carried out for two seasons i. e. dry and wet seasons. Both {{experiments were}} laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design with four replications. The data obtained were statistically analyzed with the use of cross diallel-analysis II and analysis III. The results showed that there were some highly significant effects due to sowing season on harvesting age, number of cobs/rai, cob fresh weights/rai and also some interactions between season and crosses on harvesting age, and season and ratio between cob fresh weights and baby <b>corn</b> <b>fresh</b> weights. Dry season hastened harvesting age of baby corns but a delay with wet season. The results on reciprocal analysis revealed that significant effects were found with number of cobs/plant, cob <b>fresh</b> weights/rai, baby <b>corn</b> <b>fresh</b> weights/rai, standard weights of baby corns/rai, and out-standard weights of baby corns/rai (1 ha = 6. 25 rai). The results of reciprocal crosses revealed that there were significant effects on number of cobs/plant, cob <b>fresh</b> weights/rai, baby <b>corn</b> <b>fresh</b> weights/rai, standard baby corns/rai, and out-standard baby corns/rai due to maternal effect. With diallel analysis, an excellent general combining abilities was found with harvesting age on direct crosses and number of cobs/plant of reciprocal off-springs but only found with dry season. Gene expression was not freely independent of season. SW 2 variety has a short harvesting age while KKU 1, and BC# 1 DMR (1 x 3) possessed highly significant effects on GCA and SCA. The best variety for open-pollinated fertilization was BC# 1 DMR. There was a highly significant correlation between cob fresh weights and baby <b>corn</b> <b>fresh</b> weights and did between cob fresh weights and out-standard cob fresh weights. ...|$|R

40|$|The Florida {{sweet corn}} {{industry}} {{did not exist}} until modern insecticides were developed for worm control. • More than 90 % of the sweet corn ears would be damaged by worms in Florida without insecticide sprays. • Each female earworm lays as many as 3000 eggs on sweet corn plants. • Florida sweet corn is sprayed with insecticides 10 - 12 times which reduces insect damage to 3 % or less. Technical Summary Modern sweet corn cultivars arose {{in the nineteenth century}} when a single gene mutated in field corn.
