5|$|The Country Wife is more neatly {{constructed}} {{than most}} Restoration comedies, but {{is typical of}} its time and place in <b>having</b> <b>three</b> sources and three plots. The separate plots are interlinked but distinct, each projecting a sharply different mood. They may be schematised as Horner's impotence trick, the married life of Pinchwife and Margery, and the courtship of Harcourt and Alithea.|$|E
5|$|The castles of the Mary Rose had {{additional}} decks, {{but since}} virtually nothing of them survives, their design {{has had to}} be reconstructed from historical records. Contemporary ships of equal size were consistently listed as <b>having</b> <b>three</b> decks in both castles.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1915, {{after several}} {{occasions}} when the British had to temporarily dismount regiments and send them into the front lines, an establishment for the Dismounted Cavalry Division was created. The three British cavalry divisions each formed a dismounted cavalry brigade, with the 1st Brigade being raised from the 1st Division, and so on. The cavalry brigades formed a dismounted cavalry battalion, numbered after their parent brigades, so the 9th Cavalry Brigade formed the 9th Dismounted Battalion, for example. The cavalry regiments each formed one dismounted company and a machine gun section for their battalion. However, the Dismounted Cavalry Division, with only three brigades, was smaller than an infantry division, which had four brigades. This disadvantage was felt throughout the formation, with the dismounted cavalry brigade only <b>having</b> <b>three</b> battalions instead of the four in an infantry formation, and the dismounted cavalry battalion only <b>having</b> <b>three,</b> albeit larger, companies {{as opposed to the}} four of an infantry battalion. There was one other divisional-sized formation raised in 1916 that contained British cavalry regiments. This was the Imperial Cavalry Division, which served in the campaign in Mesopotamia. This was another British Indian Army division, and like all Indian divisions, it had one British regiment per brigade.|$|E

5|$|Later in life, Reynolds married Montague Main {{and moved}} to Barnet in North London, <b>having</b> <b>three</b> {{children}} who all died in childhood. There she became a road safety officer, a role rarely performed by women in London during the 1930s and 1940s. By 1948, her husband also died and she focused her work on accident prevention. Reynolds died in 1955, aged 77, with local papers covering her death.|$|E
5|$|The WCHL's {{short and}} {{unstable}} existence {{was a result}} of salary escalation caused by <b>having</b> <b>three</b> leagues competing for top talent. As a result, by the mid-1920s, hockey players were among the highest paid athletes in North America, with top players able to demand even higher salaries than the top baseball stars of the time. Though the WCHL lasted only five years, the Tigers boasted five future Hockey Hall of Famers on their roster during that time.|$|E

5|$|The use of aisles {{enabled the}} barn's architects to {{increase}} its width and by doing so, provided the maximum space for threshing floors. The longer the barn was, the more threshing floors could be provided. English barns went through an evolution {{in the number of}} threshing floors; the earliest had just one central floor, a design that became the commonest to be found in Britain. Harmondsworth Great Barn is unusual in <b>having</b> <b>three</b> threshing floors, allowing much more grain to be threshed at one time.|$|E
5|$|There {{were very}} low {{expectations}} for the defenses; the over/under was set at 75.5 total points. During the regular season, both defenses were ranked in the bottom 30 (out of 120) in points allowed. Despite <b>having</b> <b>three</b> players on the All-Mountain West team, Nevada allowed opponents to convert third downs 47.2% of the time (107th in the country). Arizona was led defensively {{during the regular season}} by Jake Fischer, who accumulated 119 total tackles, while Nevada was led by Albert Rosette who totaled 135 regular season tackles.|$|E

As he got older Breslin played in local leagues and Driscoll Catholic High School's club team, which afforded {{him the opportunity to}} join the Dubuque Fighting Saints in the United States Hockey League.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas {{are large}} insects made {{conspicuous}} by the courtship calls of the males. They are characterised by <b>having</b> <b>three</b> joints in their tarsi, and having small antennae with conical bases and {{three to six}} segments, including a seta at the tip. The Auchenorrhyncha differ from other hemipterans by having a rostrum that arises from the posteroventral part of the head, complex sound-producing membranes, and a mechanism for linking the wings that involves a down-rolled edging on {{the rear of the}} forewing and an upwardly protruding flap on the hindwing. Cicadas lack the ability to jump as exhibited by other members of the Auchenorrhyncha. Another defining characteristic is the adaptations of the forelimbs of nymphs for underground life. The relict family Tettigarctidae differ from the Cicadidae in having the prothorax extending as far as the scutellum, and by lacking the tympanal apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Demolition and The Hart Foundation {{had faced}} each other two years earlier at SummerSlam 1988, where Demolition had {{successfully}} defended the WWF Tag Team Championship. The Hart Foundation duo of Jim Neidhart and Bret Hart later focused on singles wrestling but soon reunited as a team. They announced on the March 31 episode of WWF Superstars {{that they wanted to}} challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship after the WrestleMania match between The Colossal Connection and Demolition. After Demolition won the match, The Hart Foundation faced The Rockers on the April 28 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event. Demolition interfered, causing a double disqualification. On the July 14 episode of WWF Superstars, Demolition and The Hart Foundation brawled after The Hart Foundation claimed that Demolition <b>having</b> <b>three</b> members was evidence of cowardice. The following week, a match between the teams was announced for SummerSlam. The stipulations stated {{that it would be a}} two out of three falls match and that only two members of Demolition would be allowed at ringside.|$|E

5|$|During the British Raj, Shiyali (present-day Sirkazhi) was the {{headquarters}} of a separate administrative division, or taluka. In 1972 the town was declared a third grade municipality, and was upgraded to a second grade municipality in 1980. The municipality has 24 wards, {{each of which has}} an elected councillor. The functions of the municipality are devolved into six departments: general administration/personnel, engineering, revenue, public health, town planning and IT, which are controlled by a Municipal Commissioner, who is the supreme executive head. Legislative powers are vested in a body of 24 members, one for each of the 24 wards. The legislative body is headed by an elected chairperson, who is assisted by a deputy. On the revenue administration side, Sirkazhi is a taluka headquarters <b>having</b> <b>three</b> revenue villages: Kavilancheri, Sirkazhi and Thadalan.|$|E
5|$|Flint {{and bronze}} weapons have been {{discovered}} in the neighbourhood showing evidence of habitation during the Palaeolithic and Bronze Ages. Roman discoveries were made in 1607 and 1823. Middleton was mentioned as Mildentone and Mildetone in the Domesday Book as <b>having</b> <b>three</b> carucates of land much of which was woodland. The land was given to Ilbert de Lacy who had a castle at Pontefract. Middleton Park is a remnant of the manorial estate which existed after the Norman Conquest. In the 13th century the boundary between Middleton and Beeston {{became the focus of}} a protracted dispute over where it lay in the dense woodland which covered the area. The dispute between William Grammary and Adam de Beeston was settled in 1209 by single combat and resulted in the construction of a boundary bank and ditch, a stretch of which can still be seen in Middleton Woods.|$|E
5|$|Kubera {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a dwarf, with complexion of lotus leaves and a big belly. He is described as <b>having</b> <b>three</b> legs, only eight teeth, one eye, and being adorned with jewels. He is sometimes depicted riding a man. The description of deformities like the broken teeth, three legs, three heads and four arms appear only in the later Puranic texts. Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate or a money bag in his hand. He may also carry a sheaf of jewels or a mongoose with him. In Tibet, the mongoose is considered a symbol of Kubera's victory over Nāgas—the guardians of treasures. Kubera is usually depicted with a mongoose in Buddhist iconography.|$|E
