40|$|The Eucalyptus {{forests in}} {{north-western}} Spain {{are well known}} by their high productivity. They contribute heavily to the national forest production although the area occupied by these sorts of plantations is very small comparing with the total area covered with forests in Spain. The importance of these plantations is rising due to the investments of private owners nearly in absence of public funds for the Eucalyptus <b>forestations.</b> Historically, the investments in forest management have been very scarce in north-western Spain because of the incidence of forest fires (affecting {{the risk of the}} investments) and because of the fragmentation of forest properties (affecting the profitability of the silviculture). Nowadays, the Government, the main forest industries and private owners are making some efforts to improve the management of high productivity forests.

Significant reduction in genetic diversity and significant difference in genetic composition of the seedling lots compared to the seed origin stand were detected. The female and the total effective number of parents were quantified by means of maternity assignment of seedlings and temporal changes in allele frequencies. Extremely low effective maternity numbers were estimated (Nfe ≈ 2 - 4) and estimates accounting for both seed and pollen donors gave also low values (Ne ≈ 35 - 50). These values {{can be explained by}} an inappropriate forestry seed harvest strategy limited to a small number of spatially close trees...|$|R

40|$|Reforestation of Presila di Cosenza: three {{conifers}} compared. A comparison {{was made}} between <b>forestations</b> of Atlas cedar, Douglas fir and Calabrian pine {{realized in the}} mid- 70 s {{of the last century}} with identical modalities and in the same station conditions, in the Presila of Cosenza. The results achieved by the plantations must be considered, according to their main aim that was concerned with the fulfilments of essentially protective tasks, definitely positive. The data relating the rates of take and mortality through the years confirm the great ability to colonise and to form thick and pure crops on behalf of the calabrian pine, while the incremental ones emphasise the Douglas fir as a species with a quicker growth. The densities does not allow, in the test areas, the regeneration to assert itself. Surveyings on the phytosanitary state of the forest stands do not evidence, in the test areas, symptoms of suffering, while the margin plants in the warm slopes of the pine-wood strongly turn out exposed to the processionary attacks. The more important requirement, for the investigated crops, is represented by the carrying-out of silvicultural cuttings, which aim at: regulating their thickness and structure, increasing their biological stability, creating favourable conditions for their renaturalization. </strong...|$|R
5|$|About 190 {{species of}} {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} park have been registered, {{most of which are}} part of the natural composition of the Siberian taiga. Marsh Labrador tea is the most common, the park being one of only three locations in Norway where it occurs. The most common berry plant is lingonberry; common bilberry and bog bilberry are also common, but do not carry good yields of berries. In August there is normally a good yield of cloudberry, and occasionally there can be found Arctic raspberry. There is a limited number of marine plants. The steep cliffs at Revsaksskaret allow mountainous plants to thrive, such as Alpine chickweed, white bluegrass and brittle bladder-fern. These were common throughout the area after the last glacial period, but have vanished with <b>forestation.</b> Other mountainous plants common in the region are not found in Pasvik because of low oxygen levels in the lower soil levels.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the heavy}} <b>forestation</b> in the area, {{sawmilling}} was an important and early industry, starting in the 1830s. In the early 20th century, there were around 20 sawmills in Meander and the surrounding localities. Due to a move towards closer settlement—smaller land plots and resulting greater population density—demand for timber in Meander increased and new sawmills were built in Meander in the 1910s and 1920s. Some of these mills continued into the late 20th century. Sawmilling later declined, partly {{due to lack of}} timber. Timberworld is the only remaining sawmill, though this is not its only business. It opened in 1985 as a sawmill supplying local Australian blackwood, myrtle beach and Blackheart Sassafras, originally operating from the former Baptist Church building. From 1990 it was owned and run by Kerin Booth and Kim Booth and it relocated to the former site of the Cummings Bros sawmill. Kim Booth, leader of the Tasmanian Greens, later passed management of the company to his son, Bronte. At one time Timberworld employed 30 people. The company now focuses on supply of prefabricated homes.|$|E

To develop the problems and the causes affecting the reconstitution of the subericulture, the recourse to assisted regeneration and the various forestry treatments are a great need for the maintenance of its habitat. Regeneration by natural sowings remains insufficient whereas the <b>forestations</b> are generally lacking following none the control of the techniques of breeding of the seedlings in seedbed, and with the transplant shock due to the abrupt change in thermal conditions when moved from standard seedbed conditions to those of plantation sites often challenged with cold or heat stress. With an aim of evaluating the physiological behavior of cork oak with respect to the high temperatures, an experiment was led in conditions controlled in a culture room. Sowings of cork oak are cultivated in controlled conditions at 25 °C and a 16 -hr photoperiod. We have measured the content soluble sugar (sucrose, glucose, and fructose) and the content quercitol in the various organs of these sowings. Four thermal stresses (38, 40, 42 and 44 °C) were applied; the results show that there is a significant reduction in the content soluble sugar. However, this species accumulates quercitol in these various organs to face the thermal stress (high temperatures). - See more at: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{alpine region}} is of crucial {{importance}} for the European Union; as a result, the Carpathian Convention aims at its sustainable development. Since sustainability implies also conservation through natural protected areas, aimed at including regions representative for the national biogeographical space, this article aims at assessing the efficiency of conservation. The methodology consisted of using spatial metrics applied to Romanian and European data on the natural protected areas, land cover and use and their transitional dynamics. The findings show a very good coverage of the Alpine biogeographical region (98 % included in the Convention area, and 43 % of it protected within the Convention area) and of the ecological region of Carpathian montane coniferous forests (88 % included in the Convention area, and 42 % of it protected within the Convention area). The dominant land cover is represented by forests (63 % within the Convention area, and 70 % of the total protected area). The main transitional dynamics are deforestation (covering 50 % of all changes area within the Convention area and 46 % from the changed area within its protected area) and <b>forestations</b> – including afforestation, reforestation and colonization of abandoned agricultural areas by forest vegetation (covering 44 % of all changes area within the Convention area and 51 % from the changed area within its protected area) during 1990 - 2000 and deforestation (covering 97 % of all changes area within the Convention area and 99 % from the changed area within its protected area) during 1990 - 2000.

25|$|Norway's {{coastline}} {{rose from}} glaciation {{with the end}} of the last glacial period about 12,000 B.C. The first immigration took place during this period as the Norwegian coast offered good conditions for sealing, fishing, and hunting. They were nomadic and by 9300 B.C they were at Magerøya. Increased ice receding from 8000 B.C. caused settlement along the entire coastline. The Stone Age consisted of the Komsa culture in Troms and Finnmark and the Fosna culture further south. The Nøstvet culture took over from the Fosna culture ca. 7000 BC, which adapted to a warmer climate which gave increased <b>forestation</b> and new mammals for hunting. The oldest human skeleton ever discovered in Norway was found in shallow water off Sogne in 1994 and has been carbon dated to 6,600 BC.

25|$|The {{trail is}} located in Hope, New York, 5 {{and a half miles}} South of Wells, NY. It is a 1.8 mile trail, {{including}} 3 waterfalls each ranging between 10 and 30 feet tall. The trail was originally a major logging road that ran to Devorse creek, but the road was abandoned and later the first 2 miles of it began seeing use as a hiking trail. Part of the old road runs along a steep gorge, where loggers had to build a flying trestle to allow horses to pull logs from nearby camps. Groff mountain has a large population of eastern hemlock and red spruce. Historically, these attracted tanners from nearby towns.

25|$|The {{planting}} of Eucalyptus sp. has been criticised {{because of concerns}} that soil would be degraded by nutrient depletion and other biological changes. During the last ten years, in the northwestern regions of Uruguay the Eucalyptus sp. plantations have reached annual <b>forestation</b> rates of 300%. That zone has a potential forested area of 1,000,000 hectares, approximately 29% of the national territory dedicated to forestry, of which approximately 800,000 hectares are currently forested by monoculture of Eucalyptus spp. It is expected that the radical and durable substitution of vegetation cover leads {{to changes in the}} quantity and quality of soil organic matter. Such changes may also influence soil fertility and soil physical and chemical properties. The soil quality effects associated with Eucalyptus sp. plantations could have negative effects on soil chemistry; for example: soil acidification, iron leaching, allelopathic activities and a high C:N ratio of litter. Additionally, as most scientific understanding of land cover change effects is related to ecosystems where forests were replaced by grasslands or crops, or grassland was replaced by crops, the environmental effects of the current Uruguayan land cover changes are not well understood. The first scientific publication on soil studies in western zone tree plantations (focused on pulp production) appeared in 2004 and described soil acidification and soil carbon changes, similar to a podzolisation process, and destruction of clay (illite-like minerals), which is the main reservoir of potassium in the soil. Although these studies were carried out in an important zone for forest cultivation, they cannot define the current situation in the rest of the land area under eucalyptus cultivation. Moreover, recently Jackson and Jobbagy have proposed another adverse environmental impact that may result from Eucalyptus culture on prairie soils: stream acidification.|$|E

500|$|Weather {{within the}} Wilderness varies {{due to the}} {{mountains}} acting as a barrier for both weather and temperature. The Cascade Range mountains prevent wet storms from moving, forcing air to rise and then cool. This cooling air cannot hold as much moisture, causing heavy precipitation (up to [...] in rainfall annually) on the western flanks of the mountains, which leads to extensive <b>forestation.</b> Snowfall typically totals more than [...] annually, amounting to snow still being present as late as July or August. In warmer months, melted snow runs off into lakes, keeping them especially full. Because the mountains are so tall, storm clouds may get stuck even {{as the rest of}} the storm moves onward, leading to snowstorms and freezing temperatures year-round. In extreme conditions, these storm cells might endanger hikers by means of strong winds, fog, snow, and rain that can potentially make hiking nearly impossible. On the eastern sides of the mountains, air warms as it drops, producing Chinook winds, considerably lower precipitation, and less forested landscapes. Because of these conditions, temperatures on the western sides of mountains are steady, whereas temperatures on the eastern flanks fluctuate wildly.|$|E
