50|$|It is {{debatable}} whether <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> <b>convention</b> {{is a separate}} estoppel doctrine, or merely a case of reliance-based estoppel (estoppel by representation would be its most frequent form), or {{of the rule of}} interpretation that, where words in a contract are ambiguous, one always interprets those words so as to give effect to the actual intentions of the parties even if that would not be the usual legal outcome (see Amalgamated Investment and Property Co. Ltd. v Texas Commerce International Bank Ltd 1982 QB 84).|$|E
50|$|At first {{instance}} Mr Johnson succeeded as Pumfrey J in the High Court held that Gore Wood was estopped by convention from contending that the claims were {{an abuse of}} process as both parties had tacitly agreed that such claims could be brought when they entered into the settlement agreement. The Court of Appeal held {{that there was no}} <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> <b>convention,</b> and that the proceedings were an abuse under the rule in Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100. The Court of Appeal held that just one of Mr Johnson's claims should be struck out for reflective loss.|$|E

5000|$|The {{status of}} <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> {{representation}} of fact is less clear in Australia. Two seminal decisions purport to fuse common law and equitable estoppels into a single unified doctrine, but the New South Wales Court of Appeal continues to treat <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> representation at common law as distinct from equitable estoppel. [...] This can be significant in deciding which court has jurisdiction to adjudicate on the issue.|$|R

50|$|The House of Lords {{felt that}} the point {{relating}} to <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> <b>convention</b> (i.e. that the parties had contemplated such further action might be brought in the earlier settlement agreement) was {{tied up in the}} issue of abuse of process. They noted that the litigation between Mr Johnson and Gore Wood had been ongoing for nearly four and half years before the defendant firm of solicitors sought to strike out the claims on this basis, which was reflective of the parties common understanding that those claims might be pursued, and during that time pleadings had been considerably advanced and they had even made a payment into court. Their Lordships determined that the key issues was whether (i) the settlement of WWH's action proceeded on the basis of an underlying assumption that Mr Johnson would be bringing further claims, and (ii) whether it would be unfair or unjust to now allow Gore Wood to go back on that assumption. Their Lordships held that both grounds were made out.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Estoppel</b> <b>by</b> {{representation}} of fact and promissory estoppel are mutually exclusive: [...] the former is based on {{representation of}} existing fact (or of mixed fact and law), while the latter {{is based on a}} promise not to enforce some pre-existing right (i.e., an intention as to the future). [...] Proprietary estoppel can operate only between parties who, at the time of representation, were in a pre-existing relationship, while this is not a pre-requisite under <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> {{representation of fact}}.|$|R

50|$|A {{representation}} {{can be made}} by statement or conduct.

50|$|The {{common law}} {{doctrine}} of <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> acquiescence is applied when one party gives legal notice {{to a second}} party of a fact or claim, and the second party fails to challenge or refute that claim within a reasonable time. The second party {{is said to have}} acquiesced to the claim, and is estopped from later challenging it, or making a counterclaim. The doctrine is different from <b>estoppel</b> <b>by</b> laches to the extent that a lache may be involuntary but acquiescence involves an intentional act of the party who is accused of aquiescence.|$|R
