500|$|Former {{teammate}} Andy Russell called Greene [...] "unquestionably the NFL's {{best player}} in the seventies," [...] saying [...] "No player had a greater impact or did more for his team." [...] Greene and coach Noll are widely credited with turning the Steelers franchise around. The Steelers finished 1970 with a 5–9 record and went 6–8 in 1971. Greene was invited to the Pro Bowl in both seasons. In 1972, Pittsburgh finished 11–3 and won its first division title and its first playoff game—the [...] "Immaculate Reception" [...] game against the Oakland Raiders. [...] During the season, Greene tallied eleven quarterback sacks and 42 solo tackles, and he was recognized as the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula lauded Greene, saying, [...] "He's just a super super star. It's hard to believe he isn't offside on every play. He makes the other team adjust to him." [...] By this time, Noll had built a formidable defense. [...] "We have maybe 10 guys now capable of making All-Pro," [...] said Greene in 1972. [...] "I'm just like all the other <b>guys,</b> <b>doing</b> my best in a team effort." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bossy has harboured some {{animosity}} towards Wayne Gretzky and the Edmonton Oilers, {{stating that}} the Islanders got little recognition for their dynasty (1980–83) compared to the Canadiens (1976–79) or Oilers (1984–90). Bossy complained [...] "I {{do a lot of}} promoting for how good [...] were...We never got one millionth of the recognition we should. We had a very low-key organization. They didn't want <b>guys</b> <b>doing</b> too much, because they thought the hockey might suffer. People don't talk about us in the first mention of great teams." [...] During Gretzky's interview with the New York Post in 1993, he praised Bossy as the best right-winger ever to play, saying that their scoring totals would have been even higher if the two had played together. (They nearly did; in the 1977 WHA Amateur Draft, Bossy was selected by the Indianapolis Racers, who one year later would become Gretzky's first pro team.) Bossy's response in the Post was not complimentary, as he pointed out that their playing styles were different, and also said that Trottier was the best centre in hockey.|$|E
