25|$|In May 2012, Celtic {{were rated}} 37th in Brand Finance's annual {{valuation}} of the world's biggest football clubs. Celtic's brand was valued at $64million (£40.7million), $15million {{more than the}} previous year. It {{was the first time}} a Scottish club had been ranked in the top 50. Matt Hannagan, Sports Brand Valuation Analyst at Brand Finance, said that Celtic were constrained by the amount of money they got from the SPL and that if they were in the Premiership then, due to their large fan base, they could be in the top 10 clubs in the world. Later that month David Low, the financial consultant who advised Fergus McCann on his takeover of Celtic in 1994, said that Celtic's 'enterprise value' (<b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cost to buy the club) was £52million.|$|E

25|$|The next year, {{although}} the Islanders had won three straight Stanley Cups, more attention was {{being paid to}} the upstart Edmonton Oilers, whose young superstar Wayne Gretzky had just shattered existing scoring records. The 1982–83 season was thus a battle to decide which was {{the best team in}} the NHL. The Oilers had a better regular season, but the Islanders swept them in the Stanley Cup finals to win their fourth straight championship. Billy Smith was named the Most Valuable Player of the Playoffs after shutting down the Oilers' vaunted scoring machine. Gretzky failed to score a goal during the series. The Sutter brothers, Duane and Brent, scored 7 and 5 points respectively in the first 3 games, while Bossy again scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal in game four. After that game, the Oilers players walked past the Islanders' dressing room and were surprised to see the champions exhausted. Oilers players such as Gretzky and Mark Messier said that they realized at that moment <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> actually take to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E
500|$|Ken and Pete dine with Herb Rennet, {{head of the}} Dealers Association and {{a member}} of Jaguar's {{selection}} committee. Herb suggests SCDP’s competitive standing might be improved if they arrange an evening for him with Joan. Pete tells Joan about Herb's proposal. Shocked, she asks how Pete would feel if someone asked that of his wife Trudy. He asks Joan <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> take to convince her. She replies that he [...] "couldn't afford it".|$|E
500|$|The {{replacement}} cost method {{also has its}} critics. What types of jobs should be used as substitutes? For example, should childcare activities [...] "be calculated using the wages of daycare workers or child psychiatrists?" [...] This relates {{to the problem of}} depressed wages in female-dominated industries, and whether using such jobs as an equivalent leads to the undervaluing of unpaid work. [...] Some have argued that education levels ought to be comparable, for example, [...] "the value of time that a college-educated parent spends reading aloud to a child should be ascertained by asking <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cost to hire a college-educated worker to do the same, not by an average housekeeper's wage." ...|$|E

500|$|On December 7, 2011, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were {{announced}} as 2012 inductees to the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. Slovak's brother James accepted the award {{on his behalf}} and gave a speech honoring his brother. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Kiedis expressed his excitement with Slovak's induction, explaining [...] "He's a beautiful person that picked up a guitar in the 1970s and didn't {{make it out of}} the 1980s, and he is getting honored for his beauty". [...] Flea echoed those comments on the same day: [...] "Hillel grew up loving rock and roll so much, he hasn't been here for some time, but I know <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> mean to him. It's a powerful thing." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 18, 2002, the Ramones were {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which specifically named Dee Dee, Johnny, Joey, Tommy, and Marky. At the ceremony, the surviving inductees spoke {{on behalf of the}} band. Johnny spoke first, thanking the band's fans and blessing George W. Bush and his presidency. Tommy spoke next, saying how honored the band felt, but <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have meant for Joey. Dee Dee humorously congratulated and thanked himself, while Marky thanked Tommy for influencing his drum style. Green Day played [...] "Teenage Lobotomy", [...] "Rockaway Beach", and [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop" [...] as a tribute, demonstrating the Ramones' continuing influence on later rock musicians. The ceremony was one of Dee Dee's last public appearances; on June 5, 2002, two months later, he was found at his Hollywood home, dead from a heroin overdose.|$|E
500|$|On another occasion, {{a prostitute}} {{was brought to}} Jackson's room after a concert in Madison Square Garden. There, the pop star interrogated the sex worker, asking why she was a prostitute, whether {{she wanted to have}} sex with him, and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cost. The woman responded that she was a prostitute for the money, but that she would have sex with him for free because she wanted him. The prostitute then {{proceeded}} to unbutton her blouse, exposing her breasts. Apparently repulsed, Jackson turned his head and begged her to [...] "put them back". The singer suggested that they talk instead but would still pay her, which the prostitute declined to do; she was not there to talk. Instead, she gave Jackson her telephone number, urging him to call her when he wanted to [...] "get off". Jackson acknowledged the prostitute as she left, stating that he would perhaps call her one day, though he never did.|$|E

500|$|Cullinan III and IV are two {{of several}} stones cut from the Cullinan Diamond in 1905. The large diamond, found in South Africa, was {{presented}} to Edward VII on his 66th birthday. Two of the stones cut from the diamond were the [...] Cullinan III, a clear pear-shaped stone, and a [...] cushion-shaped stone. Queen Mary had these stones made into a brooch with the Cullinan III hanging from IV. Elizabeth inherited the brooch in 1953 from her grandmother. On 25 March 1958, while she and Prince Philip were on a state visit to the Netherlands, the Queen revealed that Cullinan III and IV are known in her family as [...] "Granny's Chips". The couple visited the Asscher Diamond Company, where the Cullinan had been cut 50 years earlier. It {{was the first time}} the Queen had publicly worn the brooch. During her visit, she unpinned the brooch and offered it for examination to Louis Asscher, the brother of Joseph Asscher who had originally cut the diamond. Elderly and almost blind, Asscher was deeply moved by the fact the Queen had brought the diamonds with her, knowing <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> mean to him seeing them again after so many years.|$|E

2500|$|Brummell took a {{house on}} Chesterfield Street in Mayfair {{and for a time}} managed to avoid the nightly gaming and other extravagances fashionable in such {{elevated}} circles. [...] Where he refused to economise was on his dress: when asked <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cost to keep a single man in clothes, he was said to have replied: [...] "Why, with tolerable economy, I think it might be done with £800." [...] That amount is approximately £52,000 ($67,000) in 2016 currency; the average wage for a craftsman at that time was £52 a year.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the works}} {{recorded}} by Capitol Records, [...] "Incident in Jazz" [...] {{is probably the}} most compositionally unified of Graettinger's and shows his full capabilities as an orchestral writer in progressive jazz or as a Third stream music composer (the work was originally entitled [...] "Incident in Sound"). [...] This is part of the new [...] "Innovations" [...] orchestra that Stan Kenton had marshalled into the studio to record these groundbreaking sides. Kenton comments on the unprecedented conditions this orchestra operated under, [...] "The Capitol people were with me all the way. There were tremendous sums of money involved in recording this orchestra and selling the music that was of such an unusual nature. I remember hour upon hour in the studio while we were recording, and there was no thought of <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> cost: the thought was only to make the finest recordings that we knew how." [...] The largesse of Capitol Records and Kenton himself would only last (roughly) six months until a more conventional, financially solvent Kenton 'dance' orchestra would be reformed to cut sides with the popular Capitol artist Nat King Cole. Graettinger's [...] "House of Strings" [...] (Aug 24, 1950) is recorded on a split session with popular Les Baxter sides; the Kenton 'Innovations Orchestra' as a regular touring and studio unit had come and gone quickly due to financial failure.|$|E
