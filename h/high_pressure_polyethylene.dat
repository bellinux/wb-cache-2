Within the investigation «Development of polymer composite materials based on epoxy binder and functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNT) » radio-absorbing materials based on epoxy binder and f-CNT have been created. These materials possess the similar absorbing and reflecting characteristics but their thicknesses are 25 – 30 times less than those of composites based on microsize carbon fillers (technical carbon and graphite) and 1, 5 – 2, 0 times less in respect to the composites based on native CNT. Such composites with the same thicknesses and weakening factor are characterized with reflection factor which is 4, 5 – 5, 5 times less than that of composites based on microsize carbon fillers and 1, 1 – 1, 4 times less in respect to the composites based on native CNT.

Study of composition Gas formations during the deformation of polyethylenes of different grades through the channel of a capillary viscometer. Which were characterized by structural characteristics, were carried out at shear rates close to production in the range from 50 to 300 s- 1 at temperatures of 160, 190 and 220 ° C. The objects of the study were domestic thermoplastics of the following brands: LDPE 10803 - 020; LDPE 15803020; LPVD F- 03020 -S; HDPE 293 - 285 -D, characterized by structural characteristics. It is established that the gasification during extrusion processing is promoted by the branching of polyethylene, while the degree of destruction processes increases with increasing temperature and depends on the reaction medium of the working volume of the equipment. Emerging critical shear stresses in the absence of oxidants and impurities contribute to mechano-destruction, accompanied by the formation of free radicals, which recombine to form a more branched structure of the polymer. In turn, the high temperature promotes degradation in the side parts of the polymer to form volatile products that are released from the reaction volume. It {{should be noted that the}} gassing due to thermal exposure is promoted by the air environment, but to a lesser extent than with mechano-thermal action. A smaller measure of the impact in the inertial medium is apparently associated with a limited access of oxidants to the destruction centers...|$|E

40|$|Drawing {{behavior}} of a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> crystallized chain-extended <b>polyethylene</b> in solid-state extrusion was studied. Because of the reduced trapped entanglements at the fold surfaces and interlamellar links in this morphology, there was insufficient continuity to provide stress transfer for effective orientation. Draw efficiency increases {{to a maximum of}} 0. 71 when the polyethylene was crystallized at higher undercoolings. Tensile moduli were found to be a unique linear function of molecular draw ratio, measured by thermal shrinkage, independent of the initial morphology, draw temperatures and techniques. Electron microscopy of the fracture surface replicas at low draw showed the coexistence of undeformed, tilted, partially drawn lamellae and the generated fibrillar structure. The observations were consistent with Peterlin 2 ̆ 7 s model of plastic deformation. ^ The question of melting and recrystallization during deformation was studied by small-angle X-ray scattering of the drawn chain-extended polyethylene. The results showed that melting and recrystallization did not occur for this morphology. ^ A partially dried Nylon 6 gel in benzyl alcohol was solid-state co-extruded at 150 (DEGREES) C up to draw ratio 5. 7. Double orientation was observed in this uniaxial drawing with the crystal chain axis oriented parallel and perpendicular to the draw direction. A deformation mechanism was proposed from the studies of birefringence, wide- and small-angle X-ray scatterrings. ^ A new drawing technique for Nylon 6 by reversible plasticization with iodine was proposed.

40|$|Exploitation of ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil {{reservoirs}} {{is always}} associated with numerous risks, challenges, and obstacles. One {{of the most}} pronounced constraints in development of such fields {{is the number of}} wells, which is imposed by massively high cost of drilling. Low number of wells may lead to <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> isolation regions left after primary production (pressure depletion) of the reservoir. Ultradeep reservoirs with <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> are more prone to such leftover <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> isolation regions due to their low permeable characteristic. These <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> isolation regions can, subsequently, deteriorate the efficiency of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) as the injected fluid cannot access the residual oil in these regions. Therefore, well placement and inter-well spacing optimizations is of greater importance in ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoirs to ensure higher ultimate oil recovery at lower costs. Furthermore, due to high cost of development of ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoirs, the EOR strategy and commencement time for the selected EOR strategy are very critical. The objective of this thesis is to demonstrate how optimization of well placement, well spacing, and startup time for miscible CO 2 flooding can enhance the incremental and ultimate oil recoveries in an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoir. To do this, a synthetic grid model was made to run different simulation scenarios on it. The model was initialized with rock and fluid properties within the range of those in the ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico to ensure that it mimics an ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoir.

The results, discussions, and conclusions were finally used by the author to shed light on potential further work on each of the aforementioned challenges in ultradeep, <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> oil reservoirs such as Wilcox formation in the Gulf of Mexico. </p...|$|R
