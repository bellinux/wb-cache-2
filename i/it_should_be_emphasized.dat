25|$|A recent use {{of equal}} {{protection}} doctrine came in Bush v. Gore (2000). At issue was the controversial recount in Florida {{in the aftermath}} of the 2000 presidential election. There, the Supreme Court held that the different standards of counting ballots across Florida violated the equal protection clause. It was not this holding that proved especially controversial among commentators, and indeed, the proposition gained seven out of nine votes; Justices Souter and Breyer joined the majority of five—but only, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>emphasized,</b> for the finding that there was an Equal Protection violation. Much more controversial was the remedy that the Court chose, namely, the cessation of a statewide recount.|$|E

Bradley's explanation cannot account for situations such as the water telescope, nor for many other optical effects (such as interference) that might occur within the telescope. This is because in the Earth's frame it predicts that the direction of propagation of the light beam in the telescope is not normal to the wavefronts of the beam, in contradiction with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. It also does not preserve the speed of light c between frames. However, Bradley did correctly infer that the effect was due to relative velocities.|$|E
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>emphasized,</b> however, {{that for}} Whitehead God is not {{necessarily}} tied to religion. [...] Rather than springing primarily from religious faith, Whitehead saw God as necessary for his metaphysical system. [...] His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed for novelty {{in the world and}} provided an aim to all entities. [...] Whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the primordial nature of God. [...] However, Whitehead was also interested in religious experience. [...] This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of God, the consequent nature. [...] Whitehead's conception of God as a [...] "dipolar" [...] entity has called for fresh theological thinking.|$|E
