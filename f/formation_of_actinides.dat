To {{gain an understanding of}} the mechanism involved in the extraction process, a complex <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>actinides</b> and lanthanides with BTBPs (6, 6 '-bis(5, 6 -dialkyl- 1, 2, 4 -triazin- 3 -yl) - 2, 2 '-bipyridines) was characterized using the Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) technique. This study was carried out to compare the influence of diluents and side groups of the extractants on complex formation. Three different diluents, nitrobenzene, octanol and cyclohexanone, and two extractants, C 5 -BTBP and CyMe 4 -BTBP, were selected for this experiment. It was found that the change of the diluent and of the substituent on the BTBP moiety does not modify the stoichiometry of the complexes which is L 2 M(NO 3) 3. It is proposed that one nitrate is directly coordinated to the metal ion, the two other anions probably remaining in the outer coordination sphere. The difference observed in extracting properties is probably due to the solvation of the complexes by the diluent. The noncovalent force that holds complexes together are likely to be largely governed by electrostatic interactions even if the hydrophobic exterior of the complexes {{plays an important role in}} the complexation/extraction mechanism.

40|$|The {{purpose and}} scope of this report is to present an {{overview}} of the experiments, methods, results, and conclusions from research performed for the project “Groundwater Characterization at Yucca Mountain Task 2 : Surface Complexation and Solid Phase Dissolution”. The impact of surface complexation, alteration phase formation, and solution competition with metal ions on the solubility and speciation of actinide elements (U, Pu, Np) will be examined. In particular the role of iron (as Fe 2 + and Fe 3 +) and silicate (as SO 3 2 -) concentrations on speciation, solubility, sorption, and secondary phase <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>actinides</b> will be investigated. While a large body of literature exists on the interaction of actinides with iron and iron oxide phases, relatively little has been explored regarding the impact of silicates on actinide speciation. Therefore the role of silicates will be the main focus of the report, as it is the primary factor which meaningfully contributes to the enhanced understanding of actinide environmental speciation. The described topics are examined through two main studies areas: formation of precipitates from solution phase species and sorption of dissolved species to solids. The main actinide ion species of interests are UO 2 2 +, NpO 2 +, and Pu 4 +. These species were selected based on their importance as components of spent nuclear fuel and their potential to form soluble species. The main component of spent nuclear fuel is uranium; neptunium is expected to have a high solubility due to its pentavalent oxidation state, and plutonium may form colloidal species [1]. The aqueous phase pH, Fe concentration, and SiO 3 2 - concentration are varied. The role of Fe is of importance since canister corrosion may elevate aqueous levels of iron. Since the groundwater near the Yucca Mountain site is approaching saturation in silicate concentration, evaluation of this anion is deemed crucial. Furthermore, geochemical research at the Nevada Test Site has identified goethite and silicates as important geominerals, offering further motive for the investigation of iron oxides and silicates [2]. The role of pH is fundamental in dictating actinide and iron hydrolysis [3] and is evaluated to ascertain its importance in speciation {{in the presence of the}} other solution constituents. The project results will elucidate the relative importance of Fe and silicates in actinide speciation, in particular the formation of precipitates and subsequently sorbed species.

40|$|Abstract The {{sustainable}} progress {{of nuclear power}} relies on a safe and secure management of radioactive waste and on the implementation of processes fulfilling the enhanced safety and security principles of an advanced nuclear fuel cycle. To this end, a pyrochemical electrorefining process for the recovery <b>of</b> <b>actinides</b> from metallic nuclear fuel based on An-Zr alloys in a molten salt medium is investigated at ITU. It consists of anodic dissolution of the fuel in a molten salt bath and selective electrochemical reduction <b>of</b> the <b>actinides</b> that are then collected {{in the form of}} An-Al alloys on solid aluminium cathodes. For the separation <b>of</b> the <b>actinides</b> from the aluminium a chlorination route is proposed at ITU. It consists of three steps: (I) distillation of the adhered salt; (II) chlorination of the An-Al alloys with either HCl(g) or Cl 2 (g) under conditions ensuring a full chlorination, forming AnClx(s) and AlCl 3 (g) avoiding <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> volatile <b>actinide</b> chlorides. A subsequent sublimation step (III) to remove any remaining AlCl 3 is also investigated. Prior to laboratory experiments, thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were performed to evaluate the optimal reaction conditions for U, Pu and Np. Using the equilibrium module of the software HSC-Chemistry 6. 0, the conditions for different temperatures and ratios of chlorination gas to An-Al alloys were calculated. Based on these calculations the temperature range to be tested experimentally was limited to 300 - 400 °C in the case of HCl(g) and 150 - 170 °C in the case of Cl 2 (g) to exclude the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> volatile <b>actinide</b> chloride species such as UCl 6 (g). As starting materials, samples prepared by electrorefining of U-Pu-Zr alloys, as well as An-Al alloys prepared by arc melting of the pure elements, were used. The experiments were carried out in a glove box under nitrogen atmosphere. The box is equipped with a Ar/HCl/Cl 2 gas line, a vacuum pump and a vertical furnace in which a reactor of 1 l in volume made of quartz glass is placed. A boron nitride crucible was used as the reaction vessel. After inserting the An-Al alloys into it, it was placed in the quartz reactor. The reactor was filled with Ar, heated to the desired temperature, filled with the chlorination gas and isolated for a specific time. The evaluation of the process efficiency is based on XRD and ICP-OES analysis of samples taken from the reaction products and from the cold parts of the reactor, where evaporated material such as AlCl 3 is condensed.

Uranium, added as uranyl nitrate, was removed from solution at pH 5 by cells but at pH 7 and 9 very little uranium was removed due to its limited volubility. Although present as soluble species, uranyl citrate at pH 5, 7, and 9, and uranyl carbonate at pH 9 were not removed by the bacterium because they were not bioavailable due to their neutral or negative charge. Addition of uranyl EDTA to brine at pH 5, 7, and 9 resulted in the immediate precipitation of U.

40|$|The recent arms {{reduction}} treaties between the U. S. and Russia {{have resulted in}} inventories of plutonium in excess of current defense needs. Storage of this material poses significant, and unnecessary, risks of diversion, especially for Russia whose infrastructure for protecting these materials has been weakened {{since the collapse of}} the Soviet Union. Moreover, maintaining and protecting these materials in their current form is costly. The United States has about sixty metric tons of excess plutonium, half of which is high-purity weapon material. This high purity material will be converted into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for use in nuclear reactors. The less pure excess plutonium does not meet the specifications for MOX fuel and will not be purified to meet the fuel specifications. Instead, it will be immobilized directly in a ceramic. The ceramic will be encased in a high level waste (HLW) glass monolith (i. e., the can-in-canister option) thus making a form that simulates the intrinsic security of spent nuclear fuel. The immobilized product will be placed in a HLW repository. To meet the repository requirements, the product must be shown to be durable for the intended storage time, the host matrix must be stable in the radiation environment, the solubility and leaching characteristics of the plutonium in the host material must be established, and optimum processing parameters must be determined for the entire compositional envelope of feed materials. In order to provide technically sound solutions to these issues, thermodynamic data are essential in developing an understanding of the chemistry and phase equilibria of the actinide-bearing mineral waste forms proposed as immobilization matrices. However, the relevant thermodynamic data (e. g., enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity) for the ceramic forms are severely lacking and this information gap directly affects the Energy Department's ability to license the disposal matrices and methods.

40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} <b>of</b> <b>actinides</b> (An) <b>of</b> different oxidation {{states in the}} process <b>of</b> aquatic colloid <b>formation,</b> e. g. at the generation of aluminosilicates (HAS) by co-nucleation of Si and Al in absence or in presence of natural humic acid (HA). The study comprises three parts. The {{first part of the}} work concentrates on the interaction of tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexavalent actinide ions with HAS colloids. The HAS colloids are synthesized through heterogeneous nucleation of Si and Al in the pH region 4 to 9 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Si concentration is maintained either below or above the saturation concentration of amorphous silica (2 x 10 - 3 M). In the former case 10 - 3 M Si is mixed with 10 - 5 M Al and Si is present in solution as monosilicic acid. In the latter case, 10 - 2 M Si is mixed with 10 - 4 M Al and polysilicic acid prevails in solution. The following tracer nuclides are introduced in the co-nucleation process: 241 Am(III), 234 Th(IV), 237 Np(V) and 233 U(VI). Colloids are separated from solution and precipitate by sequential filtration and ultrafiltration. Definition of the optimum conditions for the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> colloid-borne <b>actinide</b> species is ascertained by radiometric assay, determining the actinide fraction in the colloidal phase as a function of pH, conditioning time, concentration and concentration ratio of the involved components. Several methods are further applied for the appraisal of the chemical binding state <b>of</b> <b>actinides</b> in the HAS colloids as well as of Al in aluminosilicate solutions: TRLFS (time resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy), EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure) spectroscopy and ligand displacement method (using EDTA as competing ligand). The affinity for conucleation with HAS appears to follow the element tendency toward hydrolysis. The second part of the work further concerns the behaviour of An(III, IV, VI) at the interaction with humate colloids. In addition to actinide activity measurements, 14 C-labelled natural humic acid is used in order to facilitate the tracing of humic colloids behaviour. The conditions <b>of</b> colloid <b>formation</b> are investigated by radiometric assay as a function of pH (6. 6 - 7. 8), time, concentration of HA (0. 6 - 8 mg/L), Al (1 x 10 - 5 - 1 x 10 - 4 M) and An (5 x 10 - 8 - 1 x 10 - 5 M). The generation of humate-colloid-borne species is distinctively favored for the non-hydrolyzed ionic species. Generation of humate-colloid-borne An(IV, VI) is enhanced by increasing HA concentration or decreasing the An/HA concentration ratio. The third part of the work follows the conditions for <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> colloid-borne An(III, IV, VI) in the mixed system containing the competing HAS and humic colloids. The simultaneous presence of HAS and HA generally enhances the stability region (in respect with pH and Si/Al concentration) of the colloid-borne An species. The <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> mixed HAS-humic colloids with synergic binding appears to be responsible for the stable incorporation of An into the colloidal phase, as ascertained for Cm(III) by TRLFS.

40|$|With {{the current}} level <b>of</b> <b>actinide</b> {{materials}} used in civilian power generation {{and the need for}} safe and efficient methods for the chemical separation of these species from their daughter products and for long-term storage requirements, a detailed understanding <b>of</b> <b>actinide</b> chemistry is <b>of</b> great importance. Due to the unique bonding properties of the f-elements, the lanthanides are commonly used as structural and chemical models for the actinides, but differences in the bonding between these 4 f and 5 f elements has become a question of immediate applicability to separations technology. This brief overview <b>of</b> <b>actinide</b> coordination chemistry in the Raymond group at UC Berkeley/LBNL examines the validity of using lanthanide analogs as structural models for the actinides, with particular attention paid to single crystal X-ray diffraction structures. Although lanthanides are commonly accepted as reasonable analogs for the actinides, these comparisons suggest the careful study <b>of</b> <b>actinide</b> materials independent <b>of</b> their lanthanide analogs to be of utmost importance to present and future efforts in nuclear industries...|$|R

40|$|The X-ray {{absorption}} spectra <b>of</b> <b>actinides</b> are discussed {{with an emphasis}} on the fundamental effects that influence their spectral shape, including atomic multiplet theory, charge transfer theory and crystal field theory. Many <b>actinide</b> spectra consist <b>of</b> a single peak and it is shown that the use of resonant inelastic X-ray emission spectra (RIXS) has the potential to reveal many new features in the X-ray {{absorption spectra}} <b>of</b> <b>actinides.</b> The new range of RIXS beamlines will allow the determination of new structures in the X-ray absorption spectra that have been hitherto invisible. This has the potential to become an important tool in the determination of the electronic structure <b>of</b> <b>actinides.</b> © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn an {{environment}} rich in natural organic matter (NOM) {{it is expected}} {{to play an important role}} on the speciation and migration <b>of</b> <b>actinides.</b> The inherent heterogeneity of these substances makes the modelling of their interaction with metals and surfaces, and thus of their migration, particularly difficult. This chapter recalls the basics of the interaction <b>of</b> NOM with <b>actinides,</b> and <b>of</b> their comportment in presence of mineral surfaces. Finally, illustrative examples of NOM influence on the migration <b>of</b> <b>actinides</b> in the environments are presented...|$|R
