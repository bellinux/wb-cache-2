40|$|A {{continuum}} {{theory is}} employed to numerically study the equilibrium orientation and defect structures of a circular cylindrical particle with flat ends under a homeotropic anchoring condition {{in a uniform}} nematic medium. Different aspect ratios of this colloidal geometry from thin discotic to long rod-like shapes and several colloidal length scales ranging from mesoscale to nanoscale are investigated. We show that the equilibrium state of this colloidal geometry is sensitive to the two geometrical parameters: aspect ratio and length scale of the particle. For a large enough mesoscopic particle, there is a specific asymptotic equilibrium angle associated to each aspect ratio. Upon reducing the particle size to nanoscale, the equilibrium angle follows a descending or ascending trend {{in such a way}} that the equilibrium angle of a particle with the aspect ratio bigger than 1 : 1 (a discotic particle) <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> a parallel <b>alignment</b> with respect <b>to</b> the far field nematic, whereas the equilibrium angle for a particle with the aspect ratio 1 : 1 and smaller (a rod-like particle) tends toward a perpendicular <b>alignment</b> <b>to</b> the uniform nematic direction. The discrepancy between the equilibrium angles of the mesoscopic and nanoscopic particles originates from the significant differences between their defect structures. The possible defect structures related to mesoscopic and nanoscopic colloidal particles of this geometry are also introduced. Comment: 22 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Glycans are {{the third}} major class of biomolecules {{following}} DNA and proteins. They are extremely vital for {{the functioning of}} multicellular organisms. However, comparing the fast development of sequence analysis techniques, informatics work on glycans {{have a long way}} <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>Alignment</b> algorithms for glycan tree structures are one of the foremost concerns. In addition, the statistical analysis of these algorithms in terms of biological significance needs to be addressed. Results: We developed a tree-structure alignment algorithm for glycans and performed a statistical analysis of these alignment scores such that biologically interesting features could be captured into a score matrix for glycans. We generated our score matrix {{in a manner similar to}} BLOSUM, but with slight variations to accomodate our glycan data, including the incorporation of linkage information. We verified the effectiveness of our new glycan score matrix by illustrating how well the resulting score matrix entries correspond with biological knowledge. Future work for even better improvements with the use of a variety of score matrices for different subclasses of glycans due to their complexity is also discussed. Contact...|$|R

50|$|The men's {{basketball}} team is Kent State's oldest collegiate team, founded in 1913 {{during the first}} fall semester at the new Kent State Normal School campus. The team was organized, though only five men were enrolled out of the initial enrollment of 140 {{at the beginning of}} the term, as the new school was a teacher training college and thus had a predominately female student body. More men would arrive at the school in the coming weeks. They played and won their first game against Kent High School and competed against local company and high school teams for that first season, going 7-2. During the following season, Kent State played its first intercollegiate game, a 56-6 loss to Otterbein College, on January 22, 1915. An additional intercollegiate game, a 54-18 home loss to Muskingum College, was played that year along with three other games against local teams. Kent State's first intercollegiate win was recorded March 10, 1916, a 27-17 home win over Ashland College, played in the former heating plant and manual training building. A shortage of men during both World Wars prevented teams from being formed for the 1917-18, 1918-19, and 1943-44 seasons. Beginning in 1932, Kent State played as a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference before joining the Mid-American Conference and beginning league play in 1951.
