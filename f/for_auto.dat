5|$|Born in Wichita, Kansas, {{and raised}} in Omaha, Nebraska, Gale Eugene Sayers {{is the son of}} Roger Winfield Sayers and Bernice Ross. His father was a {{mechanic}} for Goodyear, farmed, and worked <b>for</b> <b>auto</b> dealerships. Sayers' younger brother, Ron, later played running back for the San Diego Chargers of the American Football League. Roger, his older brother, was a decorated college track and field athlete. Gale Sayers graduated from Omaha Central High School where he starred in football and track and field. A fine all-around track athlete, he set a state long jump record of 24ft 10 in as a senior in 1961.|$|E

He moves to Hollywood in April 1954 to begin filming for Eden and is {{introduced}} to Jack L. Warner, the stern president of Warner Bros. Studios who is determined to transform him into a movie star. Warner becomes suspicious of his personal life (such as his possible bisexuality and passions <b>for</b> <b>auto</b> racing and motorcycling). On the Warner Bros. backlot, he {{falls in love with}} actress Pier Angeli, who is working on the neighboring production of The Silver Chalice (1954).|$|E
5|$|The Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex {{was built}} in 1909, inaugurating {{a new era in}} history. Most Indiana cities within 200 miles of Detroit became part of the giant {{automobile}} industry after 1910. The Indianapolis speedway was a venue <b>for</b> <b>auto</b> companies to show off their products. The Indianapolis 500 quickly became the standard in auto racing as European and American companies competed to build the fastest automobile and win at the track. Industrial and technological industries thrived during this era, George Kingston developed an early carburetor in 1902; in 1912, Elwood Haynes received a patent for stainless steel.|$|E

5|$|Although Fox {{insisted on}} {{maintaining}} CinemaScope for a time, some actors disliked the system. For Fox's 1965 production Von Ryan's Express, Frank Sinatra reputedly demanded that Auto Panatar lenses be used. Such pressures led Fox to completely abandon CinemaScope <b>for</b> <b>Auto</b> Panatars that year; Von Ryan's Express was the studio's first picture with Panavision lenses. To meet the extraordinary demand for Panavision projection lenses, Gottschalk had Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lenses retrofitted into Panavision housings {{with a new}} astigmatic attachment, improving them greatly. This was revealed many years after Gottschalk's death; a lead designer from Bausch & Lomb, who had {{been involved with the}} original CinemaScope project, came to work as a designer for Panavision and—after opening some of the older lenses—figured out the secret.|$|E
5|$|Working in his {{laboratory}} {{to develop new}} corrosion-resistant metals <b>for</b> <b>auto</b> parts, Haynes discovered that mixing tungsten with chromium, steel and iron resulted {{in the formation of}} strong and lightweight alloys that were impervious to corrosion, and could endure high temperatures. In 1912, he formed Haynes Stellite Company to produce one of the new alloys, and received lucrative contracts during World War I, making Haynes a millionaire in 1916. He sold his patent for stainless steel to the American Stainless Steel Company in exchange for enough stock to gain a seat at the company's board of directors, a position he held for 12 years. He merged the Haynes Stellite company with Union Carbide in 1920. After passing through different owners, the company was renamed and is now called Haynes International. Haynes returned his focus to his automotive company, but in the economic recession of the 1920s the business went bankrupt and was liquidated.|$|E
5|$|Remaining {{in such a}} {{position}} would require Mercedes-Benz to produce a competitive car for the 1936 season. Although the chassis of the W25 was shortened, and the engine was significantly upgraded to 4.74litres, the car proved inferior to the Type C developed by Auto Union. Mercedes had not improved the chassis to match the engine, and the W25 proved uncompetitive and unreliable. Despite this, Caracciola opened {{the season with a}} win in the rain at the Monaco Grand Prix, after starting from third position. He led the Hungarian Grand Prix early but retired with mechanical problems. At the German Grand Prix, he retired with a failed fuel pump, before taking over his teammate Hermann Lang's car; he later retired that car with supercharger problems. Caracciola led the Swiss Grand Prix for several laps, Rosemeyer trailing him closely, but the Clerk of the Course ordered Caracciola to cede the lead to Rosemeyer on the ninth lap after he was found to be blocking the Auto Union. The two had a heated argument after the race despite Caracciola's later retirement with a rear axle problem. Mercedes were so uncompetitive in 1936—Caracciola won only twice, in Monaco and Tunis—that Neubauer withdrew the team mid-season, leaving Rosemeyer to take the Championship <b>for</b> <b>Auto</b> Union.|$|E

By this stage in his adolescence, he and his adoptive parents were living in California. Within a year of leaving school, he had been arrested <b>for</b> <b>auto</b> theft, hit and run, and evading arrest. For these offenses, Bittaker was imprisoned at the California Youth Authority, where he remained until the age of 18.

With {{the completion of the}} A4 expressway (scheduled November 2009) much more traffic (at least 5% by 2015) is expected through Berikon for travellers heading for the interchange at Birmensdorf (approx. 3km away). Berikon has begun roadwork with a view to reduce the flow of transit vehicles. The project implementing these remedial measures is planned to last some 2.5 years and should be completed in autumn of 2011.|$|E

25|$|The 1939 Eifelrennen was {{the first}} race of the season for the Auto Union team. Along with fellow {{motorcycle}} racer Hermann Paul Müller, they acted as reserve drivers for the Auto Union team. After qualifying for the 1939 Eifelrennen, Hans Stuck injured his foot playing skittle and the place was taken by Meier, who failed to start the race after a technical failure of his Auto Union Type D. The 1939 Eifelrennen was won by Hermann Lang driving the Mercedes-Benz W154 after Tazio Nuvolari driving <b>for</b> <b>Auto</b> Union tried to run the race non-stop. For the 1939 Belgium Grand Prix, Meier again deputised for Hans Stuck in the Auto Union team. The race, held in heavy rain and poor visibility, was dominated by the Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrows of Dick Seaman and Hermann Lang. On lap 14, Meier's Auto Union Type D was forced into a ditch by privateer Adolphe Mandirola driving a Maserati 6CM at Blanchemont on the Spa-Francorchamps circuit and then retired. The 1939 Belgium Grand Prix was again won by Hermann Lang, but was domininated {{by the death of}} Dick Seaman in a crash at La Source hairpin. The 1939 French Grand Prix at Reims-Gueux was dominated by Auto Union after the retirement of the Mercedes-Benz drivers, after Rudolf Caracciola crashed on lap 1, a lap-17 engine failure for von Brauchitsch and Hermann Lang on lap 36. The race was won by Hermann Paul Müller <b>for</b> <b>Auto</b> Union and Meier finished in 2nd place after a pit-fire burnt his arm.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some small}} scale farming {{done in the}} state, {{especially}} in the highlands areas, growing corn and other staples mostly <b>for</b> <b>auto</b> consumption, highly dependent on the rainy season {{in the late summer}} as there is no irrigation. If these rains fail, the area suffers. However, most of the agriculture continues to shift away from small farms producing for local markets to largescale commercial agro-industry. Many of the country’s largest agribusiness farms are located in Sonora. This agricultural production is concentrated in the lowlands areas, with much of the production exported to the United States. This includes non-traditional crops such as fruits, nuts and winter vegetables such as tomatoes, especially since NAFTA.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks after}} {{becoming}} the first foreign winner of the prestigious Senior TT race, Meier won the 500cc 1939 Dutch TT at Assen. This {{was followed by a}} win at 500cc 1939 Belgium Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps and {{becoming the first}} motorcycle racer to lap a Grand Prix course at over 100mph. Despite missing the French Grand Prix, Meier competed instead <b>for</b> <b>Auto</b> Union driving to second place in Grand Prix De L'Automobile Club de France at Reims-Gueux. Returning to ride for a BMW motorcycle for the Swedish Grand Prix, Meier fell twice after chasing Dorino Serafini riding for Gilera and suffered a back-injury which prevented racing {{for the rest of the}} 1939 season. With further wins at the 500cc German, Ulster and Italian GP races, Dorino Sefafini won the 500cc class for the 1939 European Championship.|$|E
