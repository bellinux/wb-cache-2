After deliberations, a $43 million contract (including $10.5 million in state funds) was awarded in August 2012. The planning project will advance the new station area, including a possible passenger mezzanine over the platforms, to the 30% <b>design</b> <b>level.</b> Other elements include a redesign of the South Station interlocking, new commuter rail layover facilities, and the restoration of public access to the adjacent section of Dorchester Avenue and the Fort Point Channel, filling in a missing half-mile segment of the Boston Harborwalk. The station expansion is intended to allow for increases in commuter rail service on the Fairmount Line and Framingham/Worcester Line, addition of South Coast Rail service, and increased Amtrak frequencies.|$|E
25|$|At {{the highest}} level, the design may be {{optimized}} to make {{best use of}} the available resources, given goals, constraints, and expected use/load. The architectural design of a system overwhelmingly affects its performance. For example, {{a system that is}} network latency-bound (where network latency is the main constraint on overall performance) would be optimized to minimize network trips, ideally making a single request (or no requests, as in a push protocol) rather than multiple roundtrips. Choice of design depends on the goals: when designing a compiler, if fast compilation is the key priority, a one-pass compiler is faster than a multi-pass compiler (assuming same work), but if speed of output code is the goal, a slower multi-pass compiler fulfills the goal better, even though it takes longer itself. Choice of platform and programming language occur at this level, and changing them frequently requires a complete rewrite, though a modular system may allow rewrite of only some component â€“ for example, a Python program may rewrite performance-critical sections in C. In a distributed system, choice of architecture (client-server, peer-to-peer, etc.) occurs at the <b>design</b> <b>level,</b> and may be difficult to change, particularly if all components cannot be replaced in sync (e.g., old clients).|$|E

[...] He and his partner Henry Kloss formed the Acoustic Research company to manufacture and market speaker systems using this principle. [...] Subsequently, continuous developments in enclosure design and materials led to significant audible improvements. The most notable improvements to date in modern dynamic drivers, and the loudspeakers that employ them, are improvements in cone materials, the introduction of higher-temperature adhesives, improved permanent magnet materials, improved measurement techniques, computer-aided design, and finite element analysis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The dike rings {{along the}} Rhine in the Netherlands have {{a level of}} {{protection}} of 1 / 1250 per year. The <b>design</b> water <b>levels</b> are estimated {{on the basis of}} one random variable: the river discharge. Van Vuren & Van Breen (2003) show the existence of large spatial and temporal variation in bed level position in the river Waal. In this paper the impact of river morphology on extreme flood level predictions is investigated. Therefore, the method to compute <b>design</b> water <b>levels</b> is extended with another random variable: the river morphology. The results show that the impact of river morphology on <b>design</b> water <b>levels</b> is limited. A random bed level prior to the <b>design</b> water <b>level</b> computations leads to small changes (order of 0. 01 - 0. 06 m) in <b>design</b> water <b>levels.</b> The impact of seasonal variations in the river morphology and morphological changes during the flood wave can be neglected. ...|$|R

40|$|For obvious reasons, the {{structural}} integrity and health condition of ocean cities are important safety issues for viable human inhabitation. For large complex civil structural systems, structural health can be {{monitored by measuring}} its dynamic response to environmental or man-made loads acting on the system. The response can be continuously checked in relation to critical <b>design</b> <b>levels.</b> In the case that {{the structural}} response exceeds the <b>design</b> <b>levels,</b> the structural system should be immediately inspected for damage. However, structural systems can suffer damage from continual environmental degradation, even at low response amplitude levels. This damage can accumulate to such a stage that a failure may occur under a final loading which has an amplitude smaller than the critical <b>design</b> <b>levels.</b> If structural damage is not detected and corrected then it may progressively worsen and eventually cause catastrophic structural failure. Therefore, a methodology for monitoring structural integrity, in order to rapidly detect the occurrence and identify the location of damage, will be instrumental in assuring the safety of ocean cities. Such a concept for damage assessment is presented here based on measuring both structural response and environmental parameters which can be used to infer the exciting forces on the system. This concept is illustrated using simulation studies of a large suspension bridge being built in Hong Kong...|$|R

DSE at early design stages helps designers to systematically explore trade-offs between various design goals and to make various design decisions such as hardware/software partitioning, architecture - to - application mappings, task scheduling and task allocation, performance evaluation etc. As the design progresses, the design space can be gradually trimmed and pruned at different <b>design</b> <b>levels</b> of unsuitable <b>design</b> alternatives until a final optimal solution is reached.
