500|$|Reeves {{provided}} a story outline which met with Tenser's enthusiastic approval. Tenser immediately began {{putting together a}} preliminary budget, and requested that Reeves quickly complete a full film script, stressing to Reeves that the production would need to commence by September of that year to avoid shooting during cold weather. Reeves called in his childhood friend Tom Baker (who had co-written The Sorcerers with Reeves) to assist him with the script. Reeves and Baker began drafting a screenplay with Donald Pleasence firmly in mind as the film's star. However, once American International Pictures {{became involved in the}} production, they insisted that their contract star, Vincent Price, be given the lead, and Pleasence was dropped from the film. With the abrupt change of star, Reeves and Baker had to rethink their original concept of presenting Hopkins as [...] "ineffective and inadequate... a ridiculous authority figure", which they had believed Pleasence could play to perfection. They knew the tall, imposing Price, with his long history of horror roles, would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> of a straightforward villain, and they made changes to their script accordingly.|$|E
500|$|McCormack {{received}} his breakthrough role in 1998 {{when he was}} cast as gay lawyer Will Truman on the NBC sitcom Will & Grace. McCormack said that when the part came along, he was convinced he was right for the role. [...] "At {{the end of the}} audition, Max Mutchnick, co-creator and executive producer of the show said 'That was perfect. Just to let you know, you never <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> gay than that.'" [...] He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] The show debuted on September 21, 1998, and was watched by almost 8.6million American viewers. Will & Grace quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and McCormack receiving strong reviews. John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that McCormack and costar Debra Messing (who played Will's best friend Grace Adler) worked [...] "nicely" [...] together. Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times also praised McCormack, Messing, and the supporting cast as [...] "very funny". For this performance, he earned four Emmy Award nominations (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005), one of which resulted in a win (2001), for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. In addition, he received five Golden Globe Award nominations.|$|E
500|$|Nagy set the {{adaptation}} {{several years later}} than the time in which the novel is set, so [...] "the dawn of the Eisenhower administration {{and the rise of}} HUAC could be front and center". One of the challenges of adapting the novel was translating the subjective and limited third-person viewpoint whereby the narrator [...] "sits on the shoulder of Therese and makes regular advances into (and retreats from) her head" [...] and Carol is thus largely seen through Therese's fanatical prism. Nagy was initially apprehensive of the narrative structure, considering [...] "there's no character of Carol. She's a ghost appropriately, as she should be, in the novel", adding that she was [...] "overwhelmed by the task of {{trying to come up with}} the visual equivalent for it structurally." [...] Nagy decided to split the point of view and shift perspectives from Therese to Carol, as [...] "the point of view is always with the more vulnerable party". She made Therese a photographer instead of a set designer, allowing her [...] "to be seen moving from objects to people", which Nagy likened to Highsmith as Therese is a [...] "clear stand-in" [...] for the author. Nagy drew from her personal knowledge of Highsmith for Therese, describing one of Therese's lines, [...] "I started taking pictures of people because my friend says I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> interested in humans", as the epitome of Highsmith: [...] "that ability to step outside of life and comment on it before participating in it". For the character of Carol, Nagy took inspiration from the silhouette and underpinning of Grace Kelly's character in Rear Window (1954). Nagy had freedom in [...] "inventing a life for , for whom, basically, we knew the outline of what was going on." [...] Once Nagy was able to dig into and understand the inner life of Carol, her motivations given the circumstances, then the character became easy to write. Nagy aimed to [...] "focus on the nature of what it's like to fall in love from two points of view", and show the characters [...] "just behaving ... not inhabiting positions." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{conduction}} {{of nerve}} impulses {{is an example}} of an all-or-none response. In other words, if a neuron responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation does not produce a stronger signal but can produce a higher frequency of firing. There are different types of receptor responses to stimuli, slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing. These tonic receptors most often respond to increased intensity of stimulus by increasing their firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second. This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where to get greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) there <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> photons, as the photons can't become [...] "stronger" [...] for a specific frequency.|$|E

He accused climate scientists of concocting the evidence for anthropogenic climate change {{in order to receive}} federal research grants, citing the Climategate controversy and calling investigations which had largely exonerated them [...] "straw-man reviews". He stated that [...] "I'm really more fearful of freezing. And I don't have any science to prove that. But {{we have a lot of}} science that tells us they're not basing it on real scientific facts."

2500|$|Killer {{whales in}} the wild, however, {{are much less}} likely to attack people than are their captive counterparts, who have been known to attack either their {{handlers}} or intruders. Following one such attack on a trainer in 2006, ABC News reported that captive killer whales have attacked nearly two dozen people since the 1970s. Studies of killer whales in the wild have identified at least two categories, based on their territorial range. Those living in a limited area, such as Puget Sound or the Strait of Juan de Fuca, are termed [...] "resident" [...] whales, while [...] "transient" [...] whales roam the oceans at will. These [...] "transient" [...] types <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> aggressive, in order to assert themselves {{in a wide range of}} territories and to prey on a variety of different species. This increased aggressiveness does not disappear in captivity. Furthermore, captivity itself has been asserted to aggravate aggressive behavior, resulting in a [...] "cetacean equivalent of anxiety disorder." ...|$|E

[...] He commented that the suspension was responding to a [...] "need to take strong steps to ... send out the message to all our players and minor hockey players that we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ... <b>more</b> respectful of our opponent." [...] Otters general manager Sherwood Bassin was quick to come to Liambas' defense following the suspension, expressing surprise at the severity of the penalty from Branch. Bassin asserted that Liambas was not simply a [...] "goofball kid", citing his 95 percent average in high school, as well as volunteer work in initiating a stay-in-school program for kids and at the Shriners Hospital for Children in Erie. Liambas expressed regret during the hearing for his hit and commented that he did not know if he could deliver bodychecks anymore as a hockey player.|$|E

40|$|Architecture, the way {{one thinks}} about {{architecture}} and the way architecture is used, is always in change. But the already existing concrete buildings do not change along. This mismatch is {{the starting point of}} my research. There is a shift in thought needed when thinking about what is mentioned above. There is need for a switch from looking at architecture as determined, finished buildings (objects) to start seeing buildings as capacities that are recognizable parts of their own continuous design process (assemblages). For this, one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> {{aware of the fact that}} an architect never <b>has</b> direct access <b>to</b> a building, like a sculptor has- One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> aware of the changing processes in time- One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> aware of the limit(lessness) of spaces. This research will show options that make architecture not more flexible (transform-ing its nature) but more able to understand and react on its own complexness by ques-tioning its own frames and boundaries. It is not about creating new forms of architec-ture, not about making it able to transfer a geometry into a totally different geom-etry, but about creating different scenarios within óne building. It is about the stable buildings as we know it being able to look beyond itself. It is about designing from the (three-dimensional) section instead of solving a programme in plan. It is about the complex interactions between spaces and the complex interactions between the ele-ments that form the spaces. It is about the fact that the limit of space is not the wall...|$|R
2500|$|In 1829 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the world's first [...] "Inter-City" [...] railway, {{was under}} construction. There {{was a large}} {{potential}} for both passenger and goods traffic. However, all locomotives built to date, including those for the Stockton and Darlington, had been intended for slow freight, with any passenger service handled by single horse-drawn coaches. It was therefore clear that any future locomotives would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> versatile. Matters were further complicated by the news about the problems being encountered on the Stockton and Darlington, which gave rise to considerable controversy as {{to the sort of}} motive power to be preferred. [...] George Stephenson, the line's civil engineer, was unsurprisingly firmly in favour of steam traction and asked for a report from Timothy Hackworth, who confirmed that he was having difficulties but was optimistic about overcoming them. To settle upon a locomotive type the directors set up a competition. The trials were held at Rainhill, and there were three serious contestants. Hackworth, with his own very limited resources, entered the 0-4-0 locomotive, Sans Pareil. This locomotive was deemed officially overweight, but nevertheless was allowed to undergo the [...] "ordeal". Unfortunately faulty cylinder casting led to steam leaks and premature abandonment of the course.|$|E
2500|$|In Olins v Walters [...] 2 WLR 1 C.A. the Court of Appeal {{has held}} that {{although}} it is {{a necessary condition for}} mutual wills that there is clear and satisfactory evidence of a contract between the testators, it is a legally sufficient condition that the contract provide that, in return for one testator agreeing to make a will in a particular form and not to revoke it without notice to the other testator, the latter would also make a will in a particular form and agree not to revoke it without notice to the first testator. [...] Once a contract of that kind is established, equity will impose on the surviving testator a constructive trust not to dispose of the property in any other way. [...] There did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> detailed terms of the contract because the remedy was not founded on specific performance of contractual obligations but upon implementation of the trust, and the intentions of the parties had only to be expressed sufficiently to lay the foundations for that equitable obligation. [...] The case also held that, where established, the equitable obligation under the trust became immediately binding upon the surviving testator upon the death of the first and was not postponed to take effect only after the death of the second or last testator when the property, or what was left of it, came into the hands of his personal representatives.|$|E
2500|$|Both sides {{came under}} {{criticism}} for their defensive {{approach in the}} final Test — New Zealand for failing to set aside its headaches about the gifts of Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma and groom a traditionally seam-friendly wicket, and India for not ramming home its advantage {{over the course of}} the final two days. [...] "A 2-0 victory would have been a more correct index of the difference between the teams," [...] wrote Indian journalist Suresh Menon, bemoaning Dhoni's lack of urgency first in batting on too long in the second innings and then in leading a signally listless and complacent display in the field. [...] The Indian skipper's answer to the first charge was that [...] "a huge score meant that we could keep attacking all the time." [...] As Menon observed, however, strangely, he didn't attack all the time. [...] He didn't tell Harbhajan Singh that the bowler should stop sending down his express deliveries but flight the ball. [...] Post-tea on the fourth day, the whole team appeared over-relaxed and almost casual, as if winning would be just a matter of turning up on the fifth day.A 2-0 victory would have been a more correct index of the difference between the teams. India appeared only too satisfied with a 1-0 win. This is not how champion teams play, and if India aspire to knock Australia off the perch at the top, they will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> ruthless in their approach, more focused, and not so easily satisfied.|$|E
