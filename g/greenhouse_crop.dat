If there is no proper ventilation, greenhouses and their growing plants can become prone to problems. The main purposes of ventilation are to regulate the temperature, humidity and vapor pressure deficit [...] to the optimal level, and to ensure movement of air and thus prevent build-up of plant pathogens (such as Botrytis cinerea) that prefer still air conditions. Ventilation also ensures a supply of fresh air for photosynthesis and plant respiration, and may enable important pollinators to access the <b>greenhouse</b> <b>crop.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. BACKGROUND: Insecticide {{resistance}} in Trialeurodes vaporariorum W. is {{unknown in the}} species’ northern distribution range where it inhabits mainly commercial greenhouses. Resistance development in whiteflies feeding on year-round crops in greenhouses is possible due to use of chemical treatments to back up biocontrol. We tested the response levels to spiromesifen, pymetrozine and imidacloprid in whiteflies collected from seven greenhouses within a 35 km radius in Western Finland. RESULTS: All except one (PR) population had LC 50 values below the recommended concentrations for the tested compounds. However, some populations showed reduced susceptibility to pymetrozine in comparison to reference susceptible population. Resistance ratios to pymetrozine were highly variable (RR 0. 5 - 39. 7) even among closely-located greenhouses and higher than those for imidacloprid (RR 1. 05 - 10. 5) and spiromesifen (RR 0. 8 - 11. 5). LC 50 values and application frequencies of pymetrozine correlated positively among the sampled populations. CONCLUSION: High variation in resistance levels to pymetrozine among populations within natural whitefly dispersal limits reflects variation in the usage of this compound among individual <b>greenhouse</b> <b>crop</b> producers. Thus, resistance management is recommended on individual <b>greenhouse</b> <b>crop</b> producer level, even in a dense production cluster...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{applicability}} of a neurofuzzy method applied to a tomato plant (Lycopersicon esculentum, Mill), {{in order to obtain}} a model of the instantaneous evapotranspiration. Two operational dynamics (diurnal and nocturnal) are defined in a hierarchical fuzzy model by a Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) type with linear consequents. The fuzzy selector of the two dynamics is the solar radiation measure. The fuzzy C–means algorithm is used to identify the fuzzy rules premises. The hierarchical fuzzy modelling is used to obtain a multi–model of the evapotranspiration cycles. In order to simplify the model structure, the variable of vapour pressure deficit (VPD) is introduced, and thus, a physical interpretation of the interior climate is obtained.

40|$|A {{discussion}} of challenges {{related to the}} modeling and control of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>crop</b> growth, this book presents state-of-the-art answers to those challenges. The authors model the subsystems involved in successful greenhouse control using different techniques and show how the models obtained can be exploited for simulation or control design; they suggest ideas {{for the development of}} physical and/or black-box models for this purpose. Strategies for the control of climate- and irrigation-related variables are brought forward. The uses of PID control and feedforward compensators, both widely used in commercial tools, are summarized. The benefits of advanced control techniques—event-based, robust, and predictive control, for example—are used to improve on the performance of those basic methods. A hierarchical control architecture is developed governed by a high-level multiobjective optimization approach rather than traditional constrained optimization and artificial intelligence techniques.   Reference trajectories are found for diurnal and nocturnal temperatures (climate-related setpoints) and electrical conductivity (fertirrigation-related setpoints). The objectives are to maximize profit, fruit quality, and water-use efficiency, these being encouraged by current international rules. Illustrative practical results selected from those obtained in an industrial greenhouse during the last eight years are shown and described. The text of the book is complemented by the use of illustrations, tables and real examples which are helpful in understanding the material. Modeling and Control of <b>Greenhouse</b> <b>Crop</b> Growth will be of interest to industrial engineers, academic researchers and graduates from agricultural, chemical, and process-control backgrounds.

The list of worldwide commercially available natural enemies goes up to 230 species and the 25 most sold species are mainly the ones used in <b>greenhouse</b> <b>crops.</b> Considering this relatively high number of available species, one might think that most greenhouse pests can be effectively controlled {{through the use of}} natural enemies.
