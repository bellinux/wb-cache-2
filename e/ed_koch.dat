5|$|For its {{coverage}} of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, some (such as <b>Ed</b> <b>Koch)</b> have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As`ad AbuKhalil) have insisted that it is pro-Israel. The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti-Semitic.|$|E

5|$|Sotomayor was {{appointed}} by Mayor <b>Ed</b> <b>Koch</b> in 1988 {{as one of the}} founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years. There she took a vigorous role in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure. Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of a stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members. She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.|$|E

25|$|Badillo {{resigned}} from Congress on December 31, 1977 to become deputy mayor of New York City under Mayor <b>Ed</b> <b>Koch,</b> {{a position he}} held until September 1979.

In a major public disagreement with Mayor Koch over {{the lack of support}} for his program to revitalize the South Bronx, Badillo resigned his post. Some argue that Badillo made a major career mistake in giving up his Congressional post for this appointed position under Mayor Koch.|$|E
25|$|Dinkins briefly {{served as}} a member of the New York State Assembly (78th D.) in 1966. He was {{nominated}} as a Deputy Mayor by Mayor Abraham D. Beame but was ultimately not appointed.

On November 7, 1989, Dinkins was elected mayor of New York City, defeating three-term incumbent mayor <b>Ed</b> <b>Koch</b> and two others in the Democratic primary and Republican nominee Rudy Giuliani in the general election.

5000|$|According to {{the same}} writer, Claudianus [...] "pierced the sects {{with the power of}} eloquence", an allusion to a prose {{treatise}} entitled [...] "On the State of the Soul" [...] or [...] "On the Substance of the Soul". Written between 468 and 472, this work was destined to combat the ideas of Faustus, Bishop of Reii (modern Riez, in the department of Basses-Alpes), particularly his thesis on the corporeity of the soul. Plato, whom he perhaps read in Greek, Porphyry, and especially Plotinus and Saint Augustine furnished Claudianus with arguments. But his method was decidedly peripatetic and foretokened Scholasticism. Even his language had the same characteristics as that of some of the medieval philosophers: hence Claudianus used many abstract adverbs in [...] "ter" [...] (essentialiter, accidenter, etc.; forty according to La Broise). On the other hand, he revived obsolete words and, in a letter to Sapaudus of Vienne, a rhetorician, sanctioned the imitation of Nævius, Plautus, Varro and Gracchus. Undoubtedly his only acquaintance with these authors was through the quotations used by grammarians and the adoption of their style by Apuleius, whose works he eagerly studied. Of course this tendency to copy his predecessors led Claudianus to acquire an entirely artificial mode of expression which Sidonius, in wishing to compliment him, called a modern antique (Epist., IV, iii, 3). Besides the treatise and the letter from Claudianus to Sidonius Apollinaris, found among the letters of the latter (IV, ii), some poetry has also been ascribed to him, although erroneously. For instance, he has been credited with the [...] "Pange, lingua", which is by Venantius Fortunatus (Carm., II, ii); [...] "Contra vanos poetas ad collegam", a poem recommending the choice of Christian subjects and written by Paulinus of Nola (Carm., xxii); two short Latin poems in honour of Christ, one by Claudius Claudianus (Birt <b>ed.,</b> p. 330; <b>Koch</b> <b>ed.,</b> p. 248) and the other by Merobaudus (Vollmer ed., p. 19), and two other Greek poems on the same subject, again believed to be the work of Claudius Claudianus.|$|R
2500|$|... “In {{his essay}} Ernst Nolte {{discusses}} the “so-called” annihilation of the Jews (in H.W. <b>Koch,</b> <b>ed.</b> Aspects of the Third Reich, London, 1985). Chaim Weizmann’s declaration {{in the beginning}} of September 1939 that the Jews of the world would fight on the side of Britain, “justified” – so opined Nolte – Hitler to treat the Jews as prisoners of war and intern them. Other objections aside, I cannot distinguish between the insinuation that world Jewry is a subject of international law and the usual anti-Semitic projections. And if it had at least stopped with deportation. All this does not stop Klaus Hildebrand in the Historische Zeitschrift from commending Nolte’s “pioneering essay”, because it “attempts to project exactly the seemingly unique aspects {{of the history of the}} Third Reich onto the backdrop of the European and global development". Hildebrand is pleased that Nolte denies the singularity of the Nazi atrocities”.|$|R
40|$|After a brief {{review of}} our current {{understanding}} of Miras and their evolutionary status, three aspects of ``real-time'' evolution in these and related stars are examined: # Chemical changes (O-rich to C-rich) due to third dredge-up # Period changes due to the effects of the helium-shell flash # The existence of ``fossil'' dust and gas shells. Studies of resolved gas and dust shells are highlighted as particularly interesting. They will enable us to examine the mass-loss histories of many late-type stars over the last ten thousand years or so. Such observations have only recently become technically feasible and they are expected to provide important new insights into the late stages of stellar evolution.
