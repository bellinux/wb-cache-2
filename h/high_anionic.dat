The results obtained, in conjunction with our earlier investigation, show the possibility of SSB at very low energy (0. 15 eV) where the LEE transfers from pi* to sigma* resonance state which resembles a S(N) 2 type mechanism.

40|$|Direct and {{indirect}} releases of {{large quantities of}} surfactants to the environment may result in serious health and environmental problems. Therefore, surfactants should be removed from water before release to the environment or delivery for public use. In the present work, the removal of anionic surfactants, benzene sulfonate (BS), p-toluene sulfonate (TS) and 4 -octylbenzene sulfonate (OBS) from water by adsorption onto Amino modified mesoporous carbon (AMC) were studied. The AMC surface chemistry and textural properties was characterized by nitrogen adsorption, XRD and FT-IR analyses. Experiments were conducted in batch mode with the variables such as amount of contact time, solution pH, dose of adsorbent and temperature. Finally, the adsorption isotherms of anionic surfactants on mesoporous carbon adsorbents were in agreement with a Langmuir model. AMC has shown <b>higher</b> <b>anionic</b> surfactants adsorption capacity than the untreated mesoporous carbon, which can explain by strong interaction between anionic surfactant and cationic surface of adsorbent...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} by the U. S. Bureau of Mines has shown that autoclave cyanide leaching of used automobile exhaust catalysts for recovery of platinum-group metals (PGM) is technically feasible. The purpose of this work {{was to investigate the}} chemistry of the dissolution of PGM in cyanide solutions in more detail. Where possible, samples of pure, elemental PGM powders or foils were used instead of automobile exhaust catalysts, because of their greater purity. Ultraviolet spectra revealed that Pt and Pd were solubilized as the square planar tetracyanometallate (II) complexes, while Rh was solubilized as the octahedral hexacyanorhodate (III) complex. This explained the poor recovery of Rh from solution by carbon adsorption, solvent extraction, and ion exchange observed in earlier research, because of the <b>higher</b> <b>anionic</b> charge and size of the octahedral complex. Leaching rate studies showed that the rate of solubilization was greatest for Pd, followed by Pt and Rh. Although the rate of chemical reaction was the controlling step for the dissolution of elemental Pt and Rh samples, the rate of pore diffusion was rate limiting for PGM in catalyst samples...|$|R

40|$|Freeze-fracture {{has been}} used {{to examine the effects of}} {{gentamicin}} on membrane structure in liposomes of different anionic phospholipids combined with a neutral phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine. The molar ratios of neutral: anionic lipid were 1 : 1 (<b>high</b> <b>anionic</b> lipid ratio) and 4 : 1 (low anionic lipid) and the liposomes were incubated with 0. 1 mM (low) and 1 mM (high) gentamicin. With the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate, an identifiable disruption of the membrane bilayer was observed as well as aggregation of liposomes leading to membrane fusion. These effects occurred both at low gentamicin concentration and low anionic lipid content of the liposomes; these responses were not inhibited by 1 mM Ca 2 +. With the other anionic lipids tested (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol monophosphate), only aggregation and fusion of liposomes was observed and this effect only occurred at high gentamicin concentration and <b>high</b> <b>anionic</b> lipid content. Further, 1 mM Ca 2 + inhibited the responses of these other anionic lipids to gentamicin. The results demonstrate the unique character of the interaction between gentamicin and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and provide further support for the hypothesis that a specific binding to this lipid is a key step in the ototoxic action of aminoglycoside antibiotics. They also suggest that such an interaction in vivo might cause alterations to the structure and properties of cell membranes in the inner ear...|$|E
40|$|Mast cells play an {{important}} role in our immune defense against bacteria and parasites but are also key effector cells in various inflammatory diseases. They act by releasing inflammatory mediators from intracellular granules. Tryptase, one of the most abundant mast cell proteases, is stored in its active form and may therefore act immediately after mast cell degranulation. In this thesis, the activation mechanism of mast cell tryptase has been addressed. Further, the interaction between heparin and tryptase has been thoroughly investigated. We found that the mouse tryptase, mMCP- 6, is critically dependent on heparin and acidic pH for its activation. The critical role of heparin for tryptase activation indicated that displacement of heparin might inactivate tryptase. Indeed, we proved that heparin antagonists, protamine and Polybrene, were potent inhibitors of mMCP- 6 and purified human lung tryptase. A closer study of the structural requirements of heparin revealed that its capacity to activate tryptase is dependent on size and <b>high</b> <b>anionic</b> charge density. Further, these studies led to a novel finding in the demonstration of an active tryptase monomer. The dependence of mMCP- 6 activation on acidic pH suggested that histidines were involved in heparin binding. Site-directed mutagenesis of four selected histidines (H 35, H 106, H 108 and H 238) demonstrated that H 106, positioned closest to the interface, contributed most to heparin binding, indicating that this region may be particularly important. Generally, the single mutants displayed subtle defects compared to when several mutations were combined, which produced large defects in activation, tetramerization and heparin binding. The heparin-induced activation of human β-tryptase was dependent on the size and <b>high</b> <b>anionic</b> charge density of the activator and closely resembled the structural requirements of mMCP- 6 for its interaction with heparin. Altogether, we showed that the mechanism for activation of human β-tryptase was very similar to that of mMCP- 6. This indicates that the mouse system is a highly relevant model for the analysis of the biological role of tryptase in human mast cell-related diseases...|$|E

Both the distribution of bound polycationic ferritin and the topography of the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane were studied in depth by utilizing thin sections and critical-point dried, whole mount preparations for transmission electron microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy. Based on its relative affinity for polycationic ferritin, the surface of the inner membrane contains discrete regions of high density and low density anionic sites.

40|$|AbstractThe membrane-bound sensor kinase KdpD and the cytoplasmic {{response}} regulator KdpE {{regulate the}} expression of the kdpFABC operon coding for the high affinity potassium uptake system KdpFABC in Escherichia coli. The signal transduction cascade of this two component system is activated under K+-limiting conditions in the medium, but is less sensitive to high osmolality. In order to test whether K+ limitation affects membrane phospholipid composition and whether this change affects kdpFABC expression, we analysed the phospholipid composition of E. coli under these conditions. Our measurements revealed that there is an increase in the cardiolipin (CL) content during the exponential growth phase {{at the expense of the}} zwitterionic phospholipid phosphatidylethanolamine. The <b>higher</b> <b>anionic</b> phospholipid content occurs along with an increase of transcriptional activity of the cls gene coding for CL synthase. Furthermore, in vivo studies with E. coli derivatives carrying mutations in genes coding for enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis revealed that the increase in the anionic lipid composition enhances the expression rate of the kdpFABC operon. Finally, we show that kinase activity of KdpD is stimulated in its native membrane environment by fusion with liposomes of anionic, but reduced with liposomes of zwitterionic phospholipids...|$|R
40|$|Cecropins are a {{group of}} anti-bacterial, {{cationic}} peptides that have an amphipathic N-terminal segment, and a largely hydrophobic C-terminal segment and normally form a helix-hinge-helix structure, In this study, the ability of cecropin B (CB) and two analogs to lyse phospholipid bilayers, which have two levels of anionic content, has been examined by dye-leakage measurements over the pH range 2. 0 - 13. 0. The two analogs differ from the natural peptide by having either two amphipathic segments (CBI) or two hydrophobic segments (CB 3). All these peptides (except CB 3 on low anionic content bilayers where it is not active) have maximal lytic activity on both types of bilayers at high pH. However, the pattern of secondary structure formation on these bilayers by the peptides, as measured by circular dichroism (CD), and the pattern {{of their ability to}} bind lipid monolayers, as measured using a biosensor, do not directly correlate with the pattern of their lytic ability. CB and CB 1 with low anionic content bilayers have secondary structures as measured by CD with a similar pattern to membrane lysis, but binding is maximal near neutral, not high, pH. CB 3 has some secondary structures on low anionic content bilayers at low pH and this becomes maximal over the basic range, but CB 3 neither binds to nor lyses with these lipid layers, On <b>high</b> <b>anionic</b> content lipid layers, all peptides show high levels of secondary structures over most of the pH range and maximal binding at neutral pH (except for CB 3, which does not bind). All three peptides lyse with <b>high</b> <b>anionic</b> content bilayers, but show no activity at neutral pH and reach maximal activity at very high pH. This work shows that pH is {{a major factor in the}} capability of antibacterial peptides to lyse with liposomes and that secondary structure and binding ability may not be the main determinants.

Though all these factors contribute to the measured selectivity of this large channel, the observed selectivity inversion is mostly due to the following two. First, binding divalent cations compensates, or even slightly overcompensates, for the negative charge of the OmpF protein, which is known to be the main cause of cationic selectivity in sodium and potassium chloride solutions.

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated that both acid orange dyes lead to a common end product due to laccase treatment. Acid Orange 52 is demethylated by laccase and ultrasound treatment. Further results confirmed that the main effect of ultrasound is based on ˙OH attack on the dye molecules...|$|E
30|$|The G 2 and G 3 {{regions are}} {{separated}} by a long GAG-attachment region that is subdivided into three domains (Doege et al. [1991]). The KS-rich domain lies adjacent to the G 2 region. It is composed of repeats of six amino acids, with each repeat possessing a proline-serine sequence. Each serine residue can potentially act as the attachment site for O-linked oligosaccharides that form the linkage region for KS. The KS-rich domain {{is followed by the}} chondroitin sulfate (CS)-rich domain, which is divided into two subdomains (CS 1 and CS 2) that differ in amino acid sequence. The CS 1 domain is composed of repeats of nineteen amino acids, with each repeat possessing two serine-glycine sequences. Each serine residue in the repeats can potentially act as an attachment site for CS. The CS 2 domain also possesses serine-glycine sequences that can act as the attachment site for CS. Because of their differing amino acid sequences, the CS 1 and CS 2 domains have differing susceptibilities to proteolysis. A typical aggrecan molecule may contain up to 100 CS chains and a lower number of KS chains. The sulfated nature of the CS and KS provide the aggrecan with its <b>high</b> <b>anionic</b> charge.|$|E
40|$|Magna Floc LT 25 is a <b>high</b> {{molecular}} weight <b>anionic</b> polymer {{that has been}} described as increasing reaction rates inside flocs of yeast cells. However, no clear indication has been given on how this anionic polymer interacts with flocculent cells. Flocculation experiments made with a strain ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae corroborate that it bridges calcium ions bound to flocculent yeast cell walls, thus enlarging the available flux area for the transport of solutes inside the flocs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{substrate}} specificity {{of the rat}} mammary tissue <b>high</b> affinity, Na+-dependent <b>anionic</b> amino acid transport system has been investigated using explants and the perfused mammary gland. d-Aspartate appears to be transported via the high affinity, Na+-dependent l-glutamate carrier. Thus, d-aspartate transport by rat mammary tissue was Na+-dependent and saturable with respect to extracellular d-aspartate with a Km and Vmax of 32. 4 μM and 49. 0 nmol/ 2 min per g of cells respectively. The uptake of d-aspartate by mammary explants was cis-inhibited by l-glutamate and l-aspartate, but not by d-glutamate. l-glutamate uptake by mammary tissue explants was cis-inhibited by β-glutamate, l-cysteate, l-cysteine sulfinate and dihydrokainate but not by dl-α-aminoadipate. In addition, dihydrokainate, but not dl-α-aminoadipate inhibited d-aspartate and l-glutamate uptake by the perfused gland. d-Aspartate efflux from mammary tissue explants was trans-accelerated by external l-glutamate in a dose-dependent fashion (50 - 500 μM). The effect of l-glutamate on d-aspartate efflux was dependent {{on the presence of}} extracellular Na+. d-Aspartate, l-aspartate and l-cysteine sulfinate (at 500 μM) also markedly trans-stimulated d-aspartate efflux from mammary tissue explants. In contrast, l-cysteine, d-glutamate, l-leucine, dihydrokainate and dl-α-aminoadipate were either weak stimulators of d-aspartate efflux or were without effect. d-Aspartate efflux from the perfused mammary gland was trans-stimulated by l-glutamate but not by d-glutamate and only weakly by l-cysteine (all at 500 μM). It appears that the mammary tissue <b>high</b> affinity <b>anionic</b> amino acid carrier can operate in the exchange mode with a similar {{substrate specificity}} to that of the co-transport mode...|$|R
40|$|Polycationic ferritin, a {{multivalent}} ligand, {{was used}} as a visual probe to determine the distribution and density of anionic sites on the surfaces of rat liver mitochondrial membranes. Both the distribution of bound polycationic ferritin and the topography of the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane were studied in depth by utilizing thin sections and critical-point dried, whole mount preparations for transmission electron microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy. Based on its relative affinity for polycationic ferritin, the surface of the inner membrane contains discrete regions of high density and low density anionic sites. Whereas the surface of the cristal membrane contains a low density of anionic sites, the surface of the inner boundary membrane contains patches of <b>high</b> density <b>anionic</b> sites. The <b>high</b> density <b>anionic</b> sites on the inner boundary membrane were found to persist as stable patches and did not dissociate or randomize freely when the membrane was converted osmotically to a spherical configuration. The observations suggest that the inner mitochondrial membrane is composed of two major regions of anionic macromolecular distinction. It is well-known that an intermembrane space exists between the two membranes of the intact mitochondrion; however, a number of contact sites occur between the two membranes. We determined that the outer membrane, partially disrupted by treatment with digitonin, remains attached to the inner membrane at these contact sites as inverted vesicles. Such attached vesicles show that the inner surface of the outer membrane contains anionic sites, but of decreased density, surrounding the contact sites. Thus, the intermembrane space in the intact mitochondrion may be maintained by electronegative surfaces of the two mitochondrial membranes. The distribution of anionic sites on the outer surface of the outer membrane is random. The nature and function of fixed anionic surface charges and membrane contact sites are discussed with regard to recent reports relating to calcium transport, protein assembly into mitochondrial membranes, and membrane fluidity...|$|R
