However the location of the CoR can be difficult to estimate in vivo. Several methods have been developed over the last thirty years, using 3 D motion capture devices. Two main approaches are commonly used to localize the CoR of upper and lower limb joints: predictive <b>methods</b> and <b>functional</b> <b>methods.</b> <b>Functional</b> <b>methods,</b> which can be divided into spherefit methods and coordinate transformation (CT) methods, are reported to show better precision and repeatability than predictive approaches.

50|$|Building on his 1964 Rockefeller PhD thesis, in the 1960s and 1970s, Grossberg {{generalized}} the Additive and Shunting {{models to}} a class of dynamical systems that included these models as well as non-neural biological models, and proved content addressable memory theorems for this more general class of models. As part of this analysis, he introduced a Liapunov <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> to help classify the limiting and oscillatory dynamics of competitive systems by keeping track of which population is winning through time. This Liapunov method led him and Michael Cohen to discover in 1981 and publish in 1982 and 1983 a Liapunov function {{that they used to}} prove that global limits exist in a class of dynamical systems with symmetric interaction coefficients that includes the Additive and Shunting models. John Hopfield published this Liapunov function for the Additive model in 1984. Some scientists started to call Hopfield’s contribution the Hopfield model. In an attempt to correct this historical error, other scientists called the more general model and Liapunov function the Cohen-Grossberg model. Still other scientists call it the Cohen-Grossberg-Hopfield model. In 1987, Bart Kosko adapted the Cohen-Grossberg model and Liapunov function, which proved global convergence of STM, to define an Adaptive Bidirectional Associative Memory that combines STM and LTM and which also globally converges to a limit.|$|E

40|$|The <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> {{has become}} both the mantra and the bête noire of {{contemporary}} comparative law. The {{debate over the}} <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> {{is the focal point}} of almost all discussions about the field of comparative law as a whole, about centers and peripheries of scholarly projects and interests, about mainstream and avant-garde, about ethnocentrism and orientalism, about convergence and pluralism, about technocratic instrumentalism and cultural awareness, etc. Not surprisingly, this <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> is a chimera, both as theory and as practice of comparative law. In fact, “the functional method” is a trifold misnomer: There is not one (“the”) <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> but many, not all methods so called are functional at all, and some projects claiming adherence to it do not even follow any recognizable method. This paper first places the <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> in a historical and interdisciplinary context, in order to see its connections with, and peculiarities opposed to, the debates about functionalism in other disciplines. Second, it tries to use the functionalist method on the method itself, in order to determine how functional it is. This makes it necessary to place functionalism within a larger framework – not within the development of comparative law, but instead within {{the rise and fall of}} functionalism in other disciplines, especially the social sciences. Thirdly, the comparison with functionalism in other disciplines enables us to see what is special about functionalism in comparative law, and why what would in other disciplines rightly be regarded as methodological shortcomings may in fact be fruitful for comparative law. This analysis leads to surprising results. Generally, one assumes that the strength of the <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> lies in its emphasis on similarities, its aspirations towards evaluation and unification of law. Actually, the <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> emphasizes difference, it does not give us criteria for evaluation, and it provides powerful arguments against unification. Further, one generally assumes that the <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> does not account sufficiently for culture and is reductionist. However, the <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> not only requires us to look at culture, but also enables us, better than other methods, to formulate general laws without having to abstract from the specificities. The problem is that the <b>functional</b> <b>method,</b> as generally described, combines a number of different concepts of function: an evolutionary concept, a structural concept, a concept focusing on equivalence. The relation between these different concepts within the method is unclear, its aspirations therefore unrealistic. If we reconstruct the method plainly on the basis of functional equivalence as the most robust of the three concepts of function and emphasize an interpretative as opposed to a scientific approach, we realize that the <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> can make less claims, but at the same time is less open to some of the critique voiced against it. In short, the <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> is strong as a tool for understanding, comparing, and critiquing different laws, but a weak tool for evaluating and unifying laws.

40|$|The <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> is a {{new test}} theory using a new scoring method that assumes {{complexity}} in test structure, and thus takes into account every correlation between factors and items. The main specificity of the <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> is to model test scores by multiple regression instead of estimating them by using simplistic sums of points. In order to proceed, the <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> requires the creation of hyperspherical measurement space, in which item responses are expressed by their correlation with orthogonal factors. This method has three main qualities. First, measures are expressed in the absolute metric of correlations; therefore, items, scales and persons are expressed in the same measurement space using the same single metric. Second, factors are systematically orthogonal and without errors, which is optimal in order to predict other outcomes. Such predictions can be performed to estimate how one would answer to other tests, or even to model one’s response strategy if it was perfectly coherent. Third, the <b>functional</b> <b>method</b> provides measures of individuals’ response validity (i. e., control indices). Herein, we propose a standard procedure {{in order to identify}} whether test results are interpretable and to exclude invalid results caused by various response biases based on control indices...|$|E

This paper aims at evaluating the accuracy and the repeatability with which the glenohumeral joint rotation centre (GHRC) can be estimated in vivo by <b>functional</b> <b>methods.</b> The reference joint centre is the glenohumeral anatomical centre obtained by medical imaging. Five <b>functional</b> <b>methods</b> were tested: the algorithm of Gamage and Lasenby (2002), bias compensated (Halvorsen, 2003), symmetrical centre of rotation estimation (Ehrig et al., 2006), normalization method (Chang and Pollard, 2007), helical axis (Woltring et al., 1985). The glenohumeral anatomical centre (GHAC) was deduced from the fitting of the humeral head. Four subjects performed three cycles of three different movements (flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and circumduction). For each test, the location of the glenohumeral joint centre was estimated by the five methods. Analyses focused on the 3 D location, on the repeatability of location and on the accuracy by computing the Euclidian distance between the estimated GHRC and the GHAC. For all the methods, the error repeatability was inferior to 8. 25 mm.
