5|$|The Baths of Zeuxippus {{were popular}} public baths {{in the city}} of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire.

They were built around 500 yards south of the much older baths of Achilles of the earlier Greek Acropolis in Byzantion. The baths were famed primarily for the many statues that were built within, and the <b>famous</b> <b>people</b> they each represented.

5|$|After a {{tentative}} creation of several smaller suburban cemeteries, the Prefect Nicholas Frochot under Napoleon Bonaparte provided a more definitive solution {{in the creation}} of three massive Parisian cemeteries outside the city limits.

New suburban cemeteries were created in the early 20th century: The largest of these are the Cimetière parisien de Saint-Ouen, the Cimetière parisien de Pantin (also known as Cimetière parisien de Pantin-Bobigny), the Cimetière parisien d'Ivry, and the Cimetière parisien de Bagneux. Some of the most <b>famous</b> <b>people</b> in the world are buried in Parisian cemeteries.|$|E
5|$|Though Stowell's {{hypothesis}} was incorrect, his article rekindled {{interest in the}} Jack the Ripper case, and in 1973 the BBC launched a television series, Jack the Ripper, which investigated the Whitechapel murders.

5|$|In April 1930, Crowley {{moved to}} Berlin, {{where he took}} Hanni Jaegar as his magical partner; the {{relationship}} was troubled.
