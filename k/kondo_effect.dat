5|$|The Sommerfeld {{model and}} spin models for {{ferromagnetism}} illustrated the successful application {{of quantum mechanics}} to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of superconductivity and the <b>Kondo</b> <b>effect.</b> After World War II, several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of collective excitation modes of solids and the important notion of a quasiparticle. Russian physicist Lev Landau used {{the idea for the}} Fermi liquid theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles. Landau also developed a mean field theory for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. The theory also introduced the notion of an order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases. Eventually in 1965, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Schrieffer developed the so-called BCS theory of superconductivity, based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a Cooper pair.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} spin-orbit coupling on the <b>Kondo</b> <b>effects</b> in carbon nanotube quantum dots, using the numerical renormalization group technique. A sufficiently large spin-orbit coupling is shown to destroy the SU(4) <b>Kondo</b> <b>effects</b> at zero magnetic field, leaving only two SU(2) <b>Kondo</b> <b>effects</b> in the one- and three-electron Coulomb blockade valleys. On applying a finite magnetic field, two additional, spin-orbit induced SU(2) <b>Kondo</b> <b>effects</b> arise in the three- and two-electron valleys. Using physically realistic model parameters, we calculate the differential conductance over a range of gate voltages, temperatures and fields. The results agree well with measurements from two different experimental devices in the literature, and explain a number of observations that are not described within the standard framework of the SU(4) Anderson impurity model.

40|$|We {{study the}} spin-charge {{separation}} in a Kondo-like model for an impurity with a spin and a charge (isospin) {{degree of freedom}} coupled to a single conduction channel (the ``spin-charge'' Kondo model). We show that the spin and charge <b>Kondo</b> <b>effects</b> can occur simultaneously at any coupling strength. In the continuum (wide-band or weak coupling) limit, the Kondo screening in each sector is independent, while at finite bandwidth and strong coupling the lattice effects lead to a renormalization of the effective Kondo exchange constants; nevertheless, universal spin and charge <b>Kondo</b> <b>effects</b> still occur. We find similar behavior in the two-impurity Anderson model with positive and negative electron-electron interaction and in the two-impurity Anderson-Holstein model with a single phonon mode. We comment on the applicability of such models to describe the conductance of deformable molecules with a local magnetic moment. Comment: 13 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

40|$|While {{standard}} heavy fermion metals {{feature a}} single spin- 1 / 2 local moment per unit cell, more complicated systems with multiple distinct local moments have been synthesized as well, with Ce_ 3 Pd_ 20 (Si,Ge) _ 6 being one example. Here, {{we discuss the}} physics of a Kondo lattice model with two local-moment sublattices, coupled with different Kondo couplings to conduction electrons. The phase diagram will be strongly modified {{from that of the}} standard Kondo lattice if the characteristic screening temperatures of the distinct moments are well separated. Therefore, we investigate the interplay between the two <b>Kondo</b> <b>effects</b> using a local self-energy approximation via slave bosons. We find that the two <b>Kondo</b> <b>effects</b> can either compete or co-operate depending on the conduction-band filling. In the regime of competition, small differences in the two Kondo couplings can lead to huge differences in the respective Kondo scales, due to non-trivial many-body effects.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium <b>Kondo</b> <b>effects</b> in a single-level interacting quantum dot connected to two ferromagnetic leads. Within the non-crossing approximation, we calculate the total {{density of states}} (DOS), the linear conductance, and the nonlinear differential conductance for both the parallel and the anti-parallel alignments of the spin polarization orientation in the leads, followed by a brief discussion regarding the validity of this approach. Numerical calculations show that for the anti-parallel alignment, a single Kondo peak always appears in the equilibrium DOS, resulting in the conventional temperature behavior in the linear conductance and the zero-bias maximum in the differential conductance. The strength of the DOS peak is gradually suppressed with increasing polarization, {{due to the fact}} that formation of the Kondo-correlated state is more difficult in the presence of higher polarization. On the contrary, for the parallel configuration the Kondo peak in the DOS descends precipitately and splits into two peaks to form a very steep valley between them. This splitting contributes to the appearance of a "hump" in the temperature-dependent linear conductance and a nonzero-bias maximum in the differential conductance. Moreover, application of a bias voltage can split each Kondo peak into two in the nonequilibrium DOS for both configurations. Finally we point out that the tunnel magnetoresistance could be an effective tool to demonstrate the different <b>Kondo</b> <b>effects</b> in different spin configurations found here.

Scaling up such a platform, we find a hierarchy of non-Fermi Liquids and their tunable crossovers based on a renormalization group analysis. Utilizing results from a conformal field theory, we further examine the universal conductances of this strongly correlated system and their finite temperature scaling, which elucidate the sharp distinctions between charge and spin Kondo physics.

This is the simplest coupled quantum dot system to exhibit frustration. We study three different models of the triple quantum dot device: a mirror symmetric arrangement of dots in which only one dot {{is connected to the}} conduction band, a triple quantum dot system in which only one dot is connected to the conduction band without a plane of mirror symmetry and a mirror symmetric arrangement of quantum dots in which all three dots are coupled to the conduction band. We study these models over a wide range of parameter space, and in both the presence and absence of a magnetic field. Both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic <b>Kondo</b> <b>effects</b> are observed, and in all three models we find that the system contains at least two phases, and so a number of quantum phase transitions may be observed, associated in some cases with significant changes in the low temperature conductance through the triple quantum dot device. In addition to zero-field Kondo physics, a number of field induced <b>Kondo</b> <b>effects</b> are also observed. Both first order quantum phase transitions and Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transitions are observed. We use both symmetry arguments and low energy effective models which we derive to explain and understand both the position of and type of phase boundary that is observed in each case, and perturbative methods are used to accurately predict Kondo temperatures {{for a wide range of}} systems.
