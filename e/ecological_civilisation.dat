He then wrote his PhD, ("Science, Process Philosophy and the Image of Man: the metaphysical foundations for a critical social science"), at Murdoch University in which he formed his version of process metaphysics. On {{the basis of this}} he won a Postdoctoral Fulbright Fellowship to Boston University. Gare has taught at Murdoch University, University of Queensland, Curtin University and Swinburne University. In 2006 he was a Keynote Speaker to the 6th International Whitehead Conference at Salzburg University, Austria, delivering a paper entitled: [...] "Reviving the Radical Enlightenment". More recently he has aligned himself with Chinese environmentalists in the quest to create a global <b>ecological</b> <b>civilisation.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{more recent}} work Gare has {{published}} {{in the fields of}} narratology, hermeneutics, semiotics, complexity theory, theoretical biology, human ecology and philosophical anthropology, Schelling's philosophy, Chinese philosophy and Christopher Alexander's theories of architecture, and called for a revival of the Radical Enlightenment as the true heir of the Renaissance struggle for democracy and for the creation of an <b>ecological</b> <b>civilisation</b> as a new world order based on a new relationship between humanity and nature. More specifically, he has been concerned to develop more adequate theoretical foundations for human ecology and ecological economics to provide an alternative to neo-classical economics as the core discipline for formulating public policy, and has been developing a form of retrospective path analysis as an alternative to cost-benefit analysis as a framework for formulating such policy.|$|E
40|$|This book is for {{the general}} reader {{interested}} in the human place in nature {{and the future of}} civilisation. It is based on the biohistorical approach to the study of human situations. This approach recognises human culture as a new and extremely important force in the biosphere. The book discusses the evolution of life and the essential ecological processes on which all life, including human civilisation, depend. It describes the conditions of life and ecology of humans in the four ecological phases in human history, with emphasis on the impacts of human culture on biological systems. It explains how, as cultures evolved, they often came to embrace not only factual information of good practical value, but also assumptions that are sheer nonsense, sometimes leading to activities that caused unnecessary human distress or damage to local ecosystems. These are examples of cultural maladaptation. There have been countless instances of cultural maladaptation in human history. The days of the fourth ecological phase of human history, the Exponential Phase, are numbered. Cultural maladaptations are now on a massive scale, and business as usual will inevitably lead to the <b>ecological</b> collapse of <b>civilisation.</b> The only hope for the survival of civilisation lies in radical changes in the worldviews and priorities of the prevailing cultures of the world, leading to a fifth ecological phase — a phase in which human society is truly sensitive to, in tune with and respectful of the processes of life. This is called a biosensitive society. The book concludes with discussion on the essential characteristics of a biosensitive society and on the means by which the necessary cultural transformation might come about...|$|R

40|$|A {{crisis of}} {{knowledge}} and understanding, stretching back for centuries, has crippled our {{ability to respond to}} the current ecological crisis. However, the triadic semiosis of CS Peirce, cast as a common language of nature, supports the development of shared, multi-voiced narratives that engage our emotions and imagination. These narratives develop into new habits, and the cultivation of personal and societal qualities lead to transformative actions that reflect our reconnection with the rest of nature. An <b>ecological</b> <b>civilisation</b> follows naturally from our feelings of reconnection...|$|E
40|$|While {{identifying}} the emerging features of China’s {{economy as a}} growth economy, this article argues that the real ecological threat is the increasing dependence of Chinese economy and society upon economic growth, and that building a socialist <b>ecological</b> <b>civilisation</b> might constitute a greener and more fruitful political ecology to restrain or reverse this tendency. As a main conclusion, China stands at a crucial crossroad: not very much {{in terms of the}} stages of its economic growth, but whether or not it can move forward to a green future...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{regulation}} and its corresponding measures and control {{is an important}} issue but have not been fully investigated. Literature on the unintended consequences of regulation control and measures appears to be sparse. Through a series of exploratory case studies in China, this paper examines the various unintended impacts of <b>ecological</b> <b>civilisation</b> (EC) regulation on firms’ operations and their related consequences to performance. Findings showed that there were interrelated themes that underpin the indirect and unintended effects of regulatory control and performance management. This exploratory study can contribute to both theory building and provide important EC policy implications by: (a) enriching the conceptual understanding of the unintended consequences of environmental regulation on firms’ behaviours and outcomes, (b) providing policy maker important insights and practical advices for regulating environmental performance...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} an overlooked {{perspective on}} Chinese foreign policy, that of interest groups. I use environmental foreign relations as a vantage point {{to examine how}} domestic interest groups exert influence on China’s environmental foreign relations. The proposed theoretical framework, constructivist utilitarianism, provides {{a bridge between the}} constructivist school and rationalistic institutionalism in the IR debate to explain the discursive turn of the Chinese government in global environmental governance. The discursive turn refers to the changing attitudes towards environmental governance based on learning, shared experiences, and offering an alternative norm to replace liberal environmentalism. The interest groups under scrutiny are line ministries, state-owned enterprises, environmental non-governmental organisations, local governors, and intellectuals. They each represent a distinct interest, and demonstrate different pathways for influencing foreign relations. The focus on domestic players supplements the traditional focus on international systemic factors to explain the behaviour of China on the global stage and in bilateral relations. The empirical chapters are organised according to three dimensions: international environmental treaty implementation, sharing the Chinese experience, and offering an alternative environmental norm. Each chapter focuses on one factor, in the following order: environmental diplomacy, the Chinese experience, and <b>ecological</b> <b>civilisation.</b> These three dimensions reflect the trend of the discursive turn, which is closely linked to China’s desire to establish a good national image. My findings show that interest groups in China utilise the strategic concepts of environmental diplomacy and the Chinese experience to maximise their interests. The emergence of the discourse of <b>ecological</b> <b>civilisation</b> creates space for different groups to jump onto the bandwagon by interpreting the concept in favour of their interests. In this process, identity politics becomes a mechanism by which to aggregate and rank domestic preferences {{in such a way that}} economic interests outweigh environmental ones at the state level. This thesis calls for more future research to examine other foreign relations issues through the lens of interest groups, to better comprehend the complex dynamics of China’s role in the world...|$|E
30|$|At {{the same}} time, planted forests {{play a key}} role in {{ecological}} improvement by enhancing environmental services of biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and hydrological regulation greatly contributing to the China's strategic goals of ecological restoration, ecological security and <b>ecological</b> <b>civilisation</b> (SFA, 2009). The monetary value of the major forest ecosystem services such as water conservation, soil conservation, carbon sequestration and oxygen release, nutrient accumulation, atmosphere environment purification, and biodiversity conservation, was estimated to be about 10.01 trillion CNY/year (approximately 1.48 trillion US$/year) and is equivalent to one third of China's annual gross domestic product (GDP) (Niu et al, 2012). Of these, carbon (C) sequestration by planted forest is the most important service with about 0.3 Pg C having been sequestrated by planted forests in China since the mid- 1970 s. The rapidly increasing C stock (and C density) in China's planted forests has been a major contribution to the increase in the global forest C sink over the period (Fang et al., 2001; Piao et al., 2009; Pan et al., 2011). Since most of these planted forests are still very young and have not always benefited from the greatly increased public investment in forest technology and management in China, it is reasonable to assume that the full potential of planted forests in China to accumulate additional biomass in living trees and in forest soils has not yet been achieved (Fang et al., 2007).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} that the contingencies {{in place in}} China around sustainability are unique for a major emerging economy. Chinese actors in the sustainability network are dominated by government, not corporations, and the links to ancient Chinese philosophy, whilst not immediately apparent, do persist. Furthermore, China is the first major economic power to commit to a new developmental direction, to become an ecological civilization. To study this situation, this paper focuses on providing both theoretical insight and empirical findings {{to answer the question}} – “Can China move to new accountability for sustainability based on ecological civilization?” Much of the existing research on Chinese responses to accountability for sustainability has been based on corporate responses. Because of the high profile of the authoritarian Chinese government, this study extends this analysis to political regions which are based on Chinese provinces and provincial environmental protection agencies. Foucault’s insights into episteme change are used to understand sustainability accountability in the Chinese context and to represent findings in a new development model. This model is explained with regard to a transition from the Modern to an emerging episteme represented by the <b>ecological</b> <b>civilisation</b> concept now adopted by the Chinese government. Documentary analysis is used to provide key themes and evidence. The findings are that China does have a unique opportunity to change from the existing industrial Modern civilization to an ecological civilization and that existing accountability for sustainability evidence demonstrates that this change is already taking place...|$|E
40|$|The anthropocene is the {{age where}} human {{influences}} are determining {{the development of the}} planet’s ecosystems and thus the bio-physical basis of future human civilisations. Today China has become the world’s largest economy and its worst polluter with per capita greenhouse gas emissions surpassing the EU average, the world’s largest consumer of all kinds of resources. Even regarding the aggregate contribution to climate change (historical emission residues included), called the climate debt, China has not yet, but will be most probably climbing the top position rather soon. At the same time China is the world’s largest victim of environmental change, including air and soil pollution, water and land scarcity, biodiversity loss and climate change. Thus not only slowing down the increase but reducing emissions should be a top priority for China, and it is: the government has taken some bold steps. China is the world’s largest investor in renewable energies, has the largest afforestation program, and leads the world in reducing carbon dioxide emission reduction. As the largest polluter it has extraordinary opportunities to improve the global state of the environment – is it the world’s last best hope for establishing a global <b>ecological</b> <b>civilisation?</b> Some implications regarding the Chinese environmental policy are discussed, some strengths highlighted and some weaknesses identified. However, despite their magnitude, the efforts–and in particular their implementation–are not yet sufficient. We suggest three additional steps which could help China to begin reducing its climate debt within a couple of decades, define a long term perspective for policy planning and adjust its growth model to the challenges of the anthropocene...|$|E
