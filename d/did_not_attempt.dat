5|$|Other 19th century {{experiments}} were purported {{to show that}} frogs <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to escape gradually heated water.

Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals.

He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E

Queen's Park would ultimately become the only Scottish club to reach the final of the FA Cup, although they returned the following year where they again faced Blackburn Rovers.|$|E

5|$|The British <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to {{take the}} fort again. Within days of the battle, Charlestonians learned of {{the signing of the}} Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. The British troops were reembarked on their transports, and on July 21 the British fleet withdrew northward to help the main British army in its {{campaign}} against New York City. To add insult to injury, one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by Patriot forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, the Dutch commandeered all Chinese houses, {{including that}} of Anko. When working weapons and ammunition were found in his home, Anko stated that they were remnants from an earlier war in 1718. Not believing Anko, the Dutch arrested him and Yanko, then had them chained and decapitated; Visscher then ordered the execution of all ethnic Chinese. On 14 June, Visscher ordered the Chinese quarters outside the fortress to be razed to the ground. Despite Chinese numerical superiority, they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> a final attack.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} was a British success, {{and resulted in}} {{the withdrawal of the}} Continental Army to Harlem Heights, ceding control of New York City on {{the lower half of the}} island. However, General Washington established strong positions on Harlem Heights which he proved determined to defend in a fierce skirmish between the two armies the following day. General Howe, unwilling to risk a costly frontal attack, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to advance further up the island for another two months.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{fighting}} in Papua, most of the Australian personnel captured by Japanese troops were murdered. In response, {{for the remainder of}} the war Australian soldiers generally <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to capture Japanese personnel and aggressively sought to kill their Japanese opponents including some that had surrendered. Following the defeats in Papua and Guadalcanal the Japanese withdrew to a defensive perimeter in the Territory of New Guinea. Meanwhile, during {{the fighting}} in 1942–43 the Australian Army increasingly developed a tactical superiority over the Japanese in jungle warfare.|$|E

They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, but he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> a landing. The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and {{it was difficult to}} take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E

5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh {{returned}} to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to reattach it as too much time had passed.|$|E
5|$|As freshmen {{struggled}} with the Athenian curriculum, he reverted to classification by academic discipline and offered companion texts {{in the field of}} the current work studied.

Meiklejohn saw this as desirable and indicative of abetting nonconformity, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>attempt</b> to curb it. Meiklejohn had full reign over the college, so the university and its disciplinary proceedings could not intervene. Upon their exit two years later, students transferred to a number of Ivy League and prominent state universities. By this time, the college was known throughout the nation and Europe.|$|E

In January 1806, Johnson's premises were wracked by a second fire, destroying the building and all of his stock.|$|E
