While declining to discuss the ban on Access Hollywood, during the filming of an episode <b>for</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> on the D-List with former View co-host/moderator Rosie O'Donnell, Griffin did talk about the ban, specifically targeting View executive producer Bill Geddie. Griffin had also been mentioned as a possible replacement for Walters when she departed the show. As of August 2009, Griffin had been un-banned from The View and was a guest on September 18, 2009, and June 15, 2010. However, {{in an interview on}} The Talk, Griffin has stated she has been re-banned from The View, due to an argument with View co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck. Griffin has since been unbanned once again and has appeared several times on the show, including as a guest co-host.|$|E

25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> I worked with every gram of energy and by the time we finished I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E

500|$|Pacers coach Rick Carlisle {{said after}} the game, [...] "I felt like I was {{fighting}} <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> out there." [...] One reporter who attempted to stop Tinsley from entering the stands recalled that the player [...] "went through me like I was butter", and then NBA Commissioner David Stern, watching the game on TV, recalled that he said, [...] "Holy [...]" [...] (O'Neal later said, [...] "As bad as it looked on TV, {{it was at least}} 20 times worse in person.") Pacers assistant coach Chuck Person compared the situation to being [...] "trapped in a gladiator-type scene where the fans were the lions and we were just trying to escape with our lives. That's how it felt. That there was no exit. That you had to fight your way out." [...] Players' children and others in the audience cried from fear and shock. Derrick Coleman stood near Brown and Brown's ball boy son to protect them. The remaining seconds of the game were called off and the Pacers were awarded the 97–82 win. Fans booed the Indiana players as they were escorted from the court by officials and security, and continued to throw beverages and other objects (including a folding chair that nearly hit O'Neal) at them as they walked under the tunnel to the locker room. No players from either team spoke to the media before leaving the arena. Eventually, police officers were able to swarm the arena, threatening to handcuff those who wouldn't leave. Nine spectators were injured, and two were taken to the hospital.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Paulina Palmer {{asserts that}} Waters, in Tipping the Velvet {{and her two}} {{following}} novels also set in the Victorian era—Affinity and Fingersmith—is establishing a literary tradition that has not existed: [...] "Women engaging in same-sex relationships in the Victorian era were on the whole invisible and we have little knowledge of their literary interests." [...] Waters, however, acknowledges that accuracy about lesbian life in the Victorian era is not her primary goal: [...] "My purpose {{was not to be}} authentic, but to imagine a history that we can’t really recover." [...] Short bursts of lesbian-themed literary activity occurred in 1920s with authors such as Natalie Clifford Barney and Djuna Barnes. Another surge of activity published as lesbian pulp fiction occurred in the 1950s and early 1960s, during which several notable lesbian authors such as Ann Bannon and Valerie Taylor helped to establish lesbian literary identity. These fictions helped to inform readers about the lives and cultural landmarks of lesbians when very little information existed. Waters states that she is not on a deliberate crusade to write about lesbians, but that it is a reflection of what she knows: [...] "Lesbianism {{is at the top of}} the agenda for my books because it's at the top of the agenda <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> It would be bizarre not to write about it." [...] In 2009, as she reflected on her reasons for writing Tipping the Velvet and Fingersmith, Waters said she was searching for her own identity as a lesbian writer.|$|E

[...] Flea felt the public school system was seriously lacking in exposing children to music by drastically reducing, and sometimes eliminating, art-related programs.|$|E

[...] And Collins called Tilden [...] "perhaps the greatest player of them all." [...] In an August 2006 article for MSNBC, Collins ranked Laver as one of the five top men's tennis stars of all time, along with Tilden, Gonzales, Borg, and Sampras. He pointed to Tilden's [...] "phenomenal [...]938 winning percentage", said [...] "If I had to choose someone to play <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> it would be Pancho Gonzalez", praised Borg's uncanny transition from the French Open to Wimbledon, cited Sampras's [...] "assault on the citadels of the past", and called Laver [...] "in my eyes, the greatest player ever".|$|E
2500|$|Supergrass {{followed}} I Should Coco with 18 {{months of}} heavy touring, appearing at festivals such as Scotland's T In The Park and the Glastonbury Festival.

[...] A photograph of Ronnie Biggs and Gaz together was subsequently included in the music video for their 1996 single [...] "Going Out". Recorded at Great Linford Manor the single peaked at number five in the UK charts, but was the last song produced by Sam Williams. Supergrass returned to Sawmills Studio to co-produce follow up album, In It For The Money (released April 1997), with John Cornfield. The album was a huge success and went platinum in the UK, but confused some fans expecting something similar to [...] I Should Coco. The single, [...] "Richard III", reached number two. Subsequent releases, [...] "Sun Hits the Sky" [...] and [...] "Late In The Day", reached numbers 10 and 18 respectively.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{missing the}} songs/instrumentals split that characterised Low and [...] "Heroes", Lodger has been {{interpreted}} as dividing roughly into two major themes, that of travel (primarily side one) and critiques of Western civilisation (primarily side two).

[...] "African Night Flight" [...] was {{a tribute to the}} music and culture of the veld, inspired by a trip to Kenya that he took with his then-small son Zowie; its musical textures have been cited as presaging the popularity of world music, Bowie considering it a forerunner of the sounds developed by Brian Eno and David Byrne <b>for</b> <b>My</b> <b>Life</b> in the Bush of Ghosts (1981). [...] "Move On" [...] was lyrically Bowie's ode to his own wanderlust, sonically his earlier classic [...] "All the Young Dudes" [...] played backwards. [...] "Yassassin" [...] was an unlikely reggae song with a Turkish flavour. [...] "Red Sails" [...] was inspired in part by the music of German band Neu!, sharing Neu!'s distinctive [...] "motorik" [...] drum beat; for Bowie, it combined [...] "a German new music feel" [...] with [...] "a contemporary English mercenary-cum-swashbuckling Errol Flynn" [...] to produce [...] "a lovely cross-reference of cultures".|$|E

2500|$|Thoreau {{never married}} and was childless. He strove to portray {{himself as an}} ascetic puritan. However, his {{sexuality}} {{has long been the}} subject of speculation, including by his contemporaries. Critics have called him heterosexual, homosexual, or asexual. There is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone, man or woman. Some scholars have suggested that homoerotic sentiments run through his writings and concluded that he was homosexual. The elegy Sympathy was inspired by the eleven-year-old Edmund Sewell, with whom he hiked for five days in 1839. One scholar has suggested that he wrote the poem to Edmund because he could not bring himself to write it to Edmund's sister, and another that Thoreau's [...] "emotional experiences with women are memorialized under a camouflage of masculine pronouns", but other scholars dismiss this. It has been argued that the long paean in Walden to the French-Canadian woodchopper Alek Therien, which includes allusions to Achilles and Patroclus, is an expression of conflicted desire. In some of Thoreau's writing there is the sense of a secret self. In 1840 he writes in his journal: [...] "My friend is the apology <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> In him are the spaces which my orbit traverses". Thoreau was strongly influenced by the moral reformers of his time, and this may have instilled anxiety and guilt over sexual desire.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{fight that}} would be called [...] "The Dance in Detroit", both Severn and Shamrock circled each other with little to no contact for a {{combined}} total of almost thirty minutes. [...] "I took {{the center of the}} ring understanding that I was going to be fighting <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and Dan never came at me," [...] Shamrock said. Severn later said that his strategy was to purposely not engage with Shamrock and wait for the fans to boo, hoping that the booing would affect Shamrock psychologically and force him to make a mistake that Severn could capitalize on. Finally, after over 15 minutes of stalling, Severn shot for a takedown, but was unsuccessful and following a brief scramble, Shamrock put Severn on his back in full mount. Shamrock held the mount for close to five minutes, throwing open fist palm strikes to Severn's head and an occasional closed fist punch to the body. Shamrock felt as though he would have damaged Severn badly and perhaps finished him from this position of full mount if he was allowed to punch Severn in the face with a closed fist. Severn eventually gave his back in an attempt to get out and the risk paid off as Shamrock slid off Severn's back and onto his back in full guard. Severn landed a headbutt to open a cut above Shamrock's eye and followed with elbow strikes and punches from Shamrock's guard. Shamrock eventually got back to his feet and after six more minutes stalling, the fight went to a judges decision. The judges gave a split decision win to Dan Severn, which upset Shamrock because he felt as though Severn had broken the rules by utilizing the banned closed fist punches to the head and headbutts. Chants of [...] "boring!" [...] and [...] "Let's go Red Wings!" [...] were echoed throughout the arena during the fight. Shamrock later stated that going through with this fight was the biggest regret of his fighting career.|$|E
