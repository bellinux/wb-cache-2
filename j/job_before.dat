5|$|The average SPAR {{officer was}} 29 years old, single, a college graduate, and had worked {{seven years in}} a {{professional}} or managerial position (in education or government) before entering the service. The average enlisted SPAR was 24 years old, single, a high school graduate, and had worked for over {{three years in a}} clerical or sales <b>job</b> <b>before</b> joining the service. The likelihood was that she came from the state of Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, or California. The reasons for becoming a SPAR differed, but most likely it was patriotism, self-advancement, desire for travel and adventure, or the loss of a loved one in the war.|$|E
5|$|Confident that he {{was being}} {{targeted}} by clubs from higher divisions, Bruce resolved not to sign a new contract with Gillingham when his existing deal expired {{at the end of the}} 1983–84 season. In an April 1983 match against Newport County, he attempted, in a moment of anger, to deliberately injure opposition player Tommy Tynan, but connected awkwardly and succeeded only in breaking his own leg, leaving him unable to play again for six months. He returned in time to play a key role in Gillingham achieving two draws against Everton in the FA Cup in 1984, attracting the attention once again of scouts from First Division clubs. Arthur Cox, manager of Bruce's beloved Newcastle United, expressed an interest in signing the player, but resigned from his <b>job</b> <b>before</b> any further action could be taken. Bruce eventually opted to sign for Norwich City in August 1984 for a fee variously reported as £125,000 or £135,000. In 2009, he was voted into Gillingham's Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Pandro Berman—who {{had filled}} in on three {{previous}} occasions—accepted {{the position of}} production chief on a noninterim basis. As it turned out, he would leave the <b>job</b> <b>before</b> the decade's turn, but his brief tenure resulted {{in some of the}} most notable films in studio history, including Gunga Din, with Grant and McLaglen; Love Affair, starring Dunne and Charles Boyer; and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (all 1939). Charles Laughton, who gave a now fabled performance as Quasimodo in the latter, returned periodically to the studio, headlining six more RKO features. For Maureen O'Hara, who made her American screen debut in the film, it was the first of ten pictures she would make for RKO through 1952. After co-starring with Ginger Rogers for the ninth time in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939), Fred Astaire departed the studio.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of the Clinton Laboratories passed from Monsanto to the University of Chicago in May 1947, and then to Union Carbide in December 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended that all work on reactors be concentrated at the Argonne National Laboratory, the successor to the Metallurgical Laboratory, near Chicago. There was also competition for staff and resources from the newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory near New York. Morale was low, {{and no one could}} be found to take on the job of Director of Research at the laboratory, renamed the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in January 1948. At least six people turned down the <b>job</b> <b>before</b> Union Carbide's acting Director, Nelson (Bunny) Rucker, asked Weinberg to become Director of Research in March 1948.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} Nanking had not {{led to the}} {{surrender}} of the Nationalist Government as Matsui had predicted and the war with China continued. Undeterred, Matsui began planning out new military operations in places like Xuzhou and Zhejiang Province soon after he had returned to Shanghai. The other big task occupying his time in January and February 1938 was his plan {{to establish a new}} Chinese government in Central China. Matsui was bound and determined to press forward with his ambition to found a new regime to rival Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government, and though he did not finish the <b>job</b> <b>before</b> leaving office, the Reformed Government of the Republic of China would eventually come into being in March 1938. However, the leaders of Japan's Army General Staff showed scant interest in his plan to create a new government in China and they also repeatedly refused to approve any new military campaigns under his command. By the beginning of February Matsui was contemplating suicide to protest their lack of enthusiasm.|$|E

His teams saw little success, and there was an uproar as he earned more than any faculty member. Rice University was his last coaching <b>job</b> <b>before</b> he retired in 1926 to lead the New York Downtown Athletic Club.|$|E
25|$|Following the engagement, Diana {{left her}} {{occupation}} as a kindergarten teacher and {{lived for a}} short period at Clarence House, which was the home of the Queen Mother.

She made her first public appearance with Prince Charles in a charity ball in March 1981 at Goldsmiths' Hall, where she met the Princess of Monaco.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{establishment}} of a Romanian communist regime, Rosetti lived in isolation. Largely forgotten by the public, he inhabited a garret in Bucharest, where he kept an urn destined for his ashes, leaving only the date of his death to be completed by the engraver. In the 1950s, he was frequenting the literary parties held at Ion Larian Postolache's home, on Dobroteasa Street, alongside former rival Crevedia, Virgil Carianopol, Ion Buzdugan, and Crevedia's son Eugen Barbu. His daughter by Bacaloglu was also living in Bucharest, and had a government <b>job</b> <b>before</b> being sacked. Rosetti finally died in 1964 and, according to his wish, was cremated. His urn was deposed in Lucreția's tomb at Bellu.|$|E

25|$|The {{county board}} called an {{emergency}} {{meeting to discuss}} {{the recommendations of the}} arbitration and especially the recommendation from Mulvey that Holland should resign. By 16 February, uncertainty had emerged over the status of the strike. While the county board and Holland met to discuss the issues, an expected vote by the county board to remove Holland was never called. Holland meanwhile issued a statement that didn't indicate if he had stepped down and stated that he was neutral saying: I am my own man and I am proud to be a Cork football man. Holland said the claim that six people had refused the <b>job</b> <b>before</b> him was false and there was no threat of strike when he took the job. However, a statement in support of the strike had been issued by the Gaelic Players Association on 13 November 2007, a week before Holland took the job.|$|E
25|$|Branyan {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with the Seattle Mariners on December 3, 2008. The Mariners gave him the starting first base <b>job</b> <b>before</b> spring training. At {{the end of the}} 2009 season, Branyan was the team leader in home runs. Branyan stated {{one of the keys to}} his success with the Mariners was a vision training program with Chicago ophthalmologist Dr. Barry Seiller. The exercises strengthen eye muscles and improve focus at the plate. The program is one like designated hitter Edgar Martínez used when he played for the Mariners. In Branyan's first at-bat of the game on August 7, he hit a home run. This was his 25th home run on the year, but it also set a new career high. The previous, 24, was achieved during the 2002 season. He has also set career records in RBIs, doubles, hits, runs and total bases in the 2009 season.|$|E
25|$|The action {{takes place}} in Jerome's very untidy and {{neglected}} flat. Before the play begins, Jerome has arranged a meeting with wife Corinna and Mervyn Bickerdyke from the Department of Child Wellbeing, {{to convince them that}} it will be appropriate for Geain to stay with him for long visits. Geain is also due to come to the meeting. To help to convince them, Jerome plans to hire an actress, Zoe Mill, from an escort agency, to pose as his fiancée. The first act takes place one week before the meeting as he interviews Zoe for the <b>job.</b> <b>Before</b> she arrives, Jerome activates his NAN 300F – a female android (or gynoid) whom he calls Nan. He treats Nan, who was originally designed to look after children, almost like a pet. Much of the play's humour originates from her idiosyncrasies as she collides with the furniture, blurts out unexpected remarks, and performs her tasks incompetently – such as serving a drink with the tumbler upside down.|$|E

25|$|Not {{long after}} Holland {{received}} his extension, Craig Leipold, {{owner of the}} Minnesota Wild, and Jeffrey Vinik, the then-new owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning, sought to hire Yzerman as general manager. After turning down the Minnesota <b>job</b> <b>before</b> the 2009–10 season concluded, Yzerman accepted the Lightning job and was named the team's new vice-president and general manager on May 25, 2010. In the off-season, and early in his new reign, he re-signed Martin St. Louis; signed defenceman Pavel Kubina for his second tenure with the team; signed Free Agent goaltender Dan Ellis to a two-year contract; signed defenceman Brett Clark; and brought in left-winger Simon Gagné in a trade that saw Matt Walker and a fourth-round pick in 2011 depart Tampa Bay. In {{the middle of the}} season, he also traded for goaltender Dwayne Roloson as the Lightning progressed to the Eastern Conference Finals just one year after the team had not even qualified for the 2010 playoffs. For his part, Yzerman was nominated for the NHL General Manager of the Year Award, losing out to Vancouver's Mike Gillis.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Theophilus Akunna Wallace-Johnson (1894 – 10 May 1965) was a Sierra Leonean and British West African workers' leader, journalist, {{activist and}} politician. Born into a poor krio family in Sierra Leone, he {{emerged as a}} natural leader in school. After {{attending}} United Methodist Collegiate School for two years, he dropped out and {{took a job as}} an officer in the customs department in 1913. He was dismissed for helping organize a labour strike, but later reinstated to his position a year later. After resigning from his job, he enlisted as a clerk with the Carrier Corps during World War I. After being demobilised in 1920, Wallace-Johnson moved from job to <b>job,</b> <b>before</b> settling as a clerk in the Freetown municipal government. He claimed to have exposed a corruption scandal, which resulted in the incarceration of top officials, including the mayor. After being fired from this job in 1926, he left Sierra Leone and became a sailor. He joined a national seamen union and it is believed that he also joined the Communist Party. In 1930, he helped form the first trade union in Nigeria and attended the International Trade Union Conference of Negro Workers in Hamburg, where he established a number of contacts. He published articles and edited the Negro Worker, a journal devoted to uniting black workers around the world. He travelled to Moscow, where he claimed to have attended classes on Marxism-Leninism theory, union organisation and political agitation.|$|E
25|$|After Ultra {{purchased}} the Mattei Motorsports No. 7 Nations Rent-sponsored Cup team, Wallace was announced {{as the driver}} for 2001. Despite starting off {{the season with a}} sixth-place finish at the Daytona 500, the team struggled in qualifying, almost costing Wallace his <b>job</b> <b>before</b> he posted two consecutive top tens finishes. During that time, he began running with a new Busch Series team, Biagi Brothers Racing, running their No. 4 Geico-sponsored Chevy. His best finish of eight starts was a tenth at Richmond International Raceway. Late in the season, Wallace was granted his release from Ultra, and joined Penske-Kranefuss Racing, driving the No. 12 Mobil 1-sponsored Ford Taurus as a teammate to his brother Rusty. At Phoenix, he led forty-five laps late in the race before giving the lead up to Jeff Burton, finishing a career-best second place. Unfortunately, Penske decided not to keep the 12 team going, forcing Wallace out of a ride (Penske did keep the number 12 for Ryan Newman's team the following year, replacing the 02 Newman had used in a few races in 2001). He began the season driving for Andy Petree for a pair of races, before financial problems caused that team to cease operations. He returned to run with Biagi for seventeen races in the Busch Series, posting two consecutive fourteenth-place finishes. Wallace also returned to the Truck series driving the Federated Auto Parts truck for Schrader, posting two top-tens. Mid-season, he signed onto the No. 14 Conseco-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix for A. J. Foyt Racing, his best finish a tenth at Bristol.|$|E
