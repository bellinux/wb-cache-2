25|$|In 2008, Metaxa {{launched}} a special Reserve, the METAXA AEN, celebrating 120 {{years of the}} brand. For this occasion, {{and for the first}} time in Metaxa's long history, 1888 crystal <b>decanters</b> were filled solely with the liquid of Cask No.1 of the Metaxa cellars. Metaxa AEN is the oldest product ever to be released by Metaxa with blends of over 80 years old. Packaged in Crystal de Sevres <b>decanters</b> with a gold painted stopper, the retail prices easily exceeded the $1,000 benchmark as only 1888 <b>decanters</b> of AEN METAXA had been available worldwide.|$|E

50|$|In 1953 Flottweg {{expanded}} its {{into a business}} sector: the production of liquid-solid separation machines. The first product was the Flottweg <b>Decanter,</b> a solid bowl <b>decanter</b> centrifuge; the first model, <b>DECANTER</b> Z1, was sold to BASF. Further development lead to a higher speed and more efficient <b>decanter</b> in 1964. In 1966 an adjustable impeller for <b>decanter</b> was added, which allowed the operator to optimise the pond depth while the <b>decanter</b> was operating; this was useful in the extraction of olive oil. After further development, Flottweg sold a 3-phase <b>decanter</b> for olive oil in Spain in 1971. In 1977 Flottweg began to manufacture belt filter presses.|$|R

25|$|Reality in this Albee play is {{something}} that most of its characters try to escape. The most obvious escape route is through alcohol. Its presence is so entwined in the dialogue that it becomes almost a character itself. Every scene revolves around the bar and <b>decanters</b> of brandy, cognac, anisette, and gin. Claire is alcohol’s most wounded victim, but she is also the one who, although she has the most trouble dealing with reality, sees reality the clearest. Tobias is not as ruled by alcohol but uses it to calm himself enough to maintain his patience and usual silence.|$|E
25|$|Glassware {{was also}} {{replenished}} at this time. Mrs. Lincoln ordered 24 plain cut goblets (probably for family dining) in November 1864 and January 1865 from the D.C. firm of Webb & Beveridge. The cost was just $30. On January 30, 1865, she also ordered glassware to replace broken and stolen glassware for public events from John Kerr's China Hall, {{at a cost}} of $612.50. This service included four dozen each of goblets, champagne glasses, claret glasses, burgundy glasses, madeira glasses, sherry glasses, hock glasses, and cordial glasses. The bases appear to have been plain (unlike the 1861 order), except for the madeira glasses—which were more richly carved and featured the rays on the foot. The hock glasses were ruby (not green) in color, and the madeira glasses may also have been red colored. She ordered another four <b>decanters</b> on March 25.|$|E

25|$|Old Ebbitt Grill was {{purchased}} on June 16, 1970, at a tax sale by the Stuart Davidson and John Laytham, co-owners {{of the restaurant}} Clyde's of Georgetown. Clyde's was founded in 1963 by Davidson (then an investment banker) after new legislation made it legal to consume liquor to patrons standing at bars. (Since 1917, liquor could be consumed only while sitting at tables.) Davidson and Laytham bid in the tax sale hoping to buy beer steins and the mahogany bar, but {{ended up with the}} entire restaurant. The IRS offered the entire restaurant for sale after an auction of individual items failed to raise more than $6,639. The sale price was $11,250. Among the items they purchased were a 200-year-old clock (which used carved wooden gears for its mechanism), a carved wooden grizzly bear once owned by Alexander Hamilton, crystal <b>decanters</b> dating to 1575, and stuffed boar's head, swordfish, alligator, and walrus head.|$|E
25|$|Metaxa {{comes in}} nine major varieties: Three Stars, Five Stars, Five Stars Honey Shot, Seven Stars, Twelve stars, Grande Fine, Private Reserve, Angels Treasure and AEN. The number of stars {{represents}} {{the number of}} years the blend is matured. The three and 5 star are not as different, but the 5 star is notably drier, making the alcohol more pronounced. The seven and twelve star are more flavoursome and complex, while the Twelve-star G.O.R. is again more dry, in this case because there is no addition of wine. In either of the two latter varieties, the smell and taste of the barrel in which the brandy matured is noticeable. The house of Metaxa has recently launched a new product, the Metaxa Twelve Star containing distillates matured for 12 years adding Muscat wine from the island of Samos, unlike the Metaxa Twelve Stars Grand Olympian Reserve. Metaxa Private Reserve is the most oldest member of Metaxa family. Only 5.000 numbered <b>decanters</b> of Metaxa Private Reserve are on the market containing distillates aged for 30 years from Spyros Metaxas' family barrels.|$|E
25|$|Miss Lucilla Edith Cavell Teatime is a ladylike conwoman whose {{occasional}} lapses into verbal vulgarity {{make her}} all the more endearing. She has a liking for whisky, a game of dominoes and all things tasteful. She first steps off the train in Flaxborough (a town once described as having the fictional solidarity of Arnold Bennett's Five Towns) in the fourth mystery set there, Lonelyheart 4122. She likes the town {{so much that she}} settles there, even though her attempt at swindling through a lonely-hearts bureau nearly makes her the third woman killed by another swindler. She appears in all subsequent Flaxborough novels except Blue Murder. By the eleventh volume, Plaster Sinners, she is the proprietress of the 'House of Yesteryear' in Northgate, Flaxborough, and a regular attender at local auctions. Her old talents and sleight of hand remain much in evidence. On one occasion two glass <b>decanters</b> are rendered extremely cheap when she casually transfers the stoppers to a tray of miscellaneous items, which she then bids for as well. Her final appearance is in Whatever's Been Going On At Mumblesby? where we find her with an assistant called Edgar and offering opinions on the marketability of such religious relics as saints' kneecaps. In the 1977 Murder Most English BBC television series, which offered adaptations of four of Colin Watson's Flaxborough novels, Lucy Teatime was portrayed by Brenda Bruce.|$|E

Rooney lobbied the United States Post Office Department seeking for the Peace Candle to {{chosen for}} the {{official}} Christmas Stamp in the following year. However, it was rejected both years by the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, which reviewed the proposals and narrowed the applications. In 1968, {{an image of the}} painting The Annunciation by Jan van Eyck was chosen rather than the Peace Candle. In October 1979, the Schaefferstown, Pennsylvania-based Michter's Distillery created whiskey <b>decanters</b> patterned after the Peace Candle. The idea was first posed by Mark Hammerstone of Palmer Township, a decanter collector who approached Schultz with the concept in 1978. Schultz brought the idea to the distillery, which chose to base their second annual Christmas decanter on the Peace Candle. They spent $3,500 to build a [...] sculpture based on photos of the structure.

500|$|In {{creating}} {{the interior of}} the house, Burges demonstrated his skill as a jeweller, metalworker and designer. He included some of his best pieces of furniture such as the Zodiac Settle, the Dog Cabinet and the Great Bookcase, the last of which Charles Handley-Read described as [...] "occupying a unique position in the history of Victorian painted furniture". The fittings were as elaborate as the furniture: the tap for one of the guest washstands was {{in the form of a}} bronze bull from whose throat water poured into a sink inlaid with silver fish. Within the Tower House Burges placed some of his finest metalwork; the artist Henry Stacy Marks wrote, [...] "he could design a chalice as well as a cathedral...

But the overall conception, the range of materials, the ingenuity, the inventiveness, the sheer gusto of the design, is peculiarly, triumphantly Burges." [...] Burges also designed more utilitarian articles which were nonetheless imbued with his love of allusion and punning, including silverware featuring mermaids, spiders and other creatures {{and a set of}} knives and forks for the Tower House, with the handles, carved by Nicholls, showing symbols of [...] "meat and vegetables, veal, venision, onion, pea and so on." [...] He was also a knowledgeable critic, referred to by a contemporary as [...] "one of the best judges of armour in Europe." [...] His large collection of armour, parts of which came from the famed collection of Sir Samuel Rush Meyrick, was bequeathed to the British Museum upon his death.|$|E
50|$|The rapid {{development}} of the <b>decanter</b> centrifuge over the 20th century saw it expand into a vast range of over 100 industrial applications. Further development since then has seen the refinement of machine design and control methods, improving its overall performance, which allows the system to respond quickly to varying feed conditions. The newest development in <b>decanter</b> centrifuge technology aims to achieve enhanced control of the separation process occurring inside the <b>decanter.</b> The way in which manufacturers aim to address this is by utilising variable mechanical devices in the rotating part of the <b>decanter</b> centrifuge. To control the separation process, the operational parameters should be transferred from the rotating part to the stationary part of the <b>decanter</b> whilst also constantly controlling and maintaining the mechanical device inside the process region. This can be achieved using hydraulic and electronic transfer systems. A hydraulic drive motor is easily able to access the rotating area of the <b>decanter</b> centrifuge.|$|R
