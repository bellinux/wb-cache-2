It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> Development and {{carried out by the}} implementing organisations.

5|$|Gierek government's growing {{difficulties}} led also {{to increased}} {{dependence on the}} Soviet Union, including tight <b>economic</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> displays of submissiveness not seen under Gomułka's rule. The constitution, amended in February 1976, formalized the alliance with the Soviet Union and the leading role of the communist party. The language of the proposed changes was softened after protests by intellectuals and the Church, but the regime felt it needed additional authority given the indebtedness to the West and the deepening economic crisis. The divisive issues raised helped to coalesce the emerging circles of active political opposition.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland's {{trade was}} {{blockaded}} {{by both the}} Allies and by the Axis. <b>Economic</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> extension of credit to the Third Reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion {{and the availability of}} other trading partners. Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through Vichy France was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland completely surrounded, with the exception of Liechtenstein, by the Axis. Over the course of the war, Switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees and the International Red Cross, based in Geneva, played an important part during the conflict. Strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with Nazi Germany raised controversy, but not {{until the end of the}} 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Kiep {{became a}} member of the CDU in the fall of 1961, gaining a seat in the county council of Obertaunus in 1963.

He {{retained}} his seat in 1969 and 1972, this time as part of his party's electoral list in Hessen. In 1972, Kiep was one of only a few CDU parliamentarians who voted yes to the Basic Treaty (Grundlagenvertrag) between West and East Germany. Other supporters of Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik were Richard von Weizsäcker, Karl Carstens and Olaf von Wrangel. During the 1972 federal elections, Kiep was named as prospective Federal Minister of <b>Economic</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>and</b> Development in the shadow cabinet of Rainer Barzel. He left parliament on 24 February 1976 to join the state government in Lower Saxony. During his tenure as minister, he also held a seat in the Landtag of Lower Saxony from 1978 to 1980. He regained a seat in the Bundestag following the 1980 election, entering through a place on the electoral list for Lower Saxony. In order to concentrate on his role as leading candidate in his home state of Hamburg, he once again left parliament on 26 April 1982.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1806, German-speaking Central Europe {{included}} more than 300 political entities, {{most of which}} were part of the Holy Roman Empire or the extensive Habsburg hereditary dominions. They ranged in size from the small and complex territories of the princely Hohenlohe family branches to sizable, well-defined territories such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Prussia. Their governance varied: they included free imperial cities, also of different sizes, such as the powerful Augsburg and the minuscule Weil der Stadt; ecclesiastical territories, also of varying sizes and influence, such as the wealthy Abbey of Reichenau and the powerful Archbishopric of Cologne; and dynastic states such as Württemberg. These lands (or parts of them—both the Habsburg domains and Hohenzollern Prussia also included territories outside the Empire structures) made up the territory of the Holy Roman Empire, which at times {{included more}} than 1,000 entities. Since the 15th century, with few exceptions, the Empire's Prince-electors had chosen successive heads of the House of Habsburg to hold the title of Holy Roman Emperor. Among the German-speaking states, the Holy Roman Empire administrative and legal mechanisms provided a venue to resolve disputes between peasants and landlords, between jurisdictions, and within jurisdictions. Through the organization of imperial circles (Reichskreise), groups of states consolidated resources and promoted regional and organizational interests, including <b>economic</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> military protection.|$|E
