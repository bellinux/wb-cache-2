5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of ten 28 cm SK L/50 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> five twin gun turrets. Her {{secondary}} armament consisted of twelve 15cm SK L/45 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> casemates in the central portion {{of the ship and}} twelve 8.8cm SK L/45 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> the bow, in the stern, and around the forward conning tower. She was also equipped with four 50cm (20in) submerged torpedo tubes.|$|E
5|$|As a carrier, {{the ship}} was {{to have had a}} {{complement}} of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 dive-bombers. She would have been armed with an anti-aircraft battery of ten 10.5cm SK C/33 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> dual mounts, ten 3.7cm SK C/30 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> dual mounts, and twenty-four 2cm Flak 38 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> quadruple mounts. Conversion work was halted in June 1943, however, and the incomplete vessel was towed to Königsberg where she was eventually scuttled on 29 January 1945. The ship was seized by the advancing Soviet Army and was briefly considered for cannibalization for spare parts to complete her sister ship Lützow, which had been purchased by the Soviet Navy before the war. This plan was also abandoned, and {{the ship was}} broken up for scrap.|$|E

50|$|The heavy {{machine gun}} version of the VAB carries a M2HB 12.7mm machine <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> an open turret; the light version sports the AA52 7.5mm machine <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> a similar arrangement.|$|R
5|$|In 1937 eight /75 caliber AA <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> two quadruple mounts {{were added}} to improve the light AA armament. The ships were more {{extensively}} refitted with large amounts of light AA guns {{at the expense of}} the 5-inch/51 caliber <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> 1942, as the attack on Pearl Harbor had shown pre-war light AA armament to be inadequate. The 1.1 inch quad mounts were removed and 24 Bofors 40 mm guns were added in six quadruple mounts (later increased to 40 guns), while 42 Oerlikon 20 mm <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> single mounts were also added. The 3-inch AA gun armament was increased to 10 guns, while the 5-inch gun armament was reduced to 6 guns.|$|E

5|$|Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt, arriving on 8 April 1906, {{where she was}} given a lengthy refit that was finished in 1909. Her engines and boilers were reconditioned, her mainmast was removed and she received additional six-inch guns. Six more <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> lightly armored casemates were added on the upper deck, positioned on each side in the intervals between the main-deck six-inch <b>guns.</b> <b>In</b> addition the bow gun {{was moved to the}} upper deck to allow it to fire to each side. This increased the ship's broadside by four guns.|$|E

5|$|The guns on {{the forward}} turret roof were removed in 1911–1912 and the upper forward pair of <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> the {{superstructure}} were removed in 1913–1914. In addition, gun shields were fitted to all <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> the superstructure and the bridge structure was enlarged {{around the base of}} the forward tripod mast. During the first year of the war, a fire-control director was installed high on the forward tripod mast. Around the same time, the base of the forward superstructure was rebuilt to house 4 four-inch guns and the turret-top guns were removed, which reduced her secondary armament to a total of fourteen <b>guns.</b> <b>In</b> addition a pair of three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added.|$|E
5|$|The ships' 37mm 83-calibre {{guns were}} twin mounted {{and placed in}} the superstructure. The mounts were {{hand-operated}} and automatically stabilised for roll and pitch. These guns were supplied with a total of 32,000rounds of ammunition. Bismarck and Tirpitz were initially armed with twelve 20mm <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> single mounts, though these were augmented over time. Bismarck received a pair of quadruple gun mountings, for a total of twenty 20mm guns. Over the course of her career, Tirpitzs 20mm battery was increased to 78 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> single and quadruple mountings.|$|E
5|$|The two Scharnhorst-class battleships {{were the}} first capital ships built for the Kriegsmarine {{after the end of}} World War I. They marked the {{beginning}} of German naval rearmament after the Treaty of Versailles. The class comprised two vessels: Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. The ships were armed with nine 28cm (11in) SK C/34 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> three triple turrets, though there were plans to replace these weapons with six 38cm (15in) SK C/34 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> twin turrets.|$|E

5|$|Although {{an earlier}} {{organization}} included a divisional anti-tank battalion (two companies of 37mm guns and one company of 75 mm <b>guns),</b> <b>in</b> December 1941 these AT battalions {{were removed from}} the divisional structure and reorganized as independent tank destroyer battalions; their towed guns were replaced with self-propelled ones as soon as the latter became available.|$|E
5|$|Between September 1988 and January 1989, sailors aboard Iowa {{reportedly}} conducted little {{training with}} her main <b>guns,</b> <b>in</b> {{part because of}} ongoing, serious maintenance issues with the main gun turrets. According to Ensign Dan Meyer, the officer {{in charge of the}} ship's Turret One, morale and operational readiness among the gun-turret crews suffered greatly.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, the castle's defences {{had become}} {{obsolete}} once again {{due to the}} development of torpedo boats and superior breech-loading <b>guns.</b> <b>In</b> response, five 6-pounder quick-firing guns and searchlights were installed to deal with the torpedo boat threat and, between 1899 and 1901, the east battery was converted to hold breech-loading guns at a cost of £16,670.|$|E

5|$|Fort Tigné {{was one of}} the few fortifications that {{actively}} {{tried to}} resist the invasion. On 10 June, the French attempted to capture it in a minor skirmish, but were successfully repelled. The fort also fired its <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> support of a counterattack by the Order's navy against the French, and it prevented French ships from entering Marsamxett.|$|E
5|$|In November, the Board {{agreed to}} a {{compromise}} design that incorporated a secondary battery of eight 8in <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> four twin turrets amidships and twelve 7in <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> casemates. The decision to retain the 8in guns was made in large part due to American experiences in the Spanish–American War three years before. US Navy officers had been impressed {{with the performance of}} the gun at the Battle of Santiago de Cuba; despite scoring only 13 hits out of 309 shells fired, the gun had a flat trajectory and good range for its size. Armor protection was improved over the BuOrd design, with a thicker armored belt and casemate protection, albeit at the expense of thinner armor covering the barbettes that supported the gun turrets. The designers reasoned that since the barbettes were behind the belt and a transverse bulkhead, weight could be saved by reducing the level of direct protection.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1944, the USAAF {{released}} General Operational Requirements {{for a day}} fighter with a {{top speed}} of 600mph (521kn, 966km/h), combat radius of 705miles (612nmi, 1,135km), and armament of either six 0.50in (12.7mm) or four 0.60in (15.2mm) machine <b>guns.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the new aircraft had to use the General Electric TG-180 axial turbojet which entered production as the Allison J35.|$|E

50|$|In 1837 Martin von Wahrendorff {{patented}} {{a design}} for a breech-loader with a cylindrical breech plug secured by a horizontal wedge; it was adopted by Sweden in 1854. Independently, Giovanni Cavalli first proposed a breech-loader <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> 1832 to the Sardinian Army, and first tested such a <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> 1845.|$|R
5|$|On 19 September, Confiance {{captured}} the Prize, from Calcutta, which had stored eight of her ten <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> her hold to improve her stability.

5|$|Shropshire and Arunta {{remained}} at Leyte and {{were part of}} the United States Seventh Fleet Support Force at the Battle of Surigao Strait on 25 October. During this action both ships contributed to the sinking of the Japanese battleship , with Shropshire firing thirty-two eight-gun broadsides into the battleship with her 8-inch <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> a period of 14 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The 5-inch/38 gun {{would remain}} on the battleships for the ships' entire service life; however, {{the total number of}} guns and gun mounts was reduced from 20 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> ten mounts to 12 <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> six mounts during the 1980s' {{modernization}} of the four Iowas. The removal of four of the gun mounts was required for the battleships to be outfitted with the armored box launchers needed to carry and fire Tomahawk missiles. At the time of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, these guns had been largely relegated to littoral defense for the battleships. Since each battleship carried a small detachment of Marines aboard, the Marines would man one of the 5-inch gun mounts.|$|E
50|$|The ship's main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} two 4-inch (102 mm) QF Mk IV <b>guns.</b> Unlike <b>in</b> the Hastings class, which had one 4-inch <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> an anti-aircraft mount, both <b>guns</b> were <b>in</b> Low-Angle mountings only suitable for use against surface targets. In addition four 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting guns were carried.|$|R

5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to arm every fifth T-26 with the 37mm <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> the right turret, but the final {{proportion}} was somewhat higher. About 450 twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 tanks mounting the 37mm <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> the right turret were produced in 1931–1933 (including only 20–30 tanks with the B-3 gun). There were 392 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks with gun plus machine <b>gun</b> armament <b>in</b> the Red Army on 1 April 1933.|$|R
