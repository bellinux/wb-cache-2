500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out.

50|$|One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder,</b> <b>if</b> {{politics}} {{played a}} significant role in this decision. The majority in the government (but minority of the Regia Marina) favored development of capital ships, so allocated resources went mainly into this area, including unnecessary rebuilding of old era heavy cruisers, or extending their service, but reducing financing to scientific and technical developments, and production of ammunition. In 1935 Albatros was reclassified as a second-line ship, and was assigned to Regia Marina's naval experimental unit at La Spezia.|$|R

After the Boldguard was destroyed, it was replaced with a new Leostriker. Later in the series, Sigma and Helmut's Zoids gain the ability to fuse into the Command Striker.

5000|$|Although {{not as well}} publicized {{as college}} incidents, fans {{storming}} the court after a big win is not uncommon {{at the high school}} level. The injuries suffered by several people following the Iowa State University men's basketball team's win over the University of Iowa in December 2015 prompted the Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union to issue a memorandum to athletic directors and coaches to remind fans that the organization and its sister organization, the Iowa High School Athletic Association, have policies prohibiting court storming after post-season games. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the person injured was the star player, the coach, or one of the game officials if the attitude and need for 'storming the court' might change?"

All conjecture aside, and even more unusual as compared to their average labelmates' guitar-first philosophy, Culprit songs like 'Steel to Blood,' 'Ambush,' and 'Same to You' boasted extremely memorable, singalong choruses to go with their disciplined instrumental foundations. As it stands, Guilty as Charged remains a lost gem of American metal from the 1980s, and well worth seeking out for fans of other bands from the period."

40|$|Contemporary (post- 1945) {{liberalism}} functions analogously to Roman Catholicism in {{the decades}} after 1443. Both ideologies, in their respective periods, represent the hegemonic ideology of Western civilization, {{despite the fact that}} both comprise a miscellany of competing belief systems. Both ideologies are dominated by a single hegemonic power—the United States and the Renaissance papacy, respectively—which strives for doctrinal stability. All who reject official “doctrine,” however, are rendered liable to violent suppression. In this, papal Catholicism and American liberalism display an ultra-conservative outlook; but they also evince a powerfully millenarian streak, as evidenced by their dual proclamations of the “end of history” and their zealous missionary responses to macro-historical events in the final decades of the fifteenth and twentieth centuries. For ideologues of both regimes, those events speak to an ultimate harmony of truth and value that only serves to entrench their own dogmatism. This, however, has dire consequences when it comes to war, {{as can be seen in}} the “crusading” character of contemporary liberal warfare. Ultimately, the Renaissance papacy proves unable to maintain its monopoly on Christian doctrine; and one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> a similar fate may befall America's perceived role as the champion of liberalism...|$|R

5000|$|The current design {{dates from}} December 30, 1977, when the seal was subtly modified. The date was changed from 1664 (when the Kingdom of England took possession) to 1625. The change was {{proposed}} by the Irish-born Paul O'Dwyer, president of the City Council, to emphasize the Dutch contributions to the city's history and downplay the British legacy. The choice of date was controversial at the time; an aide to First Deputy Mayor James A.

[...] An aide to then-Mayor Abe Beame suggested that 1624 {{would be a more}} accurate date, as that was when the city was actually chartered as a legal Dutch entity. Author Edwin G.

40|$|Abstract—The {{telecommunication}} world keeps evolving, {{with the}} development of new technologies, and operators <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> investing in the costly infrastructures and potential licenses as well as maintaining existing technologies is worthy. This has to be investigated in a competitive context. We propose in this paper to model and analyze a three-level game between two operators. At the highest level, operators decide which technology to implement, possibilities being here 3 G, WiFi and WiMAX. At the intermediate level, they fix their service price, while at the lowest level, customers choose their provider depending on price and quality of service. The model is analyzed by backward induction, where decisions at a level depend on the equilibria at the lower levels. Different real-life cost scenarios are studied, depending on whether or not operators already own the infrastructures and licenses: our model should help understanding their final decision. I...|$|E
40|$|We use a new {{approach}} to the UV behavior of quantum general relativity, together with some recent results from the phenomenological asymptotic safety analysis of the theory, to discuss the final state of the Hawking radiation for an originally very massive black hole solution of Einstein’s theory. We find that, after the black hole evaporates to the Planck mass size, its horizon is obviated by quantum loop effects, rendering the entire mass of the originally massive black hole accessible to our universe. † Work partly supported by NATO Grant PST. CLG. 980342. Given the many successes of Einstein’s classical theory of general relativity [1 – 3], the fact that the only accepted complete treatment of quantum general relativity, superstring theory [4, 5], involves 1 many hitherto unseen degrees of freedom, some at masses wellbeyond the Planck mass, is even more of an acute issue, as we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> such degrees of freedom are anything more than a mathematical artifact?

Nevertheless,with the continued heightened security and monitoring of sex offenders,one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> how far the laws could possibly extend in the future. The rationale behind labeling sex offenders can best be understood by a quotation from Nathaniel Hawthorne's(1850) novel the scarlet letter:"In our nature,however,there is a provision,alike marvellous and merciful,that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture,but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it". Labeling Theory:This theory contains 3 main principles-the social meaning of deviance,societal reaction,and stigma. Labeling theorists often studied the lives of alcoholics,drug users,and mental patients in order to appreciate and understand those who are labeled in society. Labeling is a matter of perception:Labeling theory is also based on people's perceptions. For example,a person who has a tattoo or has several uncommon piercing may be seen as exotic and striking in some settings.
