Chapter 2 details {{the analysis of the}} network and a method of simplifying the resultant transfer function by a single pole/zero cancellation. Chapter 3 characterizes the simplified transfer function through an analysis of the quality factor and of the center <b>frequency</b> <b>gain</b> as <b>functions</b> of the individual variables of the circuit. It also details sensitivity analyses of these characteristic quantities and a stability analysis. Lastly, chapter 3 presents graphical representations of the equations developed {{so that they can be}} used as design tools. It then goes through the details of applying these graphs to an example network. Chapter 4 explains the differences between experimental data and predicted data by discussing some of the nonlinearities neglected in the original analysis. Finally chapter 5 restates the design technique in light of the predominant nonlinearities...|$|R

50|$|The {{advantage}} of using commensurate lines {{is that the}} commensurate line theory allows circuits to be synthesised from a prescribed <b>frequency</b> <b>function.</b> While any circuit using arbitrary transmission line lengths can be analysed to determine its <b>frequency</b> <b>function,</b> that circuit cannot necessarily be easily synthesised starting from the <b>frequency</b> <b>function.</b> The fundamental problem is that using more than one length generally requires more than one frequency variable. Using commensurate lines requires only one frequency variable. A well developed theory exists for synthesising lumped element circuits from a given <b>frequency</b> <b>function.</b> Any circuit so synthesised {{can be converted to}} a commensurate line circuit using Richards' transformation and a new frequency variable.|$|R

50|$|In {{some cases}} {{it may even be}} {{relevant}} to consider a <b>frequency</b> <b>function</b> and impulse response of the filter which are chosen independently from each other.

The latter condition can be realized by considering a very narrow function as the wanted impulse response of the filter even though this function has no relation to the desired <b>frequency</b> <b>function.</b> The goal of the design process is then to realize a filter which tries to meet both these contradicting design goals as much as possible.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} the proton {{irradiation}} influence on Multiple Gate MOSFETs (MuGFETs) performance is investigated. This {{analysis was performed}} through basic and analog parameters considering four different splits (unstrained, uniaxial, biaxial, uniaxial+biaxial). Although the influence of radiation is more pronounced for p-channel devices, in pMuGFETs devices, the radiation promotes a higher immunity to the back interface conduction resulting in the analog performance improvement. On the other hand, the proton irradiation results in a degradation of the post-irradiated n-channel transistors behavior. The unit <b>gain</b> <b>frequency</b> showed to be strongly dependent on stress efficiency and the radiation results in an increase of the unit <b>gain</b> <b>frequency</b> for splits with high stress effectiveness for both cases p- and nMuGFETs...|$|R
