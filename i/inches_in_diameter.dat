5|$|By 1973, the PAVN {{logistical}} system {{consisted of}} a two-lane paved (with crushed limestone and gravel) highway that ran from the mountain passes of North Vietnam to the Chu Pong Massif in South Vietnam. By 1974 {{it was possible to}} travel a completely paved four-lane route from the Central Highlands to Tây Ninh Province, northwest of Saigon. The single oil pipeline that had once terminated near the A Shau Valley now consisted of four lines (the largest eight <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>diameter)</b> and extended south to Lộc Ninh. In July 1973 the 259th Group as redesignated the Truong Son Command, the regimental sectors were converted to divisions, and the binh trams were designated as regiments. By late 1974 forces under the new command included AAA Division 377, Transportation Division 571, Engineering Division 473, the 968th Infantry Division, and sectoral divisions 470, 471, and 472.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{transcendental}} equation where Ac is {{the cross}} sectional area of a cylindrical cavity of depth L. Ao is {{the area of the}} circular orifice of depth Lo, δe is the exterior end correction, δi is the interior end correction, and kL is the Helmholtz number (acoustical Strouhal number with 2 added).

End corrections for radiation from the openings is needed to bring the two frequencies in consonance. To determine the end corrections, two additional dimensions are needed: the diameter of the orifice d1 and the diameter of the tube d2.|$|E
25|$|Because {{they were}} unable to be used by orchestras, music makers began to build smaller gong drums that would not carry a {{definite}} pitch. This smaller version of the gong drum is today called orchestral bass drum, and it is the prototype with which people are most familiar today. The modern bass drum is used primarily in orchestras. The drum, similar to the davul and long drum, is double-headed, rod tensioned, and measures roughly 40 <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>diameter</b> and 20 inches in width. Most orchestral bass drums are situated within a frame, which allows them to be positioned at any angle.|$|E

25|$|Deep Diver was 22 {{feet long}} and 8.5 feet tall. It weighed 8.25 tons dry. It allowed one pilot and three {{observers}} to dive {{for a total of}} 32 man-hours to a depth limit of 1350 feet. The pressure hull was made of steel, 54 inches thick for the pilots' and divers' compartments. Deep Divers main hatch was 23 <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b> The submersible featured no manipulators. It had twenty-one acrylic plastic viewports. The ballast and trim tanks provided 845 pounds and 676 pounds of positive buoyancy, respectively, when emptied.

25|$|Wilson and {{his colleagues}} have {{simulated}} the human whistle by creating a cylinder 2.04 <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>diameter</b> with a rounded orifice at one end that supplied a jet and another rounded orifice {{at the other end of}} the same diameter and on the same axis. The geometry was very similar to that of the tea pot whistle. After a number of tests at various speeds, orifice diameters, and orifice thicknesses, they concluded that the whistle was created by a Helmholtz resonance in the cylinder volume. There was enough data for one case in their study to calculate the Strouhal and Reynolds numbers. The results are shown in the figure on the right.|$|E

25|$|However {{the size}} of the Allied air forces began to exhaust {{possible}} two-letter combinations, and made difficult the timely assembly of heavy bomber tactical formations. In June 1943 VIII Bomber Command introduced the use of a geometric symbol painted on either side of a bomber's vertical fin to denote a bombardment wing (later division) identification marking. These devices were white in color and 80 <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b> A triangle denoted the B-17 1st Bombardment Wing (later 1st Air Division), a circle the B-24 2nd Bombardment Wing, and a square the B-17 4th Bombardment Wing (later 3rd Air Division). The B-26 medium bombers of the 3rd Bombardment Wing did not use this scheme.|$|E
25|$|Graphite {{electrodes}} {{carry the}} electricity that melts scrap iron and steel, and sometimes direct-reduced iron (DRI), in electric arc furnaces, {{which are the}} vast majority of steel furnaces. They are made from petroleum coke after it is mixed with coal tar pitch. They are then extruded and shaped, baked to carbonize the binder (pitch), and finally graphitized by heating it to temperatures approaching 3000°C, at which the carbon atoms arrange into graphite. They can vary in size up to 11feet long and 30 <b>inches</b> <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b> An increasing proportion of global steel is made using electric arc furnaces, and the electric arc furnace itself is getting more efficient, making more steel per tonne of electrode. An estimate based on USGS data indicates that graphite electrode consumption was 197,000 tonnes in 2005.|$|E
