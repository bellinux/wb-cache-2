40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optical method of storing random cryptographic keys within a reconfigurable volume of polymer-dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC). We suggest a PDLC-based device that functions as an integrated optical physical unclonable function (PUF). Our device can selectively access a dense set (up to 10 Gb/mm^ 3 in theory) of non-electronically saved random bits. Furthermore, this optical PUF can fully erase and transform these bits {{into a new}} random configuration in less than one second, via a simple electrical signal. When a short voltage spike is applied across the PDLC film interface, its optical scattering potential completely decorrelates. We confirm this phenomenon with detailed experiments on a proof-of-concept device, thereby suggesting the security use of {{a new class of}} optical materials as (i) securely and efficiently reconfigurable PUFs, and (ii) an <b>erasable</b> <b>storage</b> medium for random cryptographic keys.

40|$|Amorphous {{magneto-optic}} (m. o.) rare earth-transition metal (RE-TM) {{films are}} the most promising candidates for <b>erasable</b> optical <b>storage</b> to date. The best storage properties are found in ternary or quaternary alloys out of the compositional range (Gd,Tb) (Fe,Co). A suitable choice of the Gd/Tb ratio permits to optimize the magnetic properties yielding high storage density and high information stability. At about equal amounts of Fe and Co the magneto-optical effects are maximum. However, there are stil 1 some problems concerning {{the stability of the}} thin films which are associated with the oxidation of the RE-TM alloys. This is the main reason for aging. The aging behavior of the RE-TM films depends strongly on their microstructure. GdTbCo films were sputtered using an RF diode configuration at wich varying DC bias voltages were applied to the substrate. At negative bias voltages in the range between - 100 V and - 200 V the uniaxial anisotropy was maximum. However, these films oxidized totally in a short time when exposed to air without protective layers. This was attributed to the large argon concentration in those films. Indeed, films with perpendicular magnetization can also be sputtered without bias voltage choosing a proper Ar-pressure of about 2 Pa. Contrary to bias sputtered films, these much better withstand oxidation due to their low argon concentration...|$|R

Mass storage devices have high potential for those applications which have a requirement to store a large data base (10 ﾹ- 10 ﾹﾲ bits) on-line. 2. Mass storage devices should be considered as supplements to conventional storage devices for large data base applications, and used as part of a hierarchical storage system, rather than as replacements for conventional storage quipment. 3. Mass storage devices are not competitive with conventional storage equipment for direct access processing. 4. <b>Erasable</b> mass <b>storage</b> devices are competitive with conventional storage equipment for sequential file processing. 5. Non-erasable mass storage devices are inappropriate for high activity file processing but can be employed to advantage in archival storage applications. 6.

Phase change recording technology offers attractive features for <b>erasable</b> data <b>storage</b> with high density. Further optimization of this technology requires the determination of crystallization kinetics and comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. In this work we have prepared and investigated the crystallization kinetics of sputter deposited amorphous Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5, Ge 4 Sb 1 Te 5, and Ag 5. 5 In 6. 5 Sb 59 Te 29 films. These materials are of great interest in phase change media technology since they enable to write, erase and rewrite information repetitively using optical techniques. They can be characterized by two stable physical phases that exhibit significantly different optical properties. The properties of these materials are compared in regard to data storage applications. Temperature dependent measurements of electrical resistance have been employed to study the kinetics of the structural changes. Corroborative x-ray diffraction measurements reveal that upon annealing the amorphous Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 films crystallize to a cubic structure followed by an hexagonal structure upon further annealing.

Further optimisation of this technology requires the determination of crystallisation kinetics and comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. To speed up the search for faster materials we employ concepts of combinatorial material synthesis by producing films with a stoichiometry gradient by thermal evaporation. Then laterally resolved secondary neutral mass spectroscopy (SNMS) combined with the static tester is used to identify the composition with superior properties for phase change applications. In this work, we have prepared and investigated the crystallisation kinetics of GeSbTe stoichiometry libraries. Therefore, germanium, antimony, tellurium, and GeTe have been used as evaporant materials. By superposing the vapours of the single elements, stoichiometry libraries can be prepared. The resulting compounds have then been compared to the results of well-known sputter prepared GeSbTe compounds in order to perform the proof of concept. The properties of these materials are compared in regard to data storage applications. The preparation technique presented in this work, allows two approaches to prepare the materials: the static and the dynamic mode. First, samples prepared in static mode have lateral stoichiometry gradients. Hence, they can be screened for properties like the minimum time for crystallisation or optical contrast with the static tester. For a GeSb 2 Te 4 library, we have seen that compounds close to GeSb 2 Te 4 have the shortest crystallisation times. We observe that the minimal times for crystal- lisation increases with the distance from the pseudo-binary line, whereas the maximum change in reflection decreases, respectively. This result corroborates the believe that especially the materials along the pseudo-binary line are the most suitable candidates for re-writable optical data storage applications. Statically prepared samples have furthermore been studied with lateral resolved spectral ellipsometry to determine dependence of stoichiometry on the optical properties. The simulated optical contrast between the amorphous and crystalline structure corroborates the contrast observed by crystallisation experiments. Furthermore, by preparing samples in dynamic mode, single stoichiometry films are obtained. These samples can then be studied with macroscopic techniques such as temperature dependent electrical measurements, which has been employed to study the kinetics of the structural changes. Corroborative x-ray diffraction measurements reveal that upon annealing the amorphous GeTe, Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 and GeSb 2 Te 4 films crystallise to a cubic structure, followed by a hexagonal structure upon further annealing.

40|$|Optical {{filters and}} thin film optical devices play an {{important}} role in Science and Industry. Several significant applications have emerged in optics, microelectronics and computer technology. In this work, we study some aspects of their design and applications. One class of optical fibers, known as Christiansen filters, are based on scattering phenomena in suspensions of solid particles in a liquid medium. Some new scattering filters in the visible and the near UV regions and their performance characteristics are reported here. Feasibility to fabricate such optical filters in solid matrix form is established. Some applications of these scattering filters are discussed. After an introduction to the optics of homogeneous and isotropic thin films, I discuss the general design of anisotropic thin film media and a scheme implemented to calculate their performance. Optical anisotropy, produced by the growth-induced columnar microstructure in thin films and its effects on the performance of optical filters are studied. Large shifts in the peak wavelength of a typical narrow band filter are predicted. Magneto-optical (MO) thin film media of great importance to <b>erasable</b> optical data <b>storage</b> technology are studied. An approximate technique based on a 2 x 2 matrix formalism is developed to calculate the normal incidence performance of these media. To investigate anisotropic effects, to incorporate more than one magnetic film with arbitrary orientations of magnetization, and to study oblique incidence performance, a completely general 4 x 4 matrix technique is implemented in a computer program. Effects of substrate/superstrate birefringence in the read-out signal of MO media are investigated. Several optimizing design criteria, particularly, the effectiveness in employing appropriate metal or dielectric reflector layers are studied. The influence of the plasma edge of metals in enhancing the polar Kerr rotation of MO media is discussed with illustrations. A contour plot of the Kerr rotation and reflectance is developed to help in the design of these media. An explanation is given for the observation of Kerr rotation enhancement near the plasma reflection edge of the reflector layer adjacent to the active MO layer and in general, where the reflectance spectrum shows a steep gradient...|$|R
40|$|As the {{computer}} industry grows, so will the requirements for data storage. Magnetic memory {{has been the most}} stable method in terms of capacity and recording/reading speed. However, we have reached the point where a substantial increase in the capacity cannot be produced without increasing the size of the system. When compact discs (CDs) were introduced in the 1980 s they revolutionized the concept of data storage. While the initial force behind compact discs could easily be said to be the music industry, once recordable and rewritable discs became available they quickly found more use in {{the computer}} industry as backup devices. Since their inception, the capacity requirements have far exceeded what is available on a compact disc, and they are now following the same path as magnetic memories. Following this trend, it could be assumed that digital versatile discs or digital video discs (DVDs) have a limited lifetime as a storage medium. In fact it has been noted (Higuchi et al., 1999) that the maximum capacity of digital video discs will be reached in 3 - 5 years. The question then is, what comes next? The efficiency of conventional optical data storage is extremely poor. For an optically thick recording medium, both CDs and DVDs use less than 0. 01 % of the total volume to store the information. Three-dimensional bit optical data storage endeavors to increase the efficiency by recording information in a volume that is greater than 90 % of the total volume. The concept of three-dimensional bit optical data storage was first proposed by Parthenopoulos and Rentzepis in 1989, where they demonstrated that capacities far exceeding that of compact discs could be achieved. Three-dimensional bit optical data storage relies on creating a highly localised chemical or physical change within a recording medium, such that further layers can be recorded without causing interference. Ideally the chemical/physical change in the material should be reversible to enable erasable/rewritable data storage. In order to create a highly localised effect nonlinear excitation can be used; whereby the excitation is limited to a small region around the focal spot. Depending on the material and recording method there are several techniques for reading the information such as transmission imaging or reflection confocal microscopy. However, all the recording and reading methods require focusing to a deep position within a recording medium, such focusing encounters spherical aberration {{as a result of the}} difference in the refractive indices between the immersion and recording media. This thesis has concentrated on several areas to understand and develop the concept of three-dimensional bit optical data storage. The photorefractive effect in crystals has been studied for many years and is now widely used in optoelectronic devices. The use of photorefractive polymers is a relatively new and exciting development in optical data storage. Until now they have been used solely in the area of holographic data storage. The research in this thesis was conducted using photorefractive materials that were fabricated in two polymer matrices, poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) and poly(Methyl Methacrylate) (PMMA). The recording samples also consisted of the following compounds in various proportions, 2, 5 -dimethyl- 4 -(p-nirtophenylazo) anisole (DMNPAA), 2, 4, 7 -trinitro- 9 -fluorenone (TNF) and N-ethylcarbazole (ECZ). In this project two-photon excitation was used as the recording mechanism to achieve erasable/rewritable data storage in a photorefractive polymer. As a result of two-photon excitation, the quadratic dependence of excitation on the incident intensity produces an excitation volume that is confined to the focal region in both the transverse and axial directions. Therefore, focusing the laser beam above or below its previous position provides a method by which layers of information can be recorded in the depth direction of a material, without causing interference from neighbouring layers. The feasibility of two-photon excitation in photorefractive polymers is demonstrated in this thesis. The quadratic relationship between excitation and incident light in two-photon excitation requires high photon density to ensure efficient excitation. The use of ultra-short pulsed lasers, while effective, is not a practical solution for an optical data storage system. This thesis demonstrates the ability to produce three-dimensional erasable/rewritable data storage in a photorefractive polymer using continuous wave illumination. Using this technology it has been possible to achieve a density of 88 Gbits/cm 3, which corresponds to a capacity of 670 Gbytes on a compact disc sized recording medium. This is an increase of 1000 times the capacity of a CD and 130 times the capacity of current DVDs. While <b>erasable</b> optical data <b>storage</b> is an exciting prospect there are problems associated with the deterioration of the information. For long term information storage a permanent recording process would be more practical. It is demonstrated that there is a point after which further increases in the recording power result in the formation of a micro-cavity. While two-photon excitation is the recording method for <b>erasable</b> data <b>storage,</b> the increase in power results in an increase in ultra-violet absorption such that multi-photon excitation may occur. This thesis demonstrates the ability to record multi-layered arrays of micro-cavities. The change in refractive index associated with an erasable bit is less than 1 %. As a result only phase sensitive reading methods (transmission imaging or differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy) can be used to image a recorded bit. Both transmission and DIC imaging systems have poor axial resolution and therefore limit the density of the recording system, as well as being large optical systems. The introduction of a split or quadrant detector reduces the size of the optical reading system and is demonstrated to be sensitive enough to detect the phase changes of a recorded bit. However, the change in refractive index across a micro-cavity is large enough that reflection confocal microscopy can be used to detect a bit. It is demonstrated in this thesis that multi-layered micro-cavity arrays can be read using reflection confocal microscopy. Focusing of light to deep positions within an optical thick recording medium has the effect of increasing spherical aberration resulting from the refractive index mismatching between the immersion and recording media. The work in this thesis illustrates the effect of spherical aberration on the performance of both the recording and reading systems. The work conducted in this thesis shows the ability to record multi-layered erasable/rewritable information in a photorefractive polymer using pulsed and continuous wave two-photon excitation. It has also been demonstrated that through multi-photon excitation multi-layered micro-cavity arrays can be fabricated. It has also been illustrated that while spherical aberration deteriorates the performance of the recording and reading systems it is possible to achieve a density of greater than 88 Gbits/cm 3...|$|R

The optical properties were characterized by using UV-Visible spectroscopy and the band gap value of pure PANI, PANI-nFe 3 O 4 (50 %), PANI-nFe 3 O 4 (100 %) are 3. 284 eV, 3. 214 eV and 3. 201 eV respectively; it was observed that the band gap value of nanocomposites decreased with increase in the concentration of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. Crystalline nature of pure PANI and its nanocomposites were analysized by using the X-Ray diffraction spectroscopy. pure PANI has amorphous nature. By increasing the iron oxide nPs the amorphous nature of pure PANI decreases while its crystalline nature increases. The bacterial growth (E-Coli and staphylococcus aureus), the resultant increase in the zone of inhibition due to increase in the weight % of Fe 3 O 4 nPs were studied using antibacterial activity. Introduction. In recent research, the preparation of conducting polymer nanocomposites (CPnCs) has obtained a great deal of interest in physics and chemistry materials research community because of different potential applications of these materials in chemical sensing, polymer batteries catalysis, energy storage, solar cells, light emitting diode (LED), organic light emitting diode (OLED) and medical diagnosis etc., [1]. The synthesis of organic-inorganic nanocomposites has become the subject of extensive studies. The nanocomposites containing organic polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene, poly-o-toluidine etc.,) and inorganic particles in nano metal oxide (nFe 3 O 4, nNiO, nSb 2 O 3, nZnO, nTiO 2, nCuO, nCrO 2, nV 2 O 5 and nAl 2 O 3 etc.,) provide an entirely new class of materials with novel properties.
