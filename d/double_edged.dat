25|$|The dress sword for Heavy Cavalry {{officers}} was a {{much smaller}} and lighter weapon, having a knucklebow, ovoid pommel and boat-shell guard in gilt brass or gunmetal. The blade was much shorter and narrower than the service sword's, and usually <b>double</b> <b>edged</b> with a short narrow central fuller each side. The dress sword usually had a leather scabbard with gilt brass mounts, however, a number of examples exist of swords with iron service scabbards, suggesting that some officers may have employed the dress sword in the field.|$|E

25|$|The {{manuscript}} is transcribed onto thin slightly waxed {{sheets of}} paper by a professional calligrapher. The paper is placed face down on a block on which {{a thin layer of}} rice paste has been thinly spread and the back rubbed with a flat palm-fibre brush so that a clear impression of the inked area is left on the block. The engraving uses a set of sharp-edged tools to cut the characters with a <b>double</b> <b>edged</b> tool used to cut away any extra surfaces. The knife is held like a dagger in the right hand and guided by the middle finger of the left hand, drawing towards the cutter. The vertical lines are cut first, then the block is rotated 90 degrees and the horizontal lines cut.|$|E
25|$|Close combat troops, {{infantry}} and cavalry, {{made use of}} a spear, of varying length, usually {{referred to as a}} kontarion. Specialist infantry called menavlatoi used a heavy-shafted weapon called the menavlion the precise nature of which is uncertain; they are mentioned in the earlier Sylloge Tacticorum but may still have been extant. Swords were of two types: the spathion which was straight and <b>double</b> <b>edged</b> and differed only in details of the hilt from the typical ‘sword of war’ found in Western Europe, and the paramērion which {{appears to have been a}} form of single-edged, perhaps slightly curved, sabre. Most Byzantine soldiers would have worn swords as secondary weapons, usually suspended from a baldric rather than a waist belt. Heavy cavalry are described (in slightly earlier writings) as being doubly equipped with both the spathion and paramērion. Some missile-armed skirmish infantry used a relatively light axe (tzikourion) as a secondary weapon, whilst the Varangians were known as the “Axe-bearing Guard” because of their use of the double-handed Danish axe. The rhomphaia a long-bladed, cleaver-like, weapon was carried by guardsmen in close attendance on the emperor. Heavy cavalry made use of maces. Byzantine maces were given a variety of names including: mantzoukion, apelatikion and siderorabdion, suggesting that the weapons themselves were of varied construction.|$|E

Lawless tries to remove the breastplate but stops after she notices that her horny nerd fans have cameras ready.

500|$|Reviewing the DS {{version for}} 1UP.com, Barnholt {{positively}} noted the surreal story and music, but {{felt that the}} gameplay began to falter {{during the second half}} and called the graphics [...] "perhaps even worse" [...] than the PS2 original. He concluded that the game was most suited to dedicated fans of Suda's work, and that it showed the increased quality of his work on later titles more than having its own qualities. Matthew Razak of Destructoid found the gameplay elements [...] "seriously lacking" [...] and faulted most aspects of the title, which contributed to the low score. Despite this, Razak felt that people should play it and experience its unique deconstruction of game cliches, a theme that he realized ran through all of Suda's subsequent work. Eurogamer's Oli Welsh found that most of the puzzles presented to the player were forced in and distracted from the main narrative, but noted that the odd elements within the game fitted well into the story's surreal style. He was fairly negative about the graphics, despite the stylized look helping alleviate the downgrade from the PS2 original. In conclusion, he called the game's dated appearance and style [...] "a <b>double</b> <b>edged</b> sword", both entertaining and annoying players with its mechanics and styling. Game Informers Joe Juba enjoyed the bizarre characters and story, in addition to the artistic styling and music. His main complaints were focused on tedious sections within the gameplay and the [...] "blocky" [...] graphics. He said that, unless the player believed in sacrificing everything for style, Flower, Sun, and Rain could not be recommended.|$|E

They have neither bows nor slings, no missile weapons except the <b>double</b> <b>edged</b> axe and the angon which they use most often.

2500|$|With {{a rise in}} feminism, {{more cases}} of sexual {{harassment}} are being reported from Japanese {{women in the workplace}} and on commutes to work. [...] Two types of sexual harassment have gain widespread fame in the workplace and are being addressed. [...] The first revolves around a woman being fired, or demoted due to a refusal to offer sexual favors to her superior. [...] This is called retaliatory. [...] The second revolves around an environment that is denigrating to female workers, including sexual comments, lewd pictures, or inappropriate actions by male co-workers in the workplace. [...] This is called environmental. [...] Despite these being addressed, due to ambiguities in the legal framework, these types of harassment can be hard to enforce. [...] Women are bringing it to the public's attention through attempts to speak out against the injustice, however, many remain silent, fearing they will be fired if they speak out. [...] This hurts their performance, undermining the idea of equality in the workplace. [...] Sexual harassment can be a <b>double</b> <b>edged</b> sword in the workplace however. [...] Some women reported that men who are caught sexually harassing female co-workers are laughing stocks. [...] Based on the Japanese idea of shame, some men, especially in large corporations, avoid sexual harassment at all costs to preserve their position. [...] Also, the opinions of men can vary greatly from department to department. [...] Women harassed in one department can meet with no resistance after being transferred. [...] Men's opinions of women in Japan vary greatly, primarily due to their experiences with women. [...] Apart from their wives, mothers, and hostesses that salarymen spend time with, men live in separate spheres than women, so many are uneducated in the best ways to act.|$|E

This wrapping was in many folds, which he undid, and at last he found a pair of shoon, such as kings wear, adorned with gold, and also the most beautiful sword that he had ever seen. The handle was of clear rock crystal, and through the crystal you could see gold, inlaid with pictures of a lion hunt done in different shades of gold and silver. The sheath was of leather, with patterns in gold nails, and the blade was of bronze, a beautiful pattern ran down the centre to the point, the blade was straight, and <b>double</b> <b>edged,</b> supple, sharp, and strong. Never had Theseus seen so beautiful a sword, nor one so well balanced in his hand.|$|E
