25|$|Though {{faster and}} more {{advanced}} than the RAF's current front line biplane fighters, {{the design of the}} Hurricane's construction was already considered to be somewhat outdated when introduced to service and resembled those used on the earlier biplanes. Hawker had decided to employ its traditional construction techniques instead of radical measures such as the adoption of a stressed-skin metal exterior. The primary structure comprised a Warren truss box-girder that made use of high-tensile steel longerons and duralumin cross-bracing, which were mechanically fastened instead of welded. Over this, a secondary structure composed of wooden formers and stringers gave the fuselage a rounded external shape, which carried a doped linen covering. The majority of the <b>external</b> <b>surfaces</b> were linen, save for a section between the cockpit and the engine cowling that used lightweight metal panels instead.|$|E
500|$|Cyathus is a genus of {{fungi in}} the Nidulariaceae, a family collectively {{known as the}} bird's nest fungi. They are given this name since they {{resemble}} tiny bird's nests filled with [...] "eggs", structures large enough to have been mistaken {{in the past for}} seeds. However, these are now known to be reproductive structures containing spores. The [...] "eggs", or peridioles, are firmly attached to the inner surface of this fruit body by an elastic cord of mycelia known as a funiculus. The 45 species are widely distributed throughout the world and some are found in most countries, although a few exist in only one or two locales. Cyathus stercoreus is considered endangered in a number of European countries. Species of Cyathus are also known as splash cups, which refers to the fact that falling raindrops can knock the peridioles out of the open-cup fruit body. The internal and <b>external</b> <b>surfaces</b> of this cup may be ridged longitudinally (referred to as [...] or [...] ); this is one example of a taxonomic characteristic that has traditionally served to distinguish between species.|$|E
40|$|Three Mn(salen) {{catalysts}} were immobilized in nanopores or on <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> of mesoporous materials via phenyl sulfonic {{groups with}} different linkage lengths. The {{influence of the}} axial linkage length and the nanopores or <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> of supports on the catalytic performance of the heterogeneous Mn(salen) catalysts was investigated in detail. The ee values increase with increasing linkage length for the Mn(salen) catalysts immobilized in nanopores but remain almost unchanged for those catalysts anchored on the <b>external</b> <b>surface.</b> The ee values obtained for the Mn(salen) catalysts immobilized in nanopore increase with decreasing nanopore size and they are generally {{higher than those of}} the same catalysts anchored on the <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> of support. Modification of the nanopore surface by methyl groups improves the reaction performance for the asymmetric epoxidation. The confinement effect originating from nanopores not only enhances the chiral recognition of the chiral catalyst, but also restricts the rotation of the intermediate in nanopores, enhancing the asymmetric induction and giving higher ee values than those obtained for the same catalysts anchored oil the <b>external</b> <b>Surface.</b> (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The dynamic charge {{acceptance}} (DCA) of modern lead-carbon batteries {{is one of}} the key parameters for their future application in micro- and mild-hybrid cars. This work elucidates the impact of the <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> area of carbon additives on the electrochemical performance of lead-carbon electrodes with respect to the DCA. Five specially synthesized amorphous hard carbon powders with different specific <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> area ranging from 13 m 2 g− 1 to 192 m 2 g− 1 were added to the negative active material of laboratory lead-carbon test cells. Results from cyclic voltammetry reveal that the specific <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> area of amorphous carbons exhibits a clear correlation to the electrochemical activity of lead-carbon electrodes. Firstly, an almost linear increase of the activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction with increasing specific <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> area of the carbon additive can be found. Secondly, the specific double-layer capacity of the negative active material is directly linked to the specific <b>external</b> <b>surface</b> area of the additive, as well. Thirdly, a clear correlation to the DCA can be established. In conclusion, a high specific <b>external</b> carbon <b>surface</b> in the negative active material seems to be a key to improve the dynamic {{charge acceptance}} of modern lead-carbon batteries...|$|R

2500|$|John Bernadou {{patented}} a single-base propellant {{while working}} at the Naval Torpedo Station in 1897. Bernadou's colloid of nitrocellulose with ether and alcohol was formulated for the reaction pressures generated within naval artillery. The colloid was extruded in dense cylinders with longitudinal perforations to decompose in accordance with Piobert's law. If all <b>external</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the grain are ignited simultaneously, the grain reacts inward from {{the outside of the}} cylinder (creating a reaction area of decreasing size), and outward from each perforation (creating a reaction area of increasing size.) Propellant decomposition is initiated by heat causing the colloid to melt and form bubbles of reactive gas which decompose in a luminous exothermic reaction after the bubbles burst. [...] Rate of reaction is controlled by heat transfer through the temperature gradient from the luminous reacting gas through the bubbles to the intact colloid. Heat transfer (and rate of reaction) is faster if the bubbles are under pressure, because heat transfer is more efficient through smaller bubbles. These propellants may not react satisfactorily at low pressures within the oxygen-deficient atmosphere of a gun barrel.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Tye {{holds the}} opinion {{there are no}} qualia, no [...] "veils of perception" [...] {{between us and the}} referents of our thought. He {{describes}} our experience of an object in the world as [...] "transparent". By this he means that no matter what private understandings and/or misunderstandings we may have of some public entity, it is still there before us in reality. The idea that qualia intervene between ourselves and their origins he regards as [...] "a massive error"; as he says, [...] "it is just not credible that visual experiences are systematically misleading in this way"; [...] "the only objects of which you are aware are the external ones making up the scene before your eyes"; there are [...] "no such things as the qualities of experiences" [...] for [...] "they are qualities of <b>external</b> <b>surfaces</b> (and volumes and films) if they are qualities of anything." [...] This insistence permits him to take our experience as having a reliable base since there is no fear of losing contact with the realness of public objects.|$|E

60|$|Colour and Structure of Valves.--The <b>external</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the scuta and terga are yellow {{along the}} middle, plainly marked by zones of growth, and finely ribbed longitudinally: the {{internal}} surfaces {{and sides of}} the horns of the two valves, are coloured fine blue or purple; in the terga, however, the internal surface is mottled with yellow. In some specimens, especially in one from Tavoy, each zone of growth was only very narrowly edged with blue. When a thin layer is removed {{from one of the}} valves, the dark blue or rather purple appears by transmitted light a beautiful pale blue; and it is a very singular fact, that this blue portion is permanently turned by very gentle into a fiery red; the same singular effect is produced by muriatic and acetic acids. This blue part is much harder than the yellow; the latter exhibits, under a high power, a folded structure, and is penetrated by a few tubuli, whereas the harder blue portion has a cellular or scaled appearance. The spines of the peduncle exhibit, in a smaller degree, similar phenomena.|$|E
60|$|Description.--The {{capitulum}} is {{not much}} compressed, a horizontal section giving an oval figure; it is placed obliquely on the peduncle, the scuta descending lower than the terga and carina. There are eight valves, of which the scuta, terga, and carina are large; the rostrum {{and a pair of}} latera are very small and often rudimentary. These three latter valves are essentially distinguished from the scales of the peduncle, the upper ones of which they sometimes hardly exceed in size, by not being moulted at each period of exuviation. The latera overlie the carinal half of the terga; I presume that they are homologous with the carinal latera in Scalpellum. Each successive layer of shell forming the valves is thick, and extends over nearly the whole inner surface; hence the carina and terga, and to a certain extent the scuta, either actually do project freely much beyond the sack, or would have done so, had not their upper ends been removed; for the upper and old layers of shell, in most of the species, either scale off or disintegrate and wear away. A rectangularly projecting rim, serrated by small teeth, is formed at the bottom of each fresh layer of growth, along the <b>external</b> <b>surfaces</b> of each valve (see upper part of fig. 1 b´ Pl. VIII.) This structure, {{as well as that of}} the crenated scales on the peduncle, is important, for by this means the animal, as we shall presently see, forms and enlarges the cavity in the rock or shell in which it is imbedded.|$|E
60|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the cups, in L. dorsalis and L. Rhodiopus, I most distinctly traced the two cement-ducts; they included the usual darker chord of cellular matter; they were of rather small diameter, namely, 2/3000th of an inch. The two (in L. dorsalis) ran in a very irregular course, not parallel to each other, making the most abrupt bends. They passed through the membranous layers, (as seen after dissolution,) and running for short spaces parallel to the component laminæ, were attached to them. In their irregular course, these cement-ducts resemble those of Pollicipes mitella, but I could not perceive that any cement had been poured out at the abrupt bends. In one specimen of a basal cup, which I was enabled to examine whilst still attached to the rock, I found under the very centre, (and of course outside the yellow membrane,) a very small area of dark brown cement of the usual appearance. In several specimens of full-sized cups, I was not able to perceive any cement on the <b>external</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the upper and later-formed layers; hence I believe that the cup is cemented {{to the bottom of the}} hole only during the early stages of its formation; and this, considering its protected situation, would no doubt be sufficient to affix the animal. This probably accounts for the small size of the cement-ducts, and for the facility with which, as it appears, the cups can be removed in an unbroken condition from the rock. In the case, however, of the small, flat, calcareous discs, which are formed whilst the animal is burrowing into the rock, these are attached firmly to the sides of the holes, in the usual manner, by cement. In this cirripede it would be useless to look for the prehensile antennæ of the larva under the cup, for the animal, during the formation of the successive discs, must have travelled some distance from the spot on which the larva first attached itself.|$|E
