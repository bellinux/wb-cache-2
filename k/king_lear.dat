5|$|Khachaturian wrote {{incidental}} {{music for}} several plays, including Macbeth (1934, 1955), The Widow from Valencia (1940), Masquerade (1941), <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> (1958).|$|E
5|$|Waterston {{has also}} {{appeared}} in a numerous stage productions, both Broadway and off-Broadway, such as La Turista (1967), Halfway Up the Tree (1967), Henry IV, Part 1, as well as Henry IV, Part 2 (1968), Hamlet (1972, 1975–76, 2008), Much Ado About Nothing (1972–73, 2004), The Tempest (1974, 2015), Measure for Measure (1976) and <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> (2011).|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt often focuses, as well, on {{specific}} traits {{by comparing the}} characters not to those of real life but to characters in Shakespeare's other plays, comparing, for example, Iago with Edmund in <b>King</b> <b>Lear.</b> His interest {{in the art of}} drama emerges even more obviously when he compares Iago with the villainous character Zanga in Edward Young's The Revenge (1721), still a popular play in Hazlitt's day.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm McDowell as Marcus Kane, {{a former}} {{scientist}} {{who now lives}} as a feudal lord in an abandoned castle, having medieval army under his command and controlling parts of the country. McDowell described his character as a <b>King</b> <b>Lear.</b> According to Marshall, Kane is based on Kurtz from Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The director originally sought to bring Sean Connery out of retirement to play Kane but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{produced}} {{most of his}} known work between 1589 and 1613. His early plays {{were primarily}} comedies and histories, which are regarded {{as some of the}} best work ever produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until about 1608, including Hamlet, Othello, <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> and Macbeth, considered some of the finest works in the English language. In his last phase, he wrote tragicomedies, also known as romances and collaborated with other playwrights.|$|E
5|$|The third, and final, season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played <b>King</b> <b>Lear,</b> and Richardson, Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be cast the other way about, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Richardson's other roles in the season were Inspector Goole in An Inspector Calls, Face in The Alchemist and John of Gaunt in Richard II, which he directed, with Alec Guinness in the title role.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 he {{returned}} to the Royal Shakespeare Company, in productions of <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> and The Seagull, both directed by Trevor Nunn. In 2009 he appeared in a very popular revival of Waiting for Godot at London's Haymarket Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias, and playing opposite Patrick Stewart. He is Patron of English Touring Theatre and also President and Patron of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain, an association of amateur theatre organisations throughout the UK. In late August 2012, he took part in the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics, portraying Prospero from The Tempest.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot (Old Father Goriot, 1835) was {{his next}} success, in which Balzac transposes {{the story of}} <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> to 1820s Paris in order to rage at a society bereft of all love save the love of money. The {{centrality}} of a father in this novel matches Balzac's own position—not only as mentor to his troubled young secretary, Jules Sandeau, but {{also the fact that}} he had fathered a child, Marie-Caroline Du Fresnay, with his otherwise-married lover, Maria Du Fresnay, who had been his source of inspiration for Eugénie Grandet.|$|E
5|$|A modern {{review was}} given by University of York Professor Judith Buchanan. Buchanan recognizes that the film's acting was commended for its action and {{highlights}} the acting of the fool, placed prominently in the foreground, and says that {{it seems as if}} he has been imported from <b>King</b> <b>Lear.</b> This fool serves as an exaggerated proxy for the audience and filters a set of responses for the audience and goes on to steal the reunion scene with his expressions. Buchanan says that adapting the Shakespeare play to the one reel format required foreknowledge of the subject for audiences to intelligibly follow the subject. Buchanan also notes that this transitional period included lecturers who were hired to give supplementary lectures or commentary on the film being exhibited and the additional commentary for Shakespeare adaptations was desirable.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{influenced}} novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is {{a classic}} tragic hero, inspired by <b>King</b> <b>Lear.</b> Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Otello and Falstaff, whose critical standing compares {{with that of the}} source plays. Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated Macbeth into German. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{success of}} Kagemusha allowed Kurosawa {{to proceed with}} his next project, Ran, another epic in a similar vein. The script, partly based on William Shakespeare's <b>King</b> <b>Lear,</b> depicted a ruthless, bloodthirsty daimyō (warlord), played by Tatsuya Nakadai, who, after foolishly banishing his one loyal son, surrenders his kingdom to his other two sons, who then betray him, thus plunging the entire kingdom into war. As Japanese studios still felt wary about producing another film that would rank among the most expensive ever made in the country, international help was again needed. This time it came from French producer Serge Silberman, who had produced Luis Buñuel's final movies. Filming did not begin until December 1983 and lasted more than a year.|$|E
5|$|Balakirev's despotism {{strained}} {{the relationship}} between him and Tchaikovsky but both men still appreciated each other's abilities. Despite their friction, Balakirev proved the only man to persuade Tchaikovsky to rewrite a work several times, as he would with Romeo and Juliet. At Balakirev's suggestion, Tchaikovsky based the work on Balakirev's <b>King</b> <b>Lear,</b> a tragic overture in sonata form after the example of Beethoven's concert overtures. It was Tchaikovsky's idea to reduce the plot to one central conflict and represent it musically with the binary structure of sonata form. However, the execution of that plot in the music we know today came only after two radical revisions. Balakirev discarded many of the early drafts Tchaikovsky sent him and, with the flurry of suggestions between the two men, the piece was constantly in the mail between Moscow and Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Since 1949, a more {{detailed}} classification system has been put into use based on thematic content and the historical period of a play's creation. The first category in this system is chuantongxi, traditional plays that were in performance before 1949. The second category is xinbian de lishixi, historical plays written after 1949. This type of play was not produced at all during the Cultural Revolution, but is a major focus today. The final category is xiandaixi, contemporary plays. The subject matter of these plays is taken from the 20th century and beyond. Contemporary productions are also frequently experimental in nature, and may incorporate Western influences. In {{the second half of}} the 20th century, Western works have increasingly been adapted for Peking opera. The works of Shakespeare have been especially popular. The movement to adapt Shakespeare to the stage has encompassed all forms of Chinese theatre. Peking opera in particular has seen versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream and <b>King</b> <b>Lear,</b> among others.|$|E
5|$|Adler was {{not content}} to {{continue}} long in this mode, and sought a playwright who could create pieces that would appeal to the Jewish public, while still providing a type of theater he could be proud to perform. He recruited Jacob Gordin, already a well-respected novelist and intellectual, recently arrived in New York and eking out {{a living as a}} journalist at the Arbeiter Zeitung, precursor to The Forward. Gordin's first two plays, Siberia and Two Worlds were commercial failures—so much so that Mogulesko and Kessler quit the company—but The Yiddish <b>King</b> <b>Lear,</b> starring Adler and his new wife Sara was such a success that the play eventually transferred to Finkel's larger National Theater. This play (based only very loosely on Shakespeare) played well with the popular audience, but also with Jewish intellectuals who until this time had largely ignored Yiddish Theater, ending for a time the commercial dominance of operettas such as those of Horowitz and Joseph Lateiner. The next year, Gordin's The Wild Man solidified this change in the direction of Yiddish theater, which was entering what is retrospectively seen as its first period of greatness.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{localized}} for the West by Atlus USA. The project leader was Bill Alexander, the lead translator was Sammy Matsushima, while dialogue editing was handled by Mike Meeker. As with their other localizations such {{as for the}} Persona series, the team tried to stay faithful to the original text. This proved easier than for the Persona series as its fictional setting meant there were no cultural in-jokes {{that would not be}} understood outside Japan. The localization took place from 2006 to 2007: the project was an unusual one for Atlus, as it was an entirely new intellectual property from a studio that was still little known in the West. When tasked with localizing the game for Western markets, the team were told that the game had a Shakespearean feel, so Matsushima created a script that reflected that: with the concept of a play in mind, the dialogue was written to give a noble feel to the characters, in addition to fairy tale elements fitting in with its frame story of a girl reading books. For his part, Meeker read <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> and A Midsummer Night's Dream to find the correct style for his writing, in addition to reading Beowulf to properly capture the narrative's darker elements.|$|E
5|$|The third, and final, London season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played <b>King</b> <b>Lear,</b> and Richardson took {{the title role}} in Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be reversed, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Olivier's Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline and madness {{towards the end of the}} play some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic James Agate suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of Cyrano, Richardson was knighted, to Olivier's undisguised envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to the new chairman of the Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame.|$|E
5|$|This debut made Young {{the first}} Princeton {{baseball}} player {{to start a}} major league game at any position since Dave Sisler (son of Hall of Famer George Sisler and brother of Dick Sisler) gave up six earned runs in just over four innings on August 27, 1961 {{in the second game}} of a doubleheader against the Detroit Tigers. The game also marked the first appearance in a major league game by a Princeton baseball player since Bob Tufts played his final game for the Kansas City Royals on May 6, 1983. Other Princeton baseball players who have recorded either 50 innings pitched or 130 at bats (the requirements to qualify for Rookie of the Year) in the major leagues are Moe Berg, Homer Hillebrand, <b>King</b> <b>Lear,</b> Dutch Meier, Dutch Sterrett, and Bobby Vaughn. Young has been joined in the major leagues by Princetonian Ross Ohlendorf who debuted for the New York Yankees on September 11, 2007. Another Princetonian, Tim Lahey, was on the Philadelphia Phillies roster from the team's Opening Day on March 31, 2008 until April 5, 2008 without making an appearance.|$|E
25|$|The History of <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> is an {{adaptation}} by Nahum Tate of William Shakespeare's <b>King</b> <b>Lear.</b> It {{first appeared in}} 1681, some seventy-five years after Shakespeare's version, and {{is believed to have}} replaced Shakespeare's version on the English stage {{in whole or in part}} until 1838.|$|E
25|$|Re Lear (<b>King</b> <b>Lear),</b> 1856. Librettist Antonio Somma {{worked with}} Verdi on {{completing}} a libretto for an opera based on Shakespeare's <b>King</b> <b>Lear.</b> This libretto {{was based on}} an incomplete one written by librettist Salvatore Cammarano before he died in 1852. It was never set to music.|$|E
25|$|Also {{appeared}} in A Little Hotel on the Side; <b>King</b> <b>Lear,</b> Manitoba Theatre Centre; Neil Simon's London Suite.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, he {{designed}} the sets and costumes for a controversial theatre production of <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> starring John Gielgud.|$|E

25|$|Before {{returning}} to Rome, Berlioz composed his overtures to <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> in Nice and Rob Roy, and {{began work on}} a sequel to the Symphonie fantastique, Le retour à la vie (The Return to Life), renamed Lélio in 1855.|$|E
25|$|Welles briefly {{returned}} to America {{to make his}} first appearance on television, starring in the Omnibus presentation of <b>King</b> <b>Lear,</b> broadcast live on CBS October 18, 1953. Directed by Peter Brook, the production costarred Natasha Parry, Beatrice Straight and Arnold Moss.|$|E
25|$|Psychogenic amnesia is {{a common}} fictional plot device in many films and books and other media. Examples include Shakespeare's <b>King</b> <b>Lear,</b> who {{experienced}} amnesia and madness following a betrayal by his daughters; and the title character Nina in Nicolas Dalayrac's 1786 opera.|$|E
25|$|Late 9th century – 8th century BC – According to Geoffrey of Monmouth, Queen Cordelia, on {{whom the}} {{character}} in Shakespeare's <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> is based, battled her nephews {{for control of}} her kingdom. However, Geoffrey of Monmouth is not considered a reliable historical source.|$|E
25|$|The first {{professional}} performances of <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> in North America {{are likely to}} have been those of the Hallam Company (later the American Company) which arrived in Virginia in 1752 and who counted the play among their repertoire by the time of their departure for Jamaica in 1774.|$|E
25|$|The current {{name was}} in use {{at least by}} the time of Shakespeare's <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> (between 1603 and 1606), in which the town and its cliffs play a {{prominent}} role. The sight of the white cliffs when approaching Dover may have given the island of Britain its ancient name of Albion.|$|E
25|$|The middle {{grouping}} of Shakespeare's plays begins in 1599 with Julius Caesar. For {{the next few}} years, Shakespeare would produce his most famous dramas, including Macbeth, Hamlet, and <b>King</b> <b>Lear.</b> The plays during this period are {{in many ways the}} darkest of Shakespeare's career and address issues such as betrayal, murder, lust, power and egoism.|$|E
25|$|Collaboration between Music and Drama {{departments}} {{has yielded}} {{a range of}} productions. In recent years this has included a senior musical production of High Society, as well as performances of William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, Twelfth Night, and <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> and Alan Bennett's The Madness of King George. Junior Productions have included Fiddler on the Roof and Beauty and the Beast.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} in February 2014 that {{he would return to}} Central Park's Delacorte Theater and Shakespeare in the Park for the 2014 summer season in the title role of Shakespeare's <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> directed by Tony Award Winner Daniel Sullivan. The production was the play's first there since 1973 and Lithgow's first time there since 1975, when he had played Laertes.|$|E
25|$|Purefoy's early {{professional}} roles included Romeo in Romeo and Juliet in Leatherhead, Walter in Mary Morgan at the Riverside Studios and Alan Strang in Equus on tour. He subsequently {{joined the}} Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1988 and appeared in The Constant Couple, Macbeth, The Tempest, The Man Who Came to Dinner (Gene Saks, Barbican) and <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> as Edgar.|$|E
25|$|No less {{important}} was Richard Burbage. He {{was the lead}} actor of the Chamberlain's Men, who played Hamlet and Othello, and {{would go on to}} play <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> and Macbeth in the new reign of King James, among many other roles. Though relatively little-known in 1594, he would {{become one of the most}} famous of Renaissance actors, achieving a fame and wealth exceeded only by Alleyn's.|$|E
25|$|Whatever {{the reason}} for his departure, Kempe was {{replaced}} by Robert Armin, formerly of Chandos's Men and an author in his own right. Small and fanciful, Armin offered significantly different options for Shakespeare, and the change is seen in the last Elizabethan and first Jacobean plays. Armin is generally credited with originating such characters as Feste in Twelfth Night, Touchstone in As You Like It, and the fool in <b>King</b> <b>Lear.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known {{performance of}} Shakespeare's <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> is one {{which took place}} at the court of King James I on 26 December 1606. Some scholars believe that it was not well received, as there are few surviving references to it. The theatres were closed during the Puritan Revolution, and while records from the period are incomplete, Shakespeare's Lear is only known to have been performed twice more, after the Restoration, before being replaced by Tate's version.|$|E
25|$|Although {{credited}} uncritically {{well into}} the 16th century, it is now considered to have no value as history. When events described, such as Julius Caesar's invasions of Britain, can be corroborated from contemporary histories, Geoffrey's account {{can be seen to}} be wildly inaccurate. It remains, however, a valuable piece of medieval literature, which contains the earliest known version of the story of <b>King</b> <b>Lear</b> and his three daughters, and helped popularise the legend of King Arthur.|$|E
