40|$|The {{development}} of an electronic primary flight <b>display</b> <b>format</b> aligned with the aircraft velocity vector, a simulation evaluation comparing this format with an electronic attitude-aligned primary flight <b>display</b> <b>format,</b> and a flight evaluation of the velocity-vector-aligned <b>display</b> <b>format</b> are described. Earlier tests in turbulent conditions with the electronic attitude-aligned <b>display</b> <b>format</b> had exhibited unsteadiness. A primary objective of aligning the <b>display</b> <b>format</b> with the velocity vector was {{to take advantage of}} a velocity-vector control-wheel steering system to provide steadiness of display during turbulent conditions. Better situational awareness under crosswind conditions was also achieved. The evaluation task was a curved, descending approach with turbulent and crosswind conditions. Primary flight <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> contained computer-drawn perspective runway images and flight-path angle information. The flight tests were conducted aboard the NASA Transport Systems Research Vehicle (TSRV). Comparative results of the simulation and flight tests were principally obtained from subjective commentary. Overall, the pilots preferred the <b>display</b> <b>format</b> aligned with the velocity vector...|$|R
40|$|During a Space Shuttle mission, astronauts in {{the cockpit}} can view any {{one of dozens of}} <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> {{containing}} vehicle and mission-critical information. During launch, for example, the crew may view a <b>display</b> <b>format</b> showing tank pressures associated with the main engines. During orbit, the crew no longer needs main engine data, and might instead call up a <b>display</b> <b>format</b> containing details of the robotic arm that controls the payload. In the original cockpit, <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> were viewed on four cathode ray tubes (CRTs). In part due to the limitations of the CRTs, the <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> were monochrome and mostly text-based, with almost no graphical content. Currently, the cockpit of each Space Shuttle is being upgraded. A key aspect of the upgrades is the replacement of the four CRTs with 11 color liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The new LCDs have greatly expanded graphics capabilities compared to the CRTs. However, the <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> presented on the LCDs are largely identical copies of the original <b>display</b> <b>formats.</b> Now that the LCDs have been proven in flight to be reliable and effective, NASA is exploiting the expanded color and graphics capabilities of the LCDs to design a new generation of more userfriendly <b>display</b> <b>formats.</b> The proposed formats make systematic and logical use of color.

40|$|This study {{identifies}} improved {{methods to}} present system parameter information for detecting abnormal conditions {{and to identify}} system status. Two workstation experiments were conducted. The first experiment determined if including expected-value-range information in traditional parameter <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> affected subject performance. The second experiment determined if using a nontraditional parameter <b>display</b> <b>format,</b> which presented relative deviation from expected value, was better than traditional formats with expected-value ranges included. The inclusion of expected-value-range information onto traditional parameter formats {{was found to have}} essentially no effect. However, subjective results indicated support for including this information. The nontraditional column deviation parameter <b>display</b> <b>format</b> resulted in significantly fewer errors compared with traditional formats with expected-value-ranges included. In addition, error rates for the column deviation parameter <b>display</b> <b>format</b> remained stable as the scenario complexity increased, whereas error rates for the traditional parameter <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> with expected-value ranges increased. Subjective results also indicated that the subjects preferred this new format and thought that their performance was better with it. The column deviation parameter <b>display</b> <b>format</b> is recommended for display applications that require rapid recognition of out-of-tolerance conditions, especially for a large number of parameters...|$|R

40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{experiment was}} conducted using the NASA Ames Research Center Vertical Motion Simulator to evaluate two cockpit <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> designed for manual control on steep instrument approaches for a civil transport tiltrotor aircraft. The first display included a four-cue (pitch, roll, power lever position, and nacelle angle movement prompt) flight director. The second <b>display</b> <b>format</b> provided instantaneous {{flight path angle}} information together with other symbols for terminal area guidance. Pilots evaluated these <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> for an instrument approach task which required a level flight conversion from airplane-mode flight to helicopter-mode flight while decelerating to the nominal approach airspeed. Pilots tracked glide slopes of 6, 9, 15 and 25 degrees, terminating in a hover for a vertical landing on a 150 feet square vertipad. Approaches were conducted with low visibility and ceilings and with crosswinds and turbulence, with all aircraft systems functioning normally and were carried through to a landing. Desired approach and tracking performance was achieved with generally satisfactory handling qualities using either <b>display</b> <b>format</b> on glide slopes up through 15 degrees. Evaluations with both <b>display</b> <b>formats</b> for a 25 degree glide slope revealed serious problems with glide slope tracking at low airspeeds in crosswinds {{and the loss of}} the intended landing spot from the cockpit field of view...|$|R

The attitude information, in essence, framed the tactical <b>display</b> <b>format.</b> A comparison was conducted among variations of the original background attitude indicator (BAI) created by General Dynamics personnel.
