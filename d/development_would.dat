5|$|In April 2006, Brentwood Borough Council {{announced}} that a new housing <b>development</b> <b>would</b> include a road named Rollason Way in her memory. Additionally, eleven apartment blocks within the <b>development</b> <b>would</b> be named after people associated with Rollason or winners of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. The building names on Rollason Way include Adlington House, Boardman Place, Radcliffe House, Christie Court, Redgrave Court, Botham House, Faldo Court, Whitbread Place, Torvill Court, and MacArthur Place.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, Williams {{announced}} that he was behind a proposal to develop 2400 acres of land in St. John's. The mixed-use <b>development</b> <b>would</b> include residential, commercial and industrial space, the value of the development is estimated at $5 billion over 10 to 20 years.|$|E
5|$|With the cap {{on growth}} {{in the town of}} Banff, Canmore, located just outside the Banff boundary, has been growing rapidly to serve {{increasing}} demands of tourists. Major development proposals for Canmore have included the Three Sisters Golf Resorts, proposed in 1992, which {{has been the subject of}} contentious debate, with environmental groups arguing that the <b>development</b> <b>would</b> fragment important wildlife corridors in the Bow Valley.|$|E

5|$|According to Air Chief Marshal Sir Patrick Hine, Hawker's {{interest}} {{may have}} also been stimulated {{by the presence of}} Air Staff Requirement 345, which sought a V/STOL ground attack fighter for the Royal Air Force (RAF). Aviation author Francis K. Mason expressed a contrary view, stating that Hawker's decision to proceed was independent of British government initiatives, and that the P.1127 project was primarily based upon the NATO requirement instead. Hawker had a keen ally in its development in the form of Bristol, but by that point the latter was experiencing financial difficulties, and the lack of foreseeable commercial applications for the Pegasus engine in particular, coupled with refusals from HM Treasury, mean that <b>development</b> <b>would</b> have to be financed by NATO institutions instead. The close cooperation between Hawker and Bristol was viewed by project engineer Gordon Lewis as a key factors which had enabled the P.1127's development to proceed in spite of technical obstacles and political setbacks.|$|E
5|$|Another {{meeting on}} the issue was called on 6 December 1966, {{attended}} by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took {{the side of the}} JCS and it appeared that <b>development</b> <b>would</b> start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was to simply build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an arms limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations with the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{the college}} {{announced}} an extensive expansion of its campus, including new halls of residence, a sports and complementary therapy building {{and a new}} outdoor floodlit sports pitch. The £21.5m sports <b>development</b> <b>would</b> be the venue for the 2010 World Blind Football Championship. A £10 million fundraising campaign, Building Brighter Futures, was created to raise the funds required to complete the project, and construction work began {{in the summer of}} 2007. The complex, thePoint4, was originally named The Point after a nearby block of flats. It includes a bistro and conference facilities, and commenced operation in April 2009, and was officially opened on 24 June by BBC sports presenter and Daily Mail columnist Des Kelly. In 2008 the college was nominated as one of the sites for the 2012 Paralympic Games and acted as a pre-Games training camp for Paralympic athletes.|$|E
5000|$|Planning {{appeals in}} {{relation}} to minor <b>developments</b> <b>would</b> be heard {{by a panel of}} local councillors and not by a planning inspector.|$|R
50|$|The Soviet Union, {{also showed}} mistrust towards the Philippines {{due to its}} strong ties with the United States. Any <b>development</b> that <b>would</b> lead towards the eroding of the ties between the Philippines and the United States would be welcomed by the union, but the Soviet Union itself {{admitted}} that those <b>developments</b> <b>would</b> be limited.|$|R
5000|$|On December 10, 2010 it was {{revealed}} that some of the announced planned <b>developments</b> <b>would</b> be released as netKar Pro v.1.3 on Christmas 2010. This update would contain: ...|$|R
5|$|Maverick Hunter was in {{development}} by Armature Studio and {{was to be}} published by Capcom for the Mega Man X series. The collaboration was established by Keiji Inafune, who had previously worked on the Mega Man series as an artist and producer. He had since rose in the ranks at Capcom to become a producer. The goal was to attract a new audience to the Mega Man series. Its <b>development</b> <b>would</b> have been overseen by former Capcom producer Ben Judd. The redesign for the Mega Man character was to be done by Adi Granov (the concept artist responsible for the Iron Man redesign found in the 2008 film of the same name). An initial concept design showed X with a red glowing 'X' on his face.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Crawley Borough Council began {{discussions with}} {{neighbouring}} Horsham District Council in 2006 {{in connection with}} a proposed neighbourhood west of Bewbush; such <b>development</b> <b>would</b> straddle the boundary of the two local authorities. Planning permission was granted in March 2011, the name Kilnwood Vale was adopted, and in October 2011 Crawley Borough Council sold for £3 million some areas of land required for the construction of access roads. Work on the five-phase scheme started in October 2012. Up to 2,500 houses, a school, library, supermarket and other facilities will be provided.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{weapons were}} {{developed}} during World War II by the wartime Manhattan Project. Key scientists {{working on the}} project anticipated that their <b>development</b> <b>would</b> have wide-ranging implications. However the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., was reluctant to spend project funds on activities beyond those required to win the war. Nonetheless, Arthur Compton of the Metallurgical Project in Chicago commissioned a report on post-war nuclear energy, and the Military Policy Committee, the Manhattan Project's governing body, commissioned a similar study by Richard Tolman. Both reports called for a comprehensive, government-supported nuclear energy program, with military, scientific, and industrial aspects.|$|E
50|$|These <b>developments</b> <b>would</b> have {{grammatical}} consequences. For example, Old Gujarati's instrumental-locative singular in -i was leveled and eliminated, {{having become}} {{the same as}} Old Gujarati's nominative/accusative singular in -ə.|$|R
50|$|In short, BC {{pursued the}} Columbia River Treaty because it {{provided}} a unique opportunity for hydroelectric <b>development</b> that otherwise <b>would</b> {{not have been possible}} (due to the financial situation of the province during that period). It was the hope that these <b>developments</b> <b>would</b> promote industrial growth within the province and help expand the economy.|$|R
50|$|Member States were {{requested}} to provide troops, police, personnel, equipment and logistical support. The situation in Haiti {{would be kept}} under review and any recommendations {{in the light of}} new <b>developments</b> <b>would</b> be considered.|$|R
5|$|On November 18, 2010, Dunderdale and Premier Williams {{were joined}} by Nova Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter in announcing a $6.2billion {{agreement}} to develop {{the first phase of}} the Lower Churchill Project. Nalcor Energy, a Newfoundland and Labrador Crown corporation, signed a partnership agreement with Emera Inc. of Nova Scotia to develop the 824megawatts Muskrat Falls. The hydro <b>development</b> <b>would</b> see power from the falls transferred from Labrador to the island of Newfoundland via an underwater transmission link through the Strait of Belle Isle. Another underwater transmission link across the Gulf of St. Lawrence would bring power to Nova Scotia. Newfoundland and Labrador will use 40 percent of the hydro power itself and will be able to shut down the oil-burning Holyrood Thermal Generating Station. Emera Inc. will get 20% of the power for $1.2billion to sell to customers in Nova Scotia. The remaining 40 percent will be sold by Nalcor Energy to markets in Atlantic Canada and the Northeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|STAC {{suggested}} that two designs naturally {{fell out of}} their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan {{suggested that}} a 150-passenger transatlantic SST would cost about £75 to £90million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps £50 to £80million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, <b>development</b> <b>would</b> need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962. Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Some {{licences}} {{have not}} been renewed; for example, the RMC Aggregates quarry at Eldon Hill was forced to close in 1999, and landscaping is ongoing. The proposals dating from 1999 from Stancliffe Stone Ltd to re-open dormant gritstone quarries at Stanton Moor {{have been seen as}} a test case. They are hotly contested by ecological protesters and local residents on grounds that the <b>development</b> <b>would</b> threaten nearby Bronze Age remains, in particular the Nine Ladies Stone Circle, as well as the natural landscape locally. As of 2007, negotiations are ongoing to shift the development to the nearby Dale View quarry, a less sensitive area.|$|E
5000|$|A new Community Infrastructure Levy on <b>developments</b> <b>would</b> finance {{infrastructure}} (money {{would be}} raised from developers {{to pay for}} the facilities needed as a consequence of new developments, such as schools, hospitals and sewage plants).|$|R
30|$|The {{built-in}} redundancy and {{overlap between}} some criteria {{would ensure that}} passing <b>developments</b> <b>would</b> help the City of New Bern change the growth trajectory from standardized and fragmented subdivisions to more integrated and sustainable urban and suburban regions.|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{surprise}} election of pro a western government in Lebanon during June 2009, [...] Uruguay congratulated the President Michel Suleiman, the new government, {{and the people}} of Lebanon saying they hoped recent <b>developments</b> <b>would</b> unite them with very close ties.|$|R
5|$|The {{operation}} was planned {{in a matter}} of hours following a meeting between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke, during which Holbrooke urged Tuđman to seize Prijedor and threaten to capture Banja Luka from the VRS, short of actually seizing the city, as he believed such a <b>development</b> <b>would</b> force Bosnian Serb leaders to the negotiating table. Inadequate planning and preparation, combined with flawed military intelligence on the defending force and disregard for the high water level of the Una and Sava rivers, led to a high number of casualties and little success. The offensive was called off one day after it was launched and the bridgeheads were evacuated. The HV ultimately blamed Major General Vinko Vrbanac for its failure. Vrbanac had authorized the offensive instead of deferring to the Chief of the General Staff General Zvonimir Červenko.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} {{to build a}} wind farm, in {{a joint venture between}} United Utilities and Peel Holdings, was announced in 2003. Shortly afterwards a pressure group, The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor, was formed, and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury's, Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans. At the meeting, the spokesperson for the group said that, although they supported the use of alternative energy, they felt that this was the wrong area. Among the objections were that the scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the Green Belt, and would adversely affect common land, open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value. The group also considered that the proposed <b>development</b> <b>would</b> be out of scale with the landscape, adversely affecting peat, water courses and wildlife, and would have a seriously detrimental visual impact, as well as causing a noise nuisance.|$|E
5|$|There {{had also}} been {{criticism}} of the proposed definition of double planet: at present the Moon {{is defined as a}} satellite of the Earth, but over time the Earth-Moon barycenter will drift outwards (see tidal acceleration) and could eventually become situated outside of both bodies. This <b>development</b> <b>would</b> then upgrade the Moon to planetary status at that time, according to the redefinition. The time taken for this to occur, however, would be billions of years, long after many astronomers expect the Sun to expand into a red giant and destroy both Earth and Moon.|$|E
50|$|It {{was thought}} that Prologis, {{the parent company of}} Parkridge <b>Developments</b> <b>would</b> base a {{transport}} depot at this location giving trucks/lorries easy access to the region's road and motorway network. The ecological/environmental impact of this development was yet to be determined.|$|R
50|$|In August 2011, an {{editorial}} in the New Zealand Herald gave conditional support to the newest proposal, noting that a toll-based funding model and the partially enclosed weather-protected design of the $23 million proposal by Hopper <b>Developments</b> <b>would</b> appear to cover most concerns.|$|R
50|$|The London Sustainable Development Commission has {{calculated}} that for housing {{to meet the}} 60% target, all new <b>developments</b> <b>would</b> have to be constructed to be carbon-neutral with immediate effect (using zero energy building techniques), in addition to cutting energy used in existing housing by 40%.|$|R
5|$|Increased {{precipitation}} {{during the}} Tauca phase was probably {{triggered by the}} southern movement of the ITCZ and the strengthening of the South America monsoon, possibly caused by chilling in the northern hemisphere. Combined with a southern shift of high pressure zones, increased moisture during late glacial times would have flowed from the Amazon. This change, which occurred from 17,400–12,400 years or 18,000–11,000 BP, is recorded in Bolivian Chaco and Brazilian cave records. The Tauca phase may have been triggered by the southern shift of tropical atmospheric circulation. Although another theory posits that vegetation changes and lake <b>development</b> <b>would</b> have decreased the albedo of the Altiplano, resulting in warming and moisture advection of moisture towards the Altiplano, but such positive feedback mechanisms were considered questionable in a 1998 study. Persistent La Niña climatic conditions {{may have contributed to}} the lake's filling. Conversely, a global climatic warming and a northward shift of the monsoon occurred around 14,500 years ago. The ideal conditions for the development of paleolakes in the Altiplano do not appear to exist during maximum glaciation or warm interglacial periods.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of a {{confidential}} agreement in 2007, some <b>development</b> <b>would</b> occur but the Convincing Ground would become a public reservation.|$|E
