60|$|The {{news was}} {{imparted}} with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial {{usage of the}} Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the <b>junior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officer</b> in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth {{in the presence of}} the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac foetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers Sturzgeburt, the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a prima facie and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Telemedicine has revolutionised {{the ability}} to provide care to patients, relieve {{professional}} isolation and provide guidance and supervision to <b>junior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> in rural areas. This study evaluated the Townsville teleoncology supervision model for the training of <b>junior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> in rural areas of North Queensland, Australia. Specifically, the perspectives of <b>junior</b> and senior <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> were explored to identify recommendations for future implementation. Design: A qualitative approach incorporating observation and semistructured interviews was used to collect data. Interviews were uploaded into NVivo 10 data management software. Template analysis enabled themes to be tested and developed through consensus between researchers. Setting: One tertiary level and four secondary level healthcare centres in rural and regional Queensland, Australia. Participants: 10 <b>junior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> (Interns, Registrars) and 10 senior <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> (Senior <b>Medical</b> <b>Officers,</b> Consultants) {{who participated in the}} Townsville teleoncology model of remote supervision via videoconference (TTMRS) were included in the study. Primary and Secondary outcome measures: Perspectives on the telemedicine experience, technology, engagement, professional support, satisfaction and limitations were examined. Perspectives on topics raised by participants were also examined as the interviews progressed. Results: Four major themes with several subthemes emerged from the data: learning environment, beginning the learning relationship, stimulus for learning and practicalities of remote supervision via videoconference. While some themes were consistent with the current literature, new themes like increased professional edge, recognising non-verbal cues and physical examination challenges were identified. Conclusions: Remote supervision via videoconference provides readily available guidance to trainees supporting their delivery of appropriate care to patients. However, resources required for upskilling, training in the use of supervision via videoconference, administration issues and nursing support, as well as physical barriers to examinations, must be addressed to enable more efficient implementation. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} effect of {{clinician}} designation on emergency department (ED) fast track performance. Design and Setting A retrospective audit of patients managed in the fast track area of an ED in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Participants Patients triaged to ED fast track from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2008 (n= 8714). Main Outcome Measures Waiting times in relation to Australasian triage scale (ATS) recommendations and ED length of stay (LOS) for non-admitted patients were examined for each clinician group. Results Compliance with ATS waiting time recommendations was highest (82. 5 %) for emergency nurse practitioners/candidates and lowest (48. 2 %) for <b>junior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers.</b> Median ED LOS was less than 3 h for non-admitted patients, and 85. 8 % of non-admitted fast track patients (n= 6278) left the ED within 4 h. Patients managed by emergency nurse practitioners/ candidates had the shortest ED LOS (median 1. 7 h) and patients managed by <b>junior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> and locum <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> the longest ED LOS (median 2. 7 h) (x&sup 2;= 498. 539, df= 6, p< 0. 001).

50|$|On {{a routine}} trip to Mars, the {{passenger}} liner Johannes Kepler is {{hit by a}} meteoroid, killing the captain and almost all the {{senior members of the}} crew and resulting in the loss of much of the ship's breathable air. Lieutenant Donald Chase, a <b>junior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officer,</b> finds himself the highest-ranked surviving crew member and has to take over the running of the ship. He is helped by Chief Petty Officer Kurikka, who is familiar with the technical aspects; the Mexican scientist Dr Ugalde, a passenger whose mathematical genius enables the new crew to navigate the ship; and various others. Chase solves the air shortage by using the oxygen content of some of the ship's water. Once the situation has stabilised, a passenger, General Mathew Briggs, who had criticised Chase's methods, overthrows him by force with the apparent help of Ugalde. However, it turns out that Ugalde had only pretended to shift his loyalties and Briggs is faced down by Kurikka, defeated and imprisoned. The ship's occupants are also struck by a deadly plague carried by the meteorite, but Chase and his medical colleagues eventually find a cure, although Chase collapses from disease and exhaustion. Recovering in hospital after the ship has docked safely, he is presented with a captain's cap by his crew.|$|E

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comObjectives This study aimed to provide {{better understanding of how}} pre-registration <b>junior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> (PJMOs) make their career choices by investigating when decisions are made, what factors impact on choices, and the role of experience in this process. Methods A third (n = 54) of PJMOs from the 2003 cohort at South Australian teaching hospitals participated in the current research. Inductive content analysis was used to discover themes in data gathered from semistructured interviews. Results Interviews revealed that although 26 % (14 / 54) of participants had made their career decisions in their pre-registration year, 50 % (27 / 54) had still to decide on a career choice. The factors identified as impacting on career choice were grouped into 5 main categories: job satisfaction; lifestyle; career path; training programme, and the wider environment. Depending on the demographic profile of the PJMO, different relative importance was assigned to these factors. The most important elements used to confirm or disconfirm PJMOs' potential career choices were the experiences they had of different specialty areas. Discussion This study allowed an in-depth exploration of the factors that affect the decision-making process of PJMOs. It also found that defined groups of PJMOs place different degrees of importance on these factors, which may have implications for medical workforce planning. It is clear that experience and role models are a crucial component of the career decision-making process. This has importance for specialties that are not incorporated into <b>junior</b> <b>medical</b> training. Caroline Laurence, Taryn Elliot...|$|R
