Samples annealed at 200 and 500 °C (TiO 2 -P- 200, TiO 2 -P- 500) were characterized by nitrogen adsorption, XRD-Rietveld refinements, TEM, FTIR and UV-vis spectroscopies. The photocatalytic test of the sol-gel TiO 2 samples {{was carried out in}} an <b>insulated</b> <b>chamber</b> with 10 ppm of NO, using a 365 -nm UV light lamp; the test results were compared with those obtained with a commercial catalyst (P 25).

The photo-oxidation activity of the sol-gel catalyst annealed at 500 °C (TiO 2 -P- 500) showed changes in its textural and morphologic properties and therefore, less photoactivity.

40|$|In {{the current}} study, a phase change {{material}} (PCM) contained in an insulated concrete block is tested in extremely hot {{weather in the}} United Arab Emirates (UAE) to evaluate its cooling performance. An <b>insulated</b> <b>chamber</b> is constructed behind the block containing PCM to mimic a scaled down indoor space. The effect of placement of the PCM layer on heat gain indoors is studied at two locations: adjacent to the outer {{as well as the}} inner concrete layer. The inclusion of PCM reduced heat gain through concrete blocks compared to blocks without PCM, yielding a drop in cooling load indoors. The placement of PCM and insulation layers adjacent to indoors exhibited better cooling performance compared to that adjacent to the outdoors. In the best case, a temperature drop of 8. 5 % and a time lag of 2. 6 h are achieved in peak indoor temperature, rendering a reduction of 44 % in the heat gain. In the tested hot climate, the higher ambient temperature and the lower wind speed hampered heat dissipation and PCM re-solidification by natural ventilation.

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure proper {{composting}} of sewage sludge {{it is necessary to}} use bulking agents which will create favorable water and air conditions inside the pile and will be an additional source of carbon for the improvement of the C: N ratio of a composted mixture. However, the cereal straw widely used for composting of sewage sludge is very expensive and has a negative impact on the economic balance of the operations of a composting plant. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} novel, alternative materials that can be used as cheap and effective bulking agents for composting of sewage sludge.

40|$|Buildings are a {{significant}} source of energy consumption in the US and worldwide, and conditioning building interiors occupies a major portion of that expenditure. At the building level, a particular scenario can occur where it becomes more advantageous for a structure’s walls to be “open ” to the outside, as opposed to remaining “closed”, in an insulating state. For instance, a cool night may follow a hot summer day after the sun sets, but traditional insulation captures heat built up inside a home. A clear, sunny day may also heat a building’s exterior during a cold winter day, and heat transfer to the interior would be more desirable than insulation. This paper presents a study of a concept, termed “smart insulation”, {{that could be used in}} such scenarios to take advantage of beneficial thermal gradients in order to save heating and cooling costs. Enabling heat transfer without moving air can also help control humidity within interior spaces, as well as limit noise either from moving air or through open windows. Unlike traditional insulation that maintains a specific insulating value during its useful life, smart insulation changes between an insulating and a conducting state depending on the thermal gradient. Some design concepts have been fabricated and were tested in an <b>insulated</b> <b>chamber</b> that provides a “hot side ” and a “cool side”. In the test chamber, temperature measurements were taken and the insulating capacity of each design specimen was calculated.

40|$|Extant {{sirenians}} {{are restricted}} to warm waters, presumably due to their low metabolism and poor thermoregulatory capacity, including thin blubber. When subjected to winter waters, Florida manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) migrate to warm areas, but dugongs (Dugong dugon) do not and instead live year-round in winter waters as cool as 15 - 18 °C. Dugongs {{appear to be more}} active than manatees and may have higher metabolic rates, but little is known about thermal energetics or the insulative properties of their integument. This study investigated the physical and thermal properties of whole samples of dugong integument, i. e. epidermis, dermis and hypodermis (blubber) sampled from fresh dugong carcasses collected from 2004 to 2012 in Moreton Bay (27. 21 °S, 153. 25 °E). Physico-chemical properties (thickness, density and lipid content) of each component tissue layer were measured. Thermal conductance (C) and conductivity (k) were measured for each tissue layer through in vitro temperature flux experiments within an <b>insulated</b> <b>chamber.</b> C and k were higher for dermis (25. 7 ± 1. 2 W m- 2 K- 1, 0. 43 ± 0. 02 W m- 1 K- 1, respectively, n = 21) than blubber (24. 3 ± 2. 4 W m- 2 K- 1, 0. 31 ± 0. 01 W m- 1 K- 1, n = 21), suggesting that blubber, with higher density and lipid content, affords better insulation. However, because the dermis contributes 65 % of integumentary thickness, both layers contribute significantly to insulation. The integument of dugongs is a poorer insulator compared to many cold-water marine mammals, but the greater thickness of its dermal layer means that despite its relatively thin blubber, its integumentary insulation is similar to warm-water dolphins of similar body size...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of new type of composite materials based on multilayer concept. The multilayer composites were mainly composed of waste fibre based nonwoven fabrics, woven glass fibres and wood layers. Each of these layers was designed to operate with different functionalities; but when these layers were combined into a single composite, these functionalities were expected to work together. This particular aspect allowed to develop a single structure for fire doors (fire resistance time of more than 90 min), as well as to get a better acoustic insulation behaviour (up to 47 dB). The multilayer structure was comprised of different layers such as MDF panels (2 mm), woven glass fibre layer (220 and 400 g/m 2), wood materials (10 mm), woven glass fibre (220 and 400 g/m 2) and waste fibre based no-woven fabrics (3 different types). Composite panels were produced using these combinations in a compression moulding machine using two types of thermosetting resin systems. Acoustic insulation behaviour of these composites was characterized using a method similar to the one applied in the EN ISO 140 - 3 standard. In this testing method, a white noise was applied in an <b>insulated</b> <b>chamber</b> and the noise level (in decibels, dB) for various frequencies was measured in the first and second compartments of the chamber. The difference between the noises measured in those two compartments, called the noise reduction coefficient (α), was used to assess the acoustic insulation behaviour.

Another treatment, representing current recommendations for nursery pig environments, received an air temperature of 28 C and no infrared heat. All treatments were replicated six times with individual pigs as experimental units. ^ An infrared heater was suspended above each of six indirect calorimeters that contained a single pig.

Feed consumption was measured daily and all energy balances were calculated on a 24 -hr periods. Feed and water were available ad libitum. The metabolizable energy content of the feed was 13. 5 kJ/g dry mass. ^ Regression equations were developed to describe the rates of total and latent heat production and energy intake as functions of MRT, air temperature and black globe temperature.
