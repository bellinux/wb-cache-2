5000|$|Monoclimax or Climatic Climax Theory was {{advanced}} by Clements (1916) and recognizes only one climax whose characteristics are determined solely by climate (climatic climax). The processes of succession and modification of environment overcome {{the effects of}} differences in topography, parent material of the soil, and other factors. The whole area would be covered with uniform plant community. Communities other than the climax are related to it, and are recognized as subclimax, postclimax and <b>disclimax.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, some {{contemporary}} ecologists {{still use}} the term [...] "disclimax" [...] to describe an ecosystem been dominated by invasive species that competitively prevent the re-introduction of once native species. This concept borrows from Clement's earliest interpretation of climax as referring to an ecosystem that is resistant to colonization by outside species. The term <b>disclimax</b> was used in-context by Clements (1936), and despite being an anthropogenic phenomenon which prevents the facilitation and succession to a true climax community, {{it is one of}} the only examples of climax that can be observed in nature.|$|E
5000|$|In the off {{chance of}} a {{phenomenon}} which effectively removes most of the lifeforms in these areas, the resultant landscape {{is considered to be}} a <b>disclimax,</b> where there is a loss of the previous climax community. Factors which interrupt succession include: human intervention (plagioclimax), change in relief of land (topoclimax), change in animal species (biotic climax) or change in soil such as an increase in acidity (edaphic climax) [...] In most cases, should the area be left to regenerate as normal when the limiting factor is removed, the area eventually becomes a climax community again (secondary succession).|$|E
50|$|Eucalyptus pulchella {{like many}} other species from the myrtaceae family {{requires}} fire {{at least once in}} its lifetime in order to retain <b>disclimax</b> vegetation and complete its lifecycle. Seeds of Eucalyptus are held in woody capsules which often remain on the tree for several years after reaching maturity. A fire event is required to dry out and open the woody capsule to release the seed. Fire creates a sterile, nutrient enriched ashbed which favours shade-intolerant eucalypt seedlings by eliminating any competitors. In fact, dry sclerophyll communities and Eucalyptus species are fire promoting. The flammable nature of eucalypt bark and leaf litter which persists on the forest floor and the volatile oils in the leaves held in the canopy promote a fire frequency of approximately 20 years in dry sclerophyll communities.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Frederic Clements's use of [...] "climax"== Clements {{described}} the successional {{development of an}} ecological communities comparable to the ontogenetic development of individual organisms. Clements suggested only comparisons to very simple organisms. Later ecologists developed this idea that the ecological community is a [...] "superorganism" [...] and even sometimes claimed that communities could be homologous to complex organisms and sought to define a single climax-type for each area. The English botanist Arthur Tansley developed this idea with the [...] "polyclimax" [...] — multiple steady-state end-points, determined by edaphic factors, in a given climatic zone. Clements had called these end-points other terms, not climaxes, and had thought they were not stable, because by definition climax vegetation is best-adapted to the climate of a given area. Henry Gleason's early challenges to Clements's organism simile, and other strategies of his for describing vegetation, were largely disregarded for several decades until substantially vindicated by research in the 1950s and 1960s (below). Meanwhile, climax theory was deeply incorporated in both theoretical ecology and in vegetation management. Clements's terms such as pre-climax, post-climax, plagioclimax and <b>disclimax</b> continued {{to be used to}} describe the many communities which persist in states that diverge from the climax ideal for a particular area.|$|E

The term climax is used as a practical term to denote existence of an equilibrium between the populations and the environment.

40|$|The native grasses of {{the mixed}} prairie and short-grass plains <b>disclimax</b> have been {{subjected}} {{for a long period}} of years to extreme drought, much overstocking, and severe damage from dust. Behavior of the vegetation during the dry year of 1933, the extreme drought of 1934, and the terrible dust storms and intermittent periods of desiccation during subsequent years, has been continuously observed (Weaver and Albertson, 2 ̆ 736). Previous studies in this area furnished a back- ground which enabled one to compare present conditions with those of the pre-drought period (Weaver, 2 ̆ 724; Clements and Weaver, 2 ̆ 724; Albertson, 2 ̆ 737). A large series of exclosures and permanent quadrats supplemented by phytometers and measurements of environmental factors have revealed the nature and causes of changes in vegetation over extensive areas in western Kansas.

40|$|Abstract: Floristic {{community}} {{types and}} their environmental correlates are described for Sphagnum-dominated communities throughout Victoria. Current {{threats to the}} condition of these communities are outlined, with an assessment of their conservation status. Sites from lowland (350 m) to alpine (1780 m) areas were surveyed and seven floristic groups were recognised using cluster analysis and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling techniques. The strongest floristic gradients corresponded to altitude, temperature, rainfall, geology and current condition. Several of the sites surveyed were degraded, with some sites heavily impacted by cattle grazing or invaded by weeds. While some floristic groups, particularly sub-alpine bogs, are reserved in national parks, others such as montane and lowland bogs occur on forestry and private land tenures. Reservation has not protected some sites from threatening processes, most notably in alpine national parks, where cattle grazing has seriously degraded many of these Sphagnum peatland communities to either <b>disclimax</b> communities or isolated moss beds no longer functioning ecologically as peatlands. Further surveys of Sphagnum-dominated communities elsewhere in Victoria are warranted, especially montane and lowland areas. The results suggest Sphagnum-dominated communities will require conservation planning and management action throughout their geographic range in Victoria...|$|E

A recent survey of the vegetation resulted in the inventory of 140 plant species, 49 of these being introduced to the island. Ten vegetation types were mapped, some of these being disturbance <b>disclimax</b> communities. The island has a flora typical {{of many of the}} Furneaux Outer Islands. Since 1797, Allocasuarina verticillata, once the likely dominant tree on the island, has been depleted almost to extinction and grassland with a high proportion of exotic species has expanded to cover {{more than a third of}} the island. Exotic species propagules have been associated with human activity on the island but also with birds and by sea drift. The high levels of natural and human-related disturbance have encouraged establishment of introduced plants. Some obligate-seeding species on the island have been reduced to either precariously low numbers (Acacia ?genistifolia) or extinction (Callitris rhomboidea) by a high fire frequency. The biological productivity of the island was high at the time of initial human settlement because there was an extremely large muttonbird rookery, penguins, macropods and other animals. Scrub and low closed forest were more extensive. Most of the biological capital was exhausted within 30 or 40 years.

40|$|From a {{conservation}} point of view, avalanches are a natural ecological process. However, {{they can also}} endanger people and cause serious damage to buildings and infrastructure. From an anthropocentric point of view, protective measures {{in the form of}} avalanche barriers are necessary. Avalanche barriers in the starting zone of avalanches can prevent avalanche events. Hence there is a conflict between nature conservation and protection against natural hazards. This study aimed primarily at assessing the conservation value of active avalanche tracks. To this end we examined 16 plant stands on three different avalanche tracks in the Gesäuse National Park (Styria, Austria) and recorded butterfly species at the same time. On the investigated avalanche tracks, the soils are very shallow, stony, periodically dry, nutrient-poor, base-rich rendzinas developed over limestone debris. The sites are scree-covered, steep and mainly east-facing slopes located in the montane belt. The plant stands investigated belong mainly to the Origano-Calamagrostietum variae community. This study of biodiversity concludes that under these conditions the vegetation in active avalanche tracks is characterized by a high richness of vascular plant species. On average, a plot size of 20 m² contains 71 vascular plant species and 5 bryophyte species. The species-rich plant stands, colourful when in bloom, are dominated by herbs, resulting in a high aesthetic value and an increased diversity of butterflies. The avalanche tracks investigated have a high conservation value because natural ecological processes continue to happen, leading to near-natural and species-rich <b>disclimax</b> communities...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{years have}} now {{passed since the}} fateful spring of 1934. The almost rainless March and April, the unusually high winds, and the great clouds of dust {{following}} two summers of decreasing precipitation, portended disaster. The intensity and duration of the drought and its appalling destruction have been studied from the beginning (Weaver, Stoddart, and Noll 1935) and several reports have recorded changes wrought in the native grass cover (Savage 1937; Weaver and Albertson 1936, 1939, 1940, 1940 a). Drought began in great intensity a year earlier in the mixed prairie westward and south-westward. But previous to 1933, intensive studies had been pursued which gave {{a clear picture of}} the composition and structure of the several grassland types (Albertson 1937). Uninterrupted quantitative field studies year after year have traced the further deterioration or improvement of the meager vegetation until the wet year of 1941 finally concluded the dry cycle (Albertson and Weaver 1942). The higher rainfall, sometimes monthly periods with three times the normal amount, has again moistened the dry soil to depths of normal, pre-drought root penetration. This, with a return to more normal atmospheric moisture, temperature, and wind movement, has already initiated marked changes in the vegetation. Hence, a resurvey of the condition of the vegetation of true prairie and mixed prairie, including its short-grass <b>disclimax,</b> both above and below ground {{at the end of the}} drought seemed advisable. It will conclude the phase of deterioration due to desiccation and at the same time provide a clear and definite background from which the processes involved in the return of vegetation to a new dynamic stabilization may be traced...|$|E
40|$|Aims Kobresia humilis meadow is a disturbance-dependent (<b>disclimax)</b> {{community}} {{resulting from}} long-term and heavy grazing. Our objectives were to (a) {{examine how the}} compensatory growth of K. humilis (including ramet density, compensatory height and compensatory aboveground biomass per ramet) varies with different levels of clipping, fertilizing and watering and (b) examine changes in specific leaf area (SLA), lamina net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and relative growth rate (RGR) in order to reveal the compensatory mechanisms of the species. Methods Our field experiment was carried out at the Haibei Research Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences from 2007 to 2009. The experiment used a split-plot design with clipping treatment on the whole plot (stubbled 1 cm, 3 cm and unclipped) and both fertilizer (fertilized and unfertilized) and water (watered and unwatered) treatments in subplots. We analyzed effects of clipping, fertilizing and watering on the response variables by multivariate ANOVA. We used stepwise regression analysis to determine the contribution of SLA, Pn and RGR to compensatory growth and Pearson’s correlation to determine the correlation among ramet density, compensatory height and compensatory aboveground biomass. Important findings Compensatory height and SLA were reduced after clipping; RGR of ramet height and aboveground biomass, ramet density and compensatory biomass were increased. Fertilizing can increase ramet density, compensatory height, compensatory biomass, RGR of ramet height and aboveground biomass, SLA and Pn. The effect of watering on compensatory height and RGR of ramet height under stubbled 1 cm clipping was not obvious, but reduced them under stubbled 3 cm clipping. The interactions of clipping, fertilizing and watering showed that the relation between clipping and fertilizing is “antagonistic” and the relation between clipping andwatering is “cooperative”. Although K. humilis appeared under compensation in plant height, fertilizing could enhance the compensation ability and promote tolerance against defoliation at {{a certain level of}} clipping...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} of 1937 to 1940 the Department of Agronomy of Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station in {{cooperation}} with the Valentine sub-station conducted pasture studies in Cherry County, Nebraska. The purposes of these studies are: (1) to present an analysis of vegetation in tall and short grass rangelands; (2) to observe the activities of cattle on the range and (3) to study the effect of grazing upon vegetation. These studies consisted of several projects on both sandhill (tall-grass post climax) and hardland (short-grass <b>disclimax)</b> pastures. These two very different types of grassland afford an excellent opportunity for the comparisons of tall and short grass range. Both areas were grazed by high-grade, beef type cattle. There is great diversity in the vegetation in the sandhills, but the hardland region had very uniform vegetation. Neither the rate of stocking nor the type of forage produced had any great effect upon the total hours of grazing or resting; but the cattle grazing on the hardlands (irrespective of rate of stocking) grazed and rested for shorter periods than those herds in the sandhills. Thus the length of the grazing and resting cycles, seems to be effected by the difference in the type of forage upon which cattle are grazing. Probably the most serious factor in the deterioration of the sandhill ranges is the improper distribution of grazing animals over the range area, resulting in extreme overgrazing on parts of the range and undergrazing on other parts. This is also a serious problem in the hardland pastures. The final aim in range research should be to discover means of securing the essential facts for a better range management program. Advisor: A.

40|$|The grasslands of {{the present}} study area lie in the ecotone between Fescue grasslands to the north and the Canadian mixed prairie to the south. Most of the sites sampled lie within 12 miles of Saskatoon. The grasslands in the south of Saskatchewan have been {{investigated}} by Clarke (1930), Clarke and Tisdale (1936, 1945), Clarke et al. (l 942, 1943),and Coupland (1950), and they have been shown by the identity of the dominant species to be a northward extension of the mixed prairie (Stipa-Bouteloua Association) as classified by Weaver and Clements (l 938) and by Clements and Shelford (1939). A study undertaken immediately to the north of Saskatoon has shown the grasslands of that area to be dominated by Festuca scabrella (Coupland and Brayshaw 1953). F. scabrella does not occur as a dominant in mixed prairie, and for that reason these northern grasslands may not be considered a part of the mixed prairie and are here considered as another Association.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Studies were {{conducted}} {{in the vicinity of}} Mount Tolman on the Colville Indian Reservation in eastern Washington in order to identify vegetation habitat types of the area. After field studies were completed, Daubenmire's keys to habitat types of eastern Washington (1968, 1970) were used to determine habitat types of the area. On the basis of sampling results, eleven habitat types were identified and described. This information was used in conjunction with aerial photointerpretation to prepare a vegetation map. Daubenmire's baseline studies, from which the habitat type keys were developed, {{were conducted}} in pristine climax stands. The Mount Tolman study area vegetation has been subjected to human disturbance for many years. Agriculture, grazing, logging, mining, and urbanization have all {{had an impact on the}} natural vegetation of the area. It was of interest to see at what levels of disturbance it would still be possible to determine habitat types from remnant native vegetation. Steppe habitat types identified were Agropyron spicatum/Festuca idahoensis and Purshia tridentata/Agropyron spicatum. Very little vegetation representative of these habitat types remained in the study area because of conversion of most open land to either agricultural crops or pasture. Most steppe portions of the study area had been heavily grazed and supported <b>disclimax</b> vegetation dominated by Bromus tectorum and other weedy species. Four Pinus ponderosa habitat types were identified. They were Pinus ponderosa/Agropyron spicatum, Pinus ponderosa/Festuca idahoensis, Pinus ponderosa/Purshia tridentata, and Pinus ponderosa/Symphoricarpos albus. Together they composed 43 percent of the study area. Three other forest habitats, Pseudotsuga menziesii/Symphoricarpos albus, Pseudotsuga menziesii/Physocarpus malvaceus, and Abies grandis/Pachistima myrsinites, occupied 30 percent of the study area. Two riparian habitat types occurred consistently in the creek drainages. One of these was Crataegus douglasii/ Symphoricarpus albus, both the Crataegus phase, and Populus tremuloides phase; the other was Alnus incana/Lysichitum americanum.

40|$|The {{production}} of litter, the weight loss dynamic of forest litter decomposition, and {{the dynamics of}} bioelement loss during leaf litter decomposition were determined in three forest ecosystems located in a semi-arid zone of the Duero basin, Province of Zamora, Spain, over 2 years. The three ecosystems were a climax evergreen oak (Quercus rotundifolia Lam.) woodland, a paraclimax stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) forest, and a <b>disclimax</b> maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Sol.) forest. The mean total {{production of}} litter in the oak forest was 2320 kg ha– 1 year– 1, quite similar to the P. pinea pine forest, at 2400 kg ha– 1 year– 1 and {{higher than that of}} the P. pinaster pine forest at 1728 kg ha– 1 year– 1. Leaves and needles accounted for most of this total production (78, 89 and 96 per cent, respectively). No significant differences were found among the different leaf decomposition processes, except for the oak leaves introduced in the pine ecosystems. A relationship between time (independent variable) and the remaining leaf weight was found, which followed a negative exponential curve, DM (dry matter) = A + B exp(–Ct). About 30 per cent of the weight was lost during the first 4 months. This indicates that climate (semi-arid conditions) speeds decomposition in the short term. The decomposition indices were determined for leaves only and for total litter. Considering total litter and leaves separately, several relations were established for K, Ko and Kd decomposition indices. K and Ko in natural conditions decrease in the following order: evergreen oak > stone pine > maritime pine. The Q. rotundifolia woodland potentially returns a greater amount of N and Ca than both Pinus forests. A litter-bag method was used for the determination of the dynamics of the decomposing leaves. A progressive loss of P and Mg in the decomposing oak leaves and pine needles, and a sharp loss of K were observed: in contrast, a tendency to retain N and Ca was also seen. Pinus pinaster forest had the lowest annual N and P returns. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Joppa Preserve is a {{representative}} {{piece of a}} greater Trinity River, bottomland hardwood forest that once dominated this portion of North Texas. Located in Dallas County, the existing core (327 acres) of the project is located downstream of the Dallas Floodway, a flood damage reduction project completed in 1959. As the project sponsors, Dallas County and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) initiated a feasibility study with project implementation costs estimated at $ 12, 000, 000. This study is intended to identify existing natural resources, environmental constraints, and develop a restoration plan for Joppa Preserve. Objectives of this feasibility study included identifying the environmental degradation resulting from previous construction and restoration of Joppa Preserve. Water resources within Joppa Preserve include Lemmon Lake, Little Lemmon Lake, Honey Springs, and an unnamed tributary of Five Mile Creek. This feasibility study identified measures designed to restore critical ecosystem components. Potential ecosystem restoration alternatives included restoration and expansion of wetlands and habitat improvements to existing riparian forests. The most critical hydraulic need included the repair of a large earthen embankment isolating Lemmon Lake from the Trinity River. Numerous field surveys were conducted by personnel of U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and Wendy Lopez and Associates, Inc. (WLA) to detail existing conditions and define natural resources within the project area, evaluate potential ecosystem restoration opportunities, and identify any constraints that might limit the implementation of future ecosystem restoration measures. Several coordination and workgroup meetings were undertaken with USACE, USFWS, Dallas County, City of Dallas, and WLA, to refine these critical steps in the plan formulation process. Through the use of IWR-PLAN software, WLA completed an Incremental Cost Analysis (ICA) in which multiple alternatives were evaluated in a habitat improvement process. USFWS and WLA modeled wildlife utilization by employing the Habitat Evaluation Procedure (HEP). Possible combinations and solutions were identified and represented the best financial investments through {{the life of the}} project. Alternatives included: lake embankment restoration, expanding the boundaries of Joppa Preserve, wetland creation, aquatic habitat improvements to Little Lemmon Lake, maintenance of water levels, restoration of a poison ivy parkland, repair of the water outfall control structure, reforestation, and a recreation plan. The plan of interest derived from this process included acquiring additional buffer areas for Joppa Preserve, improving the lakes complex, restoring 15 acres of grassland/woodland, removing existing and creating new water control structures, reforestation of 3 acres of bottomland hardwood habitat, acquiring 69. 5 acres of <b>disclimax</b> communities, and restoring 1500 linear feet of the lake embankment...|$|E

It was done during the investigation of sylvan yellow fever, in June 1947, {{with a view to}} establishing the phyto-ecological conditions of the county of Passos. The pe¬riod was, however, too short for definite conclusions to be reached. Thanks are due to Dr. O. R. Causey, Chief of Research on Yellow Fever for transpor¬tation and other help. THE REGIONAL VEGETATION. Aerial photographs of the county of Passos shoto that it is covered by three great types of vegetation: Rain Forest, Secondary Pasture Land and Scrub. 1 Detailed investigation, however, brings out the fact that these correspond to different seres; furthermore, each type presents not only the specific, characteristics of the biological form dominant for the climate, but also are at various stages, which express HABITATS differing from those of the normal sere. The phytogeographic survey of the region shows that most of it is now covered by secondary pasture land (<b>disclimax)</b> in which Melinis minutiflora, v. "fat grass" (fig. 1), predominates. The mosaic of Rain Forest and of small patches of Scrub reveals the effects of human intervention (BARRETO, H. L. de Mello 1); consequently, all the formations have to be regarded as secon¬dary, though some of them probably include relicts of the primitive climax (WARMING, E. 2). On close examination, the Scrub cannot be considered as the climax, because of the following facts: 1. In the zone of Rain-Forest stretches of forest are present in very varied topographic conditions and the reconstitution of the associations show that man has destroyed an ecological unit (fig. 2). 2. In the zone of Scrub the characteristic patches are small. The banks of rivers and brooks, the valleys and ravine and whatever the soil has retained some humidity, is being invaded fry Rain Forest, which seems to be growing under optimum conditions. The Scrub is thus limited to small belts on the calcareous mountains and on sandy soils with alcaline depths (pH abo¬ve 7) which do not retain enough moisture for the Rain Forest that is progres¬sively restricting the area occupied by Scrub. In view of the topographic and present climatic conditions the Rain Forest must consequently be regarded as the regional climax. The presence of ecologically contradictory elements and associations shows that {{the real problem is that}} of the fluctuations of the climate of Passos or even of Minas Geraes during the quaternary and recent periods (DAN-SEREAU, P. : 3), a subject on which little is known and which is tied to the evolution of the climate of Brazil (OLIVEIRA, E. : 4). The transformation of Scrub into Rain Forest has been - observed by the author before, in other parts of Brazil (VELOSO, PL P. : 5). It seems probable that the Rio Grande has also greatly influenced the change of the regional vegetation, by invading areas of Scrub and dislocating the limit of the Pluvial climate towards the Canastra Range, though there are remnants of Scrub (postclimax) transfor¬med into secondary open country (<b>disclimax,</b> fig. 5) by human devastation and the setting of fire to the land. VEGETATION GROUPS OF THE PLUVIAL TYPE. The map of the region also shows that at the present time the small patches of forest (whether devasted or intact) occupy the least accessible places, such as valleys, peaks and abrupt slopes (fig. 2). Even these are now being destroyed, so that in the near future this forested region will be en¬tirely reduced to poor pasture land unless energetic measures of conservation are undertaken in time. The Special Service for Prophylaxis against Yellow Fever installed two of their four Stations for the Capture of Mosquitos in this area, one of them at Batatal and the other at Cachoeira, which have separate formations each of them composed of several associations. Other vegetation formations were also analysed, from the synecological point of view, so as to ascertain of which degree of succession their associations belong. These phytosociological sur¬veys give an idea of the principal characteristics of each station. BATATAL FORMATION. The abrupt nature of the valley has rendered this location inappropriate for agricultural purposes since colonial times. The relict of the primitive forest climax saved by this circumstance has expanded gradually to zones whose paedologic conditions favour the eatablishment of mesophilous species. The aerial photograph shows two small stretches of forest, one apparently primi¬tive, the other composed of associations belonging to the subclimax of the subsere. CACHOEIRA FORMATION. Aerial photographs show that this station is crossed by a small river, which divides it into two separate parts. The first, which presents ecological conditions similar, though not identical to those of Batatal, is favoured by topography and apparently remains primitive forest. Though the topography of the other, on the whole, favours the establishment of groups belonging to the normal sere of the climax, is has been partly devastated recently and the aspect of the associations has been completely modified. It was is this part that the four posts for the capturing of mosquitos were set up. The first forest is favoured by deposition of organic matter, washed out from the nearby devasted areas by torrential rains, and thus provides, an appropriate HABITAT for the climax species with certain hygrophilous trends of the ecological quasiclimax type. This association seems to have reached a biological equilibrium, as the dominates. Gallesia gorarema and Cariniana legalis (fig. 10), present an optimum vitality with a vigorous habit and a normal evolutionary cycle. The Cariniantum legalis Gallesiosum equilibrium, corresponds however, to a provisory association, because if the moving of soil by torrential rains should cease it would become possible...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 This {{analysis}} {{is the study}} of Oregon's wildlife resources from the period prior to white settlement up to the present time, including critical projections, based on present trends and expected conditions for both human and wildlife populations in the state up to the year 2010. Prior to white settlement Oregon was apparently part of a well balanced ecosystem. The fertile, moist valley regions were areas where an abundance of wildlife was found. Elk, deer, bear, antelope and their associated predators occupied these favorable sites. The Oregon Indian lived harmoniously within this environment. He conducted himself as a "prudent predator" and generally sought game which was most easily available. These animals were abundant enough to withstand the hunting pressure exerted by the limited Indian population. The only major deliberate control the Indian extended over his environment was burning. Indians ignited large areas to enhance the harvest of wild plants and animals. One of these areas was the Willamette Valley, parts of which were apparently maintained in a condition of fire climax or <b>disclimax</b> long prior to the arrival of white settlers. White pioneers arriving in Oregon in the 1840 's settled first in locations where the best agricultural land and available moisture was found. These areas coincided with prime game habitat and the immediate effect of settlement was the displacement of wildlife from their traditional ranges to areas of inferior fertility and moisture. The pattern of development of white civilization had a severe impact on wildlife populations from the late 1800 's to the early 1900 's. Drainage and reclamation projects coupled with prolonged drought periods drastically reduced waterfowl populations. Excessive killing of game for the meat, hide and feather value further reduced wildlife populations when market hunting reached its peak between 1870 and 1900. Predator and rodent cool efforts were directed toward improving agricultural conditions but often resulted in upsetting previous balances among several forms of wildlife. After 1893 wildlife management evolved through periods of protection, stocking, refuges, and systematic management. The Oregon State Game Commission and the United States Bureau of Biological Survey attempted to work cooperatively with several state and federal agencies in the 1920 's and 1930 's in an effort to restore depleted wildlife populations. The Taylor Grazing Act helped prevent further mismanagement of rangeland. The Migratory Bird Stamp Act allowed funds for waterfowl habitat purchases. Other legislation such as the Pittman-Robertson Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Act is further testimony of Federal Programs which have provided the means for wildlife restoration since the 1930 's. The general development of cooperative wildlife research units in the United States together with the formation of Oregon State University's Department of Fisheries and Wildlife were important steps in the movement toward more scientific wildlife management during the 1930 's. Several important wildlife management programs were developed in Oregon and successful wildlife restoration programs have continued up to the present time. Although wildlife populations have been largely restored through systematic management, they are again being lost. The next losses will be from severe competition with man for living space and resources. Based on demographic projections and current trends, it appears that the burgeoning human population will eventually cause the annihilation of many wildlife species. Upset watersheds, widespread pollution, increased competition for natural resources, and competition for living space between man and wildlife are unpleasant but real prospects for Oregon's future...|$|E
40|$|In the Australian Continent, {{in those}} areas {{occupied}} by Eurpoeans during the past 200 years, the natural environment has been modified; the change are most severe in the semi-arid regions. Prior to Eurpoean settlement, for some tens of thouthands years of Aboriginal occupation, there were slow changes mainly due to occasional burning of vegetation so that the Australian flora was gradually moved towards fire-resisted species. With the introduction of agricuture and grazing drastic changes in the density, floristics, and structure of native vegetation occurred. Disturbance or removal of vegetation has also affected surface and sub-surface hydrology. These changes have resulted in water or wind erosion and salinization. Where vegetation has been regenerated the species established are often those which are unpalatable to grazing stock or can withstand frequent burning. This leads to "desertification". The concept of "desertification" is ecologically defined as follows: The natural vegetation in equilibrium with the potentiality of regional climate (climatic climax) is replaced by the vegetation which grows naturally and originally in more arid region due to environmental stress directly induced by man and the accompanying land degradation. The Murray-Mallee Region {{in the southern part}} of Austrralia, where the late Pleistocene and Holocene sand dunes are widely distributed, is a semi-arid region with annual rainfall of 250 - 400 mm; it is wholly covered with mallee (Eucalyptus spp.) scrub. The sand dunes which were stable covered totally with such vegetation during the pre-European days have become unstable at many sites due to vegetation clearing, farming and grazing associated with European settlement since the late 19 th Century. The remobilization of sand dunes is one of the typical events of "desertification" and, in extreme cases, the surface remains unvegetated. Various stages in vegetation change can be observed showing "desertification" or regeneration process. The authors describe the processes involved in land and vegetation degradation, and discuss the measures to prevent "desertification" based on the examination of the relationships between activity of sand drifting, thickness of loose sand overlying the stable substrata, floristic composition, community height, and activlty of rabbits (Olyctolagus cuniculus). The natural mallee scrub in the conservation park is dominated by Eucalyptus spp. accompanled by rlch lower shrub layer species such as Casuarina stricta, Callitris verrucosa and Hakea leucoptera. The mallee scrub remaining on farmland, however, is very poor in understory resulting from grazing. Triodia spp. and Acacia spp. invade in the understory of the mallee scrub after bushfires. Acacia spp. regenerate easily and are dominant on the land where the surface is disturbed by vegetation clearance and/or wind erosion. Natural mallee scrub will regenerate through sprouting from so-called mallee roots (lignotuber) persisting after surface disturbance. When the lignotuber is exposed by wind erosion or covered by sand accumulation, the recovery to natural mallee scrub becomes very difficut. On such sites, Triodia colonies and/or Acacia scrub stand as <b>disclimax</b> communities with a life cycle of 30 to 50 years (Figs. 6 and 7). The thicker the loose sand is, the more active and continuous is the sand drifting (Fig. 8). In particular, on many dunes with loose sand thicker than 80 cm, serious drifting has continued for recent tens of years exacerbated by the large amount of mobile sands and the difficulty of vegetation invasion. At the sites with thick loose sands, the population of rabbit introduced from Europe is larger, suggesting that the reactivation and acceleration of sand drifting is induced by rabbit infestation (Fig. 9). On the other hand, where vegetation height is greater than the line shown in Fig. 8, suggesting a minimum height of vegetation for erosion control, sand dunes tend to be stabilized. The results of investigation as mentioned above show the various processes of vegetation changes according to the combinations of local difference in natural conditions and the importance of human impacts, and imply many stages of"desertification". The remobilization of sand dunes is regarded as an extreme stage of "desertification" caused by a combination of many factors. The soil conservation and the vegetation management based on detailed survey of physical and ecological characteristics of land will identify the factors contributing to landscape instability and "desertification" and so provide a framework for reversing the processes of land and vegetation degradation...|$|E
