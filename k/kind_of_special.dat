500|$|However, others praise his re-working and {{synthesis}} of traditions. New Age writer William Bloom wrote that [...] "Tolle {{is offering a}} very contemporary synthesis of Eastern spiritual teaching, which is normally so clothed in arcane language that it is incomprehensible", thereby providing [...] "a valuable perspective on Western culture". Publisher Judith Kendra says, [...] "The ideas [...] talking about have been in existence {{for thousands of years}} in both Eastern texts and with the great Western mystics, but he's able to make them understandable". [...] Musician Annie Lennox said he [...] "has some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>special</b> quality that I've never encountered before".|$|E

It's kind of like a bale of cotton has been on your shoulders, and now it's off", said Doby. When he received word about his election it was via telephone call from fellow Hall member Ted Williams. Upon hearing of Doby's election, Gene Mauch, said, [...] "You have to be some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>special</b> person to go through what Larry and Jackie Robinson went through. They both are. I'm not too sure there's a player in the game today who could handle it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>special</b> filter {{geometry}} is {{a series}} resonant choke or tuned choke filter. [...] Unlike the other filter geometries which are low-pass filters, a resonant choke filter is a band-stop filter: it is a parallel combination of choke and capacitor which resonates at {{the frequency of the}} ripple voltage, presenting a very high impedance to the ripple. [...] It may be followed by a shunt capacitor to complete the filter.|$|E
2500|$|Commander Schoen, a {{character}} appearing in Neal Stephenson's novel Cryptonomicon, is {{to a large}} extent inspired by Friedman. Schoen shares a significant background and personality traits with Friedman, including being one of the top cryptanalysts of the U.S. Army, breaking Japanese codes prior to Japan's involvement in World War II, and the psychological problems that he suffered from as a result. In his acknowledgements, Stephenson writes [...] "Among all these great wartime hackers, some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>special</b> recognition must go to William Friedman, who sacrificed his health to break the Japanese machine cipher called Purple before the war even began." ...|$|E

60|$|Naturally, {{under the}} straitened circumstances, I {{regarded}} Elizabeth Mary as a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>special</b> Providence. She unwisely refused {{to share her}} fortune with me, but for that I cared nothing; for, although {{by the laws of}} that country (as is well known) a wife has control of her separate property during her life, it passes to the husband at her death; nor can she dispose of it otherwise by will. The mortality among wives is considerable, but not excessive.|$|E

60|$|I {{doubt if}} reticence {{is really a}} virtue in a teacher. But this is a fearful world, and the {{majority}} of those who instruct our youth have the painful sensitiveness of the cloistered soul to this spirit of terror in things. The young need particularly to be told truthfully and fully all we know of three fundamental things: the first of which is God, the next their duty towards their neighbours in the matter of work and money, and the third Sex. These things, and the adequate why of them, and some sort of adequate how, make all that matters in education. But all three are obscure and deeply moving topics, topics for which the donnish mind has a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>special</b> ineptitude, and which it evades with the utmost skill and delicacy. The middle part of this evaded triad was now being taken up in Marjorie's case by the Oxbridge tradespeople.|$|E
60|$|If all {{existing}} {{animals have}} been produced from ancestral forms--mostly extinct--under the law of variation and natural selection, we may expect to find in most cases a close relation between the living forms of each country and those which inhabited it in the immediately preceding epoch. But if species have originated in some quite different way, either by any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>special</b> creation, or by sudden advances of organisation in the offspring of preceding types, such close relationship would not be found; and facts of this kind become, therefore, to some extent a test of evolution under natural selection or some other law of gradual change. Of course the relationship will not appear when extensive migration has occurred, by which the inhabitants of one region {{have been able to}} take possession of another region, and destroy or drive out its original inhabitants, as has sometimes happened. But such cases are comparatively rare, except where great changes of climate are known to have occurred; and we usually do find a remarkable continuity between the existing fauna and flora of a country and those of the immediately preceding age. A few of the more remarkable of these cases will now be briefly noticed.|$|E
