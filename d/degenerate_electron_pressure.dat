40|$|The basic {{properties}} of the nucleus-acoustic (NA) solitary waves (SWs) are investigated in a super-dense self-gravitating magnetized quantum plasma (SDSGMQP) system {{in the presence of}} an external magnetic field, whose constituents are the non-degenerate light (heavy) nuclei, and non/ultra-relativistically degenerate electrons. The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation has been derived by employing the reductive perturbation method. The NA SWs are formed with negative (positive) electrostatic (self-gravitational) potential. It is also observed that the effects of non/ultra-relativistically <b>degenerate</b> <b>electron</b> <b>pressure,</b> and the obliqueness of the external magnetic field significantly change the {{basic properties}} (e. g. amplitude, width, and speed) of NA SWs. The findings of our present analysis can be very helpful to explain the physics behind the formation of the NA SWs in astrophysical compact objects, specially neutron stars, which are briefly discussed.

40|$|A {{generalized}} set of nonlinear electromagnetic quantum hydrodynamic (QHD) equations {{is derived}} for a magnetized quantum plasma, including collisional, electron spin- 1 / 2, and relativistically <b>degenerate</b> <b>electron</b> <b>pressure</b> effects {{that are relevant}} for dense astrophysical systems, such as white dwarfs. For illustrative purposes, linear dispersion relations are derived for one-dimensional magnetoacoustic waves for a collisionless nonrelativistic degenerate gas {{in the presence of}} the electron spin- 1 / 2 contribution and for magnetoacoustic waves in a plasma containing relativistically degenerate electrons. It is found that both the spin and relativistic degeneracy at high densities tend to slow down the magnetoacoustic wave due to the Pauli paramagnetic effect and relativistic electron mass increase. The present study outlines the theoretical framework for the investigation of linear and nonlinear behaviors of electromagnetic waves in dense astrophysical systems. The results are applied to calculate the magnetoacoustic speeds for both the nonrelativistic and relativistic electron degeneracy cases typical for white dwarf stars...|$|E

40|$|The {{propagation}} of electrostatic waves in a densemagnetized electron–positron–ion (EPI) plasma with nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic <b>degenerate</b> <b>electrons</b> and positrons is investigated. The linear dispersion relation is obtained for slow and fast electrostatic {{waves in the}} EPI plasma. The limiting cases for ion acoustic wave (slow) and ion cyclotron wave (fast) are also discussed.

40|$|We {{consider}} nonlinear {{interactions between}} two relativistically strong laser beams and a quantum plasma composed of <b>degenerate</b> <b>electron</b> fluids and immobile ions. The collective behavior of <b>degenerate</b> <b>electrons</b> is modeled by quantum hydrodynamic equations {{composed of the}} electron continuity, quantum electron momentum (QEM) equation, {{as well as the}} Poisson and Maxwell equations. The QEM equation accounts the quantum statistical <b>electron</b> <b>pressure,</b> the quantum <b>electron</b> recoil due to electron tunneling through the quantum Bohm potential, electron-exchange, and electron-correlation effects caused by electron spin, and relativistic ponderomotive forces (RPFs) of two circularly polarized electromagnetic (CPEM) beams. The dynamics of the latter are governed by nonlinear wave equations that include nonlinear currents arising from the relativistic electron mass increase in the CPEM wave fields, {{as well as from the}} beating of the electron quiver velocity and electron density variations reinforced by the RPFs of the two CPEM waves. Furthermore, nonlinear electron density variations associated with the driven (by the RPFs) quantum electron plasma oscillations obey a coupled nonlinear Schrödinger and Poisson equations. The nonlinearly coupled equations for our purposes are then used to obtain a general dispersion relation (GDR) for studying the parametric instabilities and the localization of CPEM wave packets in a quantum plasma. Numerical analyses of the GDR reveal that the growth rate of a fastest growing parametrically unstable mode is in agreement with the result that has been deduced from numerical simulations of the governing nonlinear equations. Explicit numerical results for two-dimensional (2 D) localized CPEM wave packets at nanoscales are also presented. Possible applications of our investigation to intense laser-solid density compressed plasma experiments are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of ion-acoustic solitary waves (IASWs) in a magnetized, collisionless degenerate plasma system for describing collective plasma oscillations in dense quantum plasmas with relativistically <b>degenerate</b> <b>electrons,</b> oppositely charged inertial ions, and positively charged immobile heavy elements is investigated theoretically. The perturbations of the magnetized quantum plasma are studied employing the reductive perturbation technique to derive the Korteweg-de Vries (K-dV) and the modified K-dV (mK-dV) equations that admits solitary wave solutions. Chandrasekhar limits {{are used to}} investigate the degeneracy effects of interstellar compact objects through equation of state for <b>degenerate</b> <b>electrons</b> in case of non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic cases. The basic properties of small but finite-amplitude IASWs are modified significantly by the combined effects of the <b>degenerate</b> <b>electron</b> number density, pair ion number density, static heavy element number density and magnetic field. It is found that the obliqueness affects both the amplitude and width of the solitary waves, whereas the other parameters mainly influence {{the width of the}} solitons.
