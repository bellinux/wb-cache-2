5|$|Scully and Doggett {{join the}} {{investigation}} at McKesson’s home. Scully suggests {{a connection between}} the burned body of Ariel McKesson who disappeared in 1956 and her mother, the latest victim. Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers already have the coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery. They tell him {{that they did not have}} to dig because somebody already dug the coffin up and scratched the lid up. While they drive off with the body, Abbott inspects a <b>dead</b> <b>tree.</b> The creature is within and it eviscerates Abbott.|$|E
5|$|This species forages in {{the early}} morning or late {{afternoon}} either alone or in small groups in leaf litter and on <b>dead</b> <b>tree</b> trunks. It is also known to leap upwards to grab prey on overhanging foliage. It looks for its prey either by standing still and scanning the surrounding area or by tossing the leaf litter away with its beak. It also frequently follows columns of Dorylus ants, feeding on the insects flushed by the ants. It also is known to hunt in streams for crabs and fish. It crushes snails with its beak and, if its prey struggles, smashes it against the ground. While an uncommon occurrence, male rockfowl have been observed giving food to a female.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a young girl playing in the {{backyard}} as snow falls on the ground. The scene shifts {{to that of a}} bedside, where a young woman who has died, lies. Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, <b>dead</b> <b>tree,</b> as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach the knob of a door, and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face.|$|E
40|$|Global {{demand for}} forest biomass {{feedstock}} has increased drastically in recent years, mainly {{due to the}} implementation of policies and strategies for climate change mitigation and renewable energy production in many jurisdictions. The biomass from <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> has been recognized by the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a promising source of forest biomass for bioenergy at the global scale both because of its wide scale availability and its potential to limit global warming. In eastern Canada, <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> are not only very abundant but are also widely perceived by lumber and pulp and paper producers as contaminants in the wood supply chain with marginal profitability. The general aim {{of this study was to}} determine the conditions of profitability of an eastern Canada independent sawmill (i. e., unaffiliated with a pulp plant) to produce pellets destined for international export using either co-products or roundwood from <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> as feedstock. We compared the yield and monetary value of <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> at various sizes and degradation levels for the production of wood pellets, alone or in conjunction with the production of lumber, to current market conditions. Our results suggest that using <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> for lumber and pellets is almost as profitable as using them for lumber and pulp, with a difference of about 1 - 12 % depending on <b>tree</b> size. <b>Dead</b> <b>trees</b> from all classes of wood degradation could serve as an interesting feedstock for pellets because wood density was only slightly affected by wood degradation. Small <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> (DBH. <. 15. cm) could serve for all scenarios, as the difference between revenues and costs remained generally minimal between them. Larger <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> did not appear to represent a financially viable option under current market prices, unless suitable subsidies or other types of financial support are provided. The sustainability criteria applied by European consumers could therefore be a determining factor for the future importance of <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> from eastern Canada as a source of feedstock for wood pellet production...|$|R

5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle usually chooses {{tall trees}} or {{man-made}} pylons to nest in. Often, locations are sought {{where there is}} a tall <b>dead</b> <b>tree</b> or high branch with good visibility which {{can be used as a}} perch to survey the surrounding area, which is generally a low-lying locale near water with some forest cover. The perch becomes covered in faeces and pellets and animal remains litter the immediate surrounding area. The nest is a large deep bowl constructed of sticks and branches, and lined with such materials as grass or seaweed. Yearly renovations result in nests getting gradually bigger. Nests are generally sited in the forks of large trees overlooking bodies of water. Old nests of wedge-tailed eagles or whistling kites have been renovated and used. Cliffs are also suitable nesting sites, and on islands nests are sometimes built directly on the ground. A breeding pair, with the male being more active, spends three to six weeks building or renovating the nest before laying eggs. Normally a clutch of two dull, white, oval eggs are laid. Measuring 73×55mm, they are incubated over six weeks before hatching. The young are semi-altricial, and covered in white down when they emerge from the egg. Initially, the male brings food and the female feeds the chicks, but both parents feed the chicks as they grow larger. Although two eggs are laid, it is unusual for two young to be reared successfully to fledging (leaving the nest). One egg may be infertile, or the second chick may die in the nest. If the first clutch is lost, the parents may attempt a second brood. Nestlings have been recorded fledging when 70 to 80 days old, and remaining around the parents' territory for up to six months or until the following breeding season.|$|E
25|$|Generally, C. maxillosus {{are found}} {{throughout}} the eastern U.S. {{in the fall and}} spring, but can also be found in the summer. They are usually in wooded habitats such as forest leaf litter, decaying plant material (including fruit), and under <b>dead</b> <b>tree</b> bark. They can also be found in carrion, dung, under stones or rocks, and in fresh water areas in washed-up brown algae.|$|E

The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous <b>dead</b> <b>tree,</b> where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest hidden fear.|$|E

25|$|Trogons are cavity nesters. Nests are {{dug into}} rotting wood or termite nests, with one species, the violaceous trogon, nesting in wasp nests. Nest {{cavities}} {{can either be}} deep upward slanting tubes that lead to fully enclosed chambers, or much shallower open niches (from which the bird is visible). Nests are dug with the beak, incidentally giving the family its name. Nest digging may be undertaken by the male alone or by both sexes. In the case of nests dug into tree trunks, the wood must be strong enough not to collapse but soft enough to dig out. Trogons have been observed landing on <b>dead</b> <b>tree</b> trunks and slapping the wood with their tails, presumably to test the firmness.|$|E
25|$|Mowgli steals a lit torch at {{the village}} {{to use as a}} weapon and heads back to the jungle, accidentally {{starting}} a wildfire in the process. He confronts Shere Khan, who argues that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by causing the wildfire. Mowgli throws the torch into the water, giving Shere Khan the advantage. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack intervene and hold Shere Khan off, giving Mowgli enough time to set a trap. He lures Shere Khan up a <b>dead</b> <b>tree</b> and onto a branch, which breaks under the tiger's weight and Shere Khan falls into the fire to his death. Mowgli then directs the elephants to divert the river and put out the fire.|$|E
25|$|In Minas Tirith, Faramir and Éowyn {{meet in the}} Houses of Healing {{and fall}} in love with each other, with Éowyn {{choosing}} to eschew any further hopes of glory with Aragorn. Aragorn comes to Minas Tirith and is crowned King of Gondor outside the walls of the city in a celebration during which Frodo brings Aragorn the ancient crown of Gondor, and Gandalf places the crown on Aragorn. A healed Faramir is appointed Prince of Ithilien, and Beregond—who saved Faramir's life from the madness of Denethor—is named captain of Faramir's guard. Gandalf and Aragorn go off high above the city and find a seedling of the White Tree, which Aragorn then plants in Minas Tirith in place of the <b>dead</b> <b>tree.</b> Soon after, Arwen, daughter of Elrond of Rivendell, as well as Celeborn and Galadriel come to Minas Tirith, and Aragorn marries Arwen.|$|E

She attacks him, accuses him of planning to leave her, mounts him, and then smashes a large block of wood onto his testicles, causing him to lose consciousness. The woman then performs a sex act on the unconscious man, culminating in an ejaculation of blood. She drills a hole through his leg, bolting a heavy grindstone through the wound, and then tossing the wrench she used under the cabin. He awakens alone; unable to loosen the bolt, he hides by dragging himself into the deep, dark foxhole {{at the base of the}} <b>dead</b> <b>tree.</b> Following the sound of a crow he has found buried alive in the hole, she locates him and attacks and mostly buries him with a shovel.|$|E
500|$|Babcock {{was born}} into a family of {{thirteen}} children on a farm in Frontenac County, Ontario. According to Babcock, the barn where he was born (which no longer exists) was located off Highway 38 in South Frontenac Township. His father died in 1906 after a tree-cutting accident, when Babcock was only six years old. As described in his account given to Maclean's, while his father was cutting down one tree, another <b>dead</b> <b>tree</b> fell on his shoulder. Although he was brought into the house on bobsleigh, he only survived another two hours. Babcock said that this was an [...] "awful blow" [...] to the family.|$|E
500|$|Like other elanid kites, black-shouldered kites hunt by {{quartering}} grasslands {{for small}} creatures. This can {{be from a}} perch, but more often by hovering in mid-air. When hunting the kite hovers with its body hanging almost vertically, and its head into the wind. Unlike the Australian kestrel, the black-winged kite shows no obvious sideways movement, even in a strong breeze. One study of a nesting pair noted that the male searched aerially for 82% of the search time. Typically, a kite will hover [...] above a particular spot, peering down intently, sometimes {{for only a few}} seconds, often for a minute or more, then glide swiftly to a new vantage point and hover again. When hunting from a perch, a <b>dead</b> <b>tree</b> is the preferred platform. Like other Elanus kites, The black-shouldered kite grips a vertical branch with a foot on either side, each one above the other and turned inwards, which enables them to maintain a secure footing on relatively small branches. Though hovering is the most common hunting method, the kites have been observed searching the ground beneath a vantage point for periods of up to an hour.|$|E

500|$|Five other Armillaria {{species are}} found in Australia. Within the range of A.luteobubalina, A.hinnulea is {{restricted}} to gully habitats. A.fumosa is a rarer species found only in poorly drained or seasonally wet locations. A.luteobubalina and A.montagnei [...] share cap features and a similar unpleasant flavour, but the latter species has an olive-tinged cap, larger spores (9.5–11 by 5.5–7µm compared to 6.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5µm) and a more conspicuous annulus than those found in A.luteobubalina. The morphology of the vegetative structures of A.limonea is distinctly different than A.luteobubalina, {{and can be used}} to distinguish the two species. [...] A.novae-zelandiae has a sticky more flattened cap and stem below the ring and is found in wet forests, and A.pallidula is a species with cream gills maturing to pale pink found in tropical Australia arising from <b>dead</b> <b>tree</b> stumps or the roots of dead or living trees. A.luteobubalina is the only Armillaria species which occurs in Western Australia. Distinguishing Australian species is economically important, because A.luteobubalina is more pathogenic than {{the other members of the}} genus. A molecular diagnostic test, developed in 2002, can accurately identify each species using DNA extracted from its mycelia. Before this, species identification was limited to times when fruit bodies were in season. This technology also revealed a variation in the molecular material of A.luteobubalina that suggested sexual reproduction.|$|E

40|$|Rotten and <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> are {{the main}} {{component}} of forest ecosystems and {{play an important role in}} maintaining forest biodiversity. In this research frequency and characteristics of large diameter trees (normal, rotten, and <b>dead</b> <b>trees)</b> with diameter at breast height greater than 60 cm were studied in two compartments (selective logged and protected) in Asalem-Nav forest. Random systematic sampling method with grid of 100 × 100 m and plot area of 0. 2 ha was used for data collection. The results showed frequency and volume of large diameter trees of all three groups in the logged parcel were lower than protected parcel (P < 0. 01). The height of rotten <b>trees</b> and <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> in the protected compartment were greater than logged compartment (P < 0. 01). Thick trees of all three groups in the protected compartment were compounded from more species than logged compartment as well. Cavities created by forest birds on the bole of rotten <b>trees</b> and <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> have more frequency in the protected compartment than the logged compartment. This research indicated that protection of rotten <b>trees,</b> <b>dead</b> <b>trees</b> and remaining thicker trees from different species have special importance for protection of natural structure and biodiversity of forest stands...|$|R
