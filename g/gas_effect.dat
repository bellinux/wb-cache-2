Some 50 million years later, near the end of the Permian period, volcanic activity would burn the carbonaceous matter, releasing the carbon dioxide and acidic components, creating a sudden greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>effect</b> that warmed the oceans and released methane from the ocean beds, all leading towards the Permian-Triassic extinction event, killing 90% of the species on Earth.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of free-stream disturbances and the bow shock wave in hypersonic flow past a blunt leading edge {{is an important}} part of hypersonic boundary layer receptivity to free-stream disturbances. It has been shown that, for a perfect gas, the back and forth interaction and reflection of acoustic waves behind the shock greatly amplify the magnitudes of the disturbance waves. The interaction also generates a wide range of wavelengths for entropy and vorticity waves behind the shock due to the nonuniformity of mean flow over the body. For hypersonic flow over a blunt body, real <b>gas</b> <b>effects</b> become important because of high gas temperature behind the shock. In this paper, nonequilibrium real <b>gas</b> <b>effects</b> on the free-stream disturbance/bow shock interaction for hypersonic flow past a cylinder are investigated by numerical simulations and by linear analysis.
