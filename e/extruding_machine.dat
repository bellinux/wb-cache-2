In view of this, there should be a platform that bridges the gap between the rich manufacturing industries and the less privileged in the maintenance world or a platform that provides a face lift for the customary approach for maintenance practices. The customary maintenance technique is breakdown maintenance (which is also called unplanned maintenance, or run-to-failure maintenance), takes place only at breakdowns. Therefore this article gives an attempted concept of using an embedded approach in embedding sensors (agent hardware) for monitoring machinery conditions from the perspective view of vibration and temperature effects on machines performance.|$|E

Once the process had been validated, D-Lab researchers and AEST employees implemented the procedure at AEST's briquette production site, building a brick furnace and case hardening three screws. AEST has since reported that the case hardened screw produces twice as many briquettes during its lifespan as the untreated screw does.

30|$|The {{manufacture}} of HDPE pipes of 32  mm outer diameter involves an extrusion process for extruding a hollow pipe using blow molding technique. The elements required for extrusion process are the <b>extruding</b> <b>machine</b> setup and PolyEthylene (PE) granules. The selected {{material for the}} pipe (PE granules) is first heated in the mixer machine. After attaining the required temperature, it is manually fed into the extruder machine through a feeder. Here, the material enters into the long barrel of the machine where the material is fed all through the process through the feeding zone, melts in the melting zone and is pushed into the die head in the pushing zone. Here, the barrel {{is divided into three}} zones to maintain equal material flow rate throughout the process. For this purpose, a rotating screw is fixed inside the barrel (which would be almost the size of the barrel). This screw pushes the material from the feeder to the die head. The die head is fixed, based on the diameter of the pipe required. At this die head, pressurized air is sent in between the material for attaining hollow shape. The pipe coming out of the die head is cooled using cooling water supply for the solidification purpose. Proper cooling temperature should be maintained for the solidification and smooth finish of the pipe at the die head. The pipe coming out of die head is first sent into the cooling tank and then it is pulled by the take-off machine. The speed of the take-off machine is set based on the required pipe thickness. This pipe will be further sent for pressure testing to test the withstanding pressure. HDPE plastic pipes are mainly used for transportation of water {{from one place to another}} place. Hence, these pipes undergo tremendous pressure by water. Higher withstanding pressure is supposed to result in a better condition of the pipe. Therefore, the withstanding pressure should be set the higher the better.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{master s}} thesis is to {{investigate}} the corrosion fatigue properties of an extruded AA 6082 alloy. Surface roughness deeply affects fatigue and corrosion fatigue. Surface roughness depends on the shaping process. Three shaping processes have been studied: machining, punching, and counter trimming. Counter trimming is a two-punch process, with the second punch coming from the opposite direction to the first punch. These shaping processes have very different surfaces and surface roughness. Corrosion fatigue tests has been executed with constant amplitude loading, R = 0. 1, and with samples submerged in a 5 wt% NaCl water solution. Every sample which were punched or counter trimmed, and tested in saltwater, were optically scanned prior to testing. The topography and surface roughness are therefore thoroughly accounted for. To account for fracture initiation, the minimum of four samples from each process were studied in SEM. Some additional samples tested in air were investigated in SEM as well. Corrosion rates, temperature, and humidity were also accounted for. The fatigue and corrosion fatigue life ranked as following: Machined > Counter trimmed > Punched. The difference between the processes were reduced when tested in saltwater. Fractography showed that the wounds created during punching and counter trimming were responsible for fracture initiation. For the machined series, the corners between the <b>extruded</b> and <b>machined</b> edge were responsible. The fracture surfaces had clearly visible grain boundaries in SEM. This was attributed to corrosion. The machined surface showed a far superior surface roughness, with very low Ra, Rt, Rz, and Rv values. Rv proved to be very accurate predicting which side of a sample would have fracture initiation. Topography also showed that the punching parameters used for the samples tested in this thesis were not ideal. Using the difference in corrosion rates between the different surfaces, the increase in surface area due to punching and counter trimming was determined. Compared to the machined surface, the punched and counter trimmed surface had an increase of surface area equal to a factor of 2. 55 and 2. 41, respectively...|$|R
