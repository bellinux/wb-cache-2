2500|$|When Qiao Xuan's {{youngest}} son {{was ten years}} old, he ventured out alone and was kidnapped by three robbers. The robbers, holding the boy hostage, broke into Qiao Xuan's house and demanded a ransom but Qiao Xuan refused to pay them. Yang Qiu (陽球), the Colonel of the Capital Province (司隷校尉), along with the Intendant of Henan (河南尹) and the Prefect of Luoyang (洛陽令), led several soldiers to surround Qiao Xuan's house. Yang Qiu did not order his men to advance further because he was worried that the robbers would harm Qiao Xuan's son. However, Qiao Xuan shouted, [...] "Such criminals have no humanity! I'll not let these criminals <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> {{just for the sake}} of my son!" [...] He then instructed the soldiers to force their way in and attack the robbers. The robbers were killed but Qiao Xuan's son also died in the struggle. Qiao Xuan later wrote a memorial to the imperial court, requesting for the following law to be implemented: [...] "Any person who takes another person hostage should be killed. No ransom is to be paid, so as to deny an opportunity for criminals to make pecuniary gains." [...] The imperial court approved. Since after the reign of Emperor An ( [...] 106–125), law enforcement had weakened. Many kidnapping and hostage-taking incidents occurred in the imperial capital and even the family members of government officials and influential persons became victims. However, after the case of Qiao Xuan's son, such incidents never happened again.|$|E
