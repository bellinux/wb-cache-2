50|$|The planned {{wind farm}} was {{approximately}} 18 km {{off the coast}} of Norfolk at Sheringham, just within the 12 nm UK territorial water boundary, and 5 km north of the sand bank known as Sheringham shoal. The wind farm would be located at water depths of 16 to 22 m and consist of somewhere between 45 and 108 turbines. Benefits of the site included low shipping and trawling intensities; lack of any dredging, dumping, oil/gas, or MoD practice areas, and of cables or pipelines; as well as low visual impact from the coast, and outside any nature conservation areas. The seabed at the windfarm and offshore cable route consisted of mainly gravely sand, overlying chalk. The electrical power <b>export</b> <b>cable</b> was to be connected to a switching station near Muckleburgh Collection, via landfall near Weybourne Hope. Two routes were considered for the <b>export</b> <b>cable,</b> one avoiding the sand bank atSheringham shoal. The connection to the National Grid was planned to be made at an electrical substation near Salle, Norfolk via a 132kV 21.3 km underground cable.|$|E
50|$|A {{planning}} {{application for}} the offshore elements was submitted in early 2012. The formal developer was Triton Knoll Offshore Wind Farm Ltd, a 100% subsidiary of RWE Npower Renewables -they {{applied for a}} wind farm of 135 km2 in size off the North Norfolk and Lincolnshire coast in the southern North Sea; the development area was cut in two by a NE/SW running pipeline channel of 500 m width. The proposed wind farm would be of up to 1200MW capacity, with turbines foundations in water with depth of 18 to 24 m. The planning application included the offshore structures, but excluded the undersea <b>export</b> <b>cable,</b> and onshore electrical infrastructure.|$|E

50|$|In September 2013 {{remedial}} work was begun on the <b>export</b> <b>cables</b> close to shore as the cables were not buried sufficiently deeply. The work which {{was meant to}} take three weeks was only finished in September 2014. The work caused problems for local fishermen who asked the Greater Gabbard Offshore Wind Farm for a disruption payment. A spokesman for SSE denied that the work {{was responsible for the}} snagging of fishing nets.|$|R
50|$|The {{offshore}} substation design was subcontracted to Ramboll, with medium voltage turbine to offshore transformer submarine cables supplied by Nexans. High voltage 150 kV submarine <b>export</b> <b>cables</b> and 150/275 kV underground cables were contracted {{to be supplied}} from LS Cable & System of Korea. The cable landing point is to be near Tunstall, East Riding of Yorkshire, with a national grid connection made via the buried cables to new substation at Salt End.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 Nexans {{was awarded}} a {{contract}} to supply inter-array and <b>export</b> <b>cabling</b> for the windfarm, consisting of 32 and 40 km of 36kV three core cables. MT Hojgaard was contracted to install the offshore foundations. Siemens Wind obtained the contract to supply 54 of its SWT-3.7-107 wind turbines for the farm, and Siemens Power Transmission & Distribution supplied the onshore 33 to 132kV substation and associated switchgear, and was contracted to lay the onshore cables.|$|R
50|$|The {{device is}} moored by a mid-water buoy, which is {{fixed to the}} seabed by four spread mooring lines which are {{anchored}} to the sea-bed by pile or gravity anchors. The buoy design is also unique in that it encompasses a geo-fixed part that is anchored to the seabed and a rotating part that is linked to Evopod by a rigid yoke. The turbine drag forces are therefore transmitted through a bearing system linking the fixed and rotating parts of the buoy. A slip ring power export swivel {{is located in the}} buoy so that twist is not imparted into the umbilical cable that takes the power from the midwater buoy to the seabed. A subsea power <b>export</b> <b>cable</b> links the umbilical’s seabed connection point to the shore.|$|E
5000|$|A scoping {{report for}} [...] "Project Two" [...] was {{published}} in October 2012. The subzone {{was expected to be}} developed in a number of phases, with a potential wind turbine capacity of 1.8 GW, in an area of around 400 km2 located in the centre of the Hornsea wind farm zone. Project 2 was use the same route for its electrical <b>export</b> <b>cable</b> as Project One, and to use either HVAC or HVDC with a separate onshore substation. Suitable areas for the Project 2 development were identified as being adjacent to the north, east or west of the Zone 1, which was located in the shallowest area of the whole Hornsea zone. The design considered piled, suction pile, monopile or gravity base foundations for wind turbines of 5 to 15 MW rated power.|$|E
5000|$|Construction {{started in}} 2010 and was {{completed}} in August 2011.

Bladt Industries/Offshore Structures (Britain) Ltd. was awarded a contract for 96 tower transition pieces in early 2017, to be constructed at Aalborg, Denmark and Billingham, UK.|$|R
50|$|In April 2015 the {{developers}} submitted their planning application for the electrical power export system. HVAC {{was identified as}} the preferred method of electrical power export; HVDC and mixed HVDC/HVAC systems were considered but HVDC was rejected primarily on cost grounds, with the <b>export</b> <b>cable</b> length not sufficiently long to justify a HVDC system. Overhead lines were rejected on environmental impact grounds. A landfall at or near Anderby Creek was identified as likely, An intermediate electric compound (IEC) use to regulate the reactive power of the AC cables, and a preferred site was selected {{to the west of}} Skegness Stadium. A final substation site at or near Double Twelve Groves northwest of the Bicker Fen connection, and adjacent east of the South Forty Drain was shortlisted as the preferred option. Offshore and onshore export cables were to be energised at up to 220kV for a connection at Bicker Fen at 400kV.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{has been}} produced {{to provide the}} definition and rationale for the Baseline Offshore Wind farm established within IEA Wind Task 26 – Cost of Wind Energy. The Baseline has been developed {{in order to provide}} a common starting point for country comparisons and sensitivity analysis on key offshore wind cost and value drivers. The baseline project reflects an approximate average of the characteristics of projects installed between 2012 and 2014, with the project life assumed to be 20 years. The baseline wind farm is located 40 km from construction and O&M ports and from <b>export</b> <b>cable</b> landfall. The wind farm consists of 100 4 MW wind turbines mounted on monopile foundations in average water depth 25 metres, connected by 33 kV inter-array cables. The arrays are connected to a single offshore substation (33 kV/ 220 kV) mounted on a jacket foundation, with the substation connected via a single 220 kV <b>export</b> <b>cable</b> to an onshore substation, 10 km from landfall. The wind farm employs a port-based O&M strategy using crew-transfer vessels. The baseline wind farm applies a 70 / 30 debt/equity ratio with resulting pre-tax WACC of 8. 00 % (7. 10 % post-tax). A generic tax rate of 25 % has been applied, intended to be representative of the range of tax rates in Task 26 member countries. The site properties and technology choices have been used to estimate CapEx, OpEx and net energy production. These assumptions, together with the project life and financing inputs have been used to generate a baseline LCOE. JRC. C. 7 -Knowledge for the Energy Unio...|$|E
40|$|Offshore {{wind power}} plants (OWPPs) {{tend to be}} larger in size and distant from shore. It is widely {{accepted}} that for long distances HVDC links are preferred over HVAC transmission. Accordingly, one possible approach might be to consider not only a DC transmission system {{but also for the}} WPP collection grid. In this paper, a technical and economic comparison analysis of the conventional AC OWPP scheme and four proposed DC OWPPs topologies is addressed. Due to the conceptual novelty of DC technologies for OWPPs, uncertainty on electrical parameters and cost functions is relevant. A sensitivity analysis of the cost and efficiency of the components, OWPP rated power, <b>export</b> <b>cable</b> lengths and some economic data is carried out. For this study, a methodology is proposed and implemented in DIgSILENT Power Factory. To compare conventional AC offshore collector grid and the various proposed DC configurations, an OWPP based on Horn's Rev wind farm is selected as base case. The analysis of the results shows that, in general terms, DC OWPPs present capital costs comparable with conventional AC OWPPs, as well as lower energy losses, concluding that DC collector grid could be of interest for future OWPP installations.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{construction}} of the offshore wind farms on the turbidity was local and temporary, with {{no significant difference between the}} before and after situation. Erosion pits were formed, both around gravity based foundations and monopiles, though erosion protection provided the necessary stability. Dredging/filling works were more complex than expected. Large volumes of sand were lost and sand pits did not refill naturally. In dune migrating areas the coverage of <b>export</b> <b>cables</b> could not be guaranteed.
