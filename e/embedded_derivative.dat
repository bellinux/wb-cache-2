For bonds here, {{there are two}} main approaches: (1) Depending on the type of option, the option price, as calculated using Black Scholes, is either added to or subtracted from the price of the [...] "straight" [...] bond (i.e. as if it had no optionality) and this total is then the value of the bond. (2) A bespoke [...] "tree" [...] (usually a lattice based short rate model) may be constructed where the option's effect is incorporated at each node in the tree, affecting either the bond price or the option price as specified; see further under bond option. Once the price has been calculated, the various yields can then be calculated for the security. Other securities with <b>embedded</b> <b>derivatives</b> are priced similarly.|$|R
5000|$|The boards {{disagreed}} {{on several}} important issues, and also took {{different approaches to}} developing the new financial instruments standard. [...] FASB attempted to develop a comprehensive standard that would address classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting at the same time, and issued an exposure draft of a standard addressing all three components in 2010. [...] In contrast, the IASB attempted to develop the new standard in phases, releasing each component of the new standard separately. [...] In 2009, IASB issued the first portion of IFRS, covering classification and measurement of financial assets. [...] This was intended to replace the asset classification and measurement sections of IAS 39, but not supersede other sections of IAS 39.

5000|$|As amended, IFRS 9 {{had four}} {{possible}} classification categories for financial assets, including a FVOCI classification for debt instruments.

[...] In {{order to meet the}} contractual cash flow test, the cash flows from the instrument must consist of only principal and interest. [...] Among the amendments to classification and measurement made in the 2014 update, de minimis and [...] "non-genuine" [...] features can be disregarded from the test, meaning that a de minimis feature would not preclude an instrument from being reported at amortized cost or FVOCI.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the pricing of variable annuity <b>embedded</b> <b>derivatives</b> in a Lévy process setting. This is one of the practical issues that continues to face life insurers in the management of <b>derivatives</b> <b>embedded</b> within these products. It also addresses how such providers can protect themselves against adverse scenarios through a hedging framework built from the pricing framework. The aim is to comparatively consider the price differentials of a life insurer that prices its variable annuity guarantees under the more actuarially accepted regime-switching framework versus the use of a Lévy framework. The framework should address the inadequacies of conventional deterministic pricing approaches used by life insurers given the increasing complexity of the option-like products sold. The study applies finance models in the insurance context given the similarities in payoff structure of the products offered while taking into account the differences that may exist. The underlying Lévy process used in this study is the Variance-Gamma (VG) process. This process is useful in option pricing given its ability to model higher moments, skewness and kurtosis, and also incorporate stochastic volatility. The research results compare well with the regime-switching framework besides the added merit in the use of a more refined model for the underlying that captures most of the observed market dynamics.

40|$|Contemporary actuarial and {{accounting}} practices (APN 110 in the South African context) {{require the use}} of market-consistent models for the valuation of <b>embedded</b> investment <b>derivatives.</b> These models have to be calibrated with accurate and up-to-date market data. Arguably, the most important variable in the valuation of <b>embedded</b> equity <b>derivatives</b> is implied volatility. However, accurate long-term volatility estimation is difficult because of a general lack of tradable, liquid medium- and long-term derivative instruments, be they exchange-traded or over the counter. In South Africa, given the relatively short-term nature of the local derivatives market, this is of particular concern. This paper attempts to address this concern by: — providing a comprehensive, critical evaluation of the long-term volatility models most commonly used in practice, encompassing simple historical volatility estimation and econometric, deterministic and stochastic volatility models; and — introducing several fairly recent nonparametric alternative methods for estimating long-term volatility, namely break-even volatility and canonical option valuation. The authors apply these various models and methodologies to South African market data, thus providing practical, long-term volatility estimates under each modelling framework whilst accounting for real-world difficulties and constraints. In so doing, they identify those models and methodologies they consider to be most suited to long-term volatility estimation and propose best estimation practices within each identified area. Thus, while application is restricted to the South African market, the general discussion, as well as the suggestion of best practice, in each of the evaluated modelling areas remains relevant for all long-term volatility estimation...|$|R

This convergence, however, poses a serious challenge before Corporate Governance. Contemporary Institution of Corporate Governance, based on Auditors (Internal & External), Audit Committee and Statutes, needs to reinvent and reinforce its role for meaningful and honest implementation of Ind-AS. One of the principle concepts in these standards is - Fair Value. However, there is considerable subjectivity and judgement associated in this area, leaving broad scope to management discretion.

40|$|IAS 39 {{is going}} to {{significantly}} increase the workload of a corporate treasury. At the very least, all derivatives {{will need to be}} valued regularly and other assets may need to be valued or monitored depending on their classification. Other instruments, such as <b>embedded</b> <b>derivatives</b> and projected transactions that may not have traditionally been within the scope of the corporate treasurer or the treasury system, will also have to be evaluated. Essentially, treasury personnel are going to need far more flexibility in recording and tracking potential and actual exposures than they have in the past. Taking changes in the fair value of derivatives directly to the profit and loss account is highly likely to increase earnings volatility. This is illogical when you consider that these derivatives are hedges that exist primarily to reduce the volatility of actual economic earnings! This {{is one of the reasons}} hedge accounting has been permitted. If a hedge can be assigned to one or more exposures, then the changes in the value of the hedge can be offset against the change in the value of the hedged item and only the residual or ineffective portion will go to profit and loss. However, if a company decides to apply hedge accounting, this may create a whole new burden for the corporate treasury. Initially, testing will have to be done to demonstrate that the hedge is expected to be highly effective. A hedging relationship will also need to be formally designated and documented. The documentation will need to detail the objective and strategy of the hedge, the nature of the hedged risk and the testing method used to demonstrate effectiveness. Testing will have to be done prospectively and retrospectively throughout the life of a hedging relationship. For most corporates, using a system to do the grunt work will naturally be the preferred approach. The first requirement of an IAS 39 compliance system should be to reduce this workload, specifically by automating the tasks o...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Risk Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Banks and {{financial}} institutions record core banking activities (taking deposits and making loans) {{on the balance}} sheet of the banking book, but trading book (trading and investment) pursuits are recorded off-balance-sheet. Both books are subject to considerable risk from numerous sources, but regulatory capital reserves - to shield from unexpected market moves - are not required for the banking book as they are for the trading book. Both of these substantial shortcomings will be addressed in the near future. The 2005 initiation of new global accounting standards will ensure that trading book derivative fair values are recorded and reported on the balance sheet while the new Basel accord, due for full implementation in 2007, will regulate the calculation and reservation of capital required for the banking book. These changes are expected to better regulate and manage the transparency of financial institutions' activities and so prevent large scale economic disasters or deliberate corporate fraud. Institutions not compliant with the new rules will face severe financial losses, regulatory fines and possible debilitating legal action. One of the most commonly-used tools for measuring and managing interest rate risk, the Macaulay duration, has enjoyed almost unchallenged success, but it employs severely restrictive and unrealistic assumptions which constrain its usefulness and reliability in the rapidly-changing world of defaultable securities, those with <b>embedded</b> <b>derivatives</b> and instruments with perpetual maturities. Robust measures which more accurately approximate interest rate risk by relaxing unrealistic assumptions are required. Applications which significantly improve {{the accuracy of the}} Macaulay duration are considered as well as a new look at the duration problem in general. The influence of a more accurate duration measure on duration gap provides a significantly improved economic Market Value of Equity. The role of this enhanced measure is crucial for risk management as well as regulatory and accounting compliance. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|Research Question/ Purpose: Due to the {{increasing}} importance of international financial markets the significance of IAS 39 rises enormously. IAS 39 deals with the measurement and recognition of financial instruments. One major aim is the valuation of the instrument at fair value. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} paper is the examination of the major characteristics of the Fair Value Option (FVO) of IAS 39 and its affect on financial institutions. Design/Methodology/Approach: An interpretative research philosophy is chosen in order to write the thesis. Therefore, the annual business reports of four major European banking institutions Dresdner Bank AG (Germany), Royal Bank of Scotland Group (Scotland), Nordea (Scandinavia), Crédit Mutuel (France) are examined. The gathered information does not have a statistical value, meaning that it cannot be used in order to develop a general conclusion Findings: The analysis of the empirical findings and the amended FVO exhibits that banks tends to implement the FVO and FVA instead of applying Historical Cost Accounting. In addition a coherency is drawn between the major results of the empirical study, namely the importance of Fair Value Accounting (FVA). Conclusion: The conclusion can be drawn, that the FVO presents a milestone towards FVA but that the development is still in process. The FVO supports the reduction of accounting mismatches and facilitates the valuation of <b>embedded</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Furthermore, FVA increases the comparability and transparency of financial statements. Research Limitations: Due to the limitation of time, only a small number of banking institutions can be analyzed. A second limitation is that the banks have to adapt IAS and IFRS as their accounting standards. Originality /Value:. The aim of this paper is not to generalize but to prove with the support of a small sample the effects of the FVO on the four selected financial institutions.
