The application of cathodic polarization at − 0. 9 VSCE on the <b>epoxy</b> <b>coating</b> increases the extent of degradation and reduces the protective properties of the coating, which may be attributed to the strengthened basic environment at the coating/metal interface due to cathodic polarization. While for the zinc-rich <b>epoxy</b> <b>coating,</b> cathodic polarization at − 0. 9 VSCE decreases the dissolution rate of the zinc particles in coating and increases the coating resistance. The activation of zinc particles is delayed and the cathodic protection time contributed by the zinc particles is prolonged.
