5|$|To {{perform in}} vitro analysis, a protein must be {{purified}} {{away from other}} cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis, in which a cell's membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as a crude lysate. The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation, which fractionates the various cellular components into fractions containing soluble proteins; membrane lipids and proteins; cellular organelles, and nucleic acids. Precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the proteins from this lysate. Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge and binding affinity. The level of purification can be monitored using various types of gel electrophoresis if the desired protein's molecular weight and isoelectric point are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity.

5000|$|As protein {{electrophoresis}} {{does not}} completely distinguish between A1AT and other minor proteins at the alpha-1 position (agarose gel), antitrypsin {{can be more}} directly and specifically measured using a nephelometric or immunoturbidimetric method. Thus, protein electrophoresis is useful for screening and identifying individuals {{likely to have a}} deficiency. A1AT is further analyzed by isoelectric focusing (IEF) in the pH range 4.5-5.5, where the protein migrates in a gel according to its isoelectric point or charge in a pH gradient.Normal A1AT is termed M, as it migrates toward the center of such an IEF gel. Other variants are less functional and are termed A-L and N-Z, dependent on whether they run proximal or distal to the M band. The presence of deviant bands on IEF can signify the presence of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Since the number of identified mutations has exceeded the number of letters in the alphabet, subscripts have been added to most recent discoveries in this area, as in the Pittsburgh mutation described above. As every person has two copies of the A1AT gene, a heterozygote with two different copies of the gene may have two different bands showing on <b>electrofocusing,</b> although a heterozygote with one null mutant that abolishes expression of the gene will only show one band.

Nanofluidics, microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip technology has garnered much attention {{in recent years}} due to the opportunities it offers in analytical chemistry and point-of-care. However, {{an understanding of the}} physicochemical phenomena associated with biomolecular separations within nanofluidic devices is needed to enable those possibilities. The work presented in this manuscript describes a novel nanofluidic device designed to simultaneously separate and concentrate dilute biomarkers within low volume samples. The mechanism of separation driving biomolecules within the nanofluidic device is the continuous counteracting forces of electrophoresis and electro-osmosis {{in the presence of a}} spatial gradient that modulates molecular mobility (conductivity gradient or pH gradient) induced along the nanochannels of the device. R-phycoerythrin, streptavidin-Dylight, DNA, and PNA (peptide nucleic acid) were focused and separated within the nanochannel under various conditions and their respective behaviours were characterized. A pH gradient was applied along the nanochannel device by introducing two different pH buffers at opposite terminals of the nanochannel and applying an axial voltage across the channel. Fluorescent proteins, phycoerythrin and Dylight labelled streptavidin, were concentrated within the channel reaching concentration enhancement (CE) factors of over 380 within 5 minutes. A conductivity gradient was also applied along the nanochannel by introducing buffers of dissimilar salt concentrations at the terminals of the nanochannel in order to create a trapping condition similar to the pH gradient method. Simultaneous separation and concentration of Bacillus cereus DNA and R-phycoerythrin was achieved to a CE of over 900. The conductivity gradient technique was also used to detect hybridization between oligonucleotides and complementary strands of PNA. This work illustrates how these <b>electrofocusing</b> devices are capable of matrix-free separation and concentration of biomarkers. In the future, this technology may enable on-chip integration of orthogonal separation techniques with mass spectrometry.

Three protein fractions with isoelectric points of 8. 0, 8. 4, and 9. 0 were isolated by differential solubility in ethanol and acetate-buffered saline followed by isoelectric focusing and shown to be antigenically identical to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type B. The molecular weights of all three fractions were approximately 17, 500, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with aggregates forming in the presence of hyaluronic acid. Only the pI 8. 4 fraction showed the characteristic activities of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin in rabbits: pyrogenicity and ability to enhance susceptibility to lethal endotoxin shock. The pI 8. 0 and pI 9. 0 fractions were not pyrogenic, but could be used to immunize against pyrogenicity.
