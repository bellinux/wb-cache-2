25|$|I met Laughton only once, at a party. Of all {{the actors}} I have seen, I {{think he would}} have come closest to doing Nero Wolfe perfectly. A motion picture {{producer}} (<b>I</b> <b>forget</b> who) asked him to do a series of Nero Wolfe movies, and he had said he would agree to do one but would not commit himself to a series.|$|E

There I sat, in a fool's elysium of my own making, with absolutely nothing in my mind but the picture of Naomi's face at the moment when she had last looked at me! ...|$|R
25|$|In 2003, Michael and Joel Douglas {{produced}} It Runs in the Family, which {{along with}} Kirk starred various family members, including Michael, Michael's son, {{and his wife}} from 50 years earlier, Diana Dill, playing his wife. In March 2009, Douglas did an autobiographical one-man show, Before <b>I</b> <b>Forget,</b> at the Center Theatre Group's Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City, California.

By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E
25|$|Peno {{joined with}} guitarist and vocalist Kim Salmon (The Scientists, Beasts of Bourbon) in 2005 to form country music group, Darling Downs. They {{recorded}} two albums, How Can <b>I</b> <b>Forget</b> This Heart of Mine? (2005) and From One to Another (2007).

25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. <b>I</b> <b>forget</b> every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
500|$|Strauss was {{admired by}} other {{prominent}} composers: Richard Wagner once {{admitted that he}} liked the waltz [...] "Wein, Weib und Gesang" [...] Op.333. Richard Strauss (unrelated to the Strauss family), when writing his Rosenkavalier waltzes, said in reference to Johann Strauss, [...] "How could <b>I</b> <b>forget</b> the laughing genius of Vienna?" ...|$|E
500|$|Yitzhak Azulay {{composed}} the music played in Fill the Void. He chose primarily melodic and traditional pieces, using them frequently throughout the film. Other soundtrack is composed largely of contemporary Orthodox pop music, and the prayers are [...] "regularly chanted rather than spoken". The song [...] "Im Eshkachech Yerushalayim" [...] (Hebrew: אם אשכחך ירושלים, 'If <b>I</b> <b>Forget</b> Thee Jerusalem') features {{prominently in the}} film, playing at {{all three of the}} major events: the funeral, the Bris Milah, and the wedding. Azulay used an a cappella version of the song, which is derived from an excerpt of Psalm 137 and expresses the yearnings of the Jewish people in exile following the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BCE: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>forget</b> you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither; Let my tongue stick to my palate if I cease to think of you, if I do not keep Jerusalem in memory even at my happiest hour." ...|$|E
60|$|I lost my self-control. <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> her sex, <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> {{everything}} {{except that she}} was responsible for this unspeakable corruption. I said terrible things to her.

500|$|The fiction was {{generally}} unremarkable, with few memorable stories being published, {{particularly in the}} earlier versions of the magazines. [...] Lowndes spent much effort to set a friendly and engaging tone in both magazines, with letter columns and reader departments that interested fans. [...] He was more successful than Hornig in obtaining good stories, partly because he had good relationships with several well-known and emerging writers. [...] Among the better-known stories he published were [...] "The Liberation of Earth" [...] by William Tenn, and [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Forget</b> Thee, Oh Earth" [...] by Arthur C. Clarke.|$|E
500|$|Silver himself {{commented that}} {{inspiration}} came from multiple sources: [...] "I'm inspired by nature and {{by some of}} the people I meet and some of the events that take place in my life. I'm inspired by my mentors. I'm inspired by various religious doctrines. [...] Many of my songs are impressed on my mind just before I wake up. Others I get from just doodlin' around on the piano". He also wrote that, [...] "when I wake up with a melody in my head, I jump right out of bed before <b>I</b> <b>forget</b> it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody with my right hand and then harmonize it with my left. I put it down on my tape recorder, and then I work on getting a bridge or eightbar release for the tune." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{virtue of}} their loss, the 1998 Vikings became the first team in NFL history to compile a regular season record of 15–1 and not win the Super Bowl, and Fox Sports, NBC Sports, and the NFL Network each named the team {{as one of the}} 5 {{greatest}} not to win the Super Bowl. Vikings coach Dennis Green believed that the 1998 Vikings would have been considered the best NFL team of their generation had they won the Super Bowl, and due to these lofty perceptions, Damon Amendolara of CBS Radio and Don Banks of Sports Illustrated both consider the Vikings' loss in the championship game {{as one of the most}} devastating in NFL history. The NFL Network cites the loss as another notable example of the turmoil that has plagued the franchise's history, and analyst Bill Simmons concurs, including the loss in a list of moments that [...] " [...] the intestines out of [...] fans." [...] The influence of the loss and its effect on the team's fan base has extended into popular culture, as the game became a plot point in the episode [...] "Little Minnesota" [...] of the television show How I Met Your Mother when a Canadian character asks the significance of a banner in a Minnesota-themed bar which reads, [...] "I'm drinking till <b>I</b> <b>forget</b> the 1999 NFC Championship." ...|$|E
