500|$|In October 2012, it was {{confirmed}} by Daniel Kilkelly, a reporter for Digital Spy, that a new storyline would see Denise Fox (Diane Parish) and Fatboy spend the night together after he rescues her when she gets unwanted attention from a man. Norwood, who plays Fatboy, told Inside Soap, [...] "Right now, I don't think Fatboy is looking for love - but he's happy to be swept off his feet by Denise, who's this hot older woman he never imagined he could be with."Denise is a scorching woman - she's got a dynamite body and a beautiful smile. She's way out of his league, {{but there is a}} lot of chemistry between them. I think they'd make a really good couple. That would be cool. Fatboy may be young, but he's got an old soul and he's not just some young boy messing about. There is potential there if Denise could see it, but because of the age thing, I think she might worry that people were saying things about <b>her.</b> <b>Right</b> <b>now,</b> she's just enjoying herself." [...] Norwood added that while the pair's relationship was sexual, a serious future for them could be possible.|$|E
500|$|Jocelyn Vena of MTV News praised Beyoncé for her [...] "never-miss-a-note voice" [...] and [...] "razzle-dazzle dance moves", and for {{matching}} the crowd's energy with her enthusiasm during live performances. Jozen Cummings of The Wall Street Journal described {{the show as}} Beyoncé's [...] "most intimate work to date", adding {{that it was an}} intimate night between [...] "Beyoncé and her fans, one in which there need not be a specific stand-out moment". Gavin DeGraw of VH1 noted that [...] "there's no doubting Beyoncé's talent as a performer; her undeniable vocal ability, show(wo)manship, and charm" [...] which infused the room the entire evening." [...] By contrast, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave the show a mixed review, writing [...] "a Beyoncé concert is a big, blowsy affair, a bit like a Las Vegas floor show crossed with a typhoon. 'Intimate' is not the adjective that leaps to mind". However, he described Beyoncé as [...] "a woman who can make a club feel like a coliseum". Rosen coined the live performance of [...] "I Was Here" [...] as [...] "a hollow exercise in self-mythologizing". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice placed 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé on her list of The 10 Best Live Shows of 2011. In a review of the show, she commented [...] "The serenity at her core is borne from a supreme amount of confidence; that it comes off as something generously given is a testament to her prodigious talents as a performer on every level. Plus, I mean, have you heard her sing? Nobody has pipes like <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> Not a single person out there. At the very least, we can all learn breath control from her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get busy, and {{go after}} <b>her!</b> <b>Right</b> <b>now!</b> There's {{no time to}} waste. It's almighty luck that she didn't take the wire with her. If she had we'd {{probably}} never have traced her. But we've got to hustle. Where's that Bradshaw?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{your eye}} on the--thing," [...] said the second. [...] "It's {{going to make us}} trouble yet. If I were boss of this job, I'd slow <b>her</b> down <b>right</b> <b>now</b> instead of {{pressing}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Ambrose's worst suspicions were confirmed; {{she went}} down the passage lurching from side to side, and fending off the wall <b>now</b> with <b>her</b> <b>right</b> arm, <b>now</b> with <b>her</b> left; at each lurch she exclaimed emphatically, [...] "Damn!" ...|$|R

I ain't thought o' nothin' else since you told me 'bout how she missed me. I ken see <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> just like I was there. I'll bet she's scrubbin' the kitchen floor.

6000|$|Phillotson nodded, {{and seeing}} how staunch his friend was, became more frank. [...] "No doubt {{when it gets}} known what I've done I shall be thought a soft fool by many. But they don't know Sue as I do. Though so elusive, hers is such an honest nature at bottom that I don't think she has ever done {{anything}} against her conscience. The fact of her having lived with Fawley goes for nothing. At the time she left me for him {{she thought she was}} quite within <b>her</b> <b>right.</b> <b>Now</b> she thinks otherwise." ...|$|E
6000|$|CANDIDA. Of {{course she}} is. (She takes up her handbag.) And now I must leave you to James for the present. I suppose {{you are too}} much of a poet to know the state a woman finds her house in when she's been away for three weeks. Give me my rug. (Eugene takes the {{strapped}} rug from the couch, and gives it to her. She takes it in her left hand, having the bag in <b>her</b> <b>right.)</b> <b>Now</b> hang my cloak across my arm. (He obeys.) Now my hat. (He puts it into the hand which has the bag.) Now open the door for me. (He hurries up before her and opens the door.) Thanks. (She goes out; and Marchbanks shuts the door.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Weary of {{comparisons}} to her father's 1958 Spanish album Cole Español, Cole described her album as [...] "not being {{a tribute to}} my father {{as much as it}} is a tribute to Latin music because of my father". During the recording of the album, Pérez served as Cole's language coach. Cole said [...] "Black people and Hispanic people have the same kind of feel for passion, for music, for fun, for heart." [...] She expressed a love for language by listing [...] "I love French ...

John Bush from the website AllMusic opined that the singer managed to excel in sounding [...] "sizzling" [...] in the song. John Fordham writing for The Guardian felt that the [...] "heated" [...] atmosphere heard on Lee's version of [...] "Fever", [...] "has an underlying suggestion that the person raising the temperature for <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> doesn't {{have to be the}} one doing it next week".|$|E

Matthieu Baligand, her manager and producer at Caramba Entertainment, explained to Libération: [...] "We talk a lot of <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> and people are waiting her at the turn... Despite the demand, it seems preferable to do her first tour in fifty small places which will render her credible. Zaz is a popular, intuitive artist, who is familiar with music, who can sing, but doing a quality show is something else (...)." [...] In November 2010, the debut album Zaz became double platinum and she was awarded [...] "Revelation Song" [...] by the Académie Charles Cros.

5000|$|Chin {{stated the}} album was made at late stages because she's a perfectionist {{in a kind of}} crazy way and it was an {{independent}} album,she also. [...] "Contrary to popular belief, artistes don't always have a bag a money to drop on an album."

5000|$|... "My Mother, the Fiend" [...] also marks Hannigan's {{third and}} final guest {{appearance}} on the show. Hannigan was open to appearing in another episode, but she was unsure whether or not her busy schedule would allow it. She also felt that the character's arc {{had come to a}} natural close in this episode. In an interview, Rob Thomas said that due to her busy schedule, it was difficult to write an episode featuring Hannigan. On Hannigan's role in the episode and her future availability, Thomas commented: Well, to work around Alyson's schedule is really difficult for us. It's hard to plan to write an episode with Alyson in it because we don't know exactly what her free days are. Even the episode that we did with her, there was a huge kerfuffle, we actually had to slide that story line one episode down from when we originally wrote that. We've loved having Alyson in the show, and I'm sure we will again, some day, if she's willing, because we've {{had a lot of fun}} with her. But we have nothing booked with <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b>|$|E
