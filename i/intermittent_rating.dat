However, this approach may not be adequate under actual transient flow conditions. A new approach to the estimation of the capture zone under time-varying flow is developed.

We used four highly reliable, sophisticated noninvasive tests (segmental blood pressure, flow velocity by Doppler ultrasound, postocclusive reactive hyperemia, and pulse reappearance half-time) to assess the prevalence of large-vessel PAD and small-vessel PAD in an older (average age 66 years) defined population of 613 men and women. A total of 11. 7 % of the population had large-vessel PAD on noninvasive testing, and nearly half of those with large-vessel PAD also had small-vessel PAD (5. 2 %). An additional 16. 0 % of the population had isolated small-vessel PAD. Large-vessel PAD increased dramatically with age and was slightly more common in men and in subjects with hyperlipi-demia. Isolated small-vessel PAD, by contrast, was essentially unrelated to sex, hyperlipidemia, or age, although it was somewhat less common before age 60. <b>Intermittent</b> claudication <b>rates</b> in this population were 2. 2 % in men and 1. 7 % in women, and abnormalities in femoral or posterior tibial pulse were present in 20. 3 % of men and 22. 1 % of women compared with the noninvasively assessed large-vessel PAD rate of 11. 7 %.

Independent variables included intervention format (INDI vs. GI), age, smoking status, nicotine dependence, and motivation to quit. At three months post testing, results indicated that both intervention conditions were associated with reduction in smoking related behaviors. Lower smoking status and higher motivation to quit at baseline significantly predicted smoking reduction at follow-up.

We leveled the present-day elevations of paleoshorelines and dated marine terrace deposits using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) to determine coastal uplift. The elevations of the paleoshorelines vary between 4 +/- 0. 2 and 67 +/- 1. 4 m above sea level and OSL ages suggest terrace formation episodes during interglacial periods at ca 125, 190, 400 and 570 ka, corresponding to marine isotopic stages (MIS) 5 e, 7 a, 11 and 15.

Methods: We analyse a large map (40 ´ by 20 ´) obtained with the HERA multibeam receiver (IRAM- 30 m telescope) in a high latitude cloud of the Polaris Flare at unprecedented spatial (11 ´´) and spectral (0. 05 km s- 1) resolution for the 12 (2 - 1) line. Results: We find that two parsec-scale components of velocities differing by ˜ 2 km s- 1, share a narrow interface (< 0. 15 pc) {{that appears to be}} an elongated structure of intense velocity-shear, ˜ 15 to 30 km s- 1 pc- 1. The locus of the extrema of line-centroid-velocity increments (E-CVI) in that field follows this intense-shear structure {{as well as that of}} the 12 (2 - 1) high-velocity line wings. The tiny spatial overlap in projection of the two parsec-scale components implies that they are sheets of CO emission and that discontinuities in the gas properties (CO enrichment and/or increase in gas density) occur at the position of the intense velocity shear. Conclusions: These results identify spatial and kinematic coherence on scales of between 0. 03 pc and 1 pc. They confirm that the departure from Gaussianity of the probability density functions of E-CVIs is a powerful statistical tracer of the intermittency of turbulence. They provide support for a link between large-scale turbulence, its <b>intermittent</b> dissipation <b>rate</b> and low-mass dense core formation.

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a simulation study of a forced circulation, solar hybrid residential-cure-water h ating system which comprises a corrugated absorber water heater and a rock-bed water-to-air heat exchanger-cure-storage unit integrated to a residential building to be heated. The system has been evaluated without and with the hot water load (which is the standard hot water demand for a typical family of two adults and two children in India) in the residential building. To satisfy the heat demand, no auxiliary energy has been assumed to be supplied to the system. The rate of air flow in the system was observed to influence the system performance most significantly. In addition, the mode of operation, i. e. whether the air flow is continuous or intermittent, influences the system performance greatly, a higher and <b>intermittent</b> air flow <b>rate</b> resulting in a more stable and uniform temperature of the living space.

40|$|Conventional {{submerged}} membrane bioreactors (MBRs) rely on {{the coarse}} bubbles aeration to generate shear at the liquid membrane interface to limit membrane fouling. Unfortunately, {{it is a very}} energy consuming method, still often resulting in a rapid decrease of membrane permeability and consequently in higher expenses. In this paper, the feasibility of a novel magnetically induced membrane vibration (MMV) system was studied in a labscale MBR treating synthetic wastewater. The effects on membrane fouling of applied electrical power of different operation strategies, of membrane flux and of the presence of multiple membranes on one vibrating engine on membrane fouling were investigated. The filtration performance was evaluated by determining the filtration resistance profiles and critical flux. The results showed clear advantages of the vibrating system over conventional MBR processes by ensuring higher fluxes at lower fouling <b>rates.</b> <b>Intermittent</b> vibration was found a promising strategy for both efficient fouling control and significant energy saving. The optimised MMV system is presumed to lead to significant energy and cost reduction in up-scaled MBR operations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
