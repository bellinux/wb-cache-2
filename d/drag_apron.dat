5000|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Westfalen was {{converted}} into a seaplane tender {{to serve as a}} weather reporting and refueling station for Dornier Wal flying boats of Deutsche Luft Hansa carrying mail across the Atlantic between Europe and South America. The conversion of the Westfalen consisted of a large retractable stern mounted canvas <b>drag</b> <b>apron</b> for the flying boat to taxi on (i.e. for use in heavy seas and so the ship did not have to come to dead stop), cranes to lift the flying boats out of the water to be refueled and serviced, and a large compressed air catapult for launching the aircraft. [...] When in operation, Westfalen cruised 900 miles {{in the middle of the}} South Atlantic between Bathhurst, Gambia (now Banjul) and Pernambuco, Brazil. The first test trans-Atlantic flights by Lufthansa Wals began in 1933 and the first commercial mail flights in 1934.|$|E

But she had <b>dragged</b> the <b>apron</b> away from her face, and was looking with some puzzlement at meek, gentle little Jeanne, who had {{suddenly}} become so strange, so dictatorial, all unlike her habitual somewhat diffident self.|$|R
