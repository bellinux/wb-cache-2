5000|$|There are {{two primary}} reasons a 7mm recoils {{less than an}} comparably {{effective}} [...]30 cal. cartridge: (1) to match the 7mm's ballistic coefficient requires a significantly <b>heavier</b> [...]30 cal bullet; and (2) to drive that <b>heavier</b> [...]30 cal bullet at similar velocities (for kinetic energy and wind resistance ("time-to-target")), requires more powder.

5|$|Canada was an {{alternative}} source of <b>heavy</b> water. Cominco {{had been involved}} in <b>heavy</b> water research since 1934, and produced it at its smelting plant in Trail, British Columbia. On 26 February 1941, the NRC inquired about its ability to produce <b>heavy</b> water. This was followed on 23 July by a letter from Hugh Taylor, a British-born scientist working at Princeton University, on behalf of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). Taylor offered a NDRC contract to produce , for which the NDRC was prepared to pay $5 per pound for low-grade and $10 for high-grade <b>heavy</b> water. At the time it was selling for up to $1,130 per pound.|$|E
5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of <b>heavy</b> metals including lead. This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize <b>heavy</b> metals into the urine. Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of <b>heavy</b> metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose <b>heavy</b> metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose <b>heavy</b> metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the <b>heavy</b> metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.|$|E

5|$|Cominco had {{produced}} electrolytic hydrogen at Trail, British Columbia, since 1930. Urey suggested in 1941 {{that it could}} produce <b>heavy</b> water. To the existing $10million plant consisting of 3,215 cells consuming 75MW of hydroelectric power, secondary electrolysis cells were added to increase the deuterium concentration in the water from 2.3% to 99.8%. For this process, Hugh Taylor of Princeton developed a platinum-on-carbon catalyst {{for the first three}} stages while Urey developed a nickel-chromia one for the fourth stage tower. The final cost was $2.8million. The Canadian Government did not officially learn of the project until August 1942. Trail's <b>heavy</b> water production started in January 1944 and continued until 1956. <b>Heavy</b> water from Trail was used for Chicago Pile 3, the first reactor using <b>heavy</b> water and natural uranium, which went critical on 15 May 1944.|$|E

5|$|Demand for <b>heavy</b> water {{increased}} in the early 1950s. The <b>heavy</b> water facility at Wabash, now renamed the Dana Plant by the Atomic Energy Commission, was reopened, and DuPont resumed production of <b>heavy</b> water in May 1952. The site was used a pilot plant for a new production process using hydrogen sulphide. The <b>heavy</b> water facility was closed again in early 1957.

5|$|Despite the Italian <b>Heavy</b> Draft's early {{popularity}} as {{a strong}} but fast draft horse, increasing mechanization in the farming and military sectors reduced the need for all draft horses, and population numbers declined. In the 1970s, selection processes were changed {{to focus on the}} production of animals for horse meat, and that has continued to be the primary focus through the present time. In 1976, a breed association was formed in Italy to preserve and promote the Italian <b>Heavy</b> Draft. The association is charged with maintaining the stud book, evaluating breeding stock, granting equine passports, maintaining genetic databases, and exhibiting the breed. The main breeding areas for the Italian <b>Heavy</b> Draft are in the plains and hills around Verona, Padova, Vicenza, Venice, Treviso and Udine. In 2005, it was estimated that there were just under 6,500 Italian <b>Heavy</b> Drafts, about half of which were mares. The registered population at the end of 2010 was 6304, with the largest numbers in Lazio and Umbria; the number of unregistered <b>Heavy</b> Drafts is not reported.|$|E
