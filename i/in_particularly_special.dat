40|$|Abstract – In recent years, {{translation}} {{scholars have}} been highly interested in cultural aspects, developing theories and methods for practice – e. g. functionalist theories, the Skopos theory – that have deeply changed {{the attitude of}} translators toward texts, in particular literary works. This article is meant to reflect on some strategies adopted in my translation from Spanish into Italian of Carmen Laforet’s Nada novel, released <b>in</b> 2004. <b>Particularly,</b> <b>special</b> attention {{will be given to}} realia, linguistic units of extreme interest within literary translation, referring to the surrounding physical and sociocultural reality of the source text exerting a direct and crucial influence upon the process of translating...|$|R

But in Latin America, he is of minimal importance by contrast with other prominent English-language pop-music exports that journal readers will know, such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Smiths or The Cure.

Our paper identifies several reasons: nation-building and rock music’s first steps in Latin America, progressive cultural politics, conservative gender norms and a continent dominated by dictatorships when Bowie was becoming a putative ‘world icon’ [...] ...|$|R

The emphasis {{of this paper is}} placed on the nature and function of such guanxi. By presenting how guanxi is maintained, this paper also analyses the impact and effectiveness of local guanxi as a strategy to cope with poverty. Whereas tunqin guanxi appears to have built rural resilience in order to cushion villagers against life's upheavals, the maintenance of rural guanxi diminishes this resilience as scarce resources are spent on the exchange of cash gifts, thus aggravating local poverty...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform a}} general {{computation}} of the off-shell one-loop divergences in Einstein gravity, in a two-parameter family of path integral measures, corresponding to {{different ways of}} parametrizing the graviton field, and a two-parameter family of gauges. Trying to reduce the gauge- and measure-dependence selects certain classes of measures and gauges respectively. There is a choice of two parameters (corresponding to the exponential parametrization and the partial gauge condition that the quantum field be traceless) that automatically eliminates the dependence on the remaining two parameters and on the cosmological constant. We observe that the divergences are invariant under a Z 2 “duality” transformation that (<b>in</b> a <b>particularly</b> important <b>special</b> case) involves {{the replacement of the}} densitized metric by a densitized inverse metric as the fundamental quantum variable. This singles out a formulation of unimodular gravity as the unique “self-dual” theory in this class. © 2016, The Author(s) ...|$|R

The place possesses more than 100 resorts in which majority provides Ayurvedic spa and treatment to the customers.

While this area has so far been unexplored, we now find that not only the ministry of tourism, government of India, but also the various state tourism boards and even the private sector consisting of travel agents, tour operators, hotel companies and other accommodation providers are all eying health and medical tourism as a segment with tremendous potential for future growth.

40|$|Reliable {{methods are}} needed to detect the {{presence}} of tobacco components in tobacco products to effectively control smuggling and classify tariff and excise in tobacco industry to control illegal tobacco trade. In this study, two sensitive and specific DNA based methods, one quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay and the other loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, were developed for the reliable and efficient detection {{of the presence of}} tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) in various tobacco samples and commodities. Both assays targeted the same sequence of the uridine 5 ′-monophosphate synthase (UMPS), and their specificities and sensitivities were determined with various plant materials. Both qPCR and LAMP methods were reliable and accurate in the rapid detection of tobacco components in various practical samples, including customs samples, reconstituted tobacco samples, and locally purchased cigarettes, showing high potential for their application <b>in</b> tobacco identification, <b>particularly</b> <b>in</b> the <b>special</b> cases where the morphology or chemical compositions of tobacco have been disrupted. Therefore, combining both methods would facilitate not only the detection of tobacco smuggling control, but also the detection of tariff classification and of excise. </p...|$|R
