Only weeks before the robbery, Kamo accidentally detonated one of Krasin's bombs while trying to set the fuse. The blast severely injured <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> leaving a permanent scar. Kamo was confined to his bed for a month owing to intense pain, and had not fully recovered {{by the time of the}} robbery.|$|E
5|$|During the 1991 SEA Games, Fandi scored both Singapore goals against Myanmar in {{the group}} stage, but was {{substituted}} in the semi-final match, after Indonesian fullback Herry Setyawan elbowed <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> That match ended goalless and the Lions lost on penalties. Fandi also missed Singapore's failed attempt {{to qualify for the}} 1992 Asian Cup, having sustained a heel injury. At the 1993 SEA Games, captain Fandi scored a hat-trick in the 7–0 defeat of the Philippines, followed by the second Singapore goal in the 3–3 semi-final draw with Myanmar and scored once in the 3–1 win over Indonesia that secured a bronze medal for Singapore. Fandi also played in the inaugural Tiger Cup, and scored an equaliser against Malaysia, a goal against Brunei and two against the Philippines. 1997 was a disappointing year for Fandi, who failed to score in the Dunhill Cup and the World Cup qualifiers. After the 1997 SEA Games, where his goal in the semi-final could not prevent a 1–2 defeat to Indonesia, Fandi retired from international football.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Herod sees Cort's busted {{hand and}} gives Ratsy twenty seconds to leave town. He offers to face Cort left-handed, which Herod is equally fast at drawing with. Herod kills Ratsy {{with a rifle}} and then squares off to fight Cort. Herod then {{secretly}} tells his guards to kill Cort if he is the winner. At the moment Herod draws, several buildings explode on the street. Herod's house and the clock tower are also blown up, and through the smoke and flames, Ellen walks back into town, having faked her death {{with the help of}} Cort, Doc Wallace, the Blind Boy, and the Kid's stash of dynamite. Cort tells Herod that from now on all fights in town will be fair, and proceeds to kill Herod's men who were stationed around town. Ellen and Herod face off, and she finally reveals to him who she is when she throws her father's old badge at Herod's feet. They draw on each other; Herod shoots Ellen in the arm and she fires a shot though Herod's chest. Herod raises his gun to fire again but Ellen shoots <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> finishing him for good. She throws her father's badge to Cort and names him as the new Marshal before saddling up and riding out of the town.|$|E

25|$|Koivu {{suffered}} further knee {{problems in}} 2003–04 {{and was forced}} to miss 13 games. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he returned to Finland to play for TPS, whose head coach at the time was his father, Jukka Koivu. He was joined in Turku by Canadiens teammate Craig Rivet. When NHL play resumed in 2005–06, Koivu returned to the Canadiens to tally 62 points in 72 games. On April 26, 2006, however, during a home playoff game against the Carolina Hurricanes, Koivu sustained a serious injury to his left eye; Hurricanes forward Justin Williams attempted to lift Koivu's stick but instead struck <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> Koivu was rushed to the hospital, where he would remain overnight and {{for the remainder of the}} playoffs. He remained out of the lineup for the rest of the series and underwent surgery to repair a detached retina during the off-season.|$|E
500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Astronomic Club, its president, Professor Barbenfouillis, proposes an {{expedition}} to the Moon. After addressing some dissent, five other brave astronomers—Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus—agree to the plan. They build a space capsule {{in the shape of a}} bullet, and a huge cannon to shoot it into space. The astronomers embark and their capsule is fired from the cannon with the help of [...] "marines", most of whom are played by a bevy of young women in sailors' outfits. The Man in the Moon watches the capsule as it approaches, and it hits <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1990, {{a few weeks before}} his 17th birthday, his father led a group of high school math students, {{including}} Sergey, on a two-week exchange program to the Soviet Union. His roommate on the trip was future Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor John Stamper. As Brin recalls, the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he remembered that [...] "his first impulse on confronting Soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car". Malseed adds, [...] "On {{the second day of the}} trip, while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near Moscow, Brin took his father aside, looked <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and said, 'Thank you for taking us all out of Russia.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Khrushchev had {{no reason}} to think himself immune from the purges, and in 1937, confessed his own 1923 dalliance with Trotskyism to Kaganovich, who, {{according}} to Khrushchev, [...] "blanched" [...] (for his protégé's sins could affect his own standing) and advised him to tell Stalin. The dictator took the confession in his stride, and, after initially advising Khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggested that Khrushchev tell his tale to the Moscow party conference. Khrushchev did so, to applause, and was immediately reelected to his post. Khrushchev related in his memoirs that he was also denounced by an arrested colleague. Stalin told Khrushchev of the accusation personally, looking <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and awaiting his response. Khrushchev speculated in his memoirs that had Stalin doubted his reaction, he would have been categorized as an enemy of the people then and there. Nonetheless, Khrushchev became a candidate member of the Politburo on 14 January 1938 and a full member in March 1939.|$|E
500|$|During trial {{proceedings}} for the Otterstrom {{murder on}} April 2, 1985, Gardner attempted {{to escape from}} custody with a revolver smuggled into the Metropolitan Hall of Justice at Salt Lake City. Jim Kleine of the Salt Lake City Fire Department believed that the gun was passed to Gardner as he was being escorted into the courthouse from the underground parking lot. Gardner was immediately shot in the chest by guard Luther Hensley. Gardner then wounded unarmed bailiff George [...] "Nick" [...] Kirk in the abdomen. After running to the courtroom archives, Gardner confronted attorneys Robert Macri and Michael Burdell. According to Macri, after Gardner pointed the gun at him, he changed aim to Burdell, who had been doing pro bono work for his church. Burdell yelled, [...] "Oh, my God," [...] when Gardner shot <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> Gardner made his way outside the building, where {{he was surrounded by}} dozens of police officers. Gardner threw the gun away, dropped and yelled: [...] "Don’t shoot, I don’t have a gun." ...|$|E

500|$|New York {{got off to}} a {{slow start}} in the 1957 season, and by early June was six games out. By then, the team was making {{headlines}} off the field. Some of the Yankees were known for partying late into the night, something Stengel turned a blind eye to as long as the team performed well. The May 16 brawl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York involved Martin, Berra, Mantle, Ford, Hank Bauer and other Yankees, resulted in the arrest of Bauer (the charge of assault was later dropped) and exhausted Yankee management's patience with Martin. Stengel was close to Martin, who took great pride in being a Yankee, and Topping and Weiss did not involve the manager in the trade talks that ensued. On June 15, Martin was traded to the Kansas City Athletics. Martin wrote in his autobiography that Stengel could not look <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> as the manager told him of the trade. The two, once close friends, rarely spoke in the years to come.|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} {{still searching for}} a lead singer. Chimes recalls one Billy Watts (who [...] "seemed to be, like, {{nineteen}} or eighteen then, as we all were") handling the duties for a time. Rhodes had his eye on Strummer, with whom he made exploratory contact. Jones and Levene had both seen him perform and were impressed as well. Strummer, for his part, was primed to make the switch. In April, he had taken in the opening act {{for one of his}} band's gigs—the Sex Pistols. Strummer later explained:I knew something was up, so I went out in the crowd which was fairly sparse. And I saw the future—with a snotty handkerchief—right in front of me. It was immediately clear. Pub rock was, [...] "Hello, you bunch of drunks, I'm gonna play these boogies and I hope you like them." [...] The Pistols came out that Tuesday evening and their attitude was, [...] "Here's our tunes, and we couldn't give a flying fuck whether you like them or not. In fact, we're gonna play them even if you fucking hate them."On 30 May, Rhodes and Levene met surreptitiously with Strummer after a 101'ers gig. Strummer was invited to meet up at the band's rehearsal location on Davis Road. After Strummer turned up, Levene grabbed his guitar, stood several inches away from Strummer, looked <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and then began playing [...] "Keys to Your Heart", one of Strummer's own tunes.|$|E

When he did, [...] "he saw the world—and his purpose—in a new light". Muir later wrote, [...] "This affliction has driven me to the sweet fields.

2500|$|Lindemulder {{was arrested}} in May 2003 for assaulting husband Jesse James. James filed for a {{temporary}} restraining order and legal separation from Janine Lindemulder in May 2003, after she attacked him in their Seal Beach, California house. Janine became angry when she arrived back at the house and discovered Jesse loading her possessions into a truck. According to court documents, James said, [...] "She began screaming and yelling at me...and punching me. She punched me in the face several times." [...] Jesse was unable to defend himself because his right arm had recently undergone surgery. According to court documents, by the time the police arrived, Lindemulder had already hit James {{in the back of the}} head with a flowerpot, and attacked him with a metal sculpture. James also claimed that Lindemulder punched <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> on February 13, 2003 - and attempted to run him over with a vehicle in May of that year.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1968, {{their first}} album Truth was released; by October it {{had risen to}} number 15 on the US albums chart but failed to chart in the UK. The album {{featured}} Beck's masterly guitar technique and manipulated sounds as Stewart's dramatic vocalising tackled the group's varied repertoire of blues, folk, rock, and proto-heavy metal. Stewart also co-wrote three of the songs, and credited the record for helping to develop his vocal abilities and the sandpaper quality in his voice. The group toured America again {{at the end of}} the year to a very strong reception, then suffered from more personnel upheaval (something that would continue throughout Beck's career). In July 1969, Stewart left, following his friend Wood's departure. Stewart later recalled: [...] "It was a great band to sing with but I couldn't take all the aggravation and unfriendliness that developed.... In the two and a half years I was with Beck I never once looked <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> – I always looked at his shirt or something like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 8, 1980, Leibovitz had a {{photo shoot}} with John Lennon for Rolling Stone, and she promised him he would make the cover. She had {{initially}} {{tried to get a}} picture with just Lennon alone, as Rolling Stone wanted, but Lennon insisted that both he and Yoko Ono be on the cover. Leibovitz then tried to re-create something like the kissing scene from the couple's Double Fantasy 1980 album cover, a picture Leibovitz loved, and she had John remove his clothes and curl up next to Yoko on the floor. Leibovitz recalls, [...] "What is interesting is she said she'd take her top off and I said, 'Leave everything on'not really preconceiving the picture at all. Then he curled up next to her and it was very, very strong. You couldn't help but feel that he was cold and {{he looked like he was}} clinging on to her. I think it was amazing to look at the first Polaroid and they were both very excited. John said, 'You've captured our relationship exactly. Promise me it'll be on the cover.' I looked <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and we shook on it." [...] Leibovitz was the last person to professionally photograph Lennonhe was shot and killed five hours later.|$|E
2500|$|One of Hathcock's {{most famous}} accomplishments was {{shooting}} an enemy sniper through the enemy's own rifle scope, hitting <b>him</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> and killing him. Hathcock and John Roland Burke, his spotter, were stalking the enemy sniper {{in the jungle}} near Hill 55, the firebase from which Hathcock was operating, southwest of Da Nang. The sniper, known only as the [...] "Cobra," [...] had already killed several Marines and was {{believed to have been}} sent specifically to kill Hathcock. When Hathcock saw a flash of light (light reflecting off the enemy sniper's scope) in the bushes, he fired at it, shooting through the scope and killing the sniper. Surveying the situation, Hathcock concluded that the only feasible way he could have put the bullet straight down the enemy's scope, through his eye, would have been if both snipers were zeroing in on each other at the same time, which gave him only a few seconds to act, and Hathcock fired first. Given the flight time of rounds at long ranges, the snipers could have simultaneously killed one another. Hathcock took possession of the dead sniper's rifle, hoping to bring it home as a [...] "trophy", but after he turned it in and tagged it, it was stolen from the armory.|$|E
