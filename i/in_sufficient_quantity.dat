25|$|Protein nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance is performed on aqueous samples of highly purified protein. Usually, the sample consists of between 300 and 600 microlitres with a protein concentration in the range 0.1 – 3 millimolar. The source of the protein can be either natural or produced in a production system using recombinant DNA techniques through genetic engineering. Recombinantly expressed proteins are usually easier to produce <b>in</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>quantity,</b> and this method makes isotopic labeling possible.|$|E

25|$|Technological {{innovations}} {{and economic}} development in the eastern Mediterranean, Mesopotamia, and along the Nile, increased the demand for various metals not found locally <b>in</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>quantity.</b> Phoenician traders recognized the relative abundance and low cost of the needed metals among the goods offered for trade by local merchants in Hispania, which spurred trade.

25|$|The 1841 census {{showed a}} {{population}} of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage.

25|$|However redox {{reactions}} of alkanes, {{in particular with}} oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition; {{in the case of}} methane, the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon (−4) is reached. Reaction with oxygen (if present <b>in</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>quantity</b> to satisfy the reaction stoichiometry) leads to combustion without any smoke, producing carbon dioxide and water. Free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens, leading to the production of haloalkanes. In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes in C–H bond activation.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} {{export goods}} were tea, rice, and matches. At first, the export tea came from Kyoto, but tea produced in western Japan was gradually promoted, and structures for its export came into place. Rice was exported from Kobe <b>in</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>quantity</b> {{to become the}} standard rice in London's grain market. Full-scale match manufacturing in Kobe {{began in the late}} 1870s, at which point those matches also started being exported. The value of match exports from the Port of Kobe increased rapidly beginning in the late 1880s, increasing until they comprised more than nine-tenths of Japan's total match exports. These exports were directed primarily at China at first, but over time expanded to reach Australia, Europe, and America.|$|E
25|$|Avocado leaves {{contain a}} toxic fatty acid derivative, persin, which <b>in</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>quantity</b> can cause colic in horses and without {{veterinary}} treatment, death.

Birds {{also seem to}} be particularly sensitive to this toxic compound. A line of premium dog and cat food, AvoDerm, uses oils and meal made from avocado meat as main ingredients. The manufacturer says the avocado's leaves and pit {{are the source of}} toxicity, and only in the Guatemalan variety of avocados, and the fruit is often eaten by orchard dogs as well as wildlife such as bears and coyotes.|$|E
25|$|Subatomic charged particles, {{primarily}} protons from {{cosmic rays}} and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact <b>in</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>quantity,</b> their effect is {{visible to the}} naked eye in a phenomenon called an aurora. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 millisievert each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth. This results in a higher risk of cancer for astronauts. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the DNA and chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the immune system, and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower immunity experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.|$|E

25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{adequate}} cooling, the materials inside of the reactor vessel overheat and deform as they undergo thermal expansion, and the reactor structure fails once the temperature reaches the melting point of its structural materials. The corium melt then accumulates {{at the bottom of}} the reactor vessel. In the case of adequate cooling of the corium melt, the melt can solidify and the spread of damage is limited to the reactor itself. However, corium may melt through the reactor vessel and flow out or be ejected as a molten stream by the pressure inside the reactor vessel. The reactor vessel failure may be caused by heating of its vessel bottom by the corium melt, resulting first in creep failure and then in breach of the vessel. Cooling water from above the corium layer, <b>in</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>quantity,</b> may obtain a thermal equilibrium below the metal creep temperature, without reactor vessel failure.|$|E
