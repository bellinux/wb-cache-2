5|$|September 1, 2006- The {{combined}} {{effects of}} Tropical Storm Ernesto {{and a large}} <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system</b> leave about 151,000 without power and several trees damaged from strong winds. The system also drops moderate rainfall peaking at 5.15inches (129mm) in Jones Crossing; one person requires assistance to be rescued from a flooded roadway.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} form as {{a result}} of significant convective activity, and are warm core. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. Cyclolysis is the opposite of cyclogenesis, and is the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system</b> equivalent, which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas—Anticyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Florence {{produced}} strong swells {{and dangerous}} surf conditions {{along the northern}} Lesser Antilles, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and Bermuda. Later in its duration, the tight pressure gradient between Florence and a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system</b> over southeastern Canada produced strong winds and rough waves along the East Coast of the United States. The hurricane also caused strong swells and rough ocean conditions, including rip currents, in the Bahamas and Atlantic Canada. In South Carolina, high waves produced severe beach erosion on several beaches.|$|E
5000|$|Anticyclonic storms usually form around <b>high-pressure</b> <b>systems.</b> These do not [...] "contradict" [...] the Coriolis effect; it predicts such {{anticyclonic}} flow about high-pressure regions. Anticyclonic storms, as <b>high-pressure</b> <b>systems,</b> usually accompany {{cold weather}} and are frequently {{a factor in}} large snowstorms. Jupiter's Great Red Spot is a well-known extraterrestrial example of an anticyclonic system.|$|R

5|$|The south–west Monsoon from June to September {{accounts}} {{for most of}} the rainfall in the region. The Arabian Sea branch of the south-west monsoon hits the Western Ghats along the coastal state of Kerala and moves northwards along the Konkan coast with precipitation on coastal areas, west of the Western Ghats. The lofty Western Ghats prevent the winds from reaching the Deccan Plateau - hence the leeward region (the region that deprived of winds) receives very little rainfall. The Bay of Bengal branch of south-west monsoon heads toward north east India, picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The Coramandel coast does not receive much rainfall from the south-west monsoon due to the shape of the land. Tamil Nadu and southeast Andhra Pradesh receive rains from the north–east Monsoon. The north-east monsoon take place from November to early March when the surface <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system</b> is strongest. The North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones occur throughout the year in Bay of Bengal and Arabian sea bringing devastating winds and heavy rainfall.|$|E
25|$|The {{heatwave}} {{was caused}} by a slow moving <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system</b> that settled over the Tasman Sea, with a combination of an intense tropical low located off the North West Australian coast and a monsoon trough over northern Australia, which produced ideal conditions for hot tropical air to be directed down over southeastern Australia.|$|E
25|$|A {{hypothetical}} azeotrope of constituents X and Y {{is shown}} in the adjacent diagram. Two at an arbitrarily chosen low pressure and another at an arbitrarily chosen, but higher, pressure. The composition of the azeotrope is substantially different between the high- and low-pressure plots – higher in X for the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system.</b> The goal is to separate X in as high a concentration as possible starting from point A. At the low pressure, it is possible by progressive distillation to reach a distillate at the point, B, which is {{on the same side of}} the azeotrope as A. Note that successive distillation steps near the azeotropic composition exhibit very little difference in boiling temperature. If this distillate is now exposed to the high pressure, it boils at point C. From C, by progressive distillation it is possible to reach a distillate at the point D, which is on the same side of the high-pressure azeotrope as C. If that distillate is then exposed again to the low pressure, it boils at point E, which is on the opposite side of the low-pressure azeotrope to A. So, by means of the pressure swing, it is possible to cross over the low-pressure azeotrope.|$|E
5000|$|High-pressure systems: These are {{designed}} to protect the core by injecting large quantities of water into it to prevent the fuel from being uncovered by a decreasing water level. Generally used in cases with stuck-open safety valves, small breaks of auxiliary pipes, and particularly violent transients caused by turbine trip and main steam isolation valve closure. If the water level cannot be maintained with <b>high-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> alone (the water level still is falling below a preset point with the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> working full-bore), the next set of systems responds.|$|R
50|$|<b>High-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> form due to {{downward}} motion {{through the}} troposphere, the atmospheric layer where weather occurs. Preferred areas within a synoptic flow pattern in {{higher levels of}} the troposphere are beneath {{the western side of}} troughs.|$|R
50|$|The {{direction}} of wind flow around an atmospheric high-pressure area and a low-pressure area, as seen from above, depends on the hemisphere. <b>High-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> rotate clockwise in the northern Hemisphere; low-pressure systems rotate clockwise in the southern hemisphere.|$|R
500|$|Severe squall lines {{typically}} bow out due to {{the formation}} of a stronger mesoscale <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system</b> (a mesohigh) within the convective area due to strong descending motion behind the squall line, and could {{come in the form of}} a downburst. [...] The pressure difference between the mesoscale high and the lower pressures ahead of the squall line cause high winds, which are strongest where the line is most bowed out.|$|E
500|$|Strong, {{vertically}} shallow high-pressure systems {{moving from}} higher latitudes to lower latitudes {{in the northern}} hemisphere are associated with continental arctic air masses. [...] Once arctic air moves over an unfrozen ocean, the air mass modifies greatly over the warmer water and takes {{on the character of}} a maritime air mass, which reduces the strength of the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system.</b> When extremely cold air moves over relatively warm oceans, polar lows can develop. [...] However, warm and moist (or maritime tropical) air masses that move poleward from tropical sources are slower to modify than arctic air masses.|$|E
500|$|Wind is {{initially}} accelerated from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. [...] This {{is due to}} density (or temperature and moisture) differences between two air masses. [...] Since stronger high-pressure systems contain cooler or drier air, the air mass is denser and flows towards areas that are warm or moist, which are {{in the vicinity of}} low-pressure areas in advance of their associated cold fronts. [...] The stronger the pressure difference, or pressure gradient, between a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system</b> and a low-pressure system, the stronger the wind. [...] Thus, stronger areas of low pressure are associated with stronger winds.|$|E
5000|$|<b>High-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> form due to {{downward}} motion {{through the}} troposphere, the atmospheric layer where weather occurs. Preferred areas within a synoptic flow pattern in {{higher levels of}} the troposphere are beneath {{the western side of}} troughs. On weather maps, these areas show converging winds (isotachs), also known as confluence, or converging height lines near or above the level of non-divergence, which is near the 500 hPa pressure surface about midway up through the troposphere. [...] <b>High-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> are alternatively referred to as anticyclones. On weather maps, high-pressure centers are associated with the letter H placed within the isobar with the highest pressure value. On constant pressure upper level charts, it is located within the highest height line contour.|$|R

500|$|In {{terms of}} climatology, high {{pressure}} forms at the horse latitudes, or torrid zone, between the latitudes of 20 and 40 {{degrees from the}} equator, {{as a result of}} air that has been uplifted at the equator. [...] As the hot air rises it cools, losing moisture; it is then transported poleward where it descends, creating the high-pressure area. [...] This is part of the Hadley cell circulation and is known as the subtropical ridge or subtropical high, and is strongest in the summer. [...] The subtropical ridge is a warm core <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system,</b> meaning it strengthens with height. [...] Many of the world's deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure systems.|$|E
500|$|High-pressure {{systems are}} {{frequently}} associated with light winds {{at the surface}} and subsidence through the lower portion of the troposphere. [...] In general, subsidence will dry out an air mass by adiabatic or compressional heating. [...] Thus, high pressure typically brings clear skies. [...] During the day, since no clouds are present to reflect sunlight, there is more incoming shortwave solar radiation and temperatures rise. [...] At night, the absence of clouds means that outgoing longwave radiation (i.e. heat energy from the surface) is not absorbed, giving cooler diurnal low temperatures in all seasons. [...] When surface winds become light, the subsidence produced directly under a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system</b> {{can lead to a}} buildup of particulates in urban areas under the ridge, leading to widespread haze. [...] If the low-level relative humidity rises towards 100 percent overnight, fog can form.|$|E
500|$|The {{depression}} {{quickly became}} better organized {{with a great}} increase in convection near the center, and six hours after forming it strengthened into Tropical Storm Kenna. Upper-level outflow and banding features improved in organization, as well. With warm water temperatures of over [...] and updated model forecasts anticipating light amounts of vertical wind shear, forecasters predicted Kenna to slowly intensify to reach winds of 85mph (135km/h) within 72hours of October 22. The storm moved to the west-northwest around the periphery of a mid-level <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system,</b> and initially failed to strengthen further with much of its convection being associated with outer rainbands. On October 23, the outer rainbands dissipated and convection became more concentrated near the center, which coincided with a steady increase in strength. Late on October 23, Kenna intensified into a hurricane while located about 380mi (615km) southwest of Manzanillo.|$|E
500|$|Cumulus clouds {{can form}} in lines {{stretching}} over [...] long called cloud streets. These cloud streets cover vast areas {{and may be}} broken or continuous. They form when wind shear causes horizontal circulation in the atmosphere, producing the long, tubular cloud streets. They generally form during <b>high-pressure</b> <b>systems,</b> such as after a cold front.|$|R
50|$|A {{socket flange}} appears {{similar to a}} slip-on flange, but its bore is counter-bored to accept pipe. A fillet weld around {{the hub of the}} flange {{attaches}} the flange to the pipe, with an interval weld added in high-stress applications. It is most frequently used in <b>high-pressure</b> <b>systems,</b> such as hydraulic and steam lines.|$|R
50|$|Cumulus clouds {{can form}} in lines {{stretching}} over 480 km long called cloud streets. These cloud streets cover vast areas {{and may be}} broken or continuous.

500|$|On November9, a {{cold front}} {{moved into the}} {{northwest}} Caribbean Sea, shortly before an abnormally strong <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system</b> entered in the area. The front then became nearly stationary and interacted with several tropical waves over the next week. The Intertropical Convergence Zone became active, causing monsoonal southwesterly flow to enter the system from the eastern Pacific Ocean. On November13, surface weather analysis indicated a weak low-pressure area had developed north of Colombia. Despite a well-defined low-level circulation, the system {{did not meet the}} criteria for a tropical cyclone because convective activity was not organized or concentrated within the vicinity of the center. Several small, weak centers of low pressure formed in the general area, and the entire system drifted northward for a couple days. In combination with a high-pressure area over the United States, the system produced gale-force winds on Florida, Cuba, the Bahamas and the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Wind {{flows from}} areas of high {{pressure}} to areas of low pressure. [...] This {{is due to}} density {{differences between the two}} air masses. [...] Since stronger high-pressure systems contain cooler or drier air, the air mass is more dense and flows towards areas that are warm or moist, which are in the vicinity of low pressure areas in advance of their associated cold fronts. [...] The stronger the pressure difference, or pressure gradient, between a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system</b> and a low-pressure system, the stronger the wind. The coriolis force caused by the Earth's rotation is what gives winds within high-pressure systems their clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure) and counterclockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere (as the wind moves outward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure). [...] Friction with land slows down the wind flowing out of high-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more outward than would be the case in the absence of friction. This is known as a geostrophic wind.|$|E
500|$|Cyclogenesis is the {{development}} and strengthening of cyclonic circulations, or low-pressure areas, within the atmosphere. [...] Cyclogenesis {{is the opposite of}} , and has an anticyclonic (<b>high-pressure</b> <b>system)</b> equivalent which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas—anticyclogenesis. [...] Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes, all of which result in {{the development}} of some sort of cyclone. [...] Meteorologists use the term [...] "cyclone" [...] where circular pressure systems flow {{in the direction of the}} Earth's rotation, which normally coincides with areas of low pressure. [...] The largest low-pressure systems are cold-core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale. [...] Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones, mesocyclones, and polar lows lie within the smaller mesoscale. [...] Subtropical cyclones are of intermediate size. Cyclogenesis can occur at various scales, from the microscale to the synoptic scale. [...] Larger-scale troughs, also called Rossby waves, are synoptic in scale. [...] Shortwave troughs embedded within the flow around larger scale troughs are smaller in scale, or mesoscale in nature. [...] Both Rossby waves and shortwaves embedded within the flow around Rossby waves migrate equatorward of the polar cyclones located in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. [...] All share one important aspect, that of upward vertical motion within the troposphere. [...] Such upward motions decrease the mass of local atmospheric columns of air, which lowers surface pressure.|$|E
50|$|Demisters {{can reduce}} the {{residence}} time required to separate a given liquid droplet size by reducing the volume and associated cost of separator equipment. Demisters are often used where vapor quality is important in regard to entrained liquids, particularly where separator equipment costs are high (e.g., <b>high-pressure</b> <b>systems)</b> or where space or weight savings are advantageous.|$|R

In the summer the Azores <b>high-pressure</b> <b>system</b> affects the south-west of England. Convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine; annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which are most active during those seasons. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around [...] About 8–15 days of snowfall per year is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds.

50|$|In North and Central America, {{during the}} Northern Hemisphere winter, <b>high-pressure</b> <b>systems</b> are created between the equator and 35th {{parallels}} north via atmospheric circulation. Air near the equator is warmed by the sun. This heated air is more buoyant than colder air so it rises and is then pushed poleward by more air rising from below. Once the air reaches northern latitudes {{it begins to}} cool {{and as a result}} it falls back towards to the Earth’s surface. As the air is falling it exerts more pressure downward on the surface, creating a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>systems.</b> This cold, <b>high-pressure</b> air mass then travels equatorward. Air masses repeatedly move in this loop, but {{it should be noted that}} due to the Coriolis force, this convection is not perfectly aligned south to north. In actuality, the air moves clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, as it moves from the equator to higher latitudes and then back to the equator again.|$|R
