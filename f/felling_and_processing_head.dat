40|$|Forest {{harvesting}} {{with animals}} is a labor-intensive operation. It is expensive to use machines on smaller woodlots, which require frequent moves if mechanically logged. So, small logging systems using animals {{may be more}} cost effective. In this study, work sampling was used for five animal logging operations in Alabama to measure productive and non-productive time elements to determine utilization with respect to operators, functions (<b>felling</b> <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> of trees, skidding, loading, and forwarding of logs), animals, and machines. Cost of log production was calculated from the figures reported by owners and the crew members. Average utilization of crew was 58 percent, animals (horses and mules) were utilized only 22 percent and the machines were utilized from 5 to 74 percent of scheduled time.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The role of {{environmental}} effects in timber harvesting has great importance {{in decision making}} and planning logging operations. Consequently, more emphasis should be put on a planning system so that environmentally sensitive sites for a certain harvesting system can be recognized and the most suitable machinery selected for given terrain conditions. Material and Methods: Four main data sources {{have been used for}} the model of ecoefficient harvesting system prediction: 1) a digital elevation model (DEM), 2) a digital network of forest roads, 3) forest inventory data and 4) ecoefficient limitations for harvesting systems. Software ArcGIS 9 was used for GIS <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> data analysis. Results: A model for selecting an ecoefficient harvesting system for commercial forests of Northern Velebit is based on three influencing factors: terrain slope, extraction distance and breast height diameter of trees. Based on the model, a harvesting system is determined for each forest subcompartment. The results show that breast height tree diameter restricts mechanized <b>felling</b> <b>and</b> <b>processing.</b> Fully mechanized harvesting systems could be used only over 7. 27 % of the researched area. Ground based extraction represents the main technology. Conclusions: In order to establish functional terrain classification, a model for determining an ecoefficient harvesting system should comprise a geographic information system, and terrain and forest stand data. Specific terrain (limestone combined with relief characteristics) and forest stand conditions (mixed selective forests with natural regeneration) limit the application of some harvesting systems which would otherwise be environmentally acceptable in many other cases...|$|R

The original data pool contained more than 15, 000 individual timestudy records, each representing a single harvesting cycle (most often one tree). The records were extracted from 38 studies conducted with the same methods and by the same principal investigators between 1998 and 2008. Statistically significant models were developed for all cyclic work phases, such as moving, brushing, <b>felling,</b> <b>and</b> <b>processing.</b> Accessory time <b>and</b> delay time were added as percent factors, also estimated from the same studies. Model development aimed at achieving the best compromise solution between accuracy and easy use, avoiding the introduction of an excessively large number of input variables. Selected independent variables were tree volume, tree species, task type (harvesting or <b>processing),</b> machine power <b>and</b> type, density of residual stand and of harvest trees, stand type, and slope gradient. These models could predict a large proportion of the variability in the data and were successfully validated using reserved cycle records, extracted from the same data pool and not used for model development.

40|$|The {{process of}} forest {{harvesting}} is highly mechanized in most industrialized countries, with <b>felling</b> <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> of trees performed by technologically advanced forestry machines. However, the maneuvering {{of the vehicles}} through the forest {{as well as the}} control of the on-board hydraulic boom crane is currently performed through continuous manual operation. This complicates the introduction of further incremental productivity improvements to the machines, as the operator becomes a bottleneck in the process. A suggested solution strategy is to enhance the production capacity by increasing the level of automation. At the same time, the working environment for the operator can be improved by a reduced workload, provided that the human-machine interaction is adapted to the new automated functionality. The objectives of this thesis are 1) to describe and analyze the current logging process and to locate areas of improvements that can be implemented in current machines, and 2) to investigate future methods and concepts that possibly require changes in work methods {{as well as in the}} machine design and technology. The thesis describes the development and integration of several algorithmic methods and the implementation of corresponding software solutions, adapted to the forestry machine context. Following data recording and analysis of the current work tasks of machine operators, trajectory planning and execution for a specific category of forwarder crane motions has been identified as an important first step for short term automation. Using the method of path-constrained trajectory planning, automated crane motions were demonstrated to potentially provide a substantial improvement from motions performed by experienced human operators. An extension of this method was developed to automate some selected motions even for existing sensorless machines. Evaluation suggests that this method is feasible for a reasonable deviation of initial conditions. Another important aspect of partial automation is the human-machine interaction. For this specific application a simple and intuitive interaction method for accessing automated crane motions was suggested, based on head tracking of the operator. A preliminary interaction model derived from user experiments yielded promising results for forming the basis of a target selection method, particularly when combined with some traded control strategy. Further, a modular software platform was implemented, integrating several important components into a framework for designing and testing future interaction concepts. Specifically, this system was used to investigate concepts of teleoperation and virtual environment feedback.

If this continues, half the present total area of tropical forest will have disappeared by the end of the century, and with it an enormous and unique genetic heritage. A workshop was held on the management and development of the tropical rainforest ecosystem on 12 - 16 March in Cayenne, Guyana. It was organized by UNESCO's Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme. One hundred and thirty participants from 35 countries met under the aegis of three large international bodies: UNESCO, FAO and the International Union of Forestry Research Organizations (IUFRO), with the aim of evaluating the methods currently available for learning about this ecosystem, for developing it, and for stopping its destruction. Huge variety of species The meeting brought together all those interested in the rain forest be it for the animals and plant life, the soils and the whole ecological system, as well as its human inhabitants. Preserving the enormous diversity is seen as the key to safeguarding the forest heritage. It is not very easy to strike a balance in the face of the divergent interests. For example, the production of timber is at variance with the task of maintaining this diversity. 'We must favour the species which are of commercial value, even if it means sacrificing the trees which compete with these', was the stated opinion of the foresters, to which the botanists replied, 'Yes, but please take great care. For 20 years now in Guyana we have discovered three or four new plant species every year. And it's the same in Africa and Asia. We must not lose them'. Gaps to be filled and work yet to be done Preserving the forest and all its riches over vast areas is a very considerable task. To simplify it, the participants compiled a list of their needs: well-trained forestry workers; finance adequate for this great task; research laboratories with wide-ranging potential; an exhaustive inventory; and reliable modern maps of the remaining forests were the principal requests. The forest managers defined the research areas on which they would like scientists to concentrate in the next few years. The improvement of the quality of wood; this would mean that fewer trees are cut to obtain the required amounts of timber, and more economic and efficient cutting methods found (at present half of the wood is lost between <b>felling</b> <b>and</b> <b>processing),</b> <b>and</b> the development of simpler and easier sylvicultural techniques were some priorities. 'We must concentrate our efforts on the dynamics of growth and regeneration', the Centre Technique Forestier Tropical (C l i-l) engineers emphasized, 'for these are relatively unknown to us, but could prove to be a tremendous force in halting the destruction of the forests'. Political will is paramount No-one claimed that all the problems were solved during the course of the few days in Guyana, although everyone accepted the FAO prediction that half the tropical forests would be cleared by the end of the century. However, much can be done with the remaining 500 m ha. For example, forests could be classified in order to preserve their genetic diversity and blocks could be created for timber production and similarly for the supply of village and agroforestry products. The workshop closed by emphasizing the role of the politicians, for, despite the current lack of knowledge, the development and conservation of the dense tropical rain forests is technically possible and economically viable.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{disentangle}} {{the effects of}} an adult model's eye gaze and head orientation on infants' processing of objects attended to by the adult, we presented 4 -month-olds with faces that either (1) shifted eye gaze toward or away from an object while the head stayed stationary or (2) that turned their head while maintaining gaze directed straight ahead. Infants' responses to the previously attended and unattended objects were measured using eye-tracking and event-related potentials. In both conditions, infants responded to objects that were not cued by the adult's head or eye gaze shift with more visual attention and an increased negative central (Nc) component relative to cued objects. This suggests that cued objects had been encoded more effectively, whereas uncued objects required further processing. We conclude that eye gaze and head orientation act independently as cues to direct infants' attention <b>and</b> object <b>processing.</b> Both <b>head</b> orientation <b>and</b> eye gaze, when presented in motion, even override the effects of incongruent stationary information from the other kind of cue...|$|R
40|$|An excavator-based {{integrated}} yarder-processor {{was evaluated}} in a clearfelling in centralNorway. The machine is unique because, as {{it uses a}} running skyline setup, yarding <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> cannot take place simultaneously {{as is the case}} with many European integrated tower yarders. Felling productivity was 10. 6 m 3 E 15 h- 1, yarding 9. 2 m 3 E 15 h- 1 <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> 10. 9 m 3 E 15 h- 1. Given that yarding <b>and</b> <b>processing</b> take place alternately accounting for 54 %and 46 % of a system hour, the overall system productivity was 4. 9 m 3 E 15 h- 1 (processed <b>and</b> stacked). The <b>processing</b> rate was approximately 30 % of what is achieved by single grip harvesters, indicating the effect of space limitations, a possible over-dimensioned <b>processing</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> the need to simplify the assortment list under such conditions. An increase in processing productivity would require a second feller-chokersetter in the crew, although neither would then be used to full capacity. Un-choking alone accounted for 19 % of the yarding cycle timeand might be reduced by applying self-releasing chokers. System productivity needs to beincreased by 30 – 50 % to make it competitive. Much of this could be achieved simply by deploying the machine in stands with larger mean tree volumes than those observed (0. 27 m 3) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{miniature}} <b>processing</b> <b>head</b> for laser cutting of metal sheets. The thermally-induced focal shift is exacerbated at low {{values of the}} beam parameter product, {{but it is possible}} to arrange the optical elements such that the focal shift and beam waist variation cancel out. Collimating and focusing low-NA beams with short focal lenses make it possible to use standard plano-convex lenses without causing appreciable spherical aberrations, but the higher power density calls for low-absorption optics in order to mitigate thermal aberrations. The use of millimeter-size optics will pave the way to lighter <b>processing</b> <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> this will enable an increased cutting speed in contours at a reduced electrical consumption. It can thus be considered as an alternative to remote cutting or to the addition of local axes to conventional gantry systems...|$|R
