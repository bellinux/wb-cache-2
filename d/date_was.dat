5|$|The Mask of Zorro was {{initially}} set for release on December 19, 1997 before the release <b>date</b> <b>was</b> changed to March 1998. There was speculation within {{the media about}} whether TriStar changed the date {{in an attempt to}} avoid competition with Titanic. In reality Zorro had encountered production problems that extended its shooting schedule. In addition, Sony Pictures Entertainment, TriStar's parent company, wanted an action film for its first quarter releases of 1998. The release <b>date</b> <b>was</b> once again pushed back, this time to July 1998, when pick-ups were commissioned. The delay from March to July added $3 million in interest costs.|$|E

This meant that Singer had to finish X-Men six months ahead of schedule, although filming had been pushed back. The release <b>date</b> <b>was</b> then moved to July 14.|$|E
