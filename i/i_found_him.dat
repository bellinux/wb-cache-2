In 1849 she established the Mendelssohn Scholarship Foundation, which makes an award to a British resident young composer every two years in Mendelssohn's memory. The first winner of the scholarship was Arthur Sullivan, then aged 14, in 1856. In 1869 Lind erected a plaque in Mendelssohn's memory at his birthplace in Hamburg.|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} to his pre-war clerical job at the Sydney Town Hall, but soon switched to a job with motor parts distributor Stack & Company, which allowed him more time for cricket commitments. Morris was automatically restored to the Sheffield Shield team in 1946–47 upon the resumption of competition. He made 27 and 98 in his first match against Queensland, and was selected for an Australian XI match against Wally Hammond's touring MCC team when first-choice opener Bill Brown was injured. In what was effectively a trial for the Test team, Morris scored 115 and featured in a 196-run partnership with Test captain Don Bradman, who scored 106. It was {{the beginnings of a}} productive cricketing relationship. Morris said of Bradman: [...] "He was marvellous. If you had a problem, you could go to him and sort it out. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> relaxed and straightforward".|$|E
500|$|The most {{significant}} relationship of Hepburn's life was with Spencer Tracy, her co-star in nine films. In her autobiography she wrote, [...] "It {{was a unique}} feeling that I had for [...] I {{would have done anything}} for him." [...] Lauren Bacall, a close friend, later wrote of how [...] "blindingly" [...] in love Hepburn was with the actor. The relationship has subsequently received much publicity, and it is often cited as one of Hollywood's legendary love affairs. Meeting when she was 34 and he was 41, Tracy was initially wary of Hepburn, unimpressed by her dirty fingernails and suspecting that she was a lesbian, but Hepburn said she [...] "knew right away that <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> irresistible." [...] Tracy remained married throughout their relationship; although he and his wife Louise had been living separate lives since the 1930s, there was never an official split and neither party pursued a divorce. Hepburn did not interfere, and never fought for marriage.|$|E

500|$|Welles said, [...] "the {{film was}} not {{intended}} as a lament for Falstaff, but {{for the death of}} Merrie England. Merrie England as a conception, a myth which has been very real to the English-speaking world, and is to some extent expressed in other countries of the Medieval epoch: the age of chivalry, of simplicity, of Maytime and all that. It is more than Falstaff who is dying. It's the old England dying and betrayed." [...] Many film theorists and Welles biographers have written about the recurrent theme of the [...] "Lost Eden" [...] in Welles's work and of characters who are nostalgic for an idealized past, which Welles called [...] "the central theme in Western culture." [...] Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that [...] "even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive of such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit." [...] Film scholar Beverle Houston argued that this nostalgia made Welles's depiction of Falstaff infantile and called his performance a [...] "ower baby...an eating, sucking, foetus-like creature." [...] Welles also called Falstaff [...] "the greatest conception of a good man, the most completely good man, in all of drama", and said that [...] "the closer I thought I was getting to Falstaff the less funny he seemed to me. When I played him before in the theater, he seemed more witty than comical. And in bringing him to the screen, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> only occasionally, and only deliberately, a clown." ...|$|E
2500|$|Exposure to Bach and Handel's music {{seems to}} have been {{important}} to Beethoven just as it had been to Mozart. [...] Ferdinand Ries later wrote, [...] "Of all composers, Beethoven valued Mozart and Handel most highly, then [...] S. Bach. ... Whenever <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> with music in his hands, or saw some lying on his desk, it was certain to be [...] a composition by one of these idols." ...|$|E

[...] Bush's top security aide Condoleezza Rice realized that Bush's phrasing had been a serious mistake. [...] "We were never able to escape the perception that the president had naïvely trusted Putin and then been betrayed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ruppelt {{wrote that}} the Air Force's {{approach}} to the UFO question [...] "was tackled with organized confusion." [...] In defending General Samford's press conference on 29 July 1952, after the big UFO flap at Washington National Airport, Ruppelt wrote that [...] "his [...] people had fouled up in not fully investigating the sightings." [...] Astronomer and Blue Book consultant J. Allen Hynek thought that Ruppelt did his best, only to see his efforts stymied. Hynek wrote [...] "In my contacts with [...] <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> {{to be honest and}} seriously puzzled about the whole phenomenon".|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> petulant... I don't {{remember}} hearing him laugh, or ever seeing him laugh. Everything that concerned him was very serious... He {{had a certain}} screen personality... but as an actor... I never made any contact with him. He wouldn't look at me. He'd say, [...] "I love you..." [...] he'd be looking out there some place. Finally, I said,"Alan, I'm he-ere!!"... I think he was very conscious of his looks. Alan would not look beyond {{a certain point in}} the camera because he didn't think he looked good... Jimmy Cagney was not tall but somehow Jimmy was at terms with himself, always. I don't think Alan Ladd ever came to terms with himself.|$|E
2500|$|Blue Book {{was headed}} by Ruppelt, then Captain Hardin, Captain Gregory, Major Friend, and finally Major Hector Quintanilla. Hynek had kind words only for Ruppelt and Friend. Of Ruppelt, he wrote [...] "In my {{contacts}} with him <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> {{to be honest}} and seriously puzzled about the whole phenomenon." [...] Of Friend, he wrote [...] "Of all the officers I worked with in Blue Book, Colonel Friend earned my respect. Whatever private views he may have held, he was a total and practical realist, and sitting where he could see the scoreboard, he recognized the limitations of his office but conducted himself with dignity and a total lack of the bombast that characterized several of the other Blue Book heads." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1844 Carl Gustav Carus, the {{physiologist}} and painter, made [...] "a {{visit to}} Mr Lawrence, {{author of a}} work on the [...] "Physiology of Man" [...] which had interested me much some years ago, but which had rendered the author obnoxious to the clergy... He appears to have {{allowed himself to be}} frightened by this, and is now merely a practising surgeon, who keeps his Sunday in the old English fashion, and has let physiology and psychology alone for the present. [...] <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> a rather dry, but honest man". Looking back in 1860 on his controversies with Abernethy, Lawrence wrote of [...] "events which though important at the time of occurrence have long ceased to occupy my thoughts".|$|E
2500|$|Between 1992 and 1995, Parks {{teamed up}} {{again with a}} then-reclusive Brian Wilson to create the album Orange Crate Art. Parks wrote all of the songs on the album, except [...] "This Town Goes Down at Sunset" [...] and George Gershwin's {{instrumental}} [...] "Lullaby", with vocals by Wilson. Orange Crate Art {{is a tribute to}} the Southern California of the early 1900s and a lyrical tribute to the beauty of Northern California. It was recorded during a stressful period for Wilson, after being involved in court orders relating to years of psychiatric misconduct to which he had been subject. According to Parks, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him,</b> he was alone in a room staring at a television. It was off." [...] The album was met with poor commercial reception, much to the disappointment of Parks.|$|E
2500|$|... "At (Cambridge) {{university}} I {{first became}} {{conscious of the}} creative role of politics in shaping human affairs, and I owe that mostly to my teachers Joan Robinson and Nicholas Kaldor. Joan Robinson was a brilliant teacher, but she also sought to awaken the inner conscience of her students {{in a manner that}} very few others were able to achieve. She questioned me a great deal and made me think the unthinkable. She propounded the left wing interpretation of Keynes, maintaining that the state has to play more of a role {{if you really want to}} combine development with social equity. Kaldor influenced me even more; <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> pragmatic, scintillating, stimulating. Joan Robinson was a great admirer of what was going on in China, but Kaldor used the Keynesian analysis to demonstrate that capitalism could be made to work." ...|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{he refers}} to some modern {{scholars}} by writing, [...] "What we see today, very unfortunately, is that the one who brings forward elevated ideas in his writings and lofty theories in his speech and his sermons often does not rise above {{the level of the}} layman" [...] but exempts Qardawi by saying, [...] "As for the outstanding, erudite scholar, Dr Yūsuf al-Qaradāwī, may God (Most High) preserve him, God (Most High) has indeed made me fortunate enough to accompany him in travels and in residence, and sit with him and closely associate with him in long and repeated meetings. [...] <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> manifest in his personality exemplary Islamic qualities, for he is a human being before he is a Muslim, and a devoted Muslim before he is a caller to Islam (dā'i), and a caller to Islam before he is a scholar and jurist." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Kerouac, On the Road [...] "was {{really a}} story about two Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God.

THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT FOR THE HOLY MAN: HE MUST SWEAT FOR GOD. And once he has found Him, the Godhood of God is forever Established and really must not be spoken about." [...] According to his [...] biographer, historian Douglas Brinkley, On the Road has been misinterpreted as a tale of companions out looking for kicks, {{but the most important}} thing to comprehend is that Kerouac was an American Catholic author – for example, virtually every page of his diary bore a sketch of a crucifix, a prayer, or an appeal to Christ to be forgiven.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his last}} days, {{some of his}} new disciples began to preach him as God Almighty. I was afraid my meeting with such men would give rise to {{unpleasant}} discussions.

That was before his removal to a more commodious house on the riverside for treatment. Ramkrishna took me to task for neglecting him. I pleaded guilty to the charge and made a clean breast of it by letting him know the exact causes, I smiled and said, “As there are many editions of a book so {{there have been many}} editions of God Almighty and your disciples are about to make you a new one.” He too smiled and said, “Just fancy, God Almighty dying of cancer in the throat.

2500|$|Arghezi {{later wrote}} that his {{relationship}} with Urmuz was difficult, especially since the grefier panicked that the establishment would discover his other career: [...] "he feared that the Cassation Court would better detect him as Urmuz than under his own name". The memoirist refers to Demetrescu-Buzău's perfectionism and unease, enhanced in the week before publication: [...] "He would {{wake up in the}} middle of the night and would send a very urgent letter, asking me if the comma after a 'that' should be moved before. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> wandering around my house at night, shy, restless, fainthearted or in a hopeful trance, that something of substance may or may not be found in his prose, that perhaps there's an error, asking me to publish it, and then again to destroy it; to publish it together with a eulogistic note, and then again to curse him. He bribed [...] to change phrases and words that I had to put back into place, as previous editorial interventions were for sure better than his." [...] The letters they exchanged show that the grefier was not enthusiastic about even seeing his texts and his pseudonym in print, to which Arghezi was replying: [...] "from among the few we'll be cooperating with, you were my first choice".|$|E
2500|$|Eberhard Grisebach {{visited him}} in March, writing to Helen Spengler of Kirchner's condition: [...] "I spent two mornings with Kirchner which I shall never forget. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> sitting on a very low chair next to a small, hot stove in a yellow-painted, sloping-roofed attic. Only {{with the help of}} a stick was he able to walk, {{staggering}} around the room. ... A colourfully painted curtain concealed a large collection of paintings. When we began to look at them, he came alive. Together with me, he saw all his experiences drift by on canvas, the small, timid-looking woman set aside what we had seen and brought a bottle of wine. He made short explanatory remarks in a weary voice. Each picture had its own particular colourful character, a great sadness was present in all of them; what I had previously found to be incomprehensible and unfinished now created the same delicate and sensitive impression as his personality. Everywhere a search for style, for psychological understanding of his figures. The most moving was a self- portrait in uniform with his right hand cut off. Then he showed me his travel permit for Switzerland. He wanted to go back to Davos... and implored me to ask father for a medical certificate. ... As the woman with him rightly said, though many people want to help him, nobody is able to do so any longer. ... When I was leaving, I thought of Van Gogh’s fate and thought that it would be his as well, sooner or later. Only later will people understand and see how much he has contributed to painting".|$|E
2500|$|Sir Reginald Johnston {{arrived in}} the Forbidden City as Puyi's English tutor on 3 March 1919. Puyi had never met a {{foreigner}} prior to this, recalling: [...] "I have never seen foreign men. From the magazines, I noticed they had big mustaches. The eunuchs said the mustaches were very hard and a lantern could be hung at its ends". President Xu Shichang believed that the monarchy {{was going to be}} restored in China sooner or later, and to prepare Puyi for the challenges of the modern world had hired Johnston to teach Puyi [...] "subjects such as political science, constitutional history and English". Johnston was allowed only five texts in English to give Puyi to read, namely Alice in Wonderland and translations into English of the [...] "Four Great Books" [...] of Confucianism; the Analects, the Mencius, the Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean. However, Johnston disregarded the rules, and taught Puyi about world history with a special focus on British history. Johnston also told Puyi so much about his native Scotland that Puyi eventually expressed the desire to visit the [...] "Scotland the Brave" [...] that his tutor spoke of with such pride and love. Besides history, Johnston taught Puyi philosophy and about what he saw as the superiority of monarchies over republics. Puyi remembered that the piecing blue eyes of his tutor [...] "made me feel uneasy ... <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> very intimidating and studied English with him like a good boy, not daring to talk about other things when I got bored ... as I did with my other Chinese tutors".|$|E
