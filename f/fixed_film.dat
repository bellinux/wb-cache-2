25|$|Measures {{creating}} uniform wastewater loadings tend {{to reduce}} the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth secondary treatment bioreactors are similar to a plug flow reactor model circulating water over surfaces colonized by biofilm, while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a continuous stirred-tank reactor keeping microorganisms suspended while water is being treated. Secondary treatment bioreactors may {{be followed by a}} physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration of <b>fixed</b> <b>film</b> secondary treatment systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth activated sludge systems can be operated in a smaller space than fixed-film trickling filter systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>film</b> systems use a porous medium which {{provides}} a bed to support the biomass film that digests the waste material in the wastewater. Designs for <b>fixed</b> <b>film</b> systems vary widely, but fall into two basic categories (though some systems may combine both methods). The first is a system where the media is moved relative to the wastewater, alternately immersing the film and exposing it to air, while the second uses a stationary media, and varies the wastewater flow so the film is alternately submerged and exposed to air. In both cases, the biomass must be exposed to both wastewater and air for the aerobic digestion to occur. The film itself may be made of any suitable porous material, such as formed plastic or peat moss. Simple systems use stationary media, and rely on intermittent, gravity driven wastewater flow to provide periodic exposure to air and wastewater. A common moving media system is the rotating biological contactor (RBC), which uses disks rotating slowly on a horizontal shaft. Approximately 40 percent of the disks are submerged at any given time, and the shaft rotates {{at a rate of}} one or two revolutions per minute.|$|E
50|$|CFSGAS systems, as {{the name}} implies, are {{designed}} to handle continuous flow, and do not provide a bed for a bacterial film, relying rather on bacteria suspended in the wastewater. The suspension and aeration are typically provided by an air pump, which pumps air through the aeration chamber, providing a constant stirring of the wastewater {{in addition to the}} oxygenation. A medium to promote <b>fixed</b> <b>film</b> bacterial growth may be added to some systems designed to handle higher than normal levels of biomass in the wastewater.|$|E

50|$|Coates {{was born}} in Reigate, Surrey, England, the {{daughter}} of Kathleen Voase (Rank) and Major Laurence Calvert Coates. Her first passion was horses. As a girl, {{she thought she might}} become a race-horse trainer. A graduate of Bartrum Gables College, before becoming a film editor, Anne Coates served as a nurse at Sir Archibald McIndoes pioneering plastic surgery hospital in East Grinstead, UK. Anne is Godmother to Samuel and Thomas Moore, son of Patrick Moore. Coates decided to pursue film directing and started out working as an assistant at a production company specializing in religious films (also doing projectionist and sound recording work). There she <b>fixed</b> <b>film</b> prints of religious short films before sending them out to various British church tours. This splicing work eventually led to the rare job as an assistant film editor at Pinewood Studios, where she worked on various films. Her first experience was assisting for film editor Reggie Mills. Anne V. Coates later worked with film director David Lean on Lawrence of Arabia. Coates has had a long and varied career, seemingly refusing to retire and she continues to edit films such as Out of Sight and Erin Brockovich for iconoclastic film director, Steven Soderbergh. Coates is a member of both the Guild of British Film and Television Editors(GBFTE) and American Cinema Editors (ACE).|$|E

The effect of temperature on nitrification rate in a <b>fixed</b> <b>film,</b> determined based on bacterial growth rate, was greatly reduced probably due to oxygen limitation.

40|$|The hybrid {{activated}} sludge-biofilm {{system called}} Integrated <b>Fixed</b> <b>Film</b> Activated Sludge (IFAS) has recently become popular for enhanced nitrification and denitrification in aerobic zones {{because it is}} an alternative to increasing the volume of treatment plant units to accomplish year round nitrification and nitrogen removal. Biomass is retained on the fixed-film media and remains in the aerobic reactor, thus increasing the effective mean cell resident time (MCRT) of the biomass and providing the temperature sensitive, slow growing nitrifiers a means of staying in the system when they otherwise would washout. While the utilization of media in aerobic zones to enhance nitrification and denitrification {{has been the subject of}} several studies and full-scale experiments, the effects and performances of <b>fixed</b> <b>film</b> media integrated into the anoxic zones of biological nutrient removal (BNR) systems have not adequately been evaluated as well as the impacts of integrated media upon enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR).
