The contrast in Congressional treatment of farm debtors and non-farm debtors in the 2005 statute is striking and appears to be attributable to strong and effective political support from farm state Members of Congress, the widespread belief that farmers in financial difficulty are deserving of assistance, and that abuse of the bankruptcy system has been less of a problem with the agricultural sector. 2005 legislation, Bankruptcy, Chapter 12 bankruptcy, Farmers, Financial stress, Indebted farmers, Political support...|$|R

Previously, the debtor could have tried to reach an out-of-court arrangement or private workout with its creditors by which the creditors could accept less than the full amount (or in some cases, the full amount, if it can be determined without the aid of any legal proceeding) they are owed. If those arrangements fail or they are not even attempted, in Spain there is a formal procedure to resolve an insolvency situation called concursodeacreedores.

40|$|Bankruptcy is {{a federal}} court {{procedure}} intended to benefit both debtors and creditors if a <b>debtor</b> is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> all obligations. Filing bankruptcy' stops, or stays, all creditor's debt-collection procedures. The stay is to prevent some creditors from receiving more than their fair share from a financially distressed debtor. A bankruptcy trustee is usually appointed {{to assist in the}} fair distribution of the debtor's property. Equitable distribution of the debtor's property also is furthered by the trustee's avoidance powers, the debtor's exempt property, and the court's discharging the debtor from unpaid obligations. There are two basic types of bankruptcy proceedings [...] liquidation and reorganization. Chapter 7 liquidation provides for the sale of the debtor's primary assets, distribution of proceeds to creditors, and discharge of remaining unpaid debts. Then, except for property specified as exempt by North Dakota law, the assets of the debtor are sold and the proceeds distributed among the creditors. Subsequently, the debtor is discharged from most remaining debts and given the opportunity to financially "start fresh. " Chapters 11, 12, and 13 of the Bankruptcy Code permit reorganization of the debtor's financial affairs and payment to creditors from the debtor's property and future income. A debtor is granted time to devise a plan of reorganization that may include rescheduling payments, selling some assets to reduce debt, forgiving debt, and implementing changes to increase the business' efficiency and profitability.

Darbā tiek analizēta jaunā Maksātnespējas likuma saistību dzēšanas procedūra no praktiskās puses, autorei norādot konkrētus uzlabojumus, kādi būtu veicami tiesību aktos. Autore ir minimāli analizējusi ārvalstu pieredzi, jo uzskata, ka ne katra ārvalstu pieredze būtu pārņemama un tā ne vienmēr integrējas Latvijas tiesību sistēmā. Autores ieskatā esošais regulējums Maksātnespējas likumā ir optimāls, bet uzlabojams. Tā kā šāds tiesību institūts Latvijā ir spēkā tikai dažus mēnešus, tad praksē vēl neviena persona Latvijā nav pilnībā ar to saskārusies. Tādēļ šis darbs un tajā paustās atziņas lielā mērā ir jauninājums, kas ir maz aplūkots juridiskajā literatūrā.

The liabilities' cancellation is a new procedure in the natural person's insolvency process, and its aim is both to shorten the natural person's insolvency process and provide the fullest possible satisfaction of creditors' demands. The paper analyzes the liabilities' cancellation procedure in the new Insolvency Law from the practical side, assesses the restrictions for applying of the liabilities' cancellation and evaluates the preferential arrangements for cancellation of liabilities {{laid out in the}} Insolvency Law in view of their compatibility with the principles of equality established by the Latvian Constitution. The paper also analyzes the concept of debtor's property, looks into the concept of debtor's property resulting from fiduciary transactions, evaluates the judicial practice in calculating administrative expenses and challenging marital contracts. The author suggests particular improvements that should be made in the legislation to amend the insolvency process. Since the Law on liabilities' cancellation procedure is in force in Latvia only for a few months, no one in Latvia has yet fully experienced the topic described in the paper: liabilities' cancellation procedure in the natural person's insolvency process. Therefore, this paper and its conclusions to a large extent is a new contribution to a topic that is underrepresented in the legal literature of cases where the <b>debtor</b> is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his/her debts...|$|R
40|$|Argentina’s debt default in 2001 {{moved the}} {{international}} community to launch initiatives to develop procedures for the orderly restructuring of unsustainable sovereign debt. These initiatives come {{against the backdrop of the}} increase in public debt in emerging market economies over the last decade, of large-scale fi nancial crises linked to the level or structure of sovereign debt and, a recent development, of several cases of sovereign default on international bonds. These developments pose two challenges. Firstly, the complexity of sovereign debt dynamics makes it necessary to strengthen international institutions’ assessment capacity. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has thus launched initiatives to improve the assessment of debt sustainability and balance sheet weaknesses. Secondly, the developments have prompted the re-examination of IMF facilities for managing debt crises. The absence of a clear framework in this area could create a moral hazard risk, as {{the international community}} could be tempted to avoid necessary restructuring by granting substantial fi nancial assistance. In practice, defining such a framework is complex, given that reforms in the area of restructuring influence the way in which debts are structured. In fact, the features of sovereign debt aim to reconcile two requirements: first, ensuring that the sovereign debtor honours the terms of the debt contract if it has the means to do so (ex ante efficiency); second, making sure that the cost of default is not excessive when the sovereign <b>debtor</b> is effectively <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> back (ex post effi ciency). The international community currently favours a market-based approach. Its first pillar is a result of the development and spread of collective action clauses (CAC), following the Quarles Report by the Group of 10. Incorporated into debt contracts, CAC aim to reduce the problems arising in inter-creditor co-ordination, by defi ning, in advance, the decision rules applicable in the event of re-negotiation. The “Principles for Stable Capital Flows and Fair Debt Restructuring in Emerging Markets”, whose defi nition was fostered notably by the Governor of the Banque de France and the Group of 20, form the second pillar. They supply guidelines for the parties involved to steer the exchange of information and facilitate co-ordination between debtors and creditors. The market-based approach is not exclusive of a formal regime, e. g. the IMF’s Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism (SDRM), where such a regime is feasible. In the market-based approach, the IMF acts as an expert via the supply of information and analyses, and also as a “monitor” via the negotiation and monitoring of programmes. The provision of loans, which is in principle limited, aims mainly to facilitate renegotiation by giving credibility to the sovereign’s policy. By contrast, a more formal regime would suppose limiting IMF involvement, so as to guarantee the independence of the mechanism. Whatever the case, the efficiency of the overhauled restructuring framework, which is built on contractual provisions and general principles rather than on a formal regime, will depend on the Fund’s capacity to fully perform its three functions. ...|$|R

The BA was passed on 5. 10. 1994 and {{it was based on}} the Germany's Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung).

Each of the changes in the law was made in order to fix “acute problems” in practice and to enhance the system of the bankruptcy protection; {{this was supposed to be}} achieved through increase functionality, speeding up of the process and decrease of the bankruptcy cost. However since the time after of passing of the BA was time of economic prosperity, consequently there was no awareness of the fact that bankruptcy should have other functions except collections of debt from the <b>debtors</b> which are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> The whole process just leads to the liquidation of the companies. But, frequent financial crisis have forced a radical change in the bankruptcy legislature, considering that the bankruptcy procedure has not improved and that it was possible to undergo a bankruptcy procedure without a bankruptcy plan. There was a clear need for a new legislative framework, Financial conduct and pre-bankruptcy settlement act FCPS, (NN 108 / 12, 144 / 12, 81 / 13 and 112 / 13 (71 / 15 and 78 / 15)). Although the passing of the FCPS in 2012. has significantly changed the bankruptcy procedure in Croatia, in its two year application a whole set of problems in terms of the meaning of the particular elements of the law which was tried to be solved with the passing of the new Bankruptcy act (NN 71 / 15). Since the „new“ BA has differently defined the rules and responsibilities of the trustee in bankruptcy, there was a need, according to the legislator, to change and in terms of the Nomo technics appropriately define the compensation for the trustees in bankruptcy with the new regulation based on the BA (Regulation on the criteria and the methodology of compensation for the trustees in bankruptcy published in NN 105 / 15). Furthermore even if the indicative method of fact-finding does point out how the wanted goals of the functionalization of the bankruptcy procedure have not been met, the legislator is faced with the new/old problem: implementation of the personal bankruptcy through the Personal bankruptcy Act (NN 100 / 15). Furthermore in order to align the Personal bankruptcy act with the new BA and with the goal of improving the socio-economic position of the people which are most affected by the bankruptcy, those are workers, legislator has in urgent fip / Volume 4 / Number 1 / 2016 58 procedure for the second time changed the Financial conduct and pre-bankruptcy settlement act (NN 86 / 08, 80 / 13 and 82 / 15). Considering the space constraints of this article I am not allowed a full and detailed inquiry into this problem, so I am going to focus, based on the author’s opinion, on most important aspects of the new insolvency legislature.
