5|$|It {{has been}} shown that out of all dog breeds, it is the Labrador Retriever that is most likely to be obese. In a 2016 {{published}} study it was shown that out of 310 Labradors, most were missing all or parts of the POMC gene. This gene plays a part in appetite regulation as well as indication of the amount of one's stored fat. The study concluded that the absence of that gene {{had a significant impact on}} Labrador weight and appetite. The POMC <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> is present in only one other breed – the Flat-coated Retriever.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{can also}} cause endometrial cancer. Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2–10% of endometrial cancer cases. Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before menopause. Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40–60%risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11years before. Carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} mismatch repair, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also mismatch repair genes. Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2–3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the <b>gene</b> <b>mutation,</b> women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) drug-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MethodsThe clinical data of treatment-experienced patients, who underwent examination for HBV drug-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> in Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 1 to December 31, 2013, and still had detectable HBV DNA after being treated with nucleos(t) ide analogues, were collected. All the patients were followed up, {{and the development of}} HCC was considered as the clinical outcome. The correlation between drug-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> and the development of HCC in patients with HBV infection was analyzed. The chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical between groups, the t-test was used for comparison of continuous data between two groups, and the log-rank test was used for comparison of the incidence of HCC between two groups. ResultsA total of 227 patients were enrolled in this study. According to the results of the detection of HBV drug-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>mutations,</b> 103 patients (103 / 227, 45. 37 %) had no drug-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> and 124 (124 / 227, 54. 63 %) had drug-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>mutations.</b> There {{were no significant differences between}} the mutation group and the non-mutation group in HBV DNA load (5. 19 ± 1. 60 log 10 IU/ml vs 5. 44 ± 1. 75 log 10 IU/ml, t=- 1. 134, P= 0. 258) and the percentage of patients with liver cirrhosis (24. 19 % (30 / 124) vs 16. 50 % (17 / 103), χ 2 = 2. 026, P= 0. 155). The median follow-up was 28 months (range 4 - 58 months), and the incidence of HCC was 7. 49 % (17 / 227). Among the patients with HBV drug-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>mutations,</b> 12 (12 / 124, 9. 68 %) developed HCC, and among those without HBV drug-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>mutations,</b> 5 (5 / 103, 4. 85 %) developed HCC. Among the patients who developed HCC, 70. 59 % (12 / 17) had HBV drug-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> at baseline; among the patients who did not develop HCC, 53. 33 % (112 / 210) had HBV drug-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> at baseline. ConclusionThe patients with poor control of HBV DNA during antiviral therapy have a comparable incidence of HCC to those not treated with antiviral therapy, with a relatively high risk of developing HCC; the treated patients with HBV drug-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> may have a higher risk of HCC than those without such mutations, which needs to be confirmed by the studies with a longer follow-up period and a larger sample size...|$|R

40|$|Diffuse large B-cell {{lymphoma}} (DLBCL) is {{a heterogeneous}} subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In addition to clinical and immunophenotypic characteristics, recurrent <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> {{have recently been}} identified in patients with DLBCL using next-generation sequencing technologies. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the clinical relevance of B-cell function <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> in DLBCL. Clinical analysis was performed on 680 Chinese DLBCL patients (146 non-CR and 534 CR cases) treated with six cycles of 21 -day R-CHOP (Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), alone or followed by two additional doses of rituximab consolidation on patients' own intention. Somatic mutations of B-cell function genes were further screened on 275 (71 non-CR and 204 CR) cases with available tumor samples by targeted sequencing, including genes involved in B-cell receptors (BCRs) pathway (CARD 11, LYN, CD 79 A, and CD 79 B), Toll-like receptors (TLRs) pathway (MYD 88), and tumor necrotic factor receptor (TNFR) pathway (TRAF 2 and TNFAIP 3). B-cell function <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> occurred in 44. 0 % (121 / 275) of DLBCL patients. The TLRs and TNFR related <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> were more frequently observed in non-CR patients (p =  0. 019 and p =  0. 032, respectively). BCRs related <b>gene</b> <b>mutations,</b> as well as revised IPI (R-IPI) and double BCL- 2 /MYC expression, were independently related to short progression-free survival in DLBCL after CR. The adverse prognostic effect of BCRs related <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> could be overcome by two additional doses of rituximab consolidation. These results highlight the molecular heterogeneity of DLBCL and identify a significant role of B-cell function <b>gene</b> <b>mutations</b> on lymphoma progression and response to rituximab in DLBCL...|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that heterozygote carriers of the Wilson's disease <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> may be potentially more susceptible to elevated copper intake than the general population.

25|$|Tuberculosis: Another {{possible}} explanation is that carriers of the gene could have some resistance to TB. This hypothesis is based on the thesis that CFTR <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> carriers have insufficient action in one of their enzymes – arylsulphatase - which is necessary for Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence.

25|$|Aceruloplasminemia {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} (a five-base pair insertion in exon 7) in the CP gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called ceruloplasmin, a protein involved in iron transport and processing. Ceruloplasmin helps move iron from the organs and tissues of the body and prepares it for incorporation into a molecule called transferrin, which transports it to red blood cells to help carry oxygen. The CP <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> results in the production of ceruloplasmin protein that is unstable or nonfunctional by altering the open reading frame such that the amino acid ligands in the essential carboxyl terminal region are eliminated. When ceruloplasmin is unavailable, transport of iron out of the body's tissues is impaired. The resulting iron accumulation damages cells in those tissues, leading to neurological dysfunction and other health problems.|$|E

25|$|Because {{development}} of CF in the fetus requires each parent {{to pass on}} a mutated copy of the CFTR gene and because CF testing is expensive, testing is often performed initially on one parent. If testing shows that parent is a CFTR <b>gene</b> <b>mutation</b> carrier, the other parent is tested to calculate the risk that their children will have CF. CF can result {{from more than a}} thousand different mutations. As of 2016, typically only the most common mutations are tested for, such as ΔF508 Most commercially available tests look for 32 or fewer different mutations. If a family has a known uncommon mutation, specific screening for that mutation can be performed. Because not all known mutations are found on current tests, a negative screen does not guarantee that a child will not have CF.|$|E
25|$|Mutations of tumor {{suppressor}} {{genes that}} occur in germline cells are passed along to offspring, and increase the likelihood for cancer diagnoses in subsequent generations. Members of these families have increased incidence and decreased latency of multiple tumors. The tumor types are typical {{for each type of}} tumor suppressor <b>gene</b> <b>mutation,</b> with some mutations causing particular cancers, and other mutations causing others. The mode of inheritance of mutant tumor suppressors is that an affected member inherits a defective copy from one parent, and a normal copy from the other. For instance, individuals who inherit one mutant p53 allele (and are therefore heterozygous for mutated p53) can develop melanomas and pancreatic cancer, known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Other inherited tumor suppressor gene syndromes include Rb mutations, linked to retinoblastoma, and APC gene mutations, linked to adenopolyposis colon cancer. Adenopolyposis colon cancer is associated with thousands of polyps in colon while young, leading to colon cancer at a relatively early age. Finally, inherited mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 lead to early onset of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|MAIS is only {{diagnosed}} in normal phenotypic males, {{and is not}} typically investigated except in cases of male infertility. MAIS has a mild presentation that often goes unnoticed and untreated; even with semenological, clinical and laboratory data, {{it can be difficult}} to distinguish between men with and without MAIS, and thus a diagnosis of MAIS is not usually made without confirmation of an AR <b>gene</b> <b>mutation.</b> The androgen sensitivity index (ASI), defined as the product of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone (T), is frequently raised in individuals with all forms of AIS, including MAIS, although many individuals with MAIS have an ASI in the normal range. Testosterone levels may be elevated despite normal levels of luteinizing hormone. Conversion of testosterone (T) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) may be impaired, although to a lesser extent than is seen in 5α-reductase deficiency. A high ASI in a normal phenotypic male, especially when combined with azoospermia or oligospermia, decreased secondary terminal hair, and/or impaired conversion of T to DHT, can be indicative of MAIS, and may warrant genetic testing.|$|E
