5000|$|In 2011, Avalon Waterways {{introduced}} the industry’s first Suite Ship - the Avalon Panorama - [...] {{which became the}} first {{in a long line of}} Avalon's now-signature Suite Ships. With a focus on bringing the outdoor experience inside, two <b>full</b> <b>decks</b> of Suite <b>Ship</b> staterooms feature floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall windows that slide open (7-feet) to create a balcony-like exterior wall for broader views of Europe's passing landscapes. Another exclusive feature of every Panorama Suite on all of Avalon Waterways’ Suite Ships are beds that face the views for which river cruising is famous.|$|R
50|$|The Type C1-B {{ships were}} built in six {{different}} yards, the majority at Consolidated Steel Corporation in Wilmington, California. All but ten of the C1-B ships had steam turbine engines; these were all built at Seattle-Tacoma SB Corp., Tacoma, Washington and Western Pipe & Steel Co., San Francisco, California, with each producing five ships. These were full scantling <b>ships</b> with three <b>decks</b> in which the frames hold the same dimensions as the upper <b>deck.</b> <b>Full</b> scantling <b>ships</b> have <b>deck</b> gear sufficient to completely unload their cargoes. An C1-B example is the USS Auriga (AK-98).|$|R
50|$|Trunk <b>deck</b> <b>ships</b> were {{influenced}} by (some would say copied from) turret <b>deck</b> <b>ships.</b> In 1892, the Sunderland, England firm of William Doxford and Sons Ltd. built its first turret <b>deck</b> <b>ship.</b> Inspired by U.S. whalebacks, one of which had recently visited Liverpool, Doxford built a ship which had a curved hull form which was stepped in above the waterline. The narrow part of the hull, called a turret, {{was part of the}} hold.|$|R

According to the company's website, the GRL either stands for [...] "Giant Robot Lizard" [...] or [...] "Graeme Roque Lori." [...] GRL Games' first application, <b>Full</b> <b>Deck</b> Solitaire was {{released}} in 2011 along with Clandestiny, <b>Full</b> <b>Deck</b> Word Games, <b>Full</b> <b>Deck</b> Poker Solitaire and Solitaire Minute. GRL Games' announced Dance City on 10 March 2012.|$|R
50|$|As with turret <b>deck</b> <b>ships,</b> {{the design}} of the trunk <b>deck</b> <b>ships</b> was said to {{maximize}} strength while reducing the amount of steel needed for construction. Disadvantages included the narrow hatches atop the trunk, which inhibited efficient loading and unloading. The low freeboard meant smaller waves could board the ship, and the bridge and superstructure therefore had to be stronger to resist wave action.|$|R

50|$|A trunk <b>deck</b> <b>ship</b> {{is a type}} of {{merchant}} ship with a hull that was stepped inward in order to obtain more favourable treatment under canal toll rules then in effect. As those tolls were set by net tonnage, a measure of volume, and as the tonnage rules did not account for all of the cargo space of such vessels, trunk <b>deck</b> <b>ships</b> incurred lower tolls than more conventional ships of equivalent capacity. When the measurement rules were changed, the type was no longer built.|$|R
50|$|Trunk <b>deck</b> <b>ships</b> had a low {{net tonnage}} (an {{approximate}} measure of cargo space) {{in comparison to}} their deadweight tonnage capacity (weight of cargo). Net tonnage is a computation of volume, and the method of measurement used at the Suez Canal to determine tolls {{was based on a}} measure of net tonnage which excluded the cargo spaces in the trunks of these unconventional hulls. Trunk <b>deck</b> <b>ships</b> therefore paid less in tolls. In 1911 the toll measure changed at Suez, and construction of the type ceased.|$|R
25|$|Turret <b>deck</b> <b>ships</b> had a low {{net tonnage}} (an {{approximate}} measure of cargo space) {{in comparison to}} their deadweight capacity (weight of cargo) allowing them to operate at a lower fee structure than a conventional hull. Net tonnage is a computation of volume, and the method of measurement used at the Suez Canal to determine tolls {{was based on a}} measure of net tonnage which excluded some of the cargo spaces of these unconventional hulls. Turret and trunk <b>deck</b> <b>ships</b> therefore paid less in tolls than conventional ships of the same capacity.|$|R

5000|$|Whalebacks {{were the}} {{precursors}} of the turret <b>deck</b> <b>ship</b> {{of the late}} 19th and early 20th century, which like the whaleback had rounded hulls, but unlike the whaleback had conventional bows and sterns and a superstructure.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{years after}} the first turret <b>deck</b> <b>ship,</b> the first trunk <b>deck</b> <b>ship</b> appeared. SS Trunkby, {{completed}} in 1896, was built by Robert Ropner at his shipyard at Stockton-on-Tees. This vessel was of [...] "three-island" [...] construction with a forecastle, bridge house, and quarterdeck, extending to the full width of a low-freeboard hull. A distinctive feature was a long [...] "trunk" [...] along the centerline, with a breadth of about half the vessel's beam, which connected the three elements of the superstructure. This trunk was stepped inward from the sides of the hull. That trunk was not a deckhouse or superstructure, but was part of the hull, and contained cargo space.|$|R
5000|$|Barlow {{described}} Heureux as [...] "the {{most complete}} flush <b>deck</b> <b>ship</b> I have ever seen, copper fastened, highly finished and of large dimensions". Furthermore, [...] "she {{will be considered}} as a most desirable ship for His Majesty's Service." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1911 {{the toll}} measure changed at Suez {{to account for}} all cargo spaces, and {{contemporaneous}} refinements {{in the design of}} ships of more conventional hull form eliminated the structural advantages of turret <b>deck</b> <b>ships.</b> Construction of the type therefore ceased.|$|R

5000|$|Yachts can be <b>shipped</b> as <b>deck</b> cargo. Yachts {{are loaded}} {{directly}} from the water or from shore. Yachts are loaded by ship or by shore cranes in cradles either supplied by the carrier or the owner.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{analyses}} {{have been performed}} using the DORCA program for several NASA-funded Aerospace Corporation studies {{in the past few}} years. The data decks containing the input data for these analyses have been compiled and are submitted, under separate cover. A few of the data <b>decks</b> are <b>full</b> (basic) <b>decks</b> containing every data item and are used as reference decks in the data bank. The other data decks were obtained by differencing a <b>full</b> <b>deck</b> with respect to one of the reference decks. Using the DORMAN program, a <b>full</b> <b>deck</b> can be recreated from the modified deck and its reference deck when and if desired. The content and structure of the data bank are described. A description of each of these data decks is presented. Three of the cases that are included in this volume have become so widely recognized and accepted that additional descriptive material has been provided. The three cases are: Case 500 Costs, Case 506 Costs, and Case 403...|$|R
