Every time a contestant hits a double square, as before, they get an extra turn. However, after finding a <b>Double</b> <b>card</b> the contestant randomly stops {{on one of the}} letters in E-X-P-L-O-S-I-O-N above the game board revealing a dollar amount between $2,000 and $5,000 which is then doubled and added to their score.

2500|$|After a double-cards lead, {{other players}} must also follow suit with <b>double</b> <b>cards,</b> {{if they have}} them; for players {{who do not have}} <b>double</b> <b>cards</b> in the suit lead, they may either play {{separate}} cards in the same suit, any two cards from other suits, or a double from the trump suit to [...] "ruff" [...] the trick. In this case, the highest-ordered trump double, if it is played, wins the trick; otherwise the highest-ordered double in the suit lead wins. Two singles may not beat a double even if they are both higher-ordered than the double (for trump 7♣, 9-9 beats J-Q or even J♣-Q♣, if a diamond double was led).|$|R

50|$|HP {{commonly}} reused {{the work}} of killed products in other product designs to save money and keep design-team morale up.

50|$|The Slovene health {{insurance}} card system was introduced, {{at the national}} scale, in the year 1999. The system provides the insured persons with a smart card. The card carries the identification number (HIIS number), the card issue number, the name and surname of the card holder, gender, and date of birth. Data links are established between the health care service providers and {{health insurance}} providers (the Health Insurance Institute and the two voluntary health insurance providers). Medical records are accessed by a health care professional using a <b>double</b> <b>card</b> reader. The professional's card controls their level of access.|$|E
50|$|If the player's two-card {{total is}} nine, ten or eleven (in some casinos, only ten and eleven, {{and in some}} casinos soft 19 and 20 are included) and the player doubles, the player has the option of {{discarding}} the double-down card received {{and replacing it with}} top (unseen) card from the shoe. The player can not replace the second <b>double</b> <b>card.</b> This option increases the favorability of doubling opportunities. Thus, basic strategy for Power Blackjack includes more doubles than for regular blackjack. Furthermore, a player needs to learn the additional strategy of when to replace the first double-down card to take maximum advantage of this rule variation. This strategy will depend on the player's initial total, the card drawn, and the dealer's up card.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{time the}} {{processes}} were refined. At Masson Mill and at Helmshore, there are Derby Doublers. The Masson machine, built by Platts of Oldham in 1902, doubled rovings from the breaker cards into card lap. This was then {{passed through the}} finisher card to produce the rovings [...] This process was known as <b>double</b> <b>carding.</b> The Derby <b>Doubler</b> was patented by Evan Leigh of Ashton-underline (21 December 1810 - 2 February 1876) and, though superseded, still continued in service in condensing coarse counts.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the basic progression of play, players should agree beforehand on certain card combinations that, when played, entitle the fastest player to slap the pile and subsequently claim it. The simplest and most common combination is often the <b>Double</b> (any two <b>cards</b> of equal rank). Other common slappable combinations include Sandwiches (a <b>double</b> with one <b>card</b> of a different value between the two), Hoagies (a <b>double</b> with 2 <b>cards</b> of different value between the two) consecutive-number runs {{of at least three}} in ascending or descending order (e.g. 7, 6, 5; 10, Jack, Queen), wild cards (usually Jokers, if used in play) and Marriage (King+Queen on top of each other). In the TSRF (Transition School Rules for Fun) variant, a 69, a 6-Jack-9, and a 42 if played, are eligible slaps.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Nonwoven mats from hemp and {{polypropylene}} fibres {{in various}} proportions were produced and hot pressed to make composite material. The effect of fibre {{content and the}} anisotropy in nonwoven mat resulting from the carding technology were examined on the three-point bending, tensile and impact properties of resultant composite material. Because of the hydrophilic nature and poor dimensional stability of cellulosic fibres due to swelling, the effect of water sorption on mechanical performances was also investigated. Optimal mechanical properties were achieved in composites made from 40 - 50 % of hemp fibre by weight. As it was expected, better mechanical properties {{were found in the}} specimens cut from the composite sheets parallel to the direction of carding. A strong decrease in three point bending properties was noticed after immersing the composite samples in the distilled water for 19 days, while the impact strength increased. <b>Double</b> <b>carding</b> of raw materials resulted into decreased anisotropy in composite material...|$|R

40|$|The less prosperous {{condition}} of the community in the Indonesia-Malaysia border area {{in the province of}} West Kalimantan has resulted in several problems including those related to fiqh, such as the sale and purchase of illegal goods from Malaysia, the phenomena of illegal migrant workers from Indonesia, human trafficking, transnational marriages, <b>double</b> identity <b>cards,</b> etc. In the perspective of fiqh, there is no ban on trading between people of different nationalities. In the legislative provisions, all citizens are bound not to commit illegal trade. On the other hand, the cases of <b>double</b> identity <b>cards,</b> transnational marriages, and the issue of migrant workers, in fact, are against the fiqh. However, in the context of citizenship, people should follow the provisions of the prevailing legislation. These fiqh issues have motivated the author to analyze them from the perspective of fiqh.
