5|$|Effective in the 2014 racing season, the {{grandstand}} capacity was reduced from 92,000 to 68,000. This {{was accomplished by}} removing approximately 12,000 seats near Turn 1 and installing a hospitality area and a digital display showing speeds along the straightaway. In addition, seats were further reduced {{as a result of}} modifying average seat width from 18 <b>inches</b> <b>to</b> 23 inches. The capacity quoted does not include luxury boxes and infield seating, which when added up reaches a capacity of approximately 100,000.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{began the}} season by {{changing}} rackets {{for the first}} time in his career, from his longtime frame of 90 square <b>inches</b> <b>to</b> one measured at 97 square inches. He had long been at a comparative disadvantage in equipment as almost the entire tour, including his top rivals Nadal and Djokovic, used more powerful frames of between 95 and 100 square inches. At the Australian Open, Federer defeated Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Andy Murray to reach his 11th consecutive semifinal in Melbourne, before losing to Rafael Nadal in straight sets.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, {{there was}} also severe wind damage in Palm Beach. A few {{buildings}} constructed by Henry Flagler, such as The Breakers, the Royal Poinciana Hotel, and Whitehall were damaged. At the Royal Poinciana, the hotel's botanical garden, which contained hundreds of exotic trees and plants, was almost completely destroyed. The golf club suffered severe roof damage, while the course was flooded with several <b>inches</b> <b>to</b> several feet of water. Waves inundated and swept away the foliage and trees {{at the house of}} J. Leonard Replogle.|$|E

50|$|The corolla of Pachypodium ambongense is limb {{white with}} the tube being pale greenish-yellow outside {{and with a}} throat that is yellowish-green inside. It {{measures}} 4.3 cm (0.17 <b>inch)</b> <b>to</b> 6 cm (0.24 inch) long in the mature bud and forms a comparatively wide broadly ovoid, shaped like an egg--ovate-like without being flat—head, which is 3.8 cm (1.5 <b>inch)</b> <b>to</b> 4.0 cm (0.16 inch) of the bud length. The head of the corolla appears to be 17 mm (0.67 inch) by 23 mm (0.91 inch) in length by 4 mm (0.16 <b>inch)</b> <b>to</b> 10 mm (0.39 inch) in width. It is obtuse, having a blunt or rounded tip, at the apex. As well, {{the head of the}} corolla is glabrous, smooth outside, with a sparsely pubescent, hairy belt inside that is 7 mm (0.28 inch) wide and located just below the insertion point of the stamens. Otherwise, the corolla head is glabrous with a tube that is 10.5 to 12.3 times as long as the calyx, the outermost series of leaves, collectively called the sepals. Moreover the calyx is 1.4 to 1.8 times as long as the lobes, measuring at 3.7 cm (1.46 <b>inch)</b> <b>to</b> 4.2 cm (1.65 inches) long. The basal part of the corolla tube is narrowly cylindrical and is half of the length of the entire tube at 19 mm (0.75 <b>inch)</b> <b>to</b> 21 mm (0.83 inch) in length by 1.5 mm (0.059 <b>inch)</b> <b>to</b> 2 mm (0.079 inch) wide.

The corolla lobes are obliquely ovate, a flatten egg-shape profile—running at 0.52 to 0.7 times as long as the corolla tube, which is 1.6 to 2 times as long it is wide. It measures 21 mm (.83 <b>inch)</b> <b>to</b> 30 mm (1.18 inch) by 11 mm (0.43 <b>inch)</b> <b>to</b> 15 mm (0.59 inch). The corolla lobes are obtuse at the apex of the tube.|$|R
5|$|Tech {{took over}} at its 13-yard line {{following}} the 63-yard punt but went three {{and out and}} was itself forced to punt. Air Force's offense returned to the field at its 47-yard line after the kick. The Falcons picked up one first down, but the Tech defense stiffened and forced a fourth down. Needing just <b>inches</b> <b>to</b> gain a first down, Air Force elected to attempt to gain the needed yardage rather than punt the ball away. But before the Falcons could start the play, time ran out in the third quarter. With one quarter remaining, the Falcons still held a 107 lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Air Force in {{possession}} of the ball, facing fourth down, and needing to advance mere <b>inches</b> <b>to</b> gain a first down. During the Falcons' attempt to gain those inches, however, Tech's Bruce Smith broke through the Air Force offensive line and sacked Bart Weiss for a loss. Having failed to gain a first down, Air Force turned the ball over to Virginia Tech, which began a drive at its 42-yard line. Tech's Eddie Hunter moved the ball forward on three consecutive rushes, earning a first down and driving into Air Force territory. Seeking {{to tie the game}} or gain a lead with a trick play; Tech head coach Bill Dooley ordered a play involving a pass by Hunter instead of quarterback Mark Cox. The pass was intercepted by Air Force defender Scott Thomas, and the Falcons took over on offense at their 38-yard line with 12:58 remaining in the game.|$|E

Sixty steel specimens containing a total of 176 fatigue cracks and 60 titanium specimens containing a total of 135 fatigue cracks were evaluated. The cracks ranged in length from. 043 cm (0. 017 <b>inch)</b> <b>to</b> 1. 02 cm (. 400 inch) and in depth from. 005 cm (. 002 <b>inch)</b> <b>to.</b> 239 cm (. 094 inch) for steel specimens.
