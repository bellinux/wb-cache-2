He hit square #17 on his last spin, which was a space that had a Whammy in it, but <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> board before the Whammy could shuffle into the square and won a trip to The Bahamas valued at $2,636.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias {{and several of}} Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus {{that he should not}} offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him. Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Nearchus, Ptolemy and Erigyius, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.|$|E
5|$|Koniecpolski's {{force of}} 4,200 light cavalry, 1,000 dragoons, and 1,000 {{infantry}} quickly moved to Prussia. Reinforced by other units, he had 9,000 men against the 20,000-strong Swedish force. Employing maneuver warfare, using small mobile units {{to strike at}} enemy communication lines and smaller units, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> Swedish attack and forced Axel Oxenstierna into a defensive posture. Meanwhile, the Sejm agreed {{to raise money for}} the war. The situation of the Commonwealth forces, short of money and food, was difficult. Lithuanian forces were dealt a serious defeat near Koknese, Inflanty Voivodeship, in December 1626 and they subsequently retreated behind the Dvina River. The Swedes then planned to strike Koniecpolski from two directions: Oxenstierna, from the Vistula River, and Johann Streiff von Lawentstein and Maxymilian Teuffl, from Swedish-held Pomorze. The flooding of the Vistula, however, disrupted their plans and allowed Koniecpolski to intercept the enemy units advancing from Pomerania.|$|E

The reports then state that after Acoli complied, and as Harper was looking inside the vehicle to examine the registration, Trooper Foerster yelled and held up an ammunition magazine as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red pocketbook, pulled out a nine-millimeter weapon and fired at him. Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next to the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} he worked on Yu Yu Hakusho, Togashi would {{calculate}} the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night. He wrote in his own dōjinshi Yoshirin de Pon! that <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> production on Yu Yu Hakusho out of selfishness. The author had originally wanted to end the manga in December 1993, at {{the climax of the}} Sensui arc. Although there was not a large demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series' run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that, beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems. He noted himself as being very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke's match with Chu. There were also many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke's meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu. Togashi was relieved {{at the conclusion of the}} manga. The author claimed to not have been involved in the production of the Yu Yu Hakusho anime adaptation due to his own work schedule. He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba's voice depiction of Kuwabara, admitting that the voice actor understood the character better than Togashi himself.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone at the front desk because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E

Eurytus was well-aware of Heracles' {{murder of his}} previous wife, Megara and their children and thus afraid that Iole and her offspring by him would suffer the same fate. Eventually, Heracles had won the contest but was not entitled to the prize because of his reputation. Eurytus broke his promise to give his royal daughter to {{the winner of the}} archery contest.|$|E

In his fifth title defense, Vic faced Glenn Donaire. Glenn gave up during the fight, claiming Vic broke his jaw in the 6th round from an alleged elbow attack. Replays show no evidence of an elbow.

25|$|After {{collapsing}} the Russian advance, Poniatowski organised {{an attack}} group from division Wielhorski units. This group contained three infantry battalions from regiments Potocki, Malczewski and ordnance ostrogocka, Brigade National Cavalry under command of Dzierżek, and regiment front watch under command of Józef Lubomirski. The group had {{to attack the}} Russian right wing. Morkov, who watched the preparations, concentrated most of his formation against the group. Polish cavalry successfully fought the Russian cavalry and forced them to withdrawal. But when Wielhorski met the enemy infantry, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> advance because his infantry was weaker than the Russians and inexperienced. About 5 p.m. Morkov, who did not get relief from Kutuzov, withdrew.|$|E

For his bravery at Montebello, he received a saber of honor on 24 January 1802. He {{was wounded in the}} thigh on 17 December 1802 at Larozotte.

25|$|Despite the {{government}} crackdown, Polanco-Rodriguez escaped arrest in New York by fleeing to the Dominican Republic with a fake passport. However, {{he was unable}} to stay out of trouble. He was shot in the leg during a gunfight over a woman in a Santiago nightclub. United States officials insisted that the Dominican government either extradite or imprison him. He was arrested in 1988 and sent to La Victoria prison without a trial. After fighting with other prisoners, Polanco-Rodriguez was transferred to the Monte Plata jail in 1990, where he bribed guards to allow him certain luxuries. But once again Polanco-Rodriguez became involved in an intense struggle with inmates when <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> attempted rape of a female prisoner. Fellow prisoners attempted to burn him alive by setting his cell cot on fire. Finally, in 1992, prison authorities released him. He is married to a woman named Johani Candelario, daughter of Renato Candelario, and is the father of five children. In an interview with The New York Times in 1996, Polanco-Rodriguez said he had retired from his life of crime, and DEA and Dominican drug officials said they have no evidence to the contrary.|$|E
500|$|Audiences did {{not respond}} well to the revised version during early performances. Blake {{was on the verge}} of {{dropping}} the number from the show when a dancer was taken ill and had to be replaced. The understudy was a singer who did not know the steps, so when he was unable to follow the routine he ignored it and improvised. America's Songs quotes Sissle's recollection of how the performance saved the song: [...] "He dropped out of line and with a jive smile and a high-stepping routine of his own, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> show cold." ...|$|E
500|$|Constantine Doukas (or Doux) (...) (died 913) was a {{prominent}} Byzantine general.

In return, Samonas manipulated his father, Andronikos Doukas, into rebelling and fleeing to the Abbasid court in 906/7. Constantine followed his father to Baghdad , but soon escaped and returned to Byzantium, where he was restored by Leo VI the Wise to favour and entrusted with high military offices.

[...] Tarleton he sent to raid Charlottesville, where the Virginia legislature was meeting, while he sent Simcoe to Point of Fork, where Baron von Steuben had a supply depot. [...] Both expeditions were qualified successes; Tarleton very nearly captured Virginia governor Thomas Jefferson at his home of Monticello, while Simcoe managed to destroy a significant cache of supplies despite being outnumbered by von Steuben's force. [...] While these raids went on, Lafayette and Wayne joined forces, and Lafayette was further reinforced by the arrival of about 600 experienced militia a few days later.|$|E
500|$|Jackson had to {{deal with}} Presley's absence from rehearsals at Graceland and concert soundchecks. The singer would usually show up at the concert venue at the last minute, walk out on stage and start to sing, having never heard the sound system. Presley {{sometimes}} turned {{to the side of the}} stage to ask Jackson to make changes, and a few times <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>the</b> show to have Jackson come out and stand center stage and listen carefully to the monitors while Presley sang to 20,000 people. One night in Fort Worth, Texas, Presley led the audience in singing [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] in honour of the engineer's birthday—an [...] "amazing, and very embarrassing" [...] occasion for Jackson. Jackson can be seen at his side-stage mix position in Presley's 1977 [...] "CBS Special" [...] TV show.

Among these measures were increased resource-sharing, including increased sharing of physical assets and research staff. The latter was evidenced by the increase in joint faculty appointments between the EES and Georgia Tech. The move paid off, and the fiscal year 1970–1971 saw EES win new contracts and grants, totaling a record $5.2 million (equivalent to $ million in [...] ). Stelson was left {{in charge of the}} station's reorganization and was named interim director upon Long's departure in 1975. During his tenure, Stelson reorganized the station into eight semi-autonomous laboratories in order to allow each to develop a specialization and clientele, a model it retains (with slight modifications) to this day.|$|E
