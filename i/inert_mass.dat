500|$|White dwarfs {{are thought}} to be the final {{evolutionary}} state of stars whose mass is not high enough to become a neutron star, which would include the Sun and over 97% of the other stars in the Milky Way., §1. After the hydrogen-fusing period of a main-sequence star of low or medium mass ends, such a star will expand to a red giant during which it fuses helium to carbon and oxygen in its core by the triple-alpha process. If a red giant has insufficient mass to generate the core temperatures, around 1 billion K, required to fuse carbon, an <b>inert</b> <b>mass</b> of carbon and oxygen will build up at its center. After such a star sheds its outer layers and forms a planetary nebula, it will leave behind a core, which is the remnant white dwarf. Usually, white dwarfs are composed of carbon and oxygen. If the mass of the progenitor is between 8 and 10.5 solar masses (...) , the core temperature will be sufficient to fuse carbon but not neon, in which case an oxygen–neon–magnesium white dwarf may form. Stars of very low mass {{will not be able to}} fuse helium, hence, a helium white dwarf may form by mass loss in binary systems.|$|E

Thus, what then ought to be more natural and necessary today, after the Russian lesson, than the political rallying of the peasantry, [...] its transformation from an amorphous and politically <b>inert</b> <b>mass</b> into a self-aware organism that is to demand its share of stately power in proportion to its numbers and significance?" ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not universally}} agreed what the {{intended}} {{effect of these}} [...] "optical refinements" [...] was; they {{may serve as a}} sort of [...] "reverse optical illusion". As the Greeks may have been aware, two parallel lines appear to bow, or curve outward, when intersected by converging lines. In this case, the ceiling and floor of the temple may seem to bow {{in the presence of the}} surrounding angles of the building. Striving for perfection, the designers may have added these curves, compensating for the illusion by creating their own curves, thus negating this effect and allowing the temple to be seen as they intended. It is also suggested that it was to enliven what might have appeared an <b>inert</b> <b>mass</b> in the case of a building without curves, but the comparison ought to be, according to Smithsonian historian Evan Hadingham, with the Parthenon's more obviously curved predecessors than with a notional rectilinear temple.|$|E
25|$|Keloid scars {{can occur}} on anyone, {{but they are}} most common in dark-skinned people. They {{can be caused by}} surgery, accident, acne or, sometimes, body piercings. In some people, keloid scars form spontaneously. Although they can be a {{cosmetic}} problem, keloid scars are only <b>inert</b> <b>masses</b> of collagen and therefore completely harmless and not cancerous. However, they can be itchy or painful in some individuals. They tend to be most common on the shoulders and chest. Hypertrophic scars and keloids tend to be more common in wounds closed by secondary intention. Surgical removal of keloid is risky and may excerbate the condition and worsening of the keloid.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the results of}} a trade study in which four novel propulsion approaches are applied to a 100 -kg-class satellite designed for rendezvous, reconnaissance, and other on-orbit operations. The technologies, which are currently at a NASA technology readiness level of 4, are known as solar thermal propulsion, digital solid motor, water-based propulsion, and solid pulse motor. Sizing calculations are carried out using analytical and empirical parameters to determine the propellant and <b>inert</b> <b>masses</b> and volumes. The results are compared to an offthe- shelf hydrazine system using a trade matrix “scorecard. ” Other factors considered besides mass and volume include safety, storability, mission time, accuracy, and refueling. Most of the concepts scored higher than the hydrazine system and warrant further development. The digital solid motor had the highest score by a small margin...|$|R
2500|$|In {{analysing}} the Russian Revolution, Kovel {{feels that}} [...] "conspiratorial" [...] revolutionary movements [...] "cut {{off from the}} development of society" [...] will [...] "find society an <b>inert</b> <b>mass</b> requiring leadership from above". From this, {{he notes that the}} anti-democratic Tsarist heritage meant that the Bolsheviks, who were aided into power by World War One, were a minority who, when faced with a counter-revolution and invading Western powers, continued [...] "the extraordinary needs of 'war communism'", which [...] "put the seal of authoritarianism" [...] on the revolution; thus, for Kovel, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky [...] "resorted to terror", shut down the Soviets (workers' councils) and emulated [...] "capitalist efficiency and productivism as a means of survival", setting the stage for Stalinism. Lenin, in Kovel's eyes, came to oppose the nascent Bolshevik environmentalism and its champion Aleksandr Bogdanov, who was later attacked for [...] "idealism"; Kovel describes Lenin's philosophy as [...] "a sharply dualistic materialism, rather similar to the Cartesian separation of matter and consciousness, and perfectly tooled... to the active working over of the dead, dull matter by the human hand", which led him to want to overcome Russian backwardness through rapid industrialization. This tendency was, according to Kovel, augmented by a desire to catch-up with the West and the [...] "severe crisis" [...] of the revolution's first years. Furthermore, Kovel quotes Trotsky, who believed in a Communist [...] "superman" [...] who would [...] "learn how to move rivers and mountains". Kovel believes that, in Joseph Stalin's [...] "revolution from above" [...] and mass terror in response to the early 1930s economic crisis, Trotsky's writings [...] "were given official imprimatur", despite the fact that Trotsky himself was eventually purged, as Stalinism attacked [...] "the very notion of ecology... in addition to ecologies". Kovel adds that Stalin [...] "would win the gold medal for enmity to nature", and that, in the face of massive environmental degradation, the inflexible Soviet bureaucracy became increasingly inefficient and unable to emulate capitalist accumulation, leading to a [...] "vicious cycle" [...] that led to its collapse.|$|E

60|$|It {{is true that}} Mach {{tried to}} avoid having to accept as real {{something}} which is not observable by endeavouring to substitute in mechanics a mean acceleration with reference to the totality of the masses in the universe in place of an acceleration with reference to absolute space. But inertial resistance opposed to relative acceleration of distant masses presupposes action at a distance; and as the modern physicist does not believe that he may accept this action at a distance, he comes back once more, if he follows Mach, to the ether, which has to serve as medium for the effects of inertia. But this conception of the ether to which we are led by Mach's way of thinking differs essentially from the ether as conceived by Newton, by Fresnel, and by Lorentz. Mach's ether not only conditions the behaviour of <b>inert</b> <b>masses,</b> but is also conditioned in its state by them.|$|R

40|$|A novel solar {{adsorption}} chiller {{intended for}} domestic use is presented. The chiller {{can be integrated}} with existing solar systems based on flat plate collectors, and, contrary to commercial chillers, it operates continuously. A detailed analysis of both the simple and the heat-integrated cycle is carried out so as to select the optimal adsorbent and operating conditions. The employed integral thermodynamic model {{takes into account the}} <b>inert</b> <b>masses</b> that limit the performance of the chiller, such as the metal frame, the thermofluid. and the non-adsorbed steam, by introducing heat capacity effects. Given the adsorption equilibrium data. the energy balances, the performance. and the useful thermal loads of the system can be calculated at any operating conditions. The results indicate that silica gel Type A is a more efficient adsorbent compared to silica gel Type RD or Type 3 A. Furthermore, the total porosity has a slight effect on system performance, while optimal operation can be achieved when the condenser temperature is less than 326 K and the evaporator temperature greater than 280 K.

With Jourdan temporarily out of the picture, the Austrians defeated the left wing of the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle at the Battle of Mainz and moved down the west bank. In November, Clerfayt gave Pichegru a drubbing at Pfeddersheim and successfully wrapped up the Siege of Mannheim. In January 1794, Clerfayt concluded an armistice with the French, allowing the Austrians to retain large portions of the west bank. During the campaign Pichegru entered into traitorous contact with French Royalists. It is debatable whether Pichegru's treason or his bad generalship was the actual cause of the French failure.|$|R
