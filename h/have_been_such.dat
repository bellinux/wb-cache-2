5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords {{as late as the}} ninth century. The Anglo-Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders, with a leader who had authority over many different groups; Ælle of Sussex may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a leader. Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. A weaker state also might ask or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works and to give some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a tape recorder to record some of his music, but Sorabji did not do so.|$|E

Wood Mound is clearly man-made and therefore the relationship between these sites and water may have had some functional or religious significance.|$|E

The specialist salvage vessel Salvage Chief removed 90 tonnes (98%) of fuel from the Cita before she sank, leaving only a minor oil slick. Oiled sand on Porth Hellick beach, part of the Isles of Scilly SSSI, was removed by excavation. Three tugs were summoned to collect the containers drifting around the Celtic Sea.|$|E
25|$|Shinty is an {{integral}} part of the Highlands and Islands. As the capital of the Highlands, Camanachd Association is based in Inverness and the city often hosts a wealth of Shinty finals such as the Camanachd Cup Final (the pinnacle of Shinty) as well as the international game of Shinty and Irish hurling. Despite Inverness Shinty Club not being particularly successful in recent years, some of the towns and villages that surround the city <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> <b>such</b> as Kiltarlity who are the home of Lovat Shinty Club (recent winners of the MacTavish Cup 2013) and Glen Urquhart.|$|E

25|$|Parallel and {{counter to}} these {{mainstream}} groups <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> New York-centered underground movements as the Beat poets and writers, including Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso and others, continuing into the 1980s and beyond with such writers as Kathy Acker and Eileen Myles. Various movements {{down through the}} years have centered on avant-garde publishing enterprises such as Grove Press and Evergreen Review, as well as unnumbered zine-style pamphlets and one-off literary productions still available in independent bookstores today. At present the underground continues to thrive {{in the form of}} small press literary publishers, including Soft Skull Press, Fugue State Press, Dennis Cooper's Little House on the Bowery/Akashic Press, and many others.|$|E
500|$|Considering {{that under}} the Lisbon Treaty the European Council has become a formal {{institution}} {{with the power of}} appointing the Commission, it could be said that the two bodies hold the executive power of the EU (the European Council also holds individual national executive powers). However, it is the Commission that currently holds executive powers over the European Union. The governmental powers of the Commission <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> that some such as former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt have suggested changing its name to the [...] "European Government", calling the present name of the Commission [...] "ridiculous".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{assert that}} Escrivá and the {{organization}} supported radical right-wing governments, {{such as those of}} Franco, Augusto Pinochet and Alberto Fujimori of Peru during the 1990s. Both Pinochet's and Fujimori's ministries and prominent supporters allegedly included members of Opus Dei, but there are also prominent Opus Dei members in parties that opposed those governments. Likewise, among Opus Dei members there were also strong detractors of Franco, such as Antonio Fontán. [...] There have also been allegations that Escrivá expressed sympathy for Adolf Hitler. One former Opus Dei priest, Vladimir Felzmann, who has become a vocal Opus Dei critic, says that Escrivá once remarked that Hitler had been [...] "badly treated" [...] by the world and he further declared that [...] "Hitler couldn't <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a bad person.

On behalf of that committee, Kvale reported it favorably to the full House on February 10. In the report, Kvale stated that the 40,000 medals would be struck without expense to the government, and that Treasury officials supported the bill.

500|$|On February23, 2010, {{the album}} was previewed in its {{entirety}} during a private listening party at Gramercy Park Hotel's Rose Bar in New York City. Craig Kallman, Chairman and CEO of Atlantic Records, delivered a speech praising {{the members of the}} band and their influence on the music industry, comparing them to Led Zeppelin. Several members of the audience described the songs as [...] "Beatles-esque" [...] and the album [...] "a natural, melodic progression for Stone Temple Pilots." [...] Robert DeLeo cautioned against the overuse of the [...] "Beatles" [...] label. [...] "I think there's {{always going to be a}} sense of Beatles on whatever anybody does.

500|$|The {{derivation}} of {{the name}} is uncertain, but several ideas have been proposed. One is that the [...] "Eccles" [...] place-name {{is derived from the}} Romano-British Ecles or Eglys, itself derived from the Ancient Greek Ecclesia. [...] Following the arrival in AD613 of the invading Anglo-Saxons at Lancashire, many existing British place-names, especially rivers and hills (the River Irwell for example), survived intact. The root [...] "Ecles", found in several village names, is an exception to this. A popular theory is that the word denoted the site of a building recognised by the Anglo-Saxons as a church and feature of the landscape. Eccles appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a village, and Ecles may be the likely source of the modern name. [...] In Kenyon's Origins of Lancashire (1991), however, the author suggests that {{this may not be the}} case as there is not an exact correlation between [...] "Eccles" [...] place-names and pre-Domesday hundreds in south Lancashire.|$|E

500|$|In general, [...] "I Hate December" [...] has {{a darker}} theme that is rarely heard in Christmas music. Durand {{talks about her}} fears of death, singing: [...] "All I know is what I dream / But lately dreams <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> scary things / Of suicide and frozen ice over my pale body". Trouser Press editor Ira A. Robbins joked that with Lately, Ivy was {{attempting}} to bring French pop music back into the American music industry. In his book The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock, Robbins and Vickie Gilmer summarized it as an [...] "original [...] wah-wahing" [...] song recorded in the [...] "City of Lights". On an episode of the MTV2 music program 120 Minutes, Schlesinger described the message behind [...] "I Hate December" [...] as [...] "anti-Christian".
