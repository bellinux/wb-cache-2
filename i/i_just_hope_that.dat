[...] Zawisza added, [...] "This title certainly feels as though it has been shuffling its feet through the darkness of [...] "Forever Evil," [...] afraid of stepping on something or stubbing its toe, but more noticeably, it simply isn't getting anywhere with any speed.

5000|$|For the Grand National on 11 April Many Clouds was {{assigned}} a weight of 11 stone 9 pounds (163 pounds), one pound below the topweight Lord Windermere. Sherwood had wanted {{to wait until the}} following year to run the horse in the race but was over-ruled by Hemmings and Aspell. Starting at odds of 25/1, he was close behind the leaders for most of the way before taking the lead five fences from the finish when The Druid's Nephew fell. He went three lengths clear at the last and held on to win by one and three quarter lengths from the French-bred Saint Are, with Monbeg Dude six lengths back in third. The winning time of 8 minutes 56.8 seconds was the second fastest in the race's history. No horse had carried a higher weight to victory since Red Rum in 1974. He is also the first horse to win both the Hennessy Gold Cup and Grand National in the same season. The horse appeared somewhat distressed after crossing the line, and Aspell dismounted rather than riding the horse into the winner's enclosure, but he quickly recovered and was reported to be [...] "bucking and kicking" [...] in his paddock on the following morning. Aspell said, [...] "I asked him some big questions and he has dug really deep. I tried to conserve energy because he had a hard race in the Gold Cup and it’s a wonderful training performance by Oliver to freshen him up and recharge the batteries.

Three weeks later he followed up with a victory in a minor race over 2000 metres at the same track beating Tosen Rasen by about three lengths. The colt was then stepped up to Grade II level for the Spring Stakes (a trial for the Satsuki Sho) over 1800 metres at Nakayama Racecourse on 22 March. He started at odds of 11.3/1 against eleven opponents including Danon Platina, who had been name Japanese champion two-year-old colt after winning the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes and Real Steel who had defeated Duramente in the Grade III Tokinominoru Kinen. Ridden as in most of his races that year by Hiroshi Kitamura he won by a neck from Real Steel, with Danon Platina {{three quarters of a}} length back in third place. In the Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres at the same track on 19 April he started the 8.7/1 fourth choice in the fifteen runner field and finished third behind Duramente and Real Steel with the favoured Satono Crown (winner of the Yayoi Sho) in sixth place. Following the race his trainer Hisashi Shimizu explained [...] "our horse gave it everything he had and I thought he turned in a good performance. He doesn’t give in easily". On 31 May at Tokyo Racecourse the colt contested the 82nd running of the Tokyo Yushun over 2400 metres but after racing in second place he dropped away quickly in the last 300 metres abd finished fourteenth of the eighteen runners behind Duramente.After a break of almost four months, Kitasan Black returned on 21 September for the Grade II St Lite Kinen (a trial race for the Kikuka Sho) over 2200 metres. He started at odds of 11.5/1 in a field headed by Satono Rasen who had finished second in the Tokyo Yushun, with the other fancied contenders including the Grade III winners Bright Emblem and Beruf. In a closely contested finish, he won by three quarters of a length and a head from the outsiders Musee Alien and Jun Tsubasa. On 25 October Kitasan Black was partnered by Kitamura when he started at odds of 12.4/1 in an eighteen-runner field for the Kikuka Sho over 3000 metres at Kyoto Racecourse. The favourite was Lia Fail, the winner of the Grade II Kobe Shimbun Hai, whilst the other runners included Real Steel, Satono Rasen, Beruf, Bright Emblem, Musee Alien and Jun Tsubasa. After racing in fifth place on the inside, Kitasan Black took the lead early in the straight and held off the late challenge of Real Steel by a neck with Lia Fail half a length back in third. After the race Shimizu, who was recording his first Grade I win as a trainer, commented [...] "There were concerns over his aptitude for long distances but I wanted to prove that this was wrong, as his form and movements showed that he is suited to long distances. There were horses chasing us on the outside after we took command so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> he will hold on until the wire."
