5|$|Bredon Hill (1941) for {{violin and}} orchestra, {{influenced}} by the poem In summertime on Bredon by A. E. Housman, was commissioned by the BBC to reinforce the notion of national music <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years.</b> Bredon Hill was the most-publicised new work commissioned by the BBC for the war effort, and {{in the autumn of}} 1941 it was broadcast to Africa, North America, and the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Minnesota, Rocco began playing {{professional}} baseball in 1935, and {{played in the}} minor leagues for the next eight years. In June 1943, he was promoted to the Cleveland Indians, and served as the team's everyday first baseman <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years.</b> After the war ended, Rocco played one more season with the Indians in 1946, then returned to the minor leagues. There, he played primarily in the Pacific Coast League (PCL) until 1952, retiring after attempting to play amateur baseball in Minnesota and being ruled ineligible.|$|E
5|$|Cookie {{cutting and}} decorating reached its {{cultural}} zenith during the boomer years with Christmas cookie cutouts of reindeer, trees, stars, and bells providing sustenance {{for kids and}} dads. Moms packed their favorite home baked cookies into Tupperware containers and carried them to cookie swap parties with friends and neighbors. Red plastic cutters replaced tin cutters <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> when metal was scarce {{and can be found}} today at garage sales and flea markets.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{the war had}} a {{significantly}} {{negative impact on the}} Australia economy. Real aggregate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined by 9.5 per cent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a 6 per cent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years,</b> it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, falling by 16 per cent.|$|E
5|$|Quackenbush {{was born}} on March 2, 1922, in Toronto, Ontario. He was born Hubert George Quackenbush but was given the {{nickname}} Bill by his aunt who disliked his given name. He played hockey on outdoor rinks around Toronto during the Great Depression as a youth, {{and was one of}} the top high school athletes in Canada as a teenager. In addition to hockey, he was a renowned football and soccer player. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>Years,</b> he played for the famous Canadian soccer club Toronto Scottish. Quackenbush had an opportunity to play football professionally, but he decided to pursue a career in hockey.|$|E
5|$|The defunct Loma Verde Mine, {{which is}} still visible in the RMD, {{produced}} {{a small amount of}} copper and gold between 1897 and 1907. Mining of igneous rock at 149 sites in the TMD sometimes produced ores of modest value in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The most successful, the Copper King Mine (later renamed the Mile Wide Mine), yielded 34,000 tons of copper, gold, lead, zinc, and molybdenum ores, mostly <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> of 1917, 1918, and 1941; it closed permanently in 1942 when it became unprofitable.|$|E

5|$|While {{technically}} minded shortwave listening hobbyists dwindled <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> {{due in part}} to {{the demands}} of military service, casual listeners seeking war news from foreign broadcasters increased. Shortwave receiver manufacturers contributed to war production. Zenith launched the multi-band Trans-Oceanic series of radios in 1942. In some other countries, during the war, listening to foreign stations was a criminal offense. Established in 1939, 35-kilowatt Chinese shortwave station XGOY broadcast programming aimed at listening-restricted Japan. The station was often bombed by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Demand for {{grinding}} {{machinery and}} specialist {{knowledge in the}} heat treatment of metals and other areas the company had developed was so high {{during the years of}} World War I that the government ordered other British manufacturers to produce Churchill designs. One specialist area was heat-treated blades used to cut the cables of sea mines. In April 1916 an increase in share capital to expand the factory further was authorised. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> the company was misled by a trade union such that it paid its male fitters, who were supervising female war workers, an increased wage of 48 shillings per week. The union told the company it was the rate paid for similar work at Armstrong Whitworth, when it was not.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{distributed}} element filters {{began in}} the years before World WarII. A major paper on the subject was published by Mason and Sykes in 1937. Mason had filed a patent much earlier, in 1927, and that patent may contain the first published design which moves away from a lumped element analysis. Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires â€“ the planar technologies were not yet in use. Much development was carried out <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> driven by the filtering needs of radar and electronic counter-measures. A good deal of this was at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved.|$|E

5|$|Due to his {{casualty}} {{studies on}} mustard gas from an accident {{during the war}} in Italy, Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of mustard gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> was the basis {{for the development of the}} field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} was halted <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> afterward, although the Tenth Mountain Division, which trained at nearby Camp Hale, came to appreciate Aspen and its skiing. Many {{of them came}} back to Aspen after the war, helping to expand and staff the ski resort. Coincidentally, Walter Paepcke, head of the Container Corporation of America, visited Aspen with his wife Elizabeth in the late 1940s, and found it an ideal place to establish a music festival they were planning. He invested heavily in the city's redevelopment, and people began coming to Aspen again to live, work and play. While the Rio Grande's trains still ran, many new visitors and arrivals preferred to drive.|$|E
5|$|In February 1919, {{with the}} war over, the C {{submitted}} a new bill that included provisions for an extension of time for the tunnel enlargement works approved {{in the act of}} 1913. The resulting act was passed on 19 August 1919 as the City and South London Railway Act, 1919. In 1920, under special wartime provisions, the LER was granted an extension of time to carry out the works for its own 1913 act. Although the permissions to carry out the works had been renewed, the Underground companies were {{not in a position to}} raise the funds needed to pay for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> and the returns produced by the companies could not cover the cost of repaying borrowed capital.|$|E

5|$|No {{immediate}} {{effort was}} made to start the works and they were postponed indefinitely when World War I started. With wartime restrictions in place, construction work for the railway was prevented. Yearly extensions to the earlier E acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922, giving a final date by which compulsory purchases had to be made of 7 August 1924. Although the permissions had been maintained, the UERL could not raise the money needed for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> and the returns produced by the company could not cover the cost of repaying loans.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, Bessie left her union post and joined G Division of the Liverpool Ambulance Service, as a driver. Initially her main job was to train other drivers, mostly young women. She became a section leader and then a deputy leader of G Division, an administrative post that should have kept her at headquarters. However, she records that she drove her ambulance through all the 68 major air raids that struck Liverpool <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years.</b> It was dangerous work; on a single day, 3May 1941, 14 drivers lost their lives. Bessie remained with the ambulance service almost {{until the end of}} the war in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Prescribed 90 {{medications}} <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> by {{his personal}} physician, Theodor Morell, Hitler took many pills {{each day for}} chronic stomach problems and other ailments. He regularly consumed amphetamine, barbiturates, opiates, and cocaine, as well as potassium bromide and atropa belladonna (the latter {{in the form of}} Doktor Koster's Antigaspills). He suffered ruptured eardrums {{as a result of the}} 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944, and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs. Newsreel footage of Hitler shows tremors in his left hand and a shuffling walk, which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life. Ernst-GÃ¼nther Schenck and several other doctors who met Hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.|$|E

5|$|After he {{left the}} military, Barrowclough {{returned}} to his legal career. His law firm had suffered <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> through a lack of manpower and the rebuilding of his practice occupied much of his time. In 1953, he moved to Wellington to take up an appointment as Chief Justice of New Zealand. The following year, he received an honorary doctorate in law from Otago. He also {{became a member of}} the Privy Council, was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to New Zealand in 1954. While Chief Justice, he established the permanent Court of Appeal for New Zealand. After his retirement in January 1966 Barrowclough returned to Auckland where he died on 4 March 1972 at the age of 77. He was survived by three children. His wife, Mary, who he had married in 1921, predeceased him in 1964.|$|E
5|$|After the {{breakdown}} of the Bohemian Revolt the residents of Silesia, including the Polish gentry in Upper Silesia, were subjected to severe repressions and Counter-Reformational activities, including forced expulsions of thousands of Silesians, many of whom ended up in Poland. Later <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> the province was repeatedly ravaged in the course of military campaigns crossing its territory, and at one point a Protestant leader, Piast Duke John Christian of Brieg, appealed to WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw IV Vasa for assuming supremacy over Silesia. King WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw, although a tolerant ruler including in matters of religion, was like his father disinclined to involve the Commonwealth in the Thirty Years' War. He ended up getting as fiefs from the Emperor the duchies of Opole and RacibÃ³rz in 1646, twenty years later reclaimed by the Empire. The Peace of Westphalia allowed the Habsburgs to do as they pleased in Silesia, already completely ruined by the war, which had resulted in intense persecution of Protestants, including the Polish Lower Silesia communities, forced to emigrate or subjected to Germanization.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in the trade union movement was an inevitable corollary of this and <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>years</b> there was a considerable {{increase in}} {{the membership of the}} various unions. Despite the considerable rises in the costs of many basic items, the government sought to maintain wages largely as they were. Although the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8â€“12 per cent, it was not enough to keep up with inflation and as a result there was considerable discontent amongst workers, to the extent that industrial action followed. Not all of these disputes were due to economic factors, and indeed in some part they were the result of violent opposition to the issue of conscription, which many trade unionists were opposed to. Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and {{it has been estimated that}} between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days lost and Â£4,785,607 in lost wages.|$|E
50|$|This club {{records that}} it was instituted in 1808 at the Angel Inn and the first President was D. Campbell of Skerrington.
