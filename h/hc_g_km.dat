40|$|China's new "Twelfth Five-Year Plan" set {{a target}} for total NO x {{emission}} reduction of 10 % {{for the period of}} 2011 – 2015. Heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) have been considered a major contributor to NO x emissions in China. Beijing initiated a comprehensive vehicle test program in 2008. This program included a sub-task for measuring on-road emission profiles of hundreds of HDDVs using portable emission measurement systems (PEMS). The major finding is that neither the on-road distance-specific (<b>g</b> <b>km</b> − 1) nor brake-specific (g kWh − 1) NO x emission factors for diesel buses and heavy-duty diesel trucks improved in most cases as emission standards became more stringent. For example, the average NO x emission factors for Euro II, Euro III and Euro IV buses are 11. 3 ± 3. 3 <b>g</b> <b>km</b> − 1, 12. 5 ± 1. 3 <b>g</b> <b>km</b> − 1, and 11. 8 ± 2. 0 <b>g</b> <b>km</b> − 1, respectively. No statistically significant difference in NO x emission factors was observed between Euro II and III buses. Even for Euro IV buses equipped with SCR systems, the NO x emission factors are similar to Euro III buses. The data regarding real-time engine performance of Euro IV buses suggest the engine certification cycles did not reflect their real-world operating conditions. These new on-road test results indicate that previous estimates of total NO x emissions for HDDV fleet may be significantly underestimated. The new estimate in total NO x emissions for the Beijing HDDV fleet in 2009 is 37. 0 Gg, an increase of 45 % compared to the previous study. Further, we estimate that the total NO x emissions for the national HDDV fleet in 2009 are approximately 4. 0 Tg, higher by 1. 0 Tg (equivalent to 18 % of total NO x emissions for vehicle fleet in 2009) than that estimated in the official report. This would also result in 4 % increase in estimation of national anthropogenic NO x emissions. More effective control measures (such as promotion of CNG buses and a new in-use compliance testing program) are urged to secure the goal of total NO x mitigation for the HDDV fleet in the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the Emission Factors (EF) of methane (CH 4) and Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) emitted from vehicle exhaust {{is the study of}} {{greenhouse}} gases that are crucial to climate change. These gases are part of a fuel known as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or as Natural Gas for Vehicles (NGV) in Thailand. This fuel is used as an alternative to oil, which has decreased the amount of gasoline and diesel oil used in the transportation sector of Thailand. This study used different types of cars that were tested on a chassis dynamometer with a Bangkok driving cycle to measure the emissions of CH 4 and CO 2 and then to calculate the averages of EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2, which are associated with speed and fuel consumption, respectively. This study was conducted in 3 vehicle types that are actually used in Thailand, namely, Heavy Duty Diesel Vehicles (HDDV), Light Duty Diesel Vehicles (LDDV) and Light Duty Gasoline Vehicles (LDGV). Our results showed that of the three vehicle types, HDDV produced the highest EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2 averages at 7. 22 and 919. 6 <b>g</b> <b>km</b> - 1, respectively. LDDV produced the lowest EF-CH 4 (0. 17 <b>g</b> <b>km</b> - 1) and LDGV produced the lowest EF-CO 2 (153. 8 <b>g</b> <b>km</b> - 1). In addition, the EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2 values of LDDV and LDGV were comparable even though the engine types of these vehicles were different. With respect to fuel consumption, the EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2 of HDDV indicated a higher fuel consumption, which differed from those of LDDV and LDGV. Nevertheless, LDGV or taxis, which account for {{a large portion of the}} transportation sector in Thailand, emitted higher proportions of CH 4 and CO 2 than the other vehicle types, as shown by the CH 4 :CO 2 ratio. Therefore, according to the results, the EF-CH 4 and EF-CO 2 values can be applied for the effective evaluation of CH 4 and CO 2 emissions from vehicles in Thailand...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of uranium and thorium in ten partly nested streams in the boreal forest region were monitored over a two-year period. Considerable spatiotemporal variations were observed, {{with little or}} no correlation between streams. The export of both uranium and thorium varied substantially between the subcatchments, ranging from 1. 7 to 30 <b>g</b> <b>km</b> − 2 a − 1 for uranium and from 3. 2 to 24 <b>g</b> <b>km</b> − 2 a − 1 for thorium. Airborne gamma spectrometry was used to measure the {{concentrations of}} uranium and thorium in surface soils throughout the catchment, but could not explain the variability in the export. Instead, the extent of lakes and mires within each subcatchment was found to be a stronger predictor for the transport of uranium and thorium. The results indicate that there is a predictable and systematic accumulation of both uranium and thorium in boreal mires. Approximately 65 – 80 % of uranium and 55 – 65 % of thorium entering a mire is estimated to be retained in the peat. Overall, accumulation in mires and other types of wetlands is estimated to decrease the fluxes of uranium and thorium from the boreal forest landscape by 30 – 40 %. The atmospheric deposition of uranium and thorium was also quantified and its contribution to boreal streams was found to be low compared to weathering...|$|R

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the seasonal and spatial variability of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) {{and its influence}} on {{the composition of the}} organic matter deposited on the bottom sediments of Mejillones Bay. The obtained results indicate that the upper limit of the OMZ fluctuated during the year between 20 and 45 m depth. In summer, this limit ranged from 20 to 35 m depth, whereas in winter it ranged from to 40 to 55 m depth. According to a Rock-Eval analysis, the organic matter present in the deepest sediments (100 m) is better preserved than the shalow material (35 m). This analysis revealed that the sediment deposited in the bay is marine phytoplanktonic in origin (Type II) and immature. The ratio of total sulfur to total organic carbon ranges from 0. 8 to 3. 9 % at station A (35 m) and from 5. 7 to 10. 3 % at the deeper stations (70 and 100 m). The C:N ratio in the sediments varies between cold and warm periods, with respective averages of 9. 13 and 7. 74 and a wintertime peak of 11 %.

40|$|In recent years, machine {{learning}} (ML) {{has been more}} and more used to solve complex tasks in different disciplines, ranging from Data Mining to Information Retrieval (IR) or Natural Language Processing (NLP). These tasks often require the processing of structured input. For example, NLP applications critically deal with syntactic and seman-tic structures. Modeling the latter in terms of feature vec-tors for ML algorithms requires large expertise, intuition and deep knowledge about the target linguistic phenomenon. Kernel Methods (KMs) are powerful ML techniques (see e. g., [5]), which can alleviate the data representation problem as they substitute scalar product between feature vectors with similarity functions (kernels) directly defined between training/test instances, e. g., syntactic trees, (thus features are not needed anymore). Additionally, kernel engineering, i. e., the composition or adaptation of several prototype ker-nels, facilitates {{the design of the}} similarity functions required for new tasks, e. <b>g.,</b> [1, 2]. <b>KMs</b> can be very valuable for IR research, e. <b>g.,</b> <b>KMs</b> allow us to easily exploit syntac-tic/semantic structures, e. g., dependency, constituency or shallow semantic structures, in learning to rank algorithms [3, 4].

Animals were submitted to cavalcade along 4 <b>km</b> (<b>G</b> 4), 8 <b>km</b> (<b>G</b> 8), and 20 <b>km</b> (<b>G</b> 20) at mean speeds of 15 km h- 1, 12 km h- 1, and 12 km h- 1, respectively. From each horse, venous blood samples were collected before exercise (T 0) and immediately after (T 1) cavalcade. Bicarbonate ion (HCO 3 -), pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2), partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2), base excess (BE), hematocrit (Hct), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-) and lactate were determined. The variables pH, pO 2 and pCO 2 were corrected in function of rectal temperature of each animal. Blood samples were analyzed for acid-base balance, as well as biochemical and electrolyte parameters using an i-STAT analyzer. Significant (P< 0. 05) increase in Hct, Na+, pH, HCO 3 - and BE were observed after cavalcade in G 20 group. Decrease (P< 0. 05) in K+ and Cl- were also observed in G 20 animals after cavalcade (T 1). Changes in the acid-base balance and hydroelectrolytic profile of the Mangalarga Marchador after cavalcade of 20 km resulted in hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.
