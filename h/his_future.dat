5|$|Beginning {{near the}} end of the 2006 season, word began to surface that Favre was {{considering}} retirement. In fact, playing in Soldier Field against the arch-rival Bears in the season finale, Favre was given a standing ovation in the closing seconds of the Packer victory as a show of respect from Chicago fans to their longtime nemesis.

However, after much debate, he returned for the 2007 season, during which <b>his</b> <b>future</b> was once again in doubt and an oft-discussed topic, with many in the media speculating that if the Packers made the Super Bowl, Favre would indeed retire and hand the reins to the unproven but talented Aaron Rodgers, who was drafted two years earlier as Favre's heir-apparent.

40|$|When a {{spot market}} {{monopolist}} {{participates in the}} futures market, he has an incentive to adjust spot prices to make <b>his</b> <b>futures</b> market position more pro 8 ̆ 5 table. Rational futures market makers take this into account when they set prices. Spot market power thus creates a moral hazard problem which parallels the adverse selection problem in models with inside information. This moral hazard not only reduces the optimal amount of hedging for those with and without market power, but also makes complete hedging impossible. When market makers cannot distinguish orders placed by those with and without market power, market power provides a venue for strategic trading and market manipulation. The monopolist will strategically randomize <b>his</b> <b>futures</b> market position and then use his market power to make this position pro 8 ̆ 5 table. Furthermore, traders without market power can manipulate futures prices by hiding their orders behind the monopolists strategic trades. ...|$|R
