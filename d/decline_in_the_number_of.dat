5|$|By 1959, {{the pattern}} of {{commuter}} services at Herne Hill had taken the shape it held into the 21st century: all-stops trains from Victoria to Orpington and from the City of London to Wimbledon and Sutton (but, unlike the modern Sutton Loop, via West Croydon). However, there was a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> electric trains on the Chatham Main Line through Herne Hill {{in the years after}} the war. Immediately after electrification in 1925, six trains used the route between Herne Hill and Shortlands in each direction during every off-peak hour. By 1960, it had dropped to two trains in each direction.|$|E
5|$|Eastbourne’s {{reputation}} for health, enhanced by bracing air and sea breezes {{contributed to the}} establishment of many independent schools in the 19th century and in 1871, the year which saw the arrival of Queenwood Ladies College, the town was just beginning a period of growth and prosperity. By 1896, Gowland’s Eastbourne Directory listed 76private schools for boys and girls. However, economic difficulties during the inter-war years saw a gradual <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> independent schools.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth in}} Commercial Air Transport (CAT) has eroded the {{operational}} freedom of GA, {{both in the}} air and on the ground at larger airports. Difficulty with access to larger airports is compounded by a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> aerodromes generally, and existing sites are often threatened with closure and re-development for more profitable uses. The UK planning system is designed to focus on local issues, and consideration of the national impact of GA operations is not within its remit. This makes aerodrome development difficult, often subjecting those that successfully negotiate the process to restrictions in use.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> {{seen from}} 2006 till 2009 / 2010 {{for most of}} the {{categories}} may probably reflect the staffing and enrolment status of the university as a whole.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{last few}} decades, a rapid <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of wild {{mountain}} bongo has occurred due to poaching and human pressure on their habitat, with local extinctions reported in Cherangani and Chepalungu hills, Kenya.|$|R
5|$|Traditionally {{courses in}} Piano Tuning and Piano Technology were also {{available}} at the college. However, these were significantly reduced in the late 2000s because of a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> students studying the subjects. There {{has also been a}} {{reduction in the number of}} A-levels available for study owing to changes in the types of courses that education funding bodies supporting students at RNC are willing to pay for.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace. Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> wars, genocides, and human rights abuses {{since the end of the}} Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 260 {{species of birds}} have been recorded, with raptors such as the bald eagle, golden eagle, {{peregrine}} falcon, osprey and several species of hawks residing year round. The harlequin duck is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes and waterways. The great blue heron, tundra swan, Canada goose and American wigeon are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park. Great horned owl, Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, pileated woodpecker and cedar waxwing reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and in the higher altitudes, the ptarmigan, timberline sparrow and rosy finch {{are the most likely}} to be seen. The Clark's nutcracker is less plentiful than in past years due to the <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> whitebark pines.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, {{there were}} 53,448 divorces, in which 33% {{for less than}} 5 years of {{marriage}} and 20.8% for 5-9 years of marriage. The figure represents a 17.1% <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> when divorce rate peaked in 2006.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1970s {{a program}} of {{normalization}} and deinstutionalisation and has seen a steady <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> centre.

50|$|Upper Wharfedale {{has been}} {{traditionally}} associated with farming, {{but there has}} been a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> and types of employment. Whilst there were <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of people <b>in</b> this industry, farming accounted directly for 9.16% of employment in 2001 but this had increased to 11.27% by 2011.|$|R
5|$|From 1972 to 2006, {{dramatic}} reductions {{continued in}} the number of feral honey bees in the U.S. and a significant though somewhat gradual <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> colonies maintained by beekeepers. This decline includes the cumulative losses from all factors, such as urbanization, pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and commercial beekeepers' retiring and going out of business. However, in late 2006 and early 2007, the rate of attrition was alleged to have reached new proportions, and people began to use the term colony collapse disorder to describe this sudden rash of disappearances (or sometimes spontaneous hive collapse or the Mary Celeste syndrome in the United Kingdom).|$|E
5|$|In 1961, type 1 and 2 {{monovalent}} oral poliovirus vaccine (MOPV) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed. In 1963, trivalent OPV (TOPV) was licensed, {{and became}} the vaccine of choice in the United States and most other countries of the world, largely replacing the inactivated polio vaccine. A second wave of mass immunizations led to a further dramatic <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> polio cases. Between 1962 and 1965 about 100 million Americans (roughly 56% of the population at that time) received the Sabin vaccine. The result was a substantial {{reduction in the number}} of poliomyelitis cases, even from the much reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk vaccine.|$|E
5|$|It is {{speculated that}} cowrie shells {{may have been}} the {{principal}} currency at Gedi. Cowrie shells have been recovered in the store rooms of the houses and found in greater abundance than struck coins, represented by only two coins of Chinese origin. The use of cowries as currency is supported by their historical use as tender in various parts of Africa, and Kirkman estimated the exchange rate of cowrie shells to the gold dinar to be 400,000 to 1. However, there are examples of locally struck coins at contemporary sites, but none have been recovered at Gedi. The use of beads as a currency has also been proposed by J. F. Schofield, who claims that a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> beads recovered in the upper stratigraphic layers reflects a decline in their value around the fifteenth century.|$|E

2500|$|<b>In</b> New Zealand, <b>the</b> Tasman Bay {{area was}} closed to {{commercial}} scallop harvesting from 2009 to 2011 due to a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers.</b> <b>In</b> 2011, industry-funded research was conducted into scallop-harvesting patterns. Forest and Bird list scallops as [...] "Worst Choice" [...] in their Best Fish Guide for sustainable seafood species.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of native fish species, which includes: bull trout, westslope {{cutthroat}} trout, northern whitefish, and northern pikeminnow. Non-native species includes: yellowstone cutthroat trout, brook trout, rainbow trout, brown trout, lake trout, lake whitefish, black bullhead, kokanee salmon, yellow perch, northern pike, largemouth bass, and smallmouth bass.|$|R
5|$|The Knox and Kane Railroad {{was forced}} to suspend {{operations}} in October 2004 after a 75percent <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> passengers, possibly {{brought about by the}} collapse of the Kinzua Bridge. The Kovalchick Corporation bought the Knox and Kane's tracks and all other property owned by the railroad, including the locomotives and rolling stock. The Kovalchick Corporation also owns the East Broad Top Railroad and was the company that owned the Kinzua Bridge before selling it to the state in 1963. The company disclosed plans in 2008 to remove the tracks and sell them for scrap. The right-of-way would then be used to establish a rail trail.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Bastille as {{a prison}} changed {{considerably}} during the reigns of Louis XV and XVI. One trend was a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> prisoners sent to the Bastille, with only 1,194 imprisoned there {{during the reign of}} Louis XV and only 306 under Louis XVI up until the Revolution, annual averages of around 23 and 20 respectively. A second trend was a slow shift away from the Bastille's 17th-century role of detaining primarily upper-class prisoners, towards {{a situation in which the}} Bastille was essentially a location for imprisoning socially undesirable individuals of all backgrounds – including aristocrats breaking social conventions, criminals, pornographers, thugs – and was used to support police operations, particularly those involving censorship, across Paris. Despite these changes, the Bastille remained a state prison, subject to special authorities, answering to the monarch of the day and surrounded by a considerable and threatening reputation.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The {{main causes of death}} were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E
