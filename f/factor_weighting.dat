The basic steps involve the preparation of digitised data sets, derivation and classification of ecological, social and economic factor maps, elicitation of <b>factor</b> <b>weights</b> among stakeholders {{of the study area}} and encoding the <b>factor</b> <b>weights</b> into the <b>factor</b> maps, and overlaying and computing the factor maps to generate the decision/priority maps for upland development in accordance with the study model. The key aspect of the study is the investigation of the impact of <b>factor</b> <b>weights</b> being assigned by different stakeholder groups as a departure from the usual practice where experts assign the <b>factor</b> <b>weights.</b> <b>Factor</b> <b>weights</b> produce the numerical scale of judgement in order to quantify and use mathematical operations to produce objective decisions using GIS. In a GIS-assisted DSS, <b>factor</b> <b>weights</b> link the human dimension of decisions with the physical site attributes. Results of the study reveal, that the statistical test on priority rating of selection criteria by different stakeholder groups yielded a generally significantly different responses and that the resulting <b>factor</b> <b>weights</b> when encoded and overlaid in GIS produced variations on the extent and location of selected priority sites. The study shows the potential use of the consensus or multi-sectoral approach to <b>factor</b> <b>weight</b> assignment as a key towards generating multi-sectoral involvement in ensuring success of upland development projects.

This model supports the decision making by providing <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> covering dredging cost, and social and environmental impacts. This model requires various input data which are dredging points, dredging machines, dewatering machines, disposal sites. Furthermore, for the model development, the researcher applied imaginary dredging project area for model assessment and analysis. We used a total of 5 cases of <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination. It can classify <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination in 2 categories. The first category is <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination for single-objective optimization and another category is <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination for multi-objective optimization. The single-objective optimization is same that one <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> is 1. 0 and other <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> is 0. 0. The multi-objective optimization is used equality <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination or <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> from previous study. According to model simulation, it shows that cost of dredging is different approximately 18 % due to <b>weight</b> <b>factors.</b> Besides, the maximum cost is obtained when <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> of social impact is 1. 0. In contrast, minimum cost of dredging projects is discovered when <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> of cost is 1. 0.

In particular, given the first d principal components (PCs) {{and as the}} radius ε of the ball tends to zero, the SmBP is asymptotically proportional to (a) the joint density of the first d PCs, (b) {{the volume of the}} d-dimensional ball with radius ε, and (c) a correction <b>factor</b> <b>weighting</b> the use of a truncated version of the process expansion. Moreover, under suitable assumptions on the spectrum of the covariance operator of X and as d diverges to infinity when ε vanishes, some simplifications occur. In particular, the SmBP factorizes asymptotically as the product of the joint density of the first d PCs and a pure volume parameter. All the provided factorizations allow to define a surrogate intensity of the SmBP that, in some cases, leads to a genuine intensity. To operationalize the stated results, a non-parametric estimator for the surrogate intensity is introduced and it is proved that the use of estimated PCs, instead of the true ones, does not affect the rate of convergence. Finally, as an illustration, simulations in controlled frameworks are provided. Comment: 27 pages, 1 figure, 2 table...|$|E

This study presents a method of selecting sites for the safe application of animal waste as fertiliser to agricultural land. A site suitability map for the Westbrook subcatchment within the MDB was created using a geographic information system (GIS) -based weighted linear combination (WLC) model. The factors affecting the suitability of a site for animal waste application were selected, and digital data sets derived from up to 1 : 50, 000 scale maps were acquired. After initial preprocessing, digital data sets were clipped {{to the size of}} the delineated subcatchment boundary producing input factors. These input factors were weighted using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) that employed an objectives-oriented comparison (OOC) technique to formulate the pairwise comparison matrix.

40|$|In {{a variety}} of three-dimensional, multi-particle systems, {{interactions}} of tensorial form occur between individual components and an applied stimulus that operates uniformly throughout the ensemble. When each material component has an identical, fixed orientation, its own response is replicated in the observed form of behaviour by {{the system as a}} whole, with respect to the angular disposition of the stimulus. The same complete correlation between microscopic and macroscopic response does not, however, operate in other systems where there is a degree of orientational freedom amongst the microscopic components. One limiting case is where the extent of such freedom allows random orientations, such conditions delivering a system that is macroscopically isotropic. When each particle has incomplete orientational freedom, the formulation is in general less mathematically tractable; here, the theory required to describe ensemble response yields analytically solvable equations only in cases where the distribution function takes a relatively simple form, such as a scalar product, and few explicit results are available. This paper addresses general systems in which there is an orientation-dependent complex exponential <b>factor,</b> <b>weighting</b> the response of each component.

It consists of several variables collected from various data sources and available at different temporal and spatial scales, which are aggregated into some thematic indicators. The FWM approach was applied separately for each case study to the single variables transformed into sensitivity indicators through standard procedures. A multiway factor analysis (MDA) was carried out to explore over time the relationships among indicators. The importance of the environmental indicators was estimated by attributing a percent weight to each of them according to MDA outputs. Climate and soil dimensions account for the highest weights in all the cases considered. These findings are in accordance with the results obtained in previous studies.

In a planning cycle, highway agency divisions face many diverse candidates for maintenance and improvements, origi-nating from public demand, accident data, engineering judgment, and local offi-cials.

As a result, several researches worldwide have focused on assessing the vulnerability of diverse aquifer systems {{and can be found}} elsewhere (e.g., Prasad et al. 2011; Jayasekera et al. 2011; Kaliraj et al. 2014; Akpan et al. 2015; Kumar et al. 2015). However, results may differ significantly depending on the method applied and the study area. Therefore, the selection of the appropriate method chiefly depends on the specific site characteristics and availability of the required data. Conversely, very limited efforts have been generally made to support aquifer vulnerability studies using spatial predictive models, with the majority of these contributions focussed on <b>factor</b> <b>weighting</b> (Burkart et al. 1999; Nolan 2002; Worrall et al. 2002; Masetti et al. 2007; Mair and El-Kadi 2013; Nohegar and Riahi 2014; Pacheco et al. 2015). In this research, the reference model has been generated by adopting the protective cover–infiltration conditions (hereafter PI) method as its comprehensive application takes into account a broad spectrum of intrinsic causative factors (Goldscheider 2005). This result has been subsequently compared to a statistically derived model whose predictor space has been built to primarily represent superficial properties. The two different methodological approaches of index-overlay and statistical methods are combined and validate the final assessment of aquifer vulnerability.|$|E
40|$|Following the {{principles}} of Grinold (1989, 1994), an active investment manager’s objective can be largely characterized as maximizing the Information Ratio (IR) or value added of their portfolio. Almost always this must be achieved {{in the presence of}} various portfolio constraints, such as no short selling. Faced with multiple information sources, an investment manger can employ linear factor models to generate return forecasts for the set of securities in their investment universe. A typical problem that they face is that of selecting an optimal weighting scheme for these factors that will provide a forecast for any given security. In making their choice investment managers {{need to be aware of}} the well known fact that choosing factor weights to maximize a factor model’s forecasting ability is not the same as selecting weights so that a portfolio’s Information Ratio (IR) is maximized. For instance, it has been demonstrated that least squares regression of linear factor models will not generally lead to estimators that maximize unconditional Sharpe Ratios (Sentana, 2005). The primary objective of this paper is to derive dynamic <b>factor</b> <b>weighting</b> schemes that generate optimal valued added portfolios under various portfolio constraints. In addition to choosing the factor weights so that they maximize IR, we want to incorporate uncertainty in the return forecasts so that our optimal portfolios account for estimation risk. The importance of this consideration has been demonstrated by several authors including Jobson and Korkie (1981), Frost and Savarino (1986), Best and Grauer (1991) and Black and Litterman (1992). They show how portfolio selection based on maximum likelihood estimation of the mean and variance of returns can yield extreme long and short positions. By reducing estimation error, incorporating estimation risk in a Bayesian setting can assist in improving these strategies. Recent advances in this are...|$|E

The empirical section of the study addresses the issue of apportionment formula fairness. Five research questions are investigated [...] {{using a variety of}} multiple regression and descriptive statistics techniques [...] by observing the reported values of income, receipts, property, and payroll for 252 large corporations, operating in widely diverse industries, for the period 1977 through 1981. The study reports the following results: (1) The standard UDITPA factors of property, payroll, and receipts, taken as a set, significantly reflect income-generating processes. The explanatory power of each individual factor is highly significant, but the multicollinearity among the factors results in considerable redundancy when the factors are viewed simultaneously. (2) These factors are very stable over time. (3) The relative importance of these factors is disparate. An optimal weighting of the factors, based on the multiple regression results, would assign approximately equal weight to the property and receipts factors and a negative weighting to the payroll factor. (4) The factors, although stable over time, are not stable across industries. The income functions of different industries vary considerably, both in terms of factor dependency and <b>factor</b> <b>weighting.</b> (5) Of the eleven practical alternative apportionment formulas tested, the most appropriate, in terms of the least degree of misapportionment, varied from industry to industry.
