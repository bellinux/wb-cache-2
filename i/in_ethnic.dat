40|$|To {{assess the}} {{breast-feeding}} condition based on economic status among primary school children and comparison between Turkman and non-Turkman <b>ethnic</b> groups <b>in</b> northern Iran in 2010. This was a descriptive, cross-sectional and retrospective research study, {{carried out on}} 6882 primary school children (4157 = non-Turkman and 2725 = Turkman) from 112 school of urban and villages {{in the north of}} Iran. The schools and students were chosen by multistage sampling (cluster and random sampling). Breastfeeding was categorized based on World Health Organization classification. Breast-feeding during the first 6 postpartum months and two postpartum years was found in 5. 8 and 57. 1 % of children. Breast-feeding during the two postpartum years was significantly 12. 5 % more <b>in</b> Turkman <b>ethnic</b> group than non-Turkman ethnic group (P = 0. 001) but breast-feeding only for the first 6 postpartum months was 1. 9 % <b>in</b> Turkman <b>ethnic</b> group less than <b>in</b> non-Turkman <b>ethnic</b> group (P = 0. 002). There was a negative significant association between economic status and breast-feeding during the two postpartum years <b>in</b> both <b>ethnic</b> groups (P = 0. 001) and there was more breast feeding in the first 6 postpartum months <b>in</b> Turkman <b>ethnic</b> group. Breast-feeding rate <b>in</b> Turkman <b>ethnic</b> group is more common than non-Turkman ethnic group. There is an inverse relationship between economic status and breast-feeding duration with a considerable trend <b>in</b> Turkman <b>ethnic</b> group...|$|R
5|$|The Act of February 16 {{proclaimed the}} {{re-establishment}} (atstatyti) of the Lithuanian state, {{making it the}} successor to the Lithuanian historical state, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In this respect the Council deviated from the resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference which called for establishment (sudaryti) of a Lithuanian state. However, it was {{made clear that the}} new state would be quite different from the old Duchy: it was to be organized only <b>in</b> <b>ethnic</b> Lithuanian lands (except for the Vilnius region which was majority Polish) and was to be governed by democratic principles, as opposed to the multi-ethnic Duchy that had been ruled by aristocracy. The termination of the ties binding Lithuania to other states was addressed to Germany, Russia, and Poland, all of which had their own plans for the country. Even though not addressed directly, the Act renounced any attempt to resurrect the former Polish-Lithuanian union.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Measure {{of liver}} enzymes {{may help to}} {{increase}} safety of blood donation for both blood donor and recipient. Determination of liver enzymes may prepare valuable clinical information. Aim: To assess serum γ-Glutamyltransferase (GGT), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) activities in healthy blood donors <b>in</b> different <b>ethnic</b> groups <b>in</b> Gorgan. Materials and Methods: This study was performed in 450 healthy male blood donors, <b>in</b> three <b>ethnic</b> groups (Fars, Sistanee and Turkman) who attended Gorgan blood transfusion center. Liver enzymes (GGT, ALT and AST) were determined. Results: Serum AST and ALT <b>in</b> three <b>ethnic</b> groups were significant except for serum GGT levels. There was significant correlation between family histories of liver disease and systolic blood pressure and AST in Fars, and GGT <b>in</b> Sistanee <b>ethnic</b> groups. Conclusion: Several factors, such as age, family history of diabetes mellitus, family history of liver disease and smoking habit {{have no effect on}} some liver enzymes <b>in</b> different <b>ethnic</b> groups <b>in</b> this area. Variation of AST, ALT, and GGT enzyme activities in healthy subjects is associated with some subjects in our study groups. According to our study, it suggests that screening of AST and GGT enzymes in subjects with family history of liver disease is necessary <b>in</b> different <b>ethnic</b> groups. © 2016, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.
