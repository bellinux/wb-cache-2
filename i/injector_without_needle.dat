40|$|In {{the past}} fifty years, most design {{parameters}} of the combustion chamber of Liquid Rocket Engines (LREs) have been adjusted without a detailed understanding of combustion phenomena, because of both limited experimental diagnostics and numerical capabilities. The objective of the present thesis work is to conduct high-fidelity unsteady numerical simulations of transcritical reacting flows, {{in order to improve}} the understanding of flame dynamics in LRE, and eventually provide guidelines for their improvement. First real-gas thermodynamics and its impact on numerical schemes are presented. As Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) involves filtered equations, the filtering effects induced by real-gas thermodynamics are then highlighted in a typical 1 D transcritical configuration and a specific real-gas artificial dissipation is proposed to smooth transcritical density gradients in LES. Then, a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) study of turbulent mixing and combustion in the near-injector region of LREs is conducted. In the non-reacting case, vortex shedding {{in the wake of the}} lip of the injector is shown to play a major role in turbulent mixing, and induces the formation of finger-like structures as observed experimentally in similar operating conditions. In the reacting case, the flame is attached to the <b>injector</b> rim <b>without</b> local extinction and the finger-like structures disappear. The flame structure is analyzed and various combustion modes are identified. Finally, a LES study of a transcritical H 2 /O 2 jet flame, issuing from a coaxial <b>injector</b> with and <b>without</b> inner recess, is conducted. Numerical results are first validated against experimental data for the <b>injector</b> <b>without</b> recess. Then, the recessed configuration is compared to the reference solution and to experimental results, to scrutinize the effects of this design parameter on combustion efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: In western countries, {{acupuncture}} as {{therapy for}} pain, {{is commonly used}} in treatment of the chronic pain. However, several studies have pointed out its success in treatment of acute pain. It is shown that acupuncture works through simultaneous activation of several pain control mechanisms in CNS. Acupuncture point LI 4 (otherwise known as Hegu), {{is one of the}} most studied points in acupuncture treatment of pain. Its stimulation is indicated in almost all painful conditions, and its effectiveness is well proven. Algometry, used for pain assessment, has been widely recognized as reliable and objective method for measuring pressure pain threshold and tolerance. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore whether a single acupuncture treatment shows significant short-term analgesic effect on mechanical stimuli, and to determine the distribution of these effects across the body (whether localized, regional or generalized). Material and Methods: Study group included 14 healthy, pain-free students who have passed clinical examination for any possible painful conditions. Pressure pain detection threshold (PPDT) and pressure pain tolerance threshold (PPTT) were measured on 3 points across the body using algometry, before and after interventions. For intervention, all subjects have received deep needling of LI 4 acupuncture point, <b>without</b> <b>needle</b> manipulation, administered for duration of 20 minutes. Results: Statistically significant rise in PPDT and PPTT has been observed in each of 3 measured points, following the needling of LI 4 acupuncture point, <b>without</b> <b>needle</b> manipulation. There were no significant differences in mean change of PPDT and PPTT upon comparing changes between points. Conclusion: Even a single manual acupuncture point stimulation, can have significant short-term generalized analgesic effect, which is determined using mechanical stimuli to cause experimental pain...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Using 3 D image-guided {{adaptive}} brachytherapy for {{cervical cancer}} treatment, it often means that patients are transported and moved during the treatment procedure. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the intra-fractional longitudinal applicator shift in relation to the high risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) by comparing geometries at imaging and dose delivery for patients with and <b>without</b> <b>needles.</b> Material and methods : Measurements were performed in 33 patients (71 fractions), where 25 fractions were without and 46 were with interstitial needles. Gold markers were placed in the lower part of the cervix as a surrogate for HR-CTV, enabling distance measurements between HR-CTV and the ring applicator. Shifts of the applicator relative to the markers were determined using planning computed tomography (CT) images used for planning, and the radiographs obtained at dose delivery. Differences in the physical D 90 for HR-CTV due to applicator shifts were simulated individually in the treatment planning system to provide the relative dose variation. Results : The maximum distances of the applicator shifts, in relation to the markers, were 3. 6 mm (caudal), and – 2. 5 mm (cranial). There was a significant displacement of – 0. 7 mm (SD = 0. 9 mm) <b>without</b> <b>needles,</b> while with needles there was no significant shift. The relative dose variation showed a significant increase in D 90 HR-CTV of 1. 6 % (SD = 2. 6 %) when not using needles, and no significant dose variation was found when using needles. Conclusions : The results from this study showed that there was a small longitudinal displacement of the ring applicator and a significant difference in displacement between using interstitial needles or not...|$|R

50|$|Diesel {{engines in}} service today raise the fuel to extreme {{pressures}} by mechanical pumps and deliver {{it to the}} combustion chamber by pressure-activated <b>injectors</b> <b>without</b> compressed air. With direct injected diesels, injectors spray fuel through 4 to 12 small orifices in its nozzle.

In all major aspects, the modern diesel engine holds true to Rudolf Diesel's original design, that of igniting fuel by compression at an extremely high pressure within the cylinder.
