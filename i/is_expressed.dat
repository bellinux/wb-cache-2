5|$|Some 400 {{genes are}} {{shown to be}} brain-specific. In all neurons ELAVL3 <b>is</b> <b>expressed,</b> and in {{pyramidal}} neurons NRGN and REEP2 are also expressed. GAD1 essential for the biosynthesis of GABA <b>is</b> <b>expressed</b> in interneurons. Proteins expressed in glial cells are astrocyte markers GFAP, and S100B. Myelin basic protein and the transcription factor OLIG2 are expressed in oligodendrocytes.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{transcription}} factor, {{a protein}} that binds to specific DNA sites and thereby regulates {{the activity of}} specific genes, Tbr1 is localized in the nucleus where the cell’s DNA is located. Tbr1 <b>is</b> <b>expressed</b> in glutamergic neurons rather than GABAergic neurons.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests <b>is</b> <b>expressed</b> in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority. A concurrent majority is {{a system in which}} a minority group is permitted to exercise a sort of veto power over actions of a majority that are believed to infringe upon the minority's rights.|$|E

5|$|English {{does not}} have a morphologised future tense. Futurity of action <b>is</b> <b>expressed</b> periphrastically with one of the {{auxiliary}} verbs will or shall. Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb be going to.|$|E
5|$|Mutant Huntingtin <b>is</b> <b>expressed</b> {{throughout}} the body and associated with abnormalities in peripheral tissues that are directly caused by such expression outside the brain. These abnormalities include muscle atrophy, cardiac failure, impaired glucose tolerance, weight loss, osteoporosis, and testicular atrophy.|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene {{were linked}} to {{autosomal}} dominant (i.e. requiring only one abnormal copy) FH in a 2003 report. The gene {{is located on the}} first chromosome (1p34.1-p32) and encodes a 666 amino acid protein that <b>is</b> <b>expressed</b> in the liver. It has been suggested that PCSK9 causes FH mainly by reducing the number of LDL receptors on liver cells.|$|E

5|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{describe a}} single, personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God {{who is the}} creator of all things in the universe. The existence of God and the universe {{is thought to be}} eternal, without a beginning or end. Though inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that <b>is</b> <b>expressed</b> through messengers termed Manifestations of God.|$|E

50|$|When certain colors cannot <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> {{within a}} {{particular}} color model, those colors {{are said to be}} out of gamut. For example, while pure red can <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> in the RGB color space, it cannot <b>be</b> <b>expressed</b> in the CMYK color space; pure red is out of gamut in the CMYK color space.|$|R

5|$|The {{relation}} of two fields <b>is</b> <b>expressed</b> {{by the notion}} of a field extension. Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that angle trisection and squaring the circle can not be done with a compass and straightedge. Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.|$|E

5|$|Al-Maʿarri's {{fundamental}} pessimism <b>is</b> <b>expressed</b> in his anti-natalist {{recommendation that}} no {{children should be}} begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life. In an elegy composed by him {{over the loss of}} a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life: Even on al-Maʿarri's epitaph, he wanted it written that his life was a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself.|$|E

5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective {{serotonin}} {{receptor agonist}} {{on a wide variety}} of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor <b>is</b> <b>expressed</b> very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.|$|E
5|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, {{have been found}} to display a preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness <b>is</b> <b>expressed</b> in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.|$|E
5|$|Every year WSDOT {{conducts a}} series of surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume.

In 2009, WSDOT calculated that as few as 3,200cars traveled through the intersection at Keene Road, west of West Richland, and as many as 16,000cars at the eastern terminus.|$|E

The two genes were not transcribed in mycelia, suggesting that these two genes are fruiting body specific.|$|R
