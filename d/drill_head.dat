500|$|Thermal drills, which cut ice by {{electrically}} {{heating the}} <b>drill</b> <b>head,</b> {{can also be}} used, but they have some disadvantages. [...] Some have been designed for working in cold ice; they have high power consumption and the heat they produce can degrade {{the quality of the}} retrieved ice core. [...] Early thermal drills, designed for use without drilling fluid, were limited in depth as a result; later versions were modified to work in fluid-filled holes but this slowed down trip times, and these drills retained the problems of the earlier models. [...] In addition, thermal drills are typically bulky and can be impractical to use in areas where there are logistical difficulties. [...] More recent modifications include the use of antifreeze, which eliminates the need for heating the drill assembly and hence reduces the power needs of the drill. Hot-water drills use jets of hot water at the <b>drill</b> <b>head</b> to melt the water around the core. The drawbacks are {{that it is difficult to}} accurately control the dimensions of the borehole, the core cannot easily be kept sterile, and the heat may cause thermal shock to the core.|$|E

Instead of drilling all the way into the water, they said they would stop just above it when a sensor on the thermal drill detected free water. At that point, the drill was to be stopped and extracted from the bore hole. [...] Removal of the drill would lower the pressure beneath it, drawing water into the hole to be left to freeze, creating a plug of ice {{in the bottom of the}} hole. Drilling stopped on 5 February 2011 at a depth of [...] so that the research team could make it off the ice before the beginning of the Antarctic winter season.

5000|$|The KTB project {{contained}} {{a lot of}} innovations - the Kola drilling experiment had shown problems with high friction that was increased by the vertical instability. So the German scientists designed a new <b>drill</b> <b>head</b> that would keep the direction with minimal lateral difference.

40|$|International audienceThe {{drilling}} of deep holes {{remains an}} unsatisfactory machining operation due its limited productivity. This manufacturing process requires the chips {{to be evacuated}} {{through the use of}} retreat cycles and high-pressure lubrication, which is problematic both for productivity and the respect of the environment. An alternative response to the chip evacuation problem is the use of a vibratory <b>drilling</b> <b>head</b> which enables the chip to be split thanks to the drill's axial vibration. The high-speed drilling operation requires specific cutting conditions to be determined in order to maintain self-excited axial vibration throughout the drilling process. The prediction of adequate cutting conditions is determined {{on the basis of the}} frequency characteristics of the spindle/self-vibratory <b>drilling</b> <b>head</b> and the dynamics of the cutting process. It can be expressed in terms of a specific stability diagram indicating the zone of stable self-excited axial vibration. The aim of this study is to develop a high-speed spindle/drilling head/tool system finite element model to evaluate the system's dynamic characteristics and the adequate cutting conditions allowing stable self-excited axial vibration. The model is elaborated on the basis of rotor dynamics prediction, and takes into account the interfaces between system components, using the receptance coupling method. Using the model, adequate cutting conditions are determined by integrating the model-based tool tip transfer function into the chatter vibration stability approach proposed by Budak and Altintas. The simulated results are validated by performing vibration and drilling tests. The proposed model can be used to accurately evaluate the dynamic performance of the spindle/self-vibratory <b>drilling</b> <b>head</b> and can also be used to design an optimised spindle/drilling head for a given drilling process...|$|R

50|$|The {{equipment}} {{used in a}} horizontal directional drilling depends on the outer diameter of the pipe, length of the run, ground conditions and the surroundings above ground. For larger bores, directional drills equipped with as much as 600 tonnes 1 320 000 lb (or more) of thrust/pullback (Vermeer D1320x900) is {{used in conjunction with}} a mud reclaimer, excavator, and multiple pumps and hoses to supply the drilling fluid to the drillstem. Directional drilling stems are made from heat-treated high-carbon steel in diameters of 8 - 15 cm. Drill stem sections are manufactured in 3.0, 4.6, and 9.1 meter lengths with male and female threading on opposite ends. It is common for a directional drill to carry as much as 305 m of <b>drilling</b> stems. <b>Drilling</b> <b>heads</b> are available for different types of rock or soil. The <b>drilling</b> <b>head</b> has multiple water ports to allow removal of material. A talon bit head uses carbide-tipped blades to cut through material while steered by the operator.

50|$|The project {{started in}} September 1987 with an advance {{borehole}} using {{state of the}} art technology. The borehole reached its target depth of 4,000 metres in April 1989. The results of this drilling were used as parameters for the main borehole - for example the temperature gradient was higher than originally expected. The main drilling started on 8 September 1990 about 200 metres away from the advance borehole for an envisaged depth of 10,000 metres. The first 7,500 metres were using an automatic vertical <b>drill</b> <b>head</b> so that the lateral deviation could be limited to 12 metres. Due to the expected failure of the electronics below that depth a conventional <b>drill</b> <b>head</b> was used below that point. Due to brittleness and ductility the borehole was deforming multiple times, requiring to backfill the hole and start drilling again from a higher place. These operations continued for the last year of the project - the timing and budget constraints {{put an end to the}} efforts to go deeper. The drilling ended on 12 October 1994 after 1,468 days at a depth of 9,101 metres and about 300 metres lateral deviation showing a temperature of 265 °C.
