25|$|If {{the lens}} {{includes}} a DOF scale, the hyperfocal distance {{can be set}} by aligning the infinity mark on the distance scale with the mark on the DOF scale corresponding to the f-number to which the lens is set. For example, with the 35mm lens shown above set to f/11, aligning the infinity mark with the '11' {{to the left of}} the <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> on the DOF scale would set the focus to the hyperfocal distance.|$|E
25|$|Many lenses for small- and medium-format cameras include scales that {{indicate}} the DOF {{for a given}} focus distance and f-number; the 35mm lens in the image is typical. That lens includes distance scales in feet and meters; when a marked distance is set opposite the large white <b>index</b> <b>mark,</b> the focus is set to that distance. The DOF scale below the distance scales includes markings {{on either side of}} the index that correspond to f-numbers. When the lens is set to a given f-number, the DOF extends between the distances that align with the f-number markings.|$|E
2500|$|When the 35mm lens {{above is}} set to f/11 and focused at {{approximately}} 1.3m, the DOF (a [...] "zone" [...] of acceptable sharpness) extends from 1m to 2m. Conversely, the required focus and f-number can be determined from the desired DOF limits by locating the near and far DOF limits on the lens distance scale and setting focus so that the <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> is centered between the near and far distance marks. The required f-number is determined by finding the markings on the DOF scale that are closest to the near and far distance marks (Ray 1994, 315). For the 35mm lens above, if it were desired for the DOF to extend from 1m to 2m, focus would be set so that <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> was centered between the marks for those distances, and the aperture would be set to f/11.|$|E

50|$|In computing, an <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> or {{index track}} is a {{physical}} impression made on a hard disk drive. Its purpose is to indicate {{the starting point for}} each track on the hard disk drive. Usually, an <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> {{takes the form of a}} hole, gap, or magnetic strip. It also allows a hard disk drive head to quickly move to various spots on the drive.|$|E
50|$|Some lens {{manufacturers}} such as Leica {{never put}} IR index marks on their lenses. The {{reason for this}} is that any <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> is only valid for one particular IR filter and film combination, and may lead to user error. Even when using lenses with index marks, focus testing is advisable as there may be a large difference between the <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> and the subject plane.|$|E

5000|$|Most manual focus 35 mm SLR {{and medium}} format SLR lenses have a red dot, line or diamond, {{often with a}} red [...] "R" [...] called the {{infrared}} <b>index</b> <b>mark,</b> {{that can be used}} to achieve proper infrared focus; many autofocus lenses no longer have this mark. When a single-lens reflex (SLR) camera is fitted with a filter that is opaque to visible light, the reflex system becomes useless for both framing and focusing, one must compose the picture without the filter and then attach the filter. This requires the use of a tripod to prevent the composition from changing. A sharp infrared photograph can be done with a tripod, a narrow aperture (like [...] ) and a slow shutter speed without focus compensation, however wider apertures like [...] can produce sharp photos only if the lens is meticulously refocused to the infrared <b>index</b> <b>mark,</b> and only if this <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> is the correct one for the filter and film in use. However, it should be noted that diffraction effects inside a camera are greater at infrared wavelengths so that stopping down the lens too far may actually reduce sharpness.|$|E
25|$|One theory used to {{describe}} pronominal binding is to use <b>index</b> <b>marking</b> rules to determine possible bindings. <b>Index</b> <b>marking</b> rules are rules used to determine which parts of a sentence carry the same reference. Each element in a sentence is given an index, which is a unique identifier of that element. A set of rules can then be applied to modify the index of one element {{to be the same}} as the index of another. Those two elements will then share the same index, and so will refer to the same thing. This indexing theory was used as a way {{to describe}} pronominal binding by Noam Chomsky, and expanded upon by James Higginbotham. The theory holds that the binding of pronouns consists of three main parts.|$|R

5000|$|In {{electronics}} components, an <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> is {{a reference}} symbol printed on or molded into the casing of a device or circuit board, {{to indicate the}} location of [...] "Pin 1". This allows the correct orientation of the component in a larger circuit assembly, so that the electrical leads can be correctly connected.|$|E
5000|$|When the 35 mm lens {{above is}} set to f/11 and focused at {{approximately}} 1.3 m, the DOF (a [...] "zone" [...] of acceptable sharpness) extends from 1 m to 2 m. Conversely, the required focus and f-number can be determined from the desired DOF limits by locating the near and far DOF limits on the lens distance scale and setting focus so that the <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> is centered between the near and far distance marks. The required f-number is determined by finding the markings on the DOF scale that are closest to the near and far distance marks (Ray 1994, 315).

50|$|Tripod collar: This {{feature is}} found on most longer focal length lenses, and macro lenses. The tripod collar {{is used for}} {{attaching}} the tripod ring. There are two main styles of tripod rings. One type is opened up, placed on the lens' tripod collar, then closed and tightened. The other type does not open, but instead is slid up the lens from the mount end (which can only be done when the lens is not mounted on a camera body) and tightened. To set the tripod ring {{so that it is}} level with the lens, rotate the ring until the <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> on the tripod ring matches the <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> on the distance scale. The tripod ring is used for attaching a tripod/monopod near to the point of balance of the lens-body combination, more conveniently than the camera body. In the case of larger and heavier lenses, there is also less strain on the lens mount if the body is supported by the tripod-mounted lens than if the lens were to be supported by a tripod-mounted body.|$|E

50|$|Most apochromatic ('APO') lenses do {{not have}} an Infrared <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> and {{do not need to be}} refocused for the {{infrared}} spectrum because they are already optically corrected into the near-infrared spectrum. Catadioptric lenses do not often require this adjustment because their mirror containing elements do not suffer from chromatic aberration and so the overall aberration is comparably less. Catadioptric lenses do, of course, still contain lenses, and these lenses do still have a dispersive property.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to a large}} {{pentaprism}} and double-hinged reflex mirror, the SR-T 101 has {{an extremely}} bright finder with a central micro prism focusing aid that in most cases proves to be very convenient, requiring no apparent lines in the motive, since all out of focus objects appear to shimmer. All relevant exposure information is visible in the finder, including a battery check <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> showing the required meter needle deflection for a healthy battery when the ON/OFF meter switch on the camera base is set to BC.|$|E
50|$|For {{more precise}} {{position}} control, a worm drive may be used. A worm wheel is {{fixed to the}} rotating platform and meshes with a worm in the base. Rotation of the worm via a manual control knob causes the platform to rotate {{with respect to the}} base. <b>Index</b> <b>marks</b> on both the control knob and the platform can be used to locate the platform very precisely and repeatably with respect to the base.|$|R

25|$|The {{sections}} {{should be}} distinguished {{by means of}} tab <b>indexes</b> <b>marked</b> according to the classifications. Where detailed overhead accounts are kept for each department, it may be well to furnish additional tab indexes within this section marked with the departments of the plant so that the overhead accounts of one department may be readily distinguished from those of another. With these classification charts Nicholson & Rohrbach (1919) presented their idea's, which {{became known as the}} definition of cost centres.|$|R
50|$|The {{control track}} {{is also used}} to hold index marks, which were {{normally}} written {{at the beginning of each}} recording session, and can be found using the VCR's index search function: this will fast-wind forward or backward to the nth specified <b>index</b> <b>mark,</b> and resume playback from there. At times, higher-end VCRs provided functions for the user to manually add and remove these marks — so that, for example, they coincide with the actual start of the television program — but this feature later became hard to find.|$|E

If you bypass the plug and wire the cable directly to the subwoofer, remember to mirror these connections.|$|E
50|$|Another kind of <b>index</b> <b>mark</b> is a {{component}} of the registration system for road vehicles in the United Kingdom. It consists of a two-letter combination allocated to a local vehicle licensing office. Certain letters are associated with particular parts of the British Isles. Marks that include I or Z are issued either in the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland, those that include S in Scotland, and others in England and Wales, though some combinations have not been authorised for use. As an example the combinations AF, CV, GL, and RL were allocated to the Truro licensing office.|$|E
50|$|A {{plain bearing}} is simply two {{surfaces}} sliding against each other. Typically, a circular {{step on the}} platform mates snugly with a circular depression in the base allowing free rotation while minimizing side to side motion. A rotary stage built {{with this type of}} bearing is usually only used for coarse positioning and is adjusted manually simply by turning the platform. <b>Index</b> <b>marks</b> on either the base or the platform are often provided, allowing for somewhat repeatable positioning of the platform relative to the base.|$|R
