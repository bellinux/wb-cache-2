5|$|The at-large {{spot in the}} Orange Bowl {{was filled}} via a {{round-robin}} selection procedure defined by the other Bowl Championship series games (the Sugar, Fiesta, and Rose bowls) and the automatic bids. The order of at-large selections rotates annually among the BCS bowls. In 2009, the Fiesta Bowl picked first, followed by the Sugar Bowl, then the Orange Bowl. The Fiesta Bowl picked Ohio State, while the Sugar Bowl selected Utah. The Orange Bowl was thus left to select Big East Conference champion Cincinnati, <b>fulfilling</b> <b>the</b> BCS' contractual obligation to provide a game for the conference's champion.|$|E
5|$|The first {{armoured}} cruisers {{had been}} built in the 1870s, as an attempt to give armour protection to ships <b>fulfilling</b> <b>the</b> typical cruiser roles of patrol, trade protection and power projection. However, the results were rarely satisfactory, as the weight of armour required for any meaningful protection usually meant that the ship became almost as slow as a battleship. As a result, navies preferred to build protected cruisers with an armoured deck protecting their engines, or simply no armour at all.|$|E

5|$|Centaur entered {{operation}} as {{a hospital}} ship on 12 March 1943. The {{early stages of}} Centaur's first voyage as a hospital ship were test and transport runs; the initial run from Melbourne to Sydney resulted in the Master, Chief Engineer, and Chief Medical Officer composing {{a long list of}} defects requiring attention. Following repairs, she conducted a test run, transporting wounded servicemen from Townsville to Brisbane to ensure that she was capable of <b>fulfilling</b> <b>the</b> role of a medical vessel. Centaur was then tasked with delivering medical personnel to Port Moresby, New Guinea, and returning to Brisbane with Australian and American wounded along with a small number of wounded Japanese prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|In {{practical}} terms, {{there are}} several reasons why admitting the language of fraud to justify a fully secret trust, but not a half-secret trust, would be sub-optimal. This is considered one principal reason why the court in Blackwell v Blackwell established that both types of secret trust shared a single justification. A half-secret trust appears closer to <b>fulfilling</b> <b>the</b> formality requirements as laid down in the Wills Act, so the conclusion that it is less likely to be enforced seems contradictory. Also, such a rule would encourage fully secret trusts, with a wider possibility for fraud. It would also spark considerable litigation on whether a particular clause resulted in a fully secret or half-secret trust. Thus it may be argued that despite the difficulties, a half-secret trust should be enforced if fully secret trusts are.|$|E

5|$|The 1863–64 season saw Wills' {{engagement}} to Anderson collapse, possibly {{due to his}} womanising, and {{it was revealed that}} he had been mismanaging Cullin-la-ringo, in part by squandering family finances on alcohol while claiming it as station expenditure. The trustees demanded that he stay in Victoria to answer for the property's runaway debt. In response, Wills left Australia to join Parr's XI on a month-long tour of New Zealand. Initially standing in as umpire, he went on to captain local teams against the English, and filled the same role for a Victoria XXII {{at the end of the}} tour in Melbourne.

The fatwa sets out detailed relaxations of the sharia (Islamic law) requirements, allowing the Muslims to conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that are ordinarily forbidden in Islamic law, when necessary to survive. It includes relaxed instructions for <b>fulfilling</b> <b>the</b> ritual prayers, the ritual charity, and the ritual ablution, and recommendations when obliged to violate Islamic law, such as worshipping as Christians, committing blasphemy, and consuming pork and wine.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{government}} decided to upgrade its fleet of AMX-30Es {{in the late}} 1980s. The focus on upgrading Spain's AMX-30E's distracted attention from the Lince plan, which was eventually shelved in 1990 after Spain acquired {{a large number of}} M60 Patton tanks, which were no longer required by the U.S., in accordance with the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. These tanks replaced the M47s and M48s, and fulfilled Spain's need to modernize its tank forces in the short term. No prototype of the planned Lince tank was manufactured, and no announcements were made on who would receive the contract. Four years later the Spanish government procured and locally manufactured the Leopard 2, <b>fulfilling</b> <b>the</b> long-term modernisation goal established in the Lince programme.|$|E

5|$|The {{information}} available in Romania for the King Carol I Bridge in Cernavodă, {{as well as}} the results of scientists in France, say that the myths are pure fiction. First of all the Romanian government never finalised the construction contract with the company of Gustave Eiffel or with another foreign company, making the decision to build the bridge only with local companies. The Cernavodă Bridge was made entirely by Romanians, <b>fulfilling</b> <b>the</b> design of Anghel Saligny, which was also the supervisor of the site. In these conditions, not knowing if the contract will be approved, it is unlikely that a foreign company would build the whole superstructure of the bridge. On the other hand, in Austria–Hungary {{there was no need to}} construct a low bridge like the Faidherbe because of the trade routes on the Danube River.|$|E
5|$|The player travels into Red Mountain to Dagoth Ur's citadel. After {{talking with}} Dagoth Ur, who {{attempts}} to sway the player {{to his side}} with the claim that he is merely following Nerevar's final orders, the player and Dagoth Ur fight. Besting Dagoth Ur, the Nerevarine soon discovers that while the Heart of Lorkhan is still intact, Dagoth Ur remains immortal and he soon returns from death. Making {{his way to the}} very heart of the mountain, the Nerevarine finds the Heart of Lorkhan and destroys it, severing Dagoth Ur from his power and ultimately killing him. Akulakhan's Chamber, where Lorkhan's heart resided, is destroyed in the process as the cavern collapses, and in turn Red Mountain is cleared of blight and The Sixth House falls. Upon escaping from the chamber, the Nerevarine is congratulated by Azura, who comes to reward the player's efforts of <b>fulfilling</b> <b>the</b> prophecy.|$|E
5|$|There was {{rivalry between}} the lords of the manor and borough. The {{lord of the}} manor complained in 1328 that the burgesses were holding private markets, from which he gained no revenue. The rivalry {{continued}} in the 16th century, with Bishop Stanley unsuccessfully challenging {{the right of the}} burgesses to hold markets, believing it should be the right of the lord of the manor. In 1583 the corporation of the borough attempted to usurp the lord of the manor by laying claim to the lordship. They did so because they felt they were <b>fulfilling</b> <b>the</b> duties of the lord: to improve waste and common land and allowing construction on this land, running courts, and mining coal. A compromise was reached, dividing some power between the two parties.|$|E

Because of the dissociation of PFOA as well as APFO under environmental conditions the results for PFOA can be transferred to APFO. Hence, APFO <b>fulfills</b> <b>the</b> REACH PBT-criteria, too.|$|R
