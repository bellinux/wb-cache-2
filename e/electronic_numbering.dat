Nearly all American law firms use Bates stamps, though the use of manual hand-stamping is becoming increasingly rare due to the rise in <b>electronic</b> <b>numbering</b> — mostly in Portable Document Format (PDF) files rather than printed material. During the discovery phase of litigation, {{a large number of}} documents might require the use of unique identifiers for each page of each document for reference and retrieval. Bates numbering, named for the Bates Automatic Numbering-Machine, assigns an arbitrary unique identifier to each page. Such identification may be solely numeric or may contain a combination of letters and numbers (alphanumeric). There is no standard method for numbering documents, nor is there a standard type face used for such numbers.|$|E

40|$|GF- 7 {{satellite}} is a two-line-array stereo imaging satellite for surveying and mapping {{which will}} be launched in 2018. Its resolution is about 0. 8 meter at subastral point corresponding to a 20  km width of cloth, and the viewing angle of its forward and backward cameras are 5 and 26 degrees. This paper proposed the imaging simulation method of GF- 7 stereo images. WorldView- 2 stereo images were used as basic data for simulation. That is, we didn’t use DSM and DOM as basic data (we call it “ortho-to-stereo” method) but used a “stereo-to-stereo” method, {{which will be}} better to reflect the difference of geometry and radiation in different looking angle. The shortage is that geometric error will be caused by two factors, one is different looking angles between basic image and simulated image, another is not very accurate or no ground reference data. We generated DSM by WorldView- 2 stereo images. The WorldView- 2 DSM was not only used as reference DSM to estimate the accuracy of DSM generated by simulated GF- 7 stereo images, but also used as “ground truth” to establish the relationship between WorldView- 2 image point and simulated image point. Static MTF was simulated on the instantaneous focal plane “image” by filtering. SNR was simulated in the electronic sense, that is, digital value of WorldView- 2 image point was converted to radiation brightness and used as radiation brightness of simulated GF- 7 camera. This radiation brightness will be converted to <b>electronic</b> <b>number</b> n according to physical parameters of GF- 7 camera. The noise <b>electronic</b> <b>number</b> n 1 will be a random number between -√n and √n. The overall <b>electronic</b> <b>number</b> obtained by TDI CCD will add and converted to digital value of simulated GF- 7 image. Sinusoidal curves with different amplitude, frequency and initial phase were used as attitude curves. Geometric installation errors of CCD tiles were also simulated considering the rotation and translation factors. An accuracy estimate was made for DSM generated from simulated images...|$|R

50|$|Being able to dial {{telephone}} numbers the way customers {{have come to}} expect is considered crucial for the convergence of classic telephone service (PSTN) and Internet telephony (Voice over IP, VoIP), and for the development of new IP multimedia services. The problem of a single universal personal identifier for multiple communication services can be solved with different approaches. One simple approach is the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Number</b> Mapping System (ENUM), developed by the IETF, using existing E.164 telephone numbers, protocols and infrastructure to indirectly access different services available under a single personal identifier. ENUM also permits connecting the IP world to the telephone system in a seamless manner.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Linking <b>Electronic</b> <b>Number</b> Mapping (ENUM) {{with the}} Semantic Web {{proposed}} by the authors in previous work necessitated a prototype for proofing the concept and application examples for further analysis. ENUM is a protocol for mapping a telephone number to a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) giving access {{to a wide range}} of a person’s (communication) identifiers. Friend-of-a-friend (FOAF) is a project for machine-readable modelling of social networks based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF). In this paper a JAVA-based prototype called PHOAF is introduced, enabling ENUM query, ENUM data retrieval, FOAF RDF file lookup and FOAF RDF file parsing. Application examples utilising that PHOAF capabilities are used to evaluate the concept. The examples range from VoIP add-ons to a semantic phonebook directory and increasing trust for FOAF data. ...|$|R
