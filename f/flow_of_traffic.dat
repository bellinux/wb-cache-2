5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on the bridge resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours. To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to the bridge, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) plan to build two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a semi-circular layout {{in the form of}} side wings, which will facilitate easy <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic,</b> before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An electronic toll collection system was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> across the bridge.|$|E

The <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> from Penrith to Cockermouth and beyond was eased after the A66 was diverted to a new bypass in 1974, a development that caused controversy because of a prominent new viaduct carrying the road across the Greta Gorge {{to the north of}} the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, which was already having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Steuben Bridge, {{originally}} the Weirton-Steubenville Bridge, was a suspension bridge which spanned the Ohio River from Steubenville, Ohio to Weirton, West Virginia and carried U.S. Route 22 and then Ohio State Route 822 during its existence. Completed in 1928 and opened as a toll bridge, the Fort Steuben Bridge {{was a more}} direct route for the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> across the river; particularly for trucks and heavy vehicles from the industrial area.

40|$|As <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> {{traverse}} a network, {{they share}} with other <b>flows</b> a variety <b>of</b> {{resources such as}} links, buffers and router CPUs in their path. Fairness is an intuitively desirable property in the allocation of resources in a network shared among <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> from different users. While fairness in bandwidth allocation over a shared link has been extensively studied, overall end-to-end fairness {{in the use of}} all the resources in the network is ultimately the desired goal. End-to-end fairness becomes especially critical when fair allocation algorithms are used as a component of the mechanisms used to provide end-to-end quality-of-service guarantees. This paper seeks to answer the question of what is fair when a set <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>flows</b> share multiple resources in the network with a shared order of preference for the opportunity to use these resources. We present the Generalized Principle of Fairness (GPF), a powerful extension of any of the classic notions of fairness such as max-min fairness, proportional fairness and utility max-min fairness defined over a single resource. We illustrate this principle by applying it to a system model with a buffer and an output link shared among competing <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> To complete our illustration of the applicability of GPF, we propose a measure of fairness and evaluate representative buffer allocation algorithms based on this measure. Besides buffer allocation, GPF may also be used in other contexts in data communication networks and operating system design...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{many places}} in London, the Old Kent Road area {{did not suffer}} {{significant}} bomb damage during World War II. In 1968, a flyover opened at the northern end allowing access to New Kent Road which catered for the main <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> During the 1970s, run-down Victorian properties on and around Old Kent Road were demolished {{to make way for}} new housing estates. Burgess Park was created as part of the County of London Plan in 1943, which recommended new parkland in the area. Several tower blocks were built along the road, although some earlier 19th-century buildings, such as Nos.360–386, survived.|$|E
5|$|Serving as a {{link between}} Steubenville, Ohio and Weirton, West Virginia, the Fort Steuben Bridge opened as a toll bridge in November 1928. The bridge was the main carrier of U.S. Route 22 over the Ohio River, its traffic {{included}} trucks and heavy duty vehicles associated with the industrial facilities in Weirton-Steubenville area and along the Ohio River. The Fort Steuben Bridge provided a more direct route for the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> which previously {{had to use the}} Market Street Bridge. As of 1940 the toll for the bridge was 5 cents (US$ with inflation) for pedestrians and 25 cents (US$ with inflation) for automobiles. The toll was removed in 1947, when ownership of the bridge was transferred to the State of Ohio. Improvements to the bridge were made in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The Minister of the Guards (Weiwei 衛尉) {{was also}} known as Commandant of the Guards), and briefly as the Prefect of the Palace Grandees (Zhong da fuling 中大夫令) during Emperor Jing of Han's reign (r. 157–141 BC) before {{reverting}} to the original title. This Minister was responsible for securing and patrolling the walls, towers, and gates of the imperial palaces. The duties of his ministry were carried out by prefects, one of whom controlled the gates where nominees for office were received and officials sent memorials to the throne. To control and monitor the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> through the palace gates, the prefects used a complex passport system involving wooden and metal tallies. During an emergency, the tallies were collected and no-one was allowed to enter unless they breached the gates by force.

5|$|The current Causeway bridges were {{designed}} by E W C Godfrey, and built between 1947 and 1952. They were the first in Western Australia to use steel composite construction. Large roundabouts were also constructed {{at each end of}} the structure, to improve the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> The opening of the Graham Farmer Freeway in 2000 reduced the traffic volume on the Causeway, allowing the two central lanes to be turned into bus lanes. By the early 2000s, the concrete structures had suffered significant damage. Cracks were repaired using carbon fibre reinforcement and localised patching, extending the bridge's life by decades. The Causeway bridges have been recognised for their heritage value by their entry on the Western Australian Register of Heritage Places.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} {{was often}} the weakest part in a circuit of defences. To overcome this, the gatehouse was developed, allowing those inside the castle to control the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic.</b> In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot and to overcome this, projecting towers were added {{on each side of}} the gate in a style similar to that developed by the Romans. The gatehouse contained a series of defences to make a direct assault more difficult than battering down a simple gate. Typically, there were one or more portcullises– a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage– and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry the enemy. The passage through the gatehouse was lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant had to spend under fire in a confined space and unable to retaliate.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, several {{changes were}} made to the {{business}} routes in downtown Jackson. Eastbound BL I-94 traffic was shifted off Michigan Avenue along Blackstone Street to Washington Avenue, and from there it ran along Washington to Francis Street and back to Michigan Avenue. The westbound traffic was shifted north at Mechanic Street to Pearl Street, continuing until turning south at Blackstone back to Michigan Avenue. The eastern end was updated further in 1968 to use Louis Glick Highway to connect to the northern half of the loop around downtown to Michigan Avenue. A set of connector streets on the western side of the downtown loop opened in November 1969 to streamline the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> further resulting in the last changes to the BL I-94 routing in Jackson. Eastbound traffic was redirected to the connector on Michigan Avenue just east of Third Street. This connector curved south then east to Washington Avenue near First Street. Louis Glick Highway was extended west from Blackstone curving south to merge into Michigan. In 2012, the eastern terminus of the business route was shifted easterly to follow Ann Arbor and Sargent roads to exit145 on I-94; as a result, the former partial interchange between I-94 and Ann Arbor Road which formerly served as the business route's eastern terminus was obliterated.|$|E
