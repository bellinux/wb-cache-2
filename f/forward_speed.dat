5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> depends on the <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E
5|$|Steering may be {{supplied}} by a rider or, under certain circumstances, by the bike itself. This self-stability {{is generated by}} a combination of several effects that depend on the geometry, mass distribution, and <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> of the bike. Tires, suspension, steering damping, and frame flex can also influence it, especially in motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> {{at which}} non-oscillatory leaning increases, where the capsize mode {{eigenvalues}} switch from negative to positive in a pitchfork bifurcation at about 8m/s (18mph) in this example, {{is called the}} capsize speed. Above this speed, this non-oscillating lean eventually causes the uncontrolled bike to fall over.|$|E

5|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> {{at which}} {{oscillations}} begin, at about 1m/s (2.2mph) in this example, {{sometimes called the}} double root speed due to there being a repeated root to the characteristic polynomial (two of the four eigenvalues have exactly the same value). Below this speed, the bike simply falls over as an inverted pendulum does.|$|E
5|$|The <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> {{at which}} {{oscillations}} do not increase, where the weave mode eigenvalues switch from positive to negative in a Hopf bifurcation at about 5.3m/s (12mph) in this example, {{is called the}} weave speed. Below this speed, oscillations increase until the uncontrolled bike falls over. Above this speed, oscillations eventually die out.|$|E
5|$|The system quickly tracked {{toward the}} west-northwest at a <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> of 33km/h (21mph). The JTWC issued their first {{advisory}} on the storm early on October13, designating it Tropical Depression 27W. Around this time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also classified the cyclone as a tropical depression.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the mutual interference effects of the ground, wing, deflected jet stream, and free stream of a semispan delta-wing VTOL model at zero and low <b>forward</b> <b>speeds</b> has been conducted in the 17 -foot test section of the Langley 300 -MPH 7 -by 10 -foot tunnel. The model consisted of two interchangeable semispan clipped delta wings, a simplified fuselage, and a high-pressure jet for simulation of a jet exhaust. Attached to the wing behind the jet were various sets of vanes for deflecting the jet stream to different turning angles. The effect of ground proximity gave the normally expected losses in lift at zero and very low <b>forward</b> <b>speeds</b> (up to about 60 or 80 knots for the assumed wing loading of 100 lb/sq ft); at higher <b>forward</b> <b>speeds</b> ground effects were favorable. At low <b>forward</b> <b>speeds,</b> out of ground effect, the model encountered large losses in lift and large nose-up pitching moments with the model at low angles of attack and the jet deflected 90 deg or 75 deg (the angles required for VTOL performance and very low <b>forward</b> <b>speeds).</b> Rotating the model to higher angles of attack and deflecting the jet back to lower angles eliminated these losses in lift. Moving the jet rearward {{with respect to the}} wing reduced the losses in lift and the nose-up moments at all speeds within the range of this investigation...|$|R

5|$|After peak intensity, the <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> of Dean {{continued}} to increase as it approached Atlantic Canada while weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane. While approaching southern Newfoundland, Dean had weakened enough to be downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8. Shortly thereafter, Dean then made landfall on the south coast of Newfoundland with winds of 65mph (105km/h). Later that day, Dean emerged into the far north Atlantic and rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on the following day.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Two {{intensified}} over open waters, the season's third {{storm was}} identified on August9. Initially tracking westward, the hurricane turned sharply north, maintaining an intensity of 85mph (140km/h) during its known existence. Briefly slowing on August11, the system quickly picked up <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> {{as it turned}} northwestward, paralleling the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula. On August14, the hurricane turned north once more; however, it lost its identity the following day {{off the coast of}} Baja California.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Eseta {{developed}} on March 10 {{from an area}} of disturbed weather that originated {{in the vicinity of}} Vanuatu. At the time the cyclone was in very favourable conditions, in an area with warm sea–surface temperatures, low wind shear, and with development enhanced by an MJO pulse traversing the area at the time. After convection began to wrap around the center of circulation, the low–pressure area was named Eseta. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began issuing warnings on Eseta at 1200UTC on March 10; Eseta had a minimum pressure of 995mbar (29.39inHg) at the time. As the cyclone was on the western periphery of a mid–level ridge, it moved in a south-southeastwardly direction, initially at 13km/h (8mph). It then intensified quickly, and the next day developed a ragged eye. As it began to curve around the mid–level ridge, its <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> increased to 21km/h (13mph). Favorable conditions continued on March 12, and Eseta underwent rapid intensification, with its barometric pressure falling 40mbar (1.2inHg) to a minimum of 930mbar (27.46inHg). Wind speeds increased to 185km/h (115mph) sustained for 10minutes. However, the cyclone only maintained this intensity for 12hours before entering an area of strong vertical wind shear. It continued to accelerate in <b>forward</b> <b>speed,</b> but shower activity became elongated and the eye dissipated. The next day, Eseta had a <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> of 55km/h (35mph). As a result, the cyclone lost tropical characteristics on March 14. The JTWC issued its last warning on Eseta at 0000UTC on March 4 as it became extratropical. Eseta was absorbed by a front the next day.|$|E

5|$|Fay {{accelerated}} {{towards the}} Texas coast and made landfall early on September 7. The storm meandered throughout inland Texas, {{and as the}} system moved inland, <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> decreased and Fay weakened to a tropical depression. The last advisory was issued on Fay on September 7, although the depression persisted for several days just inland of the Texas Coast.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emily {{continued}} tracking northeast throughout September25 {{into the}} following day with increasing speed. By late on September25, the forward motion of the storm had reached 50mph (85km/h). The storm now began to undergo an extratropical transition with <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> peaking at 65mph (100km/h), the third highest forward motion ever recorded in a tropical cyclone. Interacting with a baroclinic zone, the hurricane completed its transition at 1800UTC on September26, resulting in the issuance of the final advisory on the storm.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, all {{convection}} in Chantal dissipated, and its <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> decreased as it {{headed to}} the north. A weak wave caused Chantal to speed up and the system was absorbed in the frontal system by the night of September 14. Effects on Bermuda were minimal, with the island getting winds of up to 20mph (25km/h) and few thundershowers. Chantal generated swells of 30–40ft (9–12m) offshore.|$|E

50|$|Semi-truck {{transmissions}} {{can have}} {{as few as}} three <b>forward</b> <b>speeds</b> or as many as 18 <b>forward</b> <b>speeds</b> (plus 2 reverse speeds). A large number of transmission ratios means the driver can operate the engine more efficiently. Modern on-highway diesel engines are designed to provide maximum torque in a narrow RPM range (usually 1200-1500 RPM); having more gear ratios means the driver can hold the engine in its optimum range regardless of road speed (drive axle ratio must also be considered).|$|R
5|$|The Koch {{index is}} the ratio between peak {{steering}} torque {{and the product}} of peak lean rate and <b>forward</b> <b>speed.</b> Large, touring motorcycles {{tend to have a}} high Koch index, sport motorcycles tend to have a medium Koch index, and scooters tend to have a low Koch index. It is easier to maneuver light scooters than heavy motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|After landfall, the cyclone {{accelerated}} in <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> northward, weakening in intensity, and, by 1200UTC on October 12, Marco {{became an}} extra-tropical cyclone. It {{turned to the}} northeast and east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast. For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in hints of the Fujiwhara effect, in which two tropical cyclone appear to rotate around each other. The cold front that absorbed the weakening low was to the storm's north on October 13, though moisture from the remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States for another day.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} its intensity for 24 hours, Rachel made landfall at peak intensity near {{the southern tip}} of Baja California Sur. Strong wind shear prevented additional intensification, despite moving into the warm waters of the Gulf of California. After weakening slightly, Rachel made a second landfall midway between Las Mochis and Culiacán. Upon moving inland, the system rapidly weakened as the <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> increased. Rachel dissipated several hours later on October3. By that time, the winds had decreased to 30mph (45km/h). The remnants of Rachel entered the United States, and were last noted over Texas.|$|E

5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute a turn to the northwest {{with an increase in}} <b>forward</b> <b>speed.</b> It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Early on August3, Colin's {{forward motion}} increased, and the cyclone {{was unable to}} {{maintain}} a closed circulation. The tropical storm degenerated into a trough at 1800UTC, although tropical storm-force winds persisted. As the remnants passed north of the northern Leeward Islands, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system on August4, but no closed circulation was found. As the remnants approached a weakness in the subtropical ridge across the western Atlantic on August5, its <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> gradually slowed as well. A combination of microwave and satellite imagery during the morning hours of August5 revealed the reformation of a closed low, and Colin's remnants regained tropical storm status at this time while located 280mi (450km) north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|In early August, a {{disturbance}} {{was observed in}} satellite images moving {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 4. Moving westward along the Intertropical Convergence Zone at a <b>forward</b> <b>speed</b> of roughly , the disturbance showed no signs of development until a cloud mass broke away from the ITCZ on August 6. The separated mass began rapidly organizing, becoming Tropical Depression Three late on August 7. The tropical depression continued to gain organization and was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 8, receiving the name Cora.|$|E

5|$|At low <b>forward</b> <b>speeds,</b> the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high <b>forward</b> <b>speeds,</b> the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|R
