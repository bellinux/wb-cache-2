40|$|Cellulose is a natural, {{versatile}} and biodegradable polymer, which like most natural polymers is chiral. Some cellulose derivatives form cholesteric liquid crystal phases either on heating {{or by the}} addition of a suitable solvent, giving rise to thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals respectively. Cholesteric cellulose derivatives selectively reflect circularly polarised light, which is centred at a wavelength, which corresponds to the pitchlength of the cholesteric phase. Some lyotropic cellulosic liquid crystal materials were identified and synthesised to explore possible methods to exploit cholesteric behaviour to produce films for potential use as reflective coatings. Films were prepared in one of two ways, either by casting from a lyotropic solution in a suitable organic solvent or by dissolving the material in a monomer, which could then be photopolymerised to form a composite reflective film. Since all cellulose <b>derivatives</b> <b>share</b> the same chiral backbone it might be expected that they will have the same chirality, however the nature of the substituents is responsible for determining the chirality of cellulosic derivatives which is not always the same as cellulose itself.

40|$|Abstract. Epidemiological {{evidence}} on the chemopreventive activity of mesalazine against colitis-associated cancer has accu-mulated in recent years. Together with the variety of mesalazine molecular antitumor effects this has prompted the development of novel mesalazine derivatives. The objective {{of this study was}} to test five novel derivatives (compounds 2 - 14, 2 - 17, 2 - 28, 2 - 34 L, 2 - 39) for their effect on cell proliferation, their capability to scavenge superoxide anions, to induce a cell cycle arrest and to improve replication fidelity in cultured colorectal cells. Compound 2 - 14 was identified as the strongest inhibitor of cell proliferation and functioned as a potent superoxide scavenger, as did 2 - 17 and 2 - 34 L. 2 - 14 induced a G 2 /M-arrest in HCT 116 and a G 0 /G 1 -arrest in HT 29 cells. 2 - 17 caused a G 0 /G 1 -arrest and 2 - 34 L a G 2 /M-arrest in HT 29 cells. 2 - 17 and 2 - 34 L reduced mutation rates at a (CA) 13 repeat in a dose-dependent fashion.

40|$|Derivatives are {{commonly}} defined as some {{variation of the}} following: financial instruments whose value {{is derived from the}} performance of a secondary source such as an underlying bond, commodity, or index. This definition is both over-inclusive and under-inclusive. Thus, not surprisingly, even many policy makers, regulators, and legal analysts misunderstand them.

Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM), hierarchical cluster analysis, and neighbor-joining cluster analysis elucidated relationships among the drugs that are useful for pharmaceutical consideration. Results and Discussion. Although the new <b>derivatives</b> <b>share</b> the same parent scaffold (doxorubicin), elucidation by analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) indicates that these assorted compounds are substantially distinct. The number of oxygen and nitrogen atoms (hydrogen bond acceptors) remained constant at 12 for compounds.

P transposase mutagenesis was used to generate derivatives of a translocation that variegated for the light(+) (lt(+)) gene and carried the euchromatic white(+) (w(+)) gene on a transposon near the heterochromatin-euchromatin junction. Cytogenetic and genetic analyses of the derivatives showed that P mutagenesis resulted in deletions of several megabases of heterochromatin.

Both compounds were rapidly taken up by PMN, with a cellular-to-extracellular concentration ratio (C/E) of about 141 (HMR 3562) and 117 (HMR 3787) at 5 min, and {{this was followed by}} a plateau at 60 to 180 min, with a C/E of > 300 at 180 min. Both ketolides were mainly located in PMN granules (about 75 %) and egressed slowly from loaded cells (about 40 % at 60 min), owing to avid reuptake. Uptake was moderately sensitive to external pH, and activation energy was also moderate (about 70 kJ/mol). As with other macrolides and ketolides, the existence of an active transport system was suggested by (i) the strong interindividual variability in uptake kinetics, suggesting variability in the number or activity of a transport protein; (ii) the saturation kinetics characteristic of a carrier-mediated transport system (Vmax, about 2, 300 ng/ 2. 5 × 106 PMN/ 5 min; Km, about 50 μg/ml); (iii) the inhibitory effects of Ni 2 + (a blocker of the Na+-Ca 2 + exchanger), phorbol myristate acetate (a protein kinase C activator), and H 89 (a protein kinase A inhibitor). Although these two ketolides are more related to HMR 3647 (telithromycin), it is interesting that the presence of a fluoride gave these molecules a cellular pharmacokinetics more like those of HMR 3004 than those of HMR 3647.

40|$|Betulinic acid (BA) is {{a natural}} product that exerts its {{cytotoxicity}} against various malignant carcinomas without side effects by triggering the mitochondrial pathway to apoptosis. Betulin (BE), the 28 -hydroxyl analog of BA, is present in large amounts (up to 30 % dry weight) in the outer bark of birch trees, and shares the same pentacyclic triterpenoid core as BA, yet exhibits no significant cytotoxicity. Topomer CoMFA studies were performed on 37 BA and BE derivatives and their in vitro anti-cancer activity results (reported as IC 50 values) against HT 29 human colon cancer cells in the present study. All <b>derivatives</b> <b>share</b> a common pentacyclic triterpenoid core and the molecules were split into three pieces by cutting at the C- 3 and C- 28 sites with a consideration toward structural diversity. The analysis gave a leave-one-out cross-validation q 2 value of 0. 722 and a non-cross-validation r 2 value of 0. 974, which suggested that the model has good predictive ability (q 2 > 0. 2). The contour maps illustrated that bulky and electron-donating groups would be favorable for activity at the C- 28 site, and a moderately bulky and electron-withdrawing group near the C- 3 site would improve this activity. BE derivatives were designed and synthesized according to the modeling result, whereby bulky electronegative groups (maleyl, phthalyl, and hexahydrophthalyl groups) were directly introduced at the C- 28 position of BE.

The IC 50 values of these three new compounds were also assayed in five other tumor cell lines. 28 -O-hexahydrophthalyl BE exhibited the greatest anti-cancer activities and its IC 50 values were lower than those of BA in all cell lines, excluding DU 145 cells...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Neural Crest, a {{transient}} epithelium in vertebrate embryos, {{is the source}} of putative stem cells known to give rise to neuronal, glial and endocrine components of the peripheral (sensory, autonomic and enteric) nervous system (PNS) and pigment cells in the skin. The Neural Crest is also widely believed to be the source of mesectodermal derivatives (skeletogenic, odontogenic, connective tissue and smooth muscle mesenchyme) in the vertebrate head [see (Bronner and LeDouarin, 2012; Le Douarin, 2012; Le Douarin and Kalcheim, 1999); see also (Hörstadius, 1950; Weston, 1970) ]. This conventional understanding of the broad developmental potential of the Neural Crest has been challenged {{over the past few years}} (Breau et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2013 a, 2013 b; Weston et al., 2004), based on recognition that the definition of the embryonic epithelia that comprise the Neural Crest may be imprecise. Indeed, the definition of the embryonic tissues understood to constitute the Neural Crest has changed considerably since it was first described by Wilhelm His 150 years ago (His, 1868). Today, the operational definition of the Neural Crest is inconsistent and functionally ambiguous. We believe that more precise definitions of the embryonic tissues involved in Neural Crest development would be useful to understand (1) the range of cellular phenotypes that actually segregate from it, (2) when this lineage diversification occurs, and (3) how diversification is regulated. In this idiosyncratic review, we aim to explain our concerns with the current definitions in this field, and in the chiastic words of Samuel Johnson (1781), “… make new things familiar and familiar things new”. 11 Samuel Johnson׳s words were paraphrased by Mardy Grothe [drmardy. com] from Johnson׳s Lives of the Poets [1781]. Discussing Alexander Pope׳s poem, The Rape of the Lock, Johnson wrote, “In this work are exhibited in a very high degree the two most engaging powers of an author: New things are made familiar, and familiar things are made new. ” Then, we will try to distinguish the developmental events crucial to the regulation of Neural Crest development at both cranial and trunk axial levels of vertebrate embryos, and address some of the implicit assumptions that underlie the conventional interpretation of experimental results on the origin and fates of Neural Crest-derived cells. We hope our discussion will resolve some ambiguities regarding both the range of derivatives in the Neural Crest lineage and the conventional understanding that cranial mesectodermal <b>derivatives</b> <b>share</b> a common Neural Crest-derived lineage precursor with components of the PNS...|$|E

In biological systems, these highly soluble dipolar molecules serve as organic osmolytes (osmoprotectants), namely substances synthesized or taken up from the environment by cells for protection against osmotic stress. Osmoprotectants can stabilize proteins and membranes when salt levels or temperatures are unfavourable; therefore, they could play important roles in the adaption of cells of marine invertebrates to various adverse environmental conditions. Examples of betaines isolated from marine invertebrates are homarine, 1 trigonelline, 2 taurines, baikiain betaine, 3 β-stachydrine, 4 nor- and aminozooanemonin, 5 pyridinebetaines A and B. 5 Most of these compounds are amphoteric low-molecular weight quaternary ammonium compounds deriving from proteinogenic or non- proteinogenic amino acids in which the nitrogen atom if fully methylated.

In the present study, aiming at increasing the pool of analogues for establishing structure-activity relationships (SAR), compounds 1 and 2 were further submitted to several chemical transformations, yielding thirteen new derivatives (13 - 25). Their structures were assigned by spectroscopic methods, including 1 D and 2 D NMR experiments. Compounds 1 - 25 were evaluated for their effects on the reversion of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB 1), through combination of functional and chemosensitivity assays, using a human ABCB 1 -transfected mouse T-lymphoma cell model.

LC/ESI-FTICRMS led to the unambiguous determination of the molecular masses of the studied compounds without interference from other biomolecules. A systematic and comprehensive study of the mass spectral behaviour of caffeine and its fourteen metabolites by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was performed, through in-source ion trap collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the protonated molecules, [M+H](+). A retro-Diels-Alder (RDA) process along with ring-contraction reactions were the major fragmentation pathways observed during CID.

Improvement in ALA delivery has been sought {{through the use of}} ALA derivatives, in particular the esterification of ALA with aliphatic alcohols, which in certain cases can improve cellular penetration and selectivity. ALA uptake systems appear to be distinctive for each cell type. The LM 3 mammary adenocarcinoma cell line takes ALA up by BETA transporters. In this work, we investigated ALA derivative transport systems through the inhibition of radiolabelled ALA uptake in the LM 3 cells. We also performed inhibition studies of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake. The more lipohilic ALA derivatives hexyl-ALA and undecanoyl-ALA inhibit ALA uptake, whereas methyl-ALA, R, S-ALA- 2 -(hydroxymethyl) tetrahydropyranyl ester and the dendron aminomethane tris methyl 5 -ALA does not inhibit ALA uptake. A similar pattern was found for GABA, except that the dendron inhibited GABA uptake. However, hexyl-ALA and undecanoyl-ALA are not taken up by BETA transporters, but by simple diffusion, although they still inhibit ALA uptake by binding to the cell membrane. These results show that different modifications to the ALA molecule lead to different uptake mechanisms. Whereas ALA is taken up by BETA transporters, none of the ALA <b>derivatives</b> <b>shares</b> the same mechanism.

We used a quantitative tissue culture model employing HEp- 2 cells to compare the abilities of these bacteria to enter epithelial cells. S. typhimurium and Yersinia species were highly infective for HEp- 2 cells but were unable to replicate extensively intracellularly. Enteroinvasive E. coli exhibited low infectivity but replicated extensively intracellularly. The growth of enteroinvasive E. coli led to destruction of the HEp- 2 monolayer, whereas Yersinia spp. and S. typhimurium were maintained intracellularly for prolonged periods without damage to the monolayer. The ability of enteroinvasive E. coli to enter HEp- 2 cells required prior growth at 37 degrees C; neither S. typhimurium nor Yersinia spp. exhibited this temperature dependence for cell entry. An E. coli K- 12 derivative containing a 230 -kilobase plasmid from enteroinvasive E. coli was constructed.

An HB 101 derivative containing a cloned invasion determinant from Y. pseudotuberculosis was constructed in our laboratory. HEp- 2 monolayers were coinfected with these two K- 12 derivatives to compare invasion determinants from enteroinvasive E. coli with those of Y. pseudotuberculosis in a common genetic background. Results from these experiments suggest that these organisms reside within separate intracellular compartments...|$|R
50|$|The <b>derivative</b> USS Truxtun <b>shared</b> {{the weapons}} systems outfit of the Belknap class, but was nuclear-powered, larger and {{substantially}} unrelated in design (for example, many weapons systems in different locations, {{such as the}} aft-facing GMLS). Most information related to nuclear cruisers is still classified, but Truxtun {{appears to be more}} a Belknap-like derivative of the nuclear cruiser Bainbridge than the other way around.|$|R
40|$|The {{view that}} {{informed}} investors {{might choose to}} trade <b>derivatives</b> has been <b>shared</b> by both academics and practitioners from {{as early as the}} introduction of options trading in the early 1970 s. Black (1975) claims that “ [...] . Since an investor can get more action for a given investment in options than he can by investing directly in the underlying stock, he may choos...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} normal {{families}} {{related to a}} Hayman conjecture of higher <b>derivative</b> and concerning <b>shared</b> values and get two normal criteria. Our results improve the related theorems which were obtained independently, respectively by Fang and Yuan (2001), Yuan et al. ((2011) and (2012)), Wang et al. (2011), and Qiu et al. (2012). Meanwhile, some examples are given to show the sharpness of our results...|$|R
