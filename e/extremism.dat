5|$|In August 2016, Twitter {{stated that}} it had banned 235,000 {{accounts}} {{over the past six}} months, bringing the overall number of suspended accounts to 360,000 accounts in the past year, for violating policies banning use of the platform to promote <b>extremism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Always {{in touch}} with its Nazi past, HIAG was a subject of {{significant}} controversy, both in West Germany and abroad. The organisation drifted into right-wing <b>extremism</b> in its later history; it was disbanded in 1992 at the federal level, but local groups, along with the organisation's monthly periodical, continued to exist into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{a village}} in the Jalandhar {{district}} of Punjab, India, Dosanjh emigrated to the United Kingdom {{at the age of}} 17 before moving to Canada almost four years later. He worked numerous manual labour jobs and attended university, studying political science. He earned his law degree at the University of British Columbia and opened his own law firm. He has been a vocal opponent of violence and <b>extremism.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1993, President Bill Clinton {{appointed}} Raphel as {{the first}} Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs within the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, a newly created position within the State Department focused on a growing array of problems in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, including democratic stability, nuclear proliferation, energy access, Islamist and Taliban <b>extremism,</b> poverty and women's rights issues.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, he {{received}} the sixth biennial Erich Mühsam Prize, named after an anarcho-communist essayist, which recognizes activism in line with that of its namesake. In October 2002, he was made an honorary member of the German political organization Society of People Persecuted by the Nazi Regime– Federation of Anti-Fascists (VVN-BdA) which Germany's Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution has considered {{to be influenced by}} left-wing <b>extremism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{initially}} favoured relatively lenient {{treatment of}} Germany – he feared too harsh conditions could foment {{the rise of}} <b>extremism,</b> and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports. To Keynes's dismay, Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to include pensions in the reparations bill.|$|E
5|$|Bayern Munich is also {{renowned for}} its well-organised ultra scene. The most {{prominent}} groups are the Schickeria München, the Inferno Bavaria, the Red Munichs '89, the Südkurve '73, the Munichmaniacs 1996, the Red Angels, and the Red Sharks. The ultras scene of Bayern Munch has been recognized for certain groups taking stance against right-wing <b>extremism,</b> racism and homophobia, and in 2014 the group Schickeria München received the Julius Hirsch Award by the DFB for its commitment against antisemitism and discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Hadley has {{conducted}} research on animal rights <b>extremism,</b> {{concluding that the}} phenomenon is a complex one, and that {{a full understanding of}} individual extremists' intentions and targets are necessary to understand the ethical acceptability of extremist acts and whether such acts are appropriately classified as terrorism. He holds that while direct action should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.|$|E
5|$|In Iran, as of May 2014, {{according}} to its Yoga Association, there were approximately 200 yoga centres in the country, a quarter {{of them in the}} capital Tehran, where groups can often be seen practising in parks. This has been met by opposition among conservatives. In May 2009, Turkey's head of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, Ali Bardakoğlu, discounted personal development techniques such as reiki and yoga as commercial ventures that could lead to <b>extremism.</b> His comments were made in the context of reiki and yoga possibly being a form of proselytization at the expense of Islam.|$|E
5|$|A year later, he {{was elected}} to the Netherlands' {{national}} parliament, but his first four years in parliament drew little attention. However, his appointment in 2002 as a public spokesman for the VVD led Wilders to become more well known for his outspoken criticism of Islamic <b>extremism.</b> Tensions immediately developed within the party, as Wilders found himself to be to the right of most members, and challenged the party line in his public statements. He was expelled from the VVD parliamentary party, and in September 2004, Wilders left the VVD, having been a member since 1989, to form his own political party, Groep Wilders, later renamed the Party for Freedom. The crunch issue with the VVD party line was about his refusal to endorse the party's position that European Union accession negotiations must be started with Turkey.|$|E
5|$|At a {{young age}} Saint-Just had shown a fascination with literature, and during his stay at the {{reformatory}} he used his time to begin writing a lengthy poem. He published it anonymously {{more than two years}} later, in May 1789, at the very outbreak of the Revolution. The 21-year-old Saint-Just thereby added his own touch to the social tumult of the times with Organt, poem in twenty cantos. The poem, a medieval epic fantasy, relates the quest of young Antoine Organt. It extols the virtues of primitive man, praising his libertinism and independence while blaming all present-day troubles on modern inequalities of wealth and power. Written in a style mimicking Ariosto, it gave a juvenile foreshadowing of his own political <b>extremism.</b> Spiked with brutal satire and scandalous pornographic episodes, it also made unmistakable attacks upon the monarchy, the nobility, and the Church.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights <b>extremism,</b> the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, Chetniks from Montenegro and Sandžak met at {{a conference}} in the village of Šahovići near Bijelo Polje. The conference was {{dominated}} by Montenegrin Serb Chetnik commander Major Pavle Đurišić and its resolutions expressed <b>extremism</b> and intolerance, as well as an agenda which focused on restoring the pre-war status quo in Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship. It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbors. At this conference, Mihailović was represented by his chief of staff, Major Zaharije Ostojić, who had previously been encouraged by Mihailović to wage a campaign of terror against the Muslim population living along the borders of Montenegro and the Sandžak.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression {{provided}} a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic, which faced challenges from right- and left-wing extremists. The moderate political parties were increasingly unable {{to stem the}} tide of <b>extremism,</b> and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology. The elections of September 1930 resulted in the break-up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet. Its leader, chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party, governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg. Governance by decree became the new norm and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government. The NSDAP rose from obscurity to win 18.3 percent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election, becoming the second-largest party in parliament.|$|E
5|$|The black {{nationalist}} movement in Southern Rhodesia, founded and organised by urban black elites {{during the late}} 1950s, was repeatedly banned by the colonial government because of the political violence, industrial sabotage and intimidation of potential black voters that characterised its campaign. The principal nationalist group, led by the Bulawayo trade unionist Joshua Nkomo, renamed itself with each post-ban reorganisation, and {{by the start of}} 1962 was called the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). Attempting to win black political support, Whitehead proposed a number of reforms to racially discriminatory legislation, including the Land Apportionment Act, and promised to implement these if his UFP won the next Southern Rhodesian election. But intimidation by ZAPU of prospective black voters impeded the UFP's efforts to win their support, and much of the white community saw Whitehead as too radical, and soft on what they saw as black <b>extremism.</b> In the December 1962 Southern Rhodesian election, the UFP was defeated by the Rhodesian Front (RF), a newly formed alliance of conservative voices headed by Winston Field and Ian Smith, in what was widely considered a shock result. Field became Prime Minister, with Smith as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|The {{ideology}} featured heavily during Disraeli's {{terms in}} government, during which considerable social reforms were passed. Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, the party moved away from paternalism in favour of free market capitalism, but fears of <b>extremism</b> during the interwar period caused the revival of one-nation conservatism. The philosophy continued to be held by the Conservative party throughout the post-war consensus, influencing the decision to maintain Labour government Keynesian intervention in the economy, forming a welfare state and National Health Service. Later years saw the rise of the New Right, which attributed the country's social and economic troubles to one-nation conservatism. David Cameron, former leader of the Conservative Party, named Disraeli as his favourite Conservative and some commentators and MPs have suggested that Cameron's ideology contains an element of one-nationism. Other commentators have questioned the degree to which Cameron and his coalition have embodied One-Nation Conservatism, instead locating them in the intellectual tradition of Thatcherism. In 2016, Cameron's successor, Theresa May, referred to herself as a one-nation conservative in her first speech as prime minister and outlined her focus on social justice.|$|E
5|$|The poem also {{contains}} many of Southey's {{views on the}} Catholic Church and how it influenced his political views. Part of this comes from Southey's trip to Lisbon and Madrid in 1795 where he was exposed to what he believed as Catholic superstition. He believed that {{the church and the}} Catholic leaders kept the people ignorant, and he believed that the Muslims that were cast out of Spain were more tolerant. Many of these ideas are repeated in a speech within the work by Henry V, and the character attributes ignorance and vice to oppression. Southey believed {{that the only way to}} escape from these problems was for people to believe they were part of one universal family. His enemies later described Southey's as holding Jacobin belief and claimed he supported the <b>extremism</b> of Robbespierre, when his sympathies laid to a larger extent with the Girondins that were replaced by the Jacobins. However, the poem is still subversive since it described a French patriot fighting against the English that parallels the strife during Southey's time.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} {{claims that the}} case of Swamiji's murder has been solved, it is widely {{believed}} to be a cover up, based on doubts expressed by several senior investigators and experts on left-wing <b>extremism.</b>|$|E
25|$|There has {{nevertheless}} been widespread {{criticism that}} ALF spokespersons and activists have either failed to condemn {{acts of violence}} or have themselves engaged in it, either {{in the name of}} the ALF or under another banner. The criticism has been accompanied by dissent within the animal rights movement itself about the use of violence, and increasing attention from the police and intelligence communities. In 2002 the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors <b>extremism</b> in the United States, noted the involvement of the ALF in the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign, which SPLC identified as using terrorist tactics—though a later SPLC report also noted that they have not killed anyone. In 2005 the ALF was included in a United States Department of Homeland Security planning document listing a number of domestic terrorist threats on which the U.S. government expected to focus resources. In the UK, ALF actions are regarded as examples of domestic <b>extremism,</b> and are handled by the National <b>Extremism</b> Tactical Coordination Unit, set up in 2004 to monitor ALF and other illegal animal rights activity.|$|E
