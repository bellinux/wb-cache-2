The <b>Group</b> <b>Service</b> Representatives (GSRs) and alternate GSRs from each Group in an Area meet regularly together for a business meeting where issue are raised and discussed in order to better {{meet the needs of the}} groups in the Area. Each ASC elects its own officers: the chairperson, vice chairperson, secretary, treasurer, and regional committee members (RCMs).

Service is [...] "doing the right thing for the right reason," [...] and is the best example of [...] "good will", which is the basis for the freedom only from active addiction by the NA program. Service work is usually chairing a meeting but may be as simple as cleaning up after the meeting, putting away chairs, or answering a phone. Additionally, there are basic, formalized service positions at the group level to help the group perform its function: examples include treasurer, secretary and <b>Group</b> <b>Service</b> Representative (GSR) who represents the group in the larger service structure.|$|E

2500|$|Narcotics Anonymous is {{fundamentally}} {{made up of}} NA Groups. An NA Group is a number of NA members who meet regularly; usually {{at the same time}} and place each week. Some Groups have more frequent meetings but are considered to be part of a single Group. Groups have one primary purpose, to carry the message to the addict who still suffers. Groups are largely independent from one another and members of NA are encouraged to choose a [...] "home group" [...] to belong to, a group they attend regularly and where they will be missed if they are absent. Each Group elects any number of leaders, or [...] "trusted servants", to serve the needs of the Group they made include: a Group Secretary, a Group Treasurer, a Group Chairperson, a <b>Group</b> <b>Service</b> Representative (GSR) and an alternate GSR. This election process is carried out by the Group Conscience which is a business meeting made up of the members of the Group who strive for consensus-based decisions. With each group being autonomous, without affecting NA as a whole, the responsibilities of trusted servants vary from meeting to meeting. These responsibilities or [...] "group policies" [...] are contrived through the group's business meeting by inviting a Higher Power to guide each individual recovering addicts' decision, also known as a group conscience. An example of one specific trusted servants responsibilities are, [...] "The secretary is responsible for opening the meeting, choosing someone to chair the meeting, making sure coffee gets made, etc. He or she also arranges for purchasing supplies and keeping group records. The treasurer keeps financial records and pays the group's bills. The GSR attends the Area Service Committee meetings and represents the group to the ASC.
