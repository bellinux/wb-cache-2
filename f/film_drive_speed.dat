40|$|Linkage and cam-follower {{mechanism}} design {{are often}} based on the simplifying assumption of constant <b>drive</b> <b>speed.</b> Usually, however, the mutual interaction between the mechanism and its actuator {{gives rise to a}} fluctuating <b>drive</b> <b>speed,</b> possibly resulting in a variety of dynamic problems. This paper provides machine designers and researchers with a structured design approach towards solving such problems. As such, it constitutes both an extension and a complement to the 1979 input torque balancing survey by the second author...|$|R
50|$|Original CD-ROM drives {{could read}} data at 150 kibibytes (150 × 210 bytes) per second. As faster drives were released, the write speeds and read speeds for optical discs were multiplied by manufacturers, far {{exceeding}} the <b>drive</b> <b>speeds</b> originally released onto the market. In order to represent this exponential growth in <b>drive</b> <b>speeds,</b> manufacturers used the symbol nX, whereby n is the multiple {{of the original}} speed. For example, writing to a CD at 8X will be {{twice as fast as}} writing onto a disc at 4X..|$|R

Drying experiments were carried out by drying fermented ground cassava particles in a bench scale rotary dryer at inlet air temperatures of 115 – 230 °C, air velocities of 0. 83 [*]m/s– 1. 55 [*]m/s, feed mass of 50 – 500 [*]g, drum <b>drive</b> <b>speed</b> of 8 [*]rpm, and feed <b>drive</b> <b>speed</b> of 100 [*]rpm to validate the model. The data obtained from the experiments were {{used to calculate the}} experimental moisture ratio which compared well with the theoretical moisture ratio calculated from the newly developed Abowei-Ademiluyi model. The comparisons and correlations of the results indicate that validation and performance of the established model are rather reasonable...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a Model Predictive Control (MPC) {{algorithm}} applied to electrical drives. The main contribution is a comprehensive and {{detailed description of the}} controller design process that points out the most critical aspects and gives also some practical hints for implementation. As an example, the MPC is developed for a permanent magnet synchronous motor <b>drive.</b> <b>Speed</b> and current controllers are combined together, including all of the state variables of the system, instead of keeping the conventional cascade structure. This way the controller enforces both the current and the voltage limits. Both simulation and experimental results point out the validity of the design procedure and the potentials of the MPC in the electrical drives field.
