5|$|Adults of Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids {{release their}} eggs into the water, and the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the larva makes <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is {{the main part of}} the circulatory system) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a fish, the larva metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E
5|$|After NY448, NY117 {{becomes a}} four-lane, {{undivided}} at-grade street as it heads northeast through a residential area of Mount Pleasant. Just past the NY448 junction, NY117 enters adjacent interchanges with Saw Mill River Road (NY9A and NY100) and the northbound {{direction of the}} Taconic State Parkway near Graham Hills County Park. From here, the highway passes south of Pace University's Pleasantville campus on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> village of Pleasantville, where it narrows to two lanes and initially serves mostly commercial neighborhoods. NY117 remains on Bedford Road for its first few blocks in Pleasantville; however, it veers northeast onto Manville Road just southwest of the community's central business district.|$|E
5|$|After this junction, NY12E crosses Guffin Creek on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{village of}} Chaumont. Here, NY12E becomes Main Street again as it {{transitions}} from a rural highway {{back to a}} residential street. In {{the southern part of}} Chaumont, the route connects to CR125, at which point NY12E begins to pass by a mix of commercial and residential properties. It crosses over a small creek leading away from Chaumont Bay before turning slightly westward and entering the Chaumont Historic District.|$|E

5|$|By 1872, the {{railroad}} had extended from Portland to Roseburg. Along the way, it created growth in Willamette Valley {{towns such as}} Canby, Aurora, and Harrisburg, which emerged as freight and passenger stations, and provided a commercial lifeline to {{the part of the}} river valley above Harrisburg where steamships were rarely able to travel. As {{the railroad}} made <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Umpqua Valley, new townsites such as Drain, Oakland, and Yoncalla were laid out.|$|E
5|$|East of Thurston hamlet, NY333 {{continued}} to {{run along the}} base of the Michigan Creek valley into the town of Campbell, where the valley met a larger valley surrounding the Cohocton River. The route proceeded eastward across the width of the latter valley, crossing over the river on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> riverside hamlet of Campbell, the largest community along NY333. It proceeded eastward through the hamlet along Main Street to an interchange with the Southern Tier Expressway (then-NY15 and NY17) just east of the community. NY333 ended just east of the Southern Tier at a junction with NY415. The right-of-way also terminated at the junction.|$|E
5|$|NY173 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY31 in Ionia, a hamlet within {{the town of}} Van Buren. The route heads southeast, intersecting several county roads as it proceeds through a rural, marshy area of Onondaga County as Warners Road. It crosses over the New York State Thruway (Interstate90 or I-90) on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hamlet of Warners, where it briefly follows Canton Street and crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision rail line before becoming Warners Road once again as it follows the railroad east out {{of the community and}} into the town of Camillus.|$|E

5|$|On {{the south}} {{bank of the}} Markham River lay Markham Point, where the Japanese {{maintained}} a force of about 200 men on commanding ground. Part of the 24th Infantry Battalion was ordered to capture the position. The attack {{on the morning of}} 4 September went wrong from the start, with two scouts being wounded by a land mine. The force fought <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Japanese position but took heavy casualties and was forced to withdraw. Twelve Australians were killed and six were wounded in the attack. It was then decided to merely contain the Japanese force at Markham Point, which was subjected to mortar fire and an airstrike.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{entering}} Sussex County, Route 183 {{enters the}} community of Stanhope. At the intersection with Musconetcong Avenue, the highway turns to the northwest, leaving {{the shores of the}} lake. Route 183 continues through the residential developments in Stanhope, working <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mountains above the lake. At the intersection with Dell Road, Route 183 becomes intertwined with the interchange on U.S. Route 206 northbound, and the highways merge a short distance later in Stanhope.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} to the north, NY78 and NY104 fork in different directions, with NY104 following Ridge Road to the northeast and NY78 running along LockportOlcott Road to the northwest. Still {{in the town of}} Newfane, NY78 proceeds northwest as a four-lane (quickly changing to two-lane) residential street. The route passes east of Bent-Wing Airport, continuing northwest through Newfane. The route remains residential for a distance, crossing over a brook on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hamlet of Corwin. In Corwin, NY78 remains a two-lane residential road, crossing over Somerset Railroad tracks that are operated by CSX Transportation (heading for the Somerset Power Plant near Camp Kenan) north of Jacques Avenue. Now paralleling Eighteenmile Creek, NY78 intersects with the western terminus of CR105 (Hatter Road). While winding northwest, the route soon enters the hamlet of Newfane.|$|E

5|$|After NY18, NY93 curves to the southeast, serving another {{residential}} stretch {{ahead of}} a junction with YoungstownWilson Road (CR36) on {{the eastern edge of}} Towers Corners. After this intersection, the homes give way to farms as the road heads into rural areas of the town. The route continues on a southeast track through Porter, passing a mixture of rural and residential areas on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hamlet of Porter Center, where NY93 enters an intersection with Porter Center Road (CR57). Another southeastward stretch brings the route across Twelvemile Creek and into the hamlet of Ransomville, where NY93 becomes the community's main street. Through Ransomville, NY93 retains the YoungstownLockport Road name, intersecting with Ransomville Road (CR17) in the hamlet's business district.|$|E
5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E
5|$|As Commerce Street, NY141 {{continues}} {{to head to}} the northeast, passing by a line of businesses in an otherwise residential area between the hamlets of Hawthorne and Thornwood. The route eventually enters the latter's central business district, where the Saw Mill Parkway and the Harlem Line turn northwestward {{toward the center of the}} nearby village of Pleasantville. NY141 continues on a northern track however, veering off of Commerce Street onto Franklin Avenue, then becoming known as Broadway again as it heads through mostly residential areas on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> eastern portion of Pleasantville. It retains the Broadway name to a junction with Bedford Road, from where the route continues as Bedford Road for two blocks before ending at an intersection with NY117. Westbound NY117 enters from the west on Manville Road, while NY117 east turns north to follow Bedford Road.|$|E

5|$|At around 1:30a.m. on Monday, 10 February 1930, {{approximately}} 50 troops {{belonging to}} the Second Battalion of the Fourth Regiment of Tonkinese Rifles (Régiment de Tirailleurs Tonkinois), stationed at Yên Bái, reinforced by around 60 civilian members of the VNQDĐ, attacked their 29 French officers and warrant officers. The plan was for the rebels to split into three groups. One group was to infiltrate the infantry barracks, kill French NCOs in their beds and raise support amongst the Vietnamese troops; a second, which was to include the external VNQDD members, was to fight <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> post headquarters, while the third group would enter the officers' quarters. The longer term goal was to capture the barracks, secure the city, set up anti-aircraft guns in the hills and create a strong point around the railway station. They were to dig trenches around it to defend it from incoming colonial forces.|$|E
5|$|His {{best known}} popular work is his Dictionary of Plant Names, which found <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{libraries}} of most horticulturalists. One of the focuses {{of his work}} at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the Caribbean, where he carried out field work. Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his own garden and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany. William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including Botanical Latin and Dictionary of Plant Names and translating German botanical history into English. Just before his death he completed a revision of his original Epimedium monograph.|$|E
5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for Civil Aviation that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of Civil Aviation had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine boost pump was operating, a vortex in the engine fuel tank prevented water from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump was turned off, any water would soon find <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> engine. The Department of Civil Aviation believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff {{but at least one}} engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off. However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's loss of power was not due to water in the fuel.|$|E

5|$|NY31E {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY31 {{in the village}} of Middleport in eastern Niagara County. The route heads north as Main Street, overlapping with NY271 (which also begins at NY31) through the mostly residential village. Just south of the Erie Canal, NY31E and NY271 enter Middleport's small business district, centered on the junction of Main and State Streets. Here, NY31E and NY271 split, with NY31E following State Street eastward through the eastern portion of the community. Along this stretch, the route serves Royalton–Hartland High School and Royalton-Hartland Middle School before exiting Middleport and entering a slightly more open area of the town of Royalton. NY31E runs past undeveloped land to the north and a smattering of homes to the south on <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Orleans County town of Shelby New York|Ridgeway]].|$|E

In between Chapel and State streets, NY36 and NY408 overlap for one block along Main Street. Immediately north of Mount Morris, NY36 passes through the northern tip of Letchworth State Park and crosses the Genesee River, which separates the towns of Mount Morris and Leicester. As the route heads north into Leicester, it begins to leave the flats in favor of a more northwesterly alignment that leads it into the village of Leicester.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{eventually}} migrated {{the development}} of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay, intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk. At its release, the 32-megabyte game would be the largest game Nintendo had ever created. Early in the game's development, concerns about the data storage constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto to imagine a worst-case scenario in which Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, and using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm. An idea that arose from this stage of development, a battle with a doppelganger of Ganondorf that rides through paintings, ultimately made <b>its</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> finished game as the boss of the Forest Temple dungeon.|$|E
