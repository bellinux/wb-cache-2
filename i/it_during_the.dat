It was financed by the Marquis of Buckingham until 1801 when it was closed, until various attempts were made to reopen <b>it</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 19th century.|$|E
5|$|From the 1987 Momentary Lapse of Reason tour onwards, Wright and touring keyboardist Jon Carin favoured Kurzweil digital synthesizers, {{including}} the K2000 keyboard and K2000S rack module for reproducing piano and electric piano sounds.

They also found many suits of white clothing scattered on the ground, abandoned when North Korean soldiers changed from civilian disguises into military uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling {{was essential to}} the process of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it too hot to touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to <b>it</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E

5|$|Calvin's first {{published}} work was a commentary of Seneca the Younger's De Clementia. Published {{at his own}} expense in 1532, it showed {{that he was a}} humanist in the tradition of Erasmus with a thorough understanding of classical scholarship. His first theological work, the Psychopannychia, attempted to refute the doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by the Anabaptists. Calvin probably wrote <b>it</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> period following Cop's speech, but it was not published until 1542 in Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|Centre Philippe Sella (born 1962), who {{was also}} in the 1987 team, played 111 times for France between 1982 and 1995, setting an {{appearances}} record that stood until Fabien Pelous broke <b>it</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2007 Rugby World Cup.

5|$|Colonel Neil Hamilton Fairley and Major Ian Murray Mackerras visited Port Moresby in June 1942, {{and noted}} that the {{garrison}} had suffered 1,184 cases of malaria, an infection rate of 149 per thousand. They recommended that to conserve quinine, men could be taken off <b>it</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> dry season, and observed for relapses. Fortunately, the climate in the Owen Stanley Range was not favourable to mosquitoes, and most cases were relapses by men infected in Port Moresby or Syria. Potts therefore decided on 24 August that anti-malarial precautions were no longer necessary.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, Coward {{acquired}} Goldenhurst Farm, in Aldington, Kent, {{making it}} his home {{for most of}} the next thirty years, except when the military used <b>it</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> Second World War. It is a Grade II listed building. In the 1950s, Coward left the UK for tax reasons, receiving harsh criticism in the press. He first settled in Bermuda but later bought houses in Jamaica and Switzerland (in the village of Les Avants, near Montreux), which remained his homes {{for the rest of his}} life. His expatriate neighbours and friends included Joan Sutherland, David Niven, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, and Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards in Switzerland and Ian Fleming and his wife Ann in Jamaica. Coward was a witness at the Flemings' wedding, but his diaries record his exasperation with their constant bickering.|$|E
5|$|Kafka {{finished}} {{none of his}} full-length {{novels and}} burned around 90 percent of his work, much of <b>it</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> period he lived in Berlin with Diamant, who helped him burn the drafts.

5|$|King Charles's Castle is {{a ruined}} {{artillery}} fort overlooking New Grimsby harbour {{on the island}} of Tresco in the Isles of Scilly. Built between 1548 and 1551 to protect the islands from French attack, it would have held a battery of guns and an accompanying garrison, designed to prevent enemy vessels from entering the harbour. The castle is polygonal in design, constructed from granite stone, with the gun battery at the front, and a dining room, kitchen and living accommodation at the rear. An additional defensive earthwork was constructed around <b>it</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 17th century. The design of the castle is unusual for the period, and is only seen elsewhere in blockhouses along the River Thames.|$|E

5|$|Offshore, a {{schooner}} carrying {{four people}} capsized in rough seas roughly 250mi (400km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina on June30. The four crew were {{a father and}} his three kids.
