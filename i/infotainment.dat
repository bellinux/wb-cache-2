40|$|International audienceData-flow {{oriented}} embedded systems, such as automotive systems used {{to render}} HMI (e. g., instrument clusters, <b>infotainments),</b> are increasingly built from highly variable specifications while targeting different constrained hardware platforms configurable in a fine-grained way. These variabilities at two different levels {{lead to a}} huge number of possible embedded system solutions, which feasibility is extremely complex and tedious to predetermine. In this paper, we propose a tooled approach that capture high level specifications as variable dataflows, and targeted platforms as variable component models. Dataflows can then be mapped onto platforms to express a specification of such variability-intensive systems. The proposed tool support transforms this specification into structural and behav-ioral variability models and reuses automated reasoning techniques to explore and assess the feasibility of all variants in a single run. We also report on the application of the proposed approach to an industrial case study of automotive instrument cluster...|$|R
