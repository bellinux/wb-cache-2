5|$|The Labour Party {{came into}} {{government}} {{under the leadership}} of Tony Blair in May 1997 after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by John Major; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule. Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the House of Commons, the Party had a working majority of 179 seats, and {{went on to win the}} 2001 and 2005 elections. During its first term in office Blair's government introduced many popular policies, including legislation to establish a national minimum wage, reducing the length of hospital waiting lists, and devolving lawmaking powers to Scotland and Wales. Blair also played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. But his decision to commit British troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq turned public opinion against him and lost him the support of some of his own MPs. When Blair stepped down as Prime Minister in June 2007 he was succeeded by his Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Blair's decade-long premiership had been a time of economic boom for the United Kingdom, but Brown's tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by the global recession of the latter part of the 2000s. Although commentators perceived Brown to have made some good decisions during the economic crisis, such as providing financial aid to several UK banks which found themselves in difficulty, his fiscal policy of borrowing and spending led to a <b>dramatic</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country's national debt. He was also viewed by the media as someone who lacked interpersonal skills. Another major event that occurred during Brown's time in government was the 2009 scandal involving MPs expenses, which damaged the public's trust in politicians.|$|E

25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the deep-water anchorage and improvements in port facilities, Stanley saw a <b>dramatic</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of visiting ships in the 1840s in part due to the California Gold Rush.

Stanley and the Falkland Islands are famous as the repository of many wrecks of 19th-century ships that reached the islands only to be condemned as unseaworthy and were often employed as floating warehouses by local merchants.|$|E
25|$|During the Jurassic {{there was}} a <b>dramatic</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> known {{diversity}} of family-level Coleoptera.

Close to the Upper Jurassic, the portion of the Cupedidae decreased, however {{at the same time the}} diversity of the early plant eating, or phytophagous species increased. Most of the recent phytophagous species of Coleoptera feed on flowering plants or angiosperms.|$|E

25|$|A federal {{environmental}} programme {{was established in}} 1971, and in 1972 laws were passed to regulate garbage elimination and air pollution via emission. Matching grants covering 90% of infrastructure development were allocated to local communities, {{which led to a}} <b>dramatic</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of public swimming pools and other facilities of consumptive infrastructure throughout West Germany. The federal crime-fighting apparatus was also modernised, while a Foreign Tax Act was passed which limited the possibility of tax evasion. In addition, efforts were made to improve the railways and motorways. In 1971, a law was passed setting the maximum lead content at 0.4 grams per liter of gasoline, and in 1972 DDT was banned. The Federal Immissions Control Law, passed in March 1974, provided protection from noxious gases, noise, and air-borne particulate matter.|$|E

25|$|They {{began as}} an elite corps of slaves made up of kidnapped young Christian boys who were forced to convert to Islam, and became famed for {{internal}} cohesion cemented by strict discipline and order. Unlike typical slaves, they were paid regular salaries. Forbidden to marry or engage in trade, their complete loyalty to the Sultan was expected. By the seventeenth century, due to a <b>dramatic</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> size of the Ottoman standing army, the corps' initially strict recruitment policy was relaxed. Civilians bought their way into {{it in order to}} benefit from the improved socioeconomic status it conferred upon them. Consequently, the corps gradually lost its military character, undergoing a process that has been described as 'civilianization'.

25|$|The DR {{is exposed}} {{to a number of}} natural hazards, such as hurricanes, storms, floods, drought, earthquakes, and fires. The {{destructive}} force of these phenomena can be enormous - in 1998 Hurricane Georges caused economic losses estimated at US$2,193 (14 percent of GNI), and 235 deaths. In particular, climate shocks have included a <b>dramatic</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frequency of major weather events over the past forty years, with 491 recorded major weather events during the previous decade, as compared to 126 from 1960 to 1969.

Alarmingly, flooding is mostly due to non-extreme weather events. Out of the recorded 464 major flooding events between 1966 and 2000, only 33 were caused by hurricanes or tropical storms, while the overwhelming majority of flooding was caused by precipitation during the rainy season.|$|E
