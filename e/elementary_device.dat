40|$|A central theorem in {{mathematical}} demography {{tells us that}} the age distribution of a closed population with unchanging fertility and mortality behavior must converge to a fixed and stable form. Proofs rely on ready-made theorems borrowed from linear algebra or from asymptotic transform theory, notably the Perron-Frobenius and the Tauberian theorems.

An <b>elementary</b> <b>device</b> allows us to view the birth sequence as the product of an exponential sequence and a weighted smoothing process.

40|$|High {{temperature}} superconducting {{technology has}} {{great potential for}} power engineering applications. The work presented in this thesis investigates measurement and modelling techniques of high temperature superconductors (HTSCs) {{with the intention of}} contributing to the skills, tools and understanding needed to assist in utilisation of HTSCs in electrical power engineering. Investigations of short and wires, plates and coils are discussed. Factors likely to affect the engineering performance of HTSCs in power engineering circuits are firstly discussed. An extensive test-rig has been assembled comprising cryogenic parts, instrumentation and a computerised data collecting system. Detailed measurements are made on the effects of magnetic fields and mechanical strains on HTSC performance. A new method for AC loss measurement of short HTSC wire using a calorimeter has been investigated and demonstrated. Calorimeters have been used before and have the advantage of being able to measure the total losses in a wire. The calorimeter presented here has a simple construction compared with previously reported calorimeters and uses widely available Styrofoam as a thermal insulator. In addition, the calorimeter was made sufficiently small that it could be inserted into a solenoid so that measurements on the effect of an external applied field on the HTSC sample could be undertaken. This method has been used to measure losses of HTSC wires carrying AC current as well as twisted and untwisted HTSC wire exposed to an external C field. It is shown that AC losses of short HTSC wire to a level of microwatts per centimetre could be measured. Comparison between measurement results and theoretical calculations verified the accuracy of the method. Other work on AC loss measurement has also been performed on long lengths of wire and a bulk HTSC plate. The results agree approximately with the theoretical predictions. Characterisation of and loss tests on two HTSC pancake coils carrying current have also been performed. The purpose is to investigate the behaviour of a coil as an <b>elementary</b> <b>device</b> in AC environments. The coils are prepared using Bi- 2223 /Ag wire. New methods in predicting the critical current of the coils have been investigated including the self-field effect in the coil and the critical current results from short lengths of the wire forming the coils. The magnetic fields generated in these coils and their effects on the coil are analysed using finite element methods verified using experimental results. AC loss prediction using face-to-face stacks of HTSC wire has also been described. A pancake coil with a relatively large diameter can be assumed as stacks of infinite wires. The prediction has been compared using the results of AC loss measurements using electrical methods. Finally, engineering models of HTSC wire and coils have been developed. The models have two functions: to represent the behaviour of HTSC wire and coils and to predict the behaviour of prospective wire and coils. All significant factors affecting the HTSC performance have also been included in the models. Subsequently, circuit models have been developed using PSpice. These models are needed to assist in the accurate development and implementation of HTSC devices, such as coils, in power engineering systems...|$|E

Introduction of the learning rule leads to the differentiation of sequence-detecting neurons and to the stabilization of ongoing temporal sequences. A network architecture composed of three layers of neuronal clusters is shown to exhibit active recognition and learning of time sequences by selection: the network spontaneously produces prerepresentations that are selected according to their resonance with the input percepts.

40|$|International audiencePotential {{discontinuities}} {{and spatial}} profiles govern the electronic properties of <b>elementary</b> <b>devices</b> like Schottky diodes and metal/insulator/semiconductor (MOS) structures. At interfaces between oxygenated diamond and other materials, two situations are examined: (1) Zr Schottky contact; (2) MOS capacitors, mainly using Al 2 O 3 as an insulator. In the first case, we give two experimental evidences of potential barrier inhomogeneities and/or domains, which almost vanish after annealing at 450 °C, with a simultaneous decrease of the homogeneous barrier height of 1. 4 eV, {{analogous to the}} change in electronic affinity when the oxygen terminations disappear from the surface. This evolution {{is the same for}} 4 other metals. The model able to comply with these experimental facts relies on the Mott-Schottky linear relationship which links the barrier height and the electronic affinity at a zero order of approximation, and on a correction term proportional to the charge transfer in interface bonds. This last term is able to justify the reverted slope observed regarding the dependence of the barrier height on the metal work function. In the second case, a capacitance measurement method is developed in order to show the projected interface states density and Fermi level pinning at the Al 2 O 3 /oxygenated diamond interface of MOS capacitors. Reasons for these results, based on bonding between carbon, adsorbates and insulator atoms, and possible routes to free the interface from this Fermi level pinning are discussed...|$|R

Here we describe the design and synthesis of novel alkyl substituted guanosine-ferrocene derivatives, and their self-assembly at the solid/liquid interface on highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG). Supramolecular self-assembly of these derivatives has been accomplished in solutions by NMR and CD spectroscopy and on surface by STM and AFM techniques. We have shown that supramolecular structures formed by ferrocene-exposing guanosines in solutions and at surfaces can be tuned by introducing sterically demanding substituents, ranging from G-ribbons to G 4 cation-free architectures. This self-assembly is governed by the formation of H-bonds between guanosines that dictates the spatial localization of ferrocenes, ultimately forming 1 D conjugated arrays that may be employed as prototypes of supramolecular nanowires. In this thesis we also explored the possibility of using porphyrin derivatives carrying ferrocene residues directly connected to the porphin core, as alternative approach to QCA implementation. Preliminary electrochemical studies using cyclic voltammetry show that porphyrins {{can be used as a}} two/four dots cells.
