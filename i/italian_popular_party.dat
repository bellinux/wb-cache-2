According to Cornwell, a succession of Popes took the view that Catholic party politics [...] "brought democracy into the church by the back door". Cornwell asserts that the result of the demise of the Popular Party was the [...] "wholesale shift of Catholics into the Fascist Party and the collapse of democracy in Italy".|$|E

50|$|During {{the exile}} {{of his brother}} Luigi, former {{secretary}} of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Party,</b> he exchanged with him many letters in which they discussed philosophy, theology, literature and mysticism.

From those letters emerges despite the difference of their personality and of their personal histories, their profounding spirituality- the common anxiety of sanctity, the great intellectual approach and pastoral charity which led them to deepen the cultural and social relevance of the faith lived in the internal of the church. The two brothers do not write about politics just as “special surveillants” of the fascist regime. In the central archive of the State there are over a thousand sheets that refer to Sturzo don Luigi, was Felix, anti fascist. For Mario exist about three hundred sheets in the same archive in two funds. Mons.

The office the mayor Luigi Sturzo is considered today among the most important political events in the history of Italy. Its relevance was also a moral and ethical, because of the corruption present in the municipal administration of then stimulated also by the central government. The Catholic's movement reached extraordinary dimensions and appearances, not only in doctrine and in projects, especially in the concrete achievements. It was about Sturzo - and then De Bono - the policy has been removed from the ford of the Vatican because of NOT EXPEDIT, preventing Catholics from politics and be elected to the Parliament, had come to support the corrupt men and finally supported the corrupt men of Giolitti.After the murder of Matteotti, Luigi Sturzo, as others opposers of Fascism, forced fist to resign of secretary of <b>Italian</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Party</b> and then to abandon Italy.

5000|$|In {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, the [...] "New Piagnoni" [...] found {{inspiration}} in the friar's writings and sermons for the Italian national awakening {{known as the}} Risorgimento. By emphasising his political activism over his puritanism and cultural conservatism they restored Savonarola's voice for radical political change. The venerable Counter Reformation icon ceded to the fiery Renaissance reformer. This somewhat anachronistic image, fortified by much new scholarship, informed the major new biography by Pasquale Villari, who regarded Savonarola's preaching against Medici despotism {{as the model for}} the Italian struggle for liberty and national unification. In Germany, the Catholic theologian and church historian Joseph Schnitzer edited and published contemporary sources which illuminated Savonarola's career. In 1924 he crowned his vast research with a comprehensive study of Savonarola's life and times in which he presented the friar as the last best hope of the Catholic Church before the catastrophe of the Protestant Reformation. In the <b>Italian</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Party</b> founded by Don Luigi Sturzo in 1919, Savonarola was revered as a champion of social justice, and after 1945 he was held up as a model of reformed Catholicism by leaders of the Christian Democratic Party. From this milieu, in 1952, came the third of the major Savonarola biographies, the Vita di Girolamo Savonarola by Roberto Ridolfi. For the next half century Ridolfi was the guardian of the friar's saintly memory as well as the dean of Savonarola research which he helped grow into a scholarly industry. Today, with most of Savonarola's treatises and sermons and many of the contemporary sources (chronicles, diaries, government documents and literary works) available in critical editions, scholars can provide fresh, better informed assessments of his character and his place in the Renaissance, the Reformation and modern European history. The present-day Church has considered his beatification.|$|E

40|$|U ovom prilogu autor prikazuje razvoj sukoba između Svete Stolice i talijanske vlade do kojeg je došlo zbog napada fašističkog tiska na organizacije katoličke omladine koja je djelovala u okviru talijanske Katoličke akcije. Prikaz se daje na temelju pisanja hrvatskog tiska o tom sukobu. U prilogu se objašnjavaju uzroci sukoba, tijek sukoba, oblici njegova manifestiranja, uloga fašističkog tiska u njegovu nastajanju i razvoju kao i njegov odjek u svijetu i u Hrvatskoj te njegov završetak. In 1929 Vatican signed Lateran {{treaties}} with the Italian government among which was Concordat, too. This pact guaranteed freedom of Catholic Church, as an apolitical organization under the supreme {{authority of the}} Holy See. In spite of this, in 1931 Italian fascists started to hound Catholic youth organizations within Italian Catholic Action. During these persecutions fascists did many violent and outrageous actions against members of these organizations. Moreover, fascistic press, under protection of Mussolini, organized a campaign against these organizations. Therefore, fascists blamed Catholic Action that supports antifascist politics of Italian Folks Party (Partito Popolare Italiano), whose work {{was at the time}} forbidden. Although there was no proof for such accusations at the end of May and beginning of June fascists started to publicly disgrace members of these organizations and to attack them. Moreover, they demolished some of the buildings and offices of these Catholic organizations, destroying the documentation, as well as they often interrupted religious services and festivities. Consequently, by the beginning of June Italian government proscribed activities of all Catholic youth organizations. On the other hand, the Holy See protested against such violence, and at the beginning of July 1931 pope issued encyclic Non abiamo bisogno. In this document pope had adjudged vexation of Catholic organizations, as well as he defended Catholic Action as non political organization that had no connections with <b>Italian</b> <b>Popular</b> <b>Party.</b> Similarly, pope maintained that Catholic Action did not depraved fascist’s government. Moreover, pope disagreed with the government’s statements about the education of youth since fascists claimed that only state has right to educate youngsters. During this period of accusations and harassment (May – August 1931) relations between Holy See and Italian government were quite tensed and there existed possibility that both sides cancel signed Lateran treaties. However, in August 1931 tensions calmed down and at the beginning of September a new treaty was signed, according to which both sides agreed that Catholic Action had to have strictly religious character and {{at the head of the}} organizations could be only bishops. Thus, fascist achieved their goal – Catholic organizations were driven away from the field of education. However, this treaty did not ensure them control over the entire Italian youth...|$|E
