5|$|The {{alleviation}} {{of widespread}} unemployment and <b>hunger</b> <b>in</b> Poplar {{had to be}} funded from money raised by the borough itself under the Poor Law. The poverty of the borough made this patently unfair and lead to the 1921 conflict between government and the local councillors known as the Poplar Rates Rebellion. Council meetings were for a time held in Brixton prison, and the councillors received wide support. Ultimately, {{this led to the}} abolition of the Poor Laws through the Local Government Act 1929.|$|E
5|$|The DRA {{wanted to}} recover the country's economy, and create new rules and regulations, but the {{situation}} required it to focus on overcoming widespread <b>hunger</b> <b>in</b> the country. The situation was complicated externally, provoked by Turkish and Azeri Muslim riots. In 1920 {{the situation in the}} country became worse, with apparent rapprochement between Soviet Russia and Kemal's Turkey. When the Turkish-Armenian war started in autumn 1920, Armenia was isolated and abandoned by Western allies. The newly formed League of Nations did not provide any help. Soviet Russia intensified its pressure on Armenia. Losing the war, Armenia signed the Treaty of Alexandropol on December 2, 1920, which resulted in the recognition of large territorial losses to Turkey. The Armenia military-revolutionary committee formed in Soviet Azerbaijan. Despite their tight grip on power, the ARF ceded power to the Communist Red Army troops invading from the north, which culminated with a Soviet takeover. The ARF was banned, its leaders exiled, and many of its members dispersed {{to other parts of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|The George McGovern–Robert Dole International Food for Education and Nutrition Program {{that was}} created in 2000, and funded largely through the Congress, {{would go on to}} provide more than 22 million meals to {{children}} in 41 countries over the next eight years. It was also credited with improving school attendance, especially among girls, who {{were more likely to be}} allowed to go to school if a meal was being provided. In August 2000, President Clinton presented McGovern with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in recognition of McGovern's service in the effort to eradicate world hunger. McGovern's book The Third Freedom: Ending <b>Hunger</b> <b>In</b> Our Time was published in January 2001; with its title making reference to Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech, it proposed a plan whereby chronic world hunger could be eliminated within thirty years. In January 2001, McGovern was asked to stay on at the UN post for a while by the incoming George W. Bush administration. His stint then concluded with a termination of mission on September 28, 2001.|$|E
