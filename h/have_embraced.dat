5|$|In 1937, Wigan was {{prominently}} {{featured in}} George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier which dealt, in large part, {{with the living}} conditions of England's working poor. Some <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> the Orwellian link, as it has provided the area with a modest tourist base over the years. Others regard this connection as disappointing, considering it an insinuation that Wigan is no better {{now than it was}} at the time of Orwell's writing.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{where much}} of the vampire {{folklore}} originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, vampire superstition is still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.|$|E

25|$|As a {{response}} to globalization, some countries <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> isolationist policies. For example, the North Korean government makes {{it very difficult for}} foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.|$|E
25|$|Traditionalist conservatism, {{also known}} as {{traditional}} conservatism, classical conservatism, traditionalism and Toryism (in the United Kingdom and Canada), is a political philosophy emphasizing {{the need for the}} principles of natural law and transcendent moral order, tradition, hierarchy, organic unity, classicism, high culture and the intersecting spheres of loyalty. Some traditionalists <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> the labels reactionary and counterrevolutionary, defying the stigma attached to these terms since the Enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|The dispute {{has led to}} much acrimony, and {{sometimes}} even to violence. Following canonical precepts, some adherents of the old calendar have chosen to abstain from clerical intercommunion with those synods which <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> the new calendar until the conflict is resolved. The monastic communities on Mount Athos have provided the strongest opposition to the new calendar, and to modernism in general, while still maintaining communion with their mother church.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, David Marr {{developed}} a multi-level theory of vision, which analyzed {{the process of}} vision {{at different levels of}} abstraction. In order to focus on the understanding of specific problems in vision, he identified three levels of analysis: the computational, algorithmic and implementational levels. Many vision scientists, including Tomaso Poggio, <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> these levels of analysis and employed them to further characterize vision from a computational perspective.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{the shift}} from {{commercial}} to conservation forestry, the Forestry Commission <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> the desire for public access. The emphasis at Bedford Purlieus is on 'quiet recreation' to minimise {{the impact on the}} woodland flora and fauna. A car park is available, accessed from the A47. There is a network of rides and paths within the wood, and it is open every day during daylight hours.|$|E
25|$|Other schools, {{such as the}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Cincinnati <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> {{experimental}} or contemporary architecture. The MIT campus features {{work from}} Modernists such as Eero Saarinen and I.M. Pei, as well as contemporary buildings by architects such as Steven Holl. Similarly, Cincinnati's campus features the work of many Modernists, and contemporary architects, such as Frank Gehry, Machado and Silvetti, and Michael Graves, an iconic postmodern architect.|$|E

25|$|On July 29, 1943, the Royal Air Force's firebombing of Hamburg led Himmler {{to order}} the {{immediate}} evacuation of the main Ahnenerbe headquarters in Berlin. The extensive library was moved to Schloss Oberkirchberg near Ulm while the staff {{was moved to the}} tiny village of Waischenfeld near Bayreuth, Bavaria. The building selected was the 17th century Steinhaus. While much of the staff was not ecstatic about the primitive conditions, Sievers seemed to <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> the isolation.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{source of}} resentment were the political views {{that he and}} his associates were thought to <b>have</b> <b>embraced.</b> Critias, who appears in two of Plato's Socratic dialogues, was a leader of the Thirty Tyrants (the ruthless oligarchic regime that ruled Athens, as puppets of Sparta and backed by Spartan troops, for eight months in 404–403 BC until they were overthrown). Several of the Thirty had been students of Socrates, {{but there is also a}} record of their falling out.|$|E
25|$|The SD70M-2 {{was not a}} big seller, as {{most major}} {{carriers}} were purchasing AC traction locomotives exclusively {{by the time of}} its introduction. Only 331 SD70M-2's were built. Canadian National Railway owns 190 units, and 130 units are owned by Norfolk Southern Railway. 8 units owned by Electro-Motive Diesel and 3 units owned by CIT Financial were leased by Florida East Coast Railway until early 2015. CN 8964, built December 2010 was the last SD70M-2, and will most likely be the last new DC traction locomotive since holdouts, CN and NS, <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> the AC traction concept.|$|E

25|$|Many {{leadership}} {{roles in the}} organized church have been restricted to males. In the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches, only men may serve as priests or deacons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as pope, patriarch, and bishop. Women may serve as abbesses. Most mainstream Protestant denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups, most notably the Southern Baptist Convention, are tightening their constraints in reaction. Most all Charismatic and Pentecostal churches were pioneers in this matter and <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> {{the ordination of women}} since their founding.|$|E
25|$|Though Frei Pedro de Poiares conjectured Barcelos was Vicente's birthplace, {{evidence}} for this is scarce. Pires de Lima, on the other hand, proposed Guimarães, which better accounts for Vicente's identification as a jeweller. The people of Guimarães <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> this theory; a municipal school in Urgezes is named after the playwright. There's some stories about Gil Vicente's father,that was from this parish in Guimarães, so, people believe that Gil Vicente have lived here too. Another conjecture places his birthplace at Lisbon. The Beira region is also a candidate because of various references to it in his plays, more exactly the location of Guimarães de Tavares, that has been mistaken with Guimarães.|$|E
25|$|The Gothic Revival period lasted {{longer and}} was more {{thoroughly}} embraced in Canada than in either Britain or the United States, only {{falling out of}} style in the 1930s. The late 19th and early 20th centuries was also the period when many major Canadian institutions were founded. Throughout Canada {{many of the most}} prominent religious, civic, and scholastic institutions are housed in Gothic Revival style buildings. In the 1960s and 1970s several scholars, most notably Alan Gowans, embraced Canadian Gothic Revival architecture as one of the nation's signature styles and {{as an integral part of}} Canadian nationalism. While largely abandoned in the modernist period, several postmodern architects <b>have</b> <b>embraced</b> Canada's neo-Gothic past.|$|E
