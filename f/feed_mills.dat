[...] In 1998, the company's $2.8 billion asset base included nitrogen complexes in the U.S. and abroad; the second-largest petroleum refinery in the Midwest; phosphate mining operations; grain storage capacity of 145 million bushels; diverse feed manufacturing entities that included <b>feed</b> <b>mills,</b> spray dry plants and commodity sheds; 12 meat plants; and a transportation fleet {{of more than}} 4,400 rail cars, 1,060 over-the-road trucks and 1,850 trailers, and interest in 100 dry cargo barges and several ocean-vessels. [...] During this time, the company continued its mission to benefit the independent family farmer and farming interests, stating its mission [...] "to be a global, consumer-driven, producer-owned 'farm-to-table' cooperative system." ...|$|E
2500|$|The American windmill, or wind engine, {{was invented}} by Daniel Halladay in 1854 and was used mostly for lifting water from wells. Larger {{versions}} were also used for tasks such as sawing wood, chopping hay, and shelling and grinding grain. In early California and some other states, the windmill {{was part of a}} self-contained domestic water system which included a hand-dug well and a wooden water tower supporting a redwood tank enclosed by wooden siding known as a tankhouse. During the late 19th century steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction. [...] At their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use. Firms such as U.S. Wind Engine and Pump Company, Challenge Wind Mill and Feed Mill Company, Appleton Manufacturing Company, Star, Eclipse, Fairbanks-Morse, Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company and Aermotor became the main suppliers in North and South America. These windpumps are used extensively on farms and ranches in the United States, Canada, Southern Africa, and Australia. They feature a large number of blades, so they turn slowly with considerable torque in low winds and are self-regulating in high winds. [...] A tower-top gearbox and crankshaft convert the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Such mills pumped water and powered <b>feed</b> <b>mills,</b> saw mills, and agricultural machinery.|$|E

2500|$|Farmland's founder, Howard A. Cowden, {{was born}} in 1893 on a southwestern Missouri farm settled by his grandfather. [...] Unlike other farms in his native Polk County, which {{averaged}} less than 100 acres in size, the Cowden farm at 500 acres {{was one of the}} largest. [...] Cowden believed strongly that farmers were at an economic disadvantage in the marketplace: they faced high interest rates on mortgages, paid high transportation costs, and had virtually no leverage in the pricing of their commodities. [...] He believed that farmers were faced with a [...] "take-it-or-leave-it" [...] proposition. [...] Cowden became active in the organization of agricultural cooperatives and in 1929 formed a new firm, Union Oil Company, which he organized as a cooperative under Missouri statutes. [...] Since Union Oil was intended as a regional enterprise, Cowden elected to establish headquarters in Kansas City, Missouri. [...] By the end of its first year of operation, Union Oil served 22 local cooperatives and was supplied by Kanotex Corporation. [...] Union Oil became the first cooperative in the country to run an oil-compounding plant. [...] With the organization becoming involved {{in a wide range of}} products, it was decided in February 1935 to change the name to [...] "Consumers Cooperative Association" [...] (CCA). [...] CCA had 259 local cooperatives as members and was generating more than $2 million in annual revenues. [...] CCA established a grocery division in 1935 and soon the CO-OP label was applied to over 200 products. [...] To support its petroleum business, CCA built a refinery in Phillipsburg, Kansas. [...] When it became operational in 1939, the facility greatly increased the organization's income and led to a period of prosperity during the 1940s. [...] CCA became involved in a variety of other areas, including the production of flour and feed, the manufacture of household and electrical appliances, and the development of insurance and finance associations. [...] Of particular importance was the feed program, which in its first year generated more revenue than the grocery business did in its tenth year. [...] Another highly profitable business for CAA was fertilizer, which farmers began to use at an accelerated rate. [...] By 1958, CCA topped $100 million in annual revenues, ranked 327th among the Fortune 500, and was one of the largest cooperatives in America. [...] In many ways it was considered an industrial powerhouse, controlling a wide range of assets: oil wells, pipelines, refineries, grease and paint factories, <b>feed</b> <b>mills,</b> fertilizer works, warehouses, and a fleet of trucks. [...] Petroleum products continued to dominate the cooperative's business, accounting for 70 percent of revenues, but that percentage would dip below 50 percent over the next few years as fertilizer became an increasingly more important revenue stream. [...] The emphasis of CCA turned to the farm supply and service field, making the use of the word [...] "consumer" [...] in its title less appropriate. [...] The organization also faced mounting pressure to better serve farmers by engaging in the marketing of agricultural products, an area which CCA had intentionally avoided. [...] In 1958, the CCA Board agreed to become involved in marketing as opportunities might arise. [...] A year later the cooperative purchased the Crawford County Packing Company in Denison, Iowa, and entered the pork processing business, ultimately acquiring food manufacturing facilities throughout the Midwest. [...] During the course of developing its food processing capability, the cooperative sought to improve operating efficiencies, marketing strategies and the relationship with facility employees.|$|E
