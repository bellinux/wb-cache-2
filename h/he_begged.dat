5|$|Chnodomar {{himself and}} his retinue tried to escape on horseback, hoping to reach some boats {{prepared}} for just such an emergency near the ruined Roman fort of Concordia (Lauterbourg), some 40km downstream from Strasbourg. But they were cornered by a Roman cavalry squadron in a wood {{on the bank of}} the Rhine and surrendered. Brought before Julian, whom <b>he</b> <b>begged</b> for mercy, Chnodomar was sent on to the court of Constantius at Milan. Not long afterwards, he died of disease in a camp for barbarian prisoners in Rome.|$|E

In 1910 the Berg family moved again, to the Roseville section of Newark. Roseville offered Bernard Berg everything he wanted in a neighborhoodgood schools, middle-class residents, and very few Jews.|$|E

5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because <b>he</b> <b>begged</b> and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|Too weak {{to stand}} or walk, Beauchamp was loaded onto a cart to be {{conveyed}} to the gallows. <b>He</b> <b>begged</b> to see Anna, but the guards {{told him she}} was not seriously injured. The guards finally allowed him to see Anna, and Beauchamp was angered that they had underplayed her critical condition. He stayed with her until he could no longer feel her pulse; then the guards took him to the gallows to be hanged before he died of his stab wounds.|$|E

25|$|With the {{announced}} {{retirement of}} Cardinal Jaime Sin, {{one of the}} beloved architects of the People Power Movement of the EDSA Revolution, the Papal Nuncio told Archbishop Rosales of his impending appointment as archbishop of Manila. <b>He</b> <b>begged</b> the Nuncio with tears not to have him appointed, but the Nuncio did not relent.

25|$|The Prince's lifelong {{resentment of}} his forced {{marriage}} to a social inferior persisted, and found unchivalrous expression in a bitter letter, his last to the king, in which <b>he</b> <b>begged</b> that his wife never be released from her exile to the countryside. Nonetheless, Claire-Clémence de Maillé had brought the Prince of Condé a dowry of 600,000 livres, the manors of Ansac, Mouy, Cambronne, Plessis-Billebault, Galissonnière and Brézé, and, on one occasion, liberation from the King's dungeon.|$|E

Fitzsimmons knocked out Dempsey (from whom the later Jack Dempsey took his name) in the 13th round to become the World Middleweight Champion. Fitzsimmons knocked Dempsey down at least 13 times and by the finish left him in such a pitiable {{condition}} that <b>he</b> <b>begged</b> him to quit.

25|$|Very outspoken {{about his}} ideas, <b>he</b> <b>begged</b> Nicholas II {{to cancel the}} {{coronation}} ball at the French embassy in Moscow following the Khodynka Tragedy, warning him that holding it would create a perception of monarchical indifference such as had made Marie Antoinette unpopular. When it was held nevertheless, he arrived with his brothers, then departed soon after in protest. His manner could turn caustic. The Imperial family always {{said he had a}} mean and critical tongue. He loathed Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and her family, the Vladimirovichi. A vehement critic of most of his male cousins, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich in particular, Nicholas Mikhailovich was a divisive figure among the Romanovs.|$|E
25|$|But <b>he</b> <b>begged</b> the Court's indulgence because under Kenosha v. Bruno, {{another one}} of the cases {{following}} Monroe, if the school district had the same Eleventh Amendment immunity as a municipality Doyle could not seek equitable relief such as his reinstatement against the board as an entity; {{he would have had to}} do it against the members personally. If the case were remanded in its present state, he said, he would be unable to proceed even if he won on all the other issues. Since Congress had changed the federal-question statute since Bivens, he felt that created the implied cause of action from the enabling language in the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{grew up in}} East Lansing, Michigan. In youth hockey, Miller {{originally}} {{played as}} a forward. However, Miller became frustrated with the poor play of his team's goaltender, so <b>he</b> <b>begged</b> his coach {{as well as his}} father, Dean Miller, to let him try it out. His father told him that if he could get two goals and three assists the next game he would buy Ryan a catching glove. Miller finished the game with two goals and three assists in the win. His brother Drew is currently a free agent and three cousins (Kelly Miller, Kip Miller and Kevin Miller) all played in the NHL. All five attended Michigan State University, where Ryan Miller played goalie for three years.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} of Ibsen's Ghost at Toole's Theatre in London {{was seen by}} William Archer, the translator of Ibsen's works into English. Apparently comfortable with the parody, he enjoyed the humour of the play and recommended it to others. Barrie's third play Walker, London (1892) resulted in him being introduced to a young actress named Mary Ansell. He proposed to her and they were married on 9 July 1894. Barrie bought her a Saint Bernard puppy, who {{played a part in}} the novel The Little White Bird. He used Ansell's given name for many characters in his novels. Barrie also authored Jane Annie, a comic opera for Richard D'Oyly Carte (1893), which unfortunately failed. <b>He</b> <b>begged</b> his friend Arthur Conan Doyle to revise and finish it for him.|$|E
25|$|Born in Rochester, New York, Wang is {{the second}} of three sons of {{immigrants}} from Taiwan of waishengren heritage. His father, a pediatrician, and his mother, moved to the United States to further their college studies in the early 1960s. Influenced by his older brother, Leo Wang, who had been taking violin lessons since he was seven, Wang began to develop a curious interest towards the violin and its musical counterparts when he was three. <b>He</b> <b>begged</b> his mother {{to put him in}} violin lessons with his brother but his mother was against it, reasoning that he was too young. When Wang turned six, his mother enrolled him in violin classes, performing along with his brother. As he became a teenager, he began taking piano lessons, also teaching himself the guitar. He also worked several jobs to earn money to buy a second hand drum kit.|$|E
25|$|After his {{accession}} as the tributary {{ruler of}} Upper Assam under British Government, Purandar Singha began well with his accounts of payments of revenue. But within three year, {{he began to}} make default in his payments. <b>He</b> <b>begged</b> for a considerable reduction {{in the amount of}} revenue, as he explained that the country was badly ravaged by the Burmese invaders, affecting all spheres of life of the people, which includes social and economical. Imposing taxation was also difficult because unlike other parts of India, common people in Assam did not use or very rarely use money for any business transaction or in daily business. Captain Jenkins, the new Commissioner and Political Agent, held an enquiry into Purandar Singh’s administration and found it a hot bed of corruption and misfeasance. His subjects were oppressed and misgoverned and his rule is very distasteful to the bulk of the population. Purandar Singha was himself found guilty of gathering personal fortune rather than concentrating on good governance for his people.|$|E
50|$|The song is a ballad, with Bandeira {{lamenting the}} end of a relationship. From the lyrics, it seems that he {{inadvertently}} caused this to happen. <b>He</b> <b>begs</b> his lover not to leave him, but ultimately appears resigned to his fate.|$|R
