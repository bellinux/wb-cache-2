5|$|In 1940, Hearst {{decided to}} give the monastery away. The {{government}} of Francisco Franco requested that it be returned to Spain, but Hearst refused. In August 1941, Herbert Fleishhacker, director of the M. H. <b>de</b> <b>Young</b> Memorial Museum, convinced Hearst to give the stones to the City of San Francisco {{in exchange for the}} city's payment of his $25,000 storage debt. Hearst stipulated the stones be used to construct a group of museum buildings adjoining the <b>de</b> <b>Young</b> Museum in Golden Gate Park. The city moved the crates from the warehouse to store them outdoors behind the museum and the Japanese Tea Garden, allotting only $5,000 for trucking and for building rough sheds and protective covers. The museum plan was estimated to cost $500,000, but that amount was not available. Morgan prepared several layouts for the city to approve, each with a different arrangement of the buildings than in Spain. However, in December 1941, the U.S. was drawn into World War II and the museum plans were shelved. Picking up the project in 1946, the city paid Morgan to construct a scale model of the complex of buildings which was to be the Museum of Medieval Arts, a West Coast version of The Cloisters in New York.|$|E

It was {{installed}} in the <b>de</b> <b>Young</b> Museum, the centerpiece of Hearst Court, the main exhibit hall.

5|$|In 1983 and 1987, Davis made {{unsuccessful}} {{requests for}} all of the chapter house stones. After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the <b>de</b> <b>Young</b> museum was to be rebuilt, {{and the future of the}} stones was reconsidered. In September 1993, museum director Harry Parker joined with Davis to sign an unconditional permanent loan of the chapter house stones to New Clairvaux. In 1994, the city approved the loan with the stipulation that the building be restored accurately and that it be occasionally open to the public. The stones were transported in 20 truckloads to Vina. Inside an old brick barn built by Stanford to make brandy, the stones began to be fitted together, laid flat on Burke's plywood templates.|$|E

The 1848 finding of gold in California, prompted Savage's father to join the California Gold Rush in 1850. Savage {{and the rest of his}} family left New York in 1851 to join his father. They arrived in San Francisco in February 1852. Savage was among the first boys to attend public school in the new city, along with future poet Charles Warren Stoddard and the brothers Gus, Charles and Harry <b>de</b> <b>Young</b> who would found the San Francisco Chronicle. While the younger Savage was in school, his father helped discover the rich silver deposits of the Comstock Lode.|$|E

25|$|Weston had {{a series}} of {{important}} one-man exhibitions in 1930-31. The first was at Alma Reed's Delphic Studio Galley in New York, followed closely by a mounting of the same show at the Denny Watrous Gallery in Carmel. Both received rave reviews, including a two-page article in the New York Times Magazine. These were followed by shows at <b>De</b> <b>Young</b> Museum in San Francisco and the Galerie Jean Naert in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The {{exhibition}} {{started in}} Los Angeles, {{then moved to}} Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Chicago and Philadelphia. The exhibition then moved to London before finally returning to Egypt in August 2008. An encore of the exhibition in the United States ran at the Dallas Museum of Art from October 2008 to May 2009. The tour continued to other U.S. cities. After Dallas the exhibition moved to the <b>de</b> <b>Young</b> Museum in San Francisco, followed by the Discovery Times Square Exposition in New York City.|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} time a small group of like-minded photographers in the San Francisco area, led by Van Dyke and Ansel Adams, began informally meeting to discuss their common {{interest}} and aesthetics. Inspired by Weston's show at the <b>De</b> <b>Young</b> Museum the previous year, they approached the museum with the idea of mounting a group exhibition of their work. They named themselves Group f/64, and in November, 1932, an exhibition of 80 of their prints opened at the museum. The show was a critical success.|$|E
