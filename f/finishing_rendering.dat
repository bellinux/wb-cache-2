50|$|In {{the overall}} {{creation}} process {{there is also}} a distinction between <b>finish</b> <b>render</b> and final <b>render.</b> <b>Finish</b> <b>rendering</b> refers to the process, and final rendering refers to the schedule. The first <b>finish</b> <b>rendering</b> may not be the final rendering; the first <b>finish</b> <b>rendering</b> could be the first of many renderings, with each subsequent <b>finish</b> <b>rendering</b> needing refinement before the final version is created.|$|R

50|$|Interlacing {{has been}} criticized because {{it may not be}} clear to viewers when the image has <b>finished</b> <b>rendering,</b> unlike non-interlaced rendering, where {{progress}} is apparent (remaining data appears as blank). Also, the benefits of interlacing to those on low-speed connections may be outweighed by having to download a larger file, as interlaced images typically do not compress as well.|$|R

50|$|For {{traditional}} media (such as paint), {{the division}} between layout and comp is more clear-cut than for computer-generated art. For traditional media, the distinction between layout and comp is typically one of refinement and presentation. Layouts and comps are often done on different substrates because of this (e.g., tracing paper for a layout vs. calendered bond paper or illustration board for a comp). In this case, a layout done on tracing paper could be laid over other media (e.g., a photo) {{to see how it}} would eventually appear after <b>finish</b> <b>render,</b> and to ascertain overall feasibility, and the comp could be done on opaque bond paper or illustration board as a presentation piece for a client's approval.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we give an {{overview}} of our research on nonphotorealistic rendering methods for computer-generated pencil drawing. Our approach {{to the problem of}} simulating pencil drawings was to break it down into the subproblems of (1) simulating first the drawing materials (graphite pencil and drawing paper, blenders and kneaded eraser), (2) developing drawing primitives (individual pencil strokes and mark-making to create tones and textures), (3) simulating the basic rendering techniques (outlining and shading of 3 D models) used by artists and illustrators familiar with pencil rendering, and (4) implementing the control of drawing steps from preparatory sketches to <b>finished</b> <b>rendering</b> results. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach with a variety of images generated from reference images and 3 D models...|$|R

40|$|The current paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a 3 D character generation and multilingual talking emulation software application. Traditional lip sync techniques in 3 D graphics productions require a careful (and painful) design at the pre-render phase, as well as the selection of the mostly matching phrases during audio dubbing. This paper proposes a completely different approach, whereas graphic designers are not worried about facial animation for lip sync purposes. When the scene’s sequence modeling is <b>finished,</b> <b>rendering</b> starts just after an automatic modification procedure where faces are morphed according to the driving sound. In case of a multilingual production, rendering for each different language is required, but the content of the dialogues is not depended on the original facial expressions formed according to the original language. Based on our experimentation, we suggest a “standardized face ” format for 3 d graphic popular platforms in combination with the developed algorithm for automated lip sync, translation and rendering...|$|R

6000|$|As he was {{dressing}} for dinner his eye fell on a card announcing the [...] "at home" [...] {{of one of}} his own cousins. Her husband was a composer, and he had a vague idea that he would find at the house of a composer some quite unusually free kind of atmosphere. After dining at the club, therefore, he set out for Chelsea. The party was held in a large room on the ground-floor, which was already crowded with people when Shelton entered. They stood or sat about in groups with smiles fixed on their lips, and the light from balloon-like lamps fell in patches on their heads and hands and shoulders. Someone had just <b>finished</b> <b>rendering</b> on the piano a composition of his own.
