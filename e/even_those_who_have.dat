5|$|Who's Your City? was {{intended}} to be a self-help book, based on scholarly research and an academic theory, that provided a reader the mental framework necessary to match their personality and life situation with the optimum city to reside. Florida drew upon his past research on the geographical aspects of wealth generation and locational decisions of members of the creative class, as well as theories and opinions of other academics, like Jane Jacobs, and <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been critical of Florida's work, like Tim Harford. New research included a psychological aspect to his theory. Maps, graphs, tables, and indices illustrate the text.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E
25|$|Guanyin is {{immensely popular}} among Chinese Buddhists, {{especially}} those from devotional schools. She is generally {{seen as a}} source of unconditional love and, more importantly, as a saviour. In her bodhisattva vow, Guanyin promises to answer the cries and pleas of all sentient beings and to liberate them from their own karmic woes. Based on the Lotus Sutra and the Shurangama sutra, Avalokitesvara is generally seen as a saviour, both spiritually and physically. The sutras state that through his saving grace <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> no chance of being enlightened can be enlightened, and those deep in negative karma can still find salvation through his compassion.|$|E

25|$|The plot of Thunderstorm {{centers on}} one family's {{psychological}} and physical destruction {{as a result of}} incest, as perpetrated at the hands of its morally depraved and corrupt patriarch, Zhou Puyuan. Although it is undisputed that the prodigious reputation achieved by Thunderstorm was {{due in large part to}} its scandalous public airing of the topic of incest, and many people have pointed out technical imperfections in its structure, Thunderstorm is nevertheless considered to be a milestone in China's modern theatrical ascendancy. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> questioned the literary prowess of Cao Yu, for instance, the noted critic C. T. Hsia, admit that the popularization and consolidation of China's theatrical genre is fundamentally owed to the first works of Cao Yu.|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Tal Blevins scored it 8.9 out of 10, praising Bungie {{for seeking}} fan {{feedback}} from The Fallen Lords, and implementing the most requested changes.

For example, in the opening sentence of his 1880 article Venn writes, [...] "Schemes of diagrammatic representation have been so familiarly introduced into logical treatises during the last century or so, that many readers, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> made no professional study of logic, may be supposed to be acquainted with the general nature and object of such devices. Of these schemes one only, viz. that commonly called 'Eulerian circles,' has met with any general acceptance..."

2500|$|Quakers {{have engaged}} in peace {{testimony}} by protesting against wars, refusing to serve in armed forces if drafted, seeking conscientious objector status when available, and even to participating in acts of civil disobedience. Not all Quakers embrace this testimony as an absolute; for example, there were Friends that fought in World War I and World War II. Some others were firm [...] During extreme circumstances it has been difficult for some Quakers to engage in and uphold this testimony, yet Friends have almost universally been committed to the ideal of peace, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{felt the need to}} compromise on their testimony. Apart from the specific question of war, other ways in which Friends have testified to peace have included vegetarianism and a commitment to restorative justice.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike its {{discipline}} regarding sacraments, the Catholic Church {{does not}} exclude from receiving sacramentals, {{such as the}} placing of ashes on the head, {{those who are not}} Catholics and perhaps not even baptized. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been excommunicated and are therefore forbidden to celebrate sacramentals are not forbidden to receive them. After describing the blessing, the rite of Blessing and Distribution of Ashes (within Mass) states: [...] "Then the Priest places ashes on the heads of all those present who come to him." [...] The Catholic Church does not limit distribution of blessed ashes to within church buildings and has suggested the holding of celebrations in shopping centres, nursing homes, and factories. Such celebrations presume preparation of an appropriate area and include readings from Scripture (at least one) and prayers, and are somewhat shorter if the ashes are already blessed.|$|E
2500|$|Eurogamer's Dan Pearson {{commented that}} those {{looking for a}} {{traditional}} role-playing game for the Nintendo DS should buy something like Chrono Trigger, [...] or , or the Final Fantasy remakes, though he noted that those looking for a Pokémon title should get Platinum. Eurogamer Portugal's Ricardo Madeira called it the [...] "more complete and distinct Pokémon third version he has seen to date." [...] IGN's Craig Harris commented that while the improvements over Diamond and Pearl were not huge, its adventure mode and online mode were more fleshed out and expanded. They also included it in their list of Nintendo DS games of the Spring season, commenting that it improved on Diamond and Pearls gameplay formula, and went [...] "above and beyond with new areas, characters, and, of course, Pokemon". In their [...] "Cheers & Tears: DS RPGs" [...] article, which details role-playing games of both high and low quality, IGN included Platinum as a game of high quality. They called it [...] "packed to overflowing with content", commenting that <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> played Diamond and Pearl several times could enjoy it. IGN ultimately named Platinum, along with Diamond and Pearl, as the ninth best Nintendo DS game. IGN nominated it for best role-playing game for the Nintendo DS, while its readers chose it as the best multi-player game for the Nintendo DS.|$|E

60|$|Her {{heart was}} beating fast as she descended the stairway, bright spots of colour flaming in her cheeks and the {{diamonds}} sparkling in her ears.

But <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> felt the silence and the stir that prefaces the clamorous applause of the thousands could not know the thrill that swept her under his tribute.

The town has but few strangers, though the presence of a court renders it a little more gay than it was last year. The aspect of everything is gloomy, for the country may be again engaged in a war of existence, in a week. Many still think the affair will end in a partition; France, Prussia, and Holland getting the principal shares. I make no doubt that everybody will profit more by the change than they who brought it about.|$|E

It is amongst such, too, that your kinsman has found friends and associates. Neglecting the old friends of his house, as too grave and formal companions for the humour of the times, his intercourse has been with the versatile Shaftesbury--the mercurial Buckingham--men who would not hesitate to sacrifice to the popular Moloch of the day, whatsoever or whomsoever, whose ruin could propitiate the deity.--Forgive a mother's tears, kinsman; but I see the scaffold at Bolton again erected. If Derby goes to London while these bloodhounds are in full cry, obnoxious as he is, and I have made him by my religious faith, and my conduct in this island, he dies his father's death.

They have issued an amnesty, pardoning <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{committed}} the most frightful atrocities upon us. They have infuriated a portion of the mulattoes by announcing the repeal of the decree in their favour. Without a shadow of legal authority they have extorted large sums of money from those mulattoes who have remained quiet and are resident here, and seem bent upon extracting all that remains of their late fortune from the whites. One of them is frequently drunk and leads a scandalous life; another appears bent solely upon enriching himself; the third seems to be a well-meaning man, but he is wholly under the control of his drunken companion. If {{this is the sort of}} aid we are to receive from France, our future is hopeless indeed. And, indeed, no small portion of my friends begin to see that unless England takes possession of the island the future is altogether hopeless. The general opinion here is that it is impossible that peace can much longer be maintained between England and France, and they hope that one of the first steps England will take after war is declared will be to land an army here." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{whiteness}} {{of the white}} flower where there is any red is never unhuman, probably because a very brilliant red or rose colour on some delicate skins causes the light flesh-tints to appear white by contrast, and is the complexion known as [...] "milk and roses." [...] The apple-blossom is a beautiful example, and the beloved daisy--the [...] "wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower," [...] which {{would be so much}} less dear but for that touch of human crimson. This is the herb-Margaret of so many tender and pretty legends, that has white for purity and red for repentance. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> never read these legends and that prettiest, most pathetic of all which tells of the daisy's origin, find a secret charm in the flower. Among other common examples are the rosy-white hawthorn, wood anemone, bindweed, dropwort, and many others. In the dropwort the rosy buds are seen among the creamy white open flowers; and the expression is always very marked and beautiful when there is any red or purple tinge or blush on cream-whites and ivory-whites. When we look from the dropwort to its nearest relative, the common meadow-sweet, we see how great a charm the touch of rose-red has given to the first: the meadow-sweet has no expression of the kind we are considering--no human association.|$|E
60|$|But {{that they}} will do so is my hope always and, on the whole, except in moods of {{depression}} and impatience, my belief. When one has travelled to a conviction so great as mine {{it is difficult to}} doubt that other men faced by the same universal facts will not come to the same conclusion. I believe that only through a complete simplification o religion to its fundamental idea, to a world-wide realisation of God as the king of the heart and of all mankind, setting aside monarchy and national egotism altogether, can mankind come to any certain happiness and security. The precedent of Islam helps my faith in the creative inspiration of such a renascence of religion. The Sikh, the Moslem, the Puritan have shown that men can fight better for a Divine Idea than for any flag or monarch in the world. It seems to me that illusions fade and effigies lose credit everywhere. It is a very wonderful thing to me that China is now a republic.... I take myself to be very nearly an average man, abnormal only by reason of a certain mental rapidity. I conceive myself to be thinking as the world thinks, and if I find no great facts, I find a hundred little indications to reassure me that God comes. <b>Even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> neither the imagination nor the faith to apprehend God as a reality will, I think, realise presently that the Kingdom of God over a world-wide system of republican states, is the only possible formula under which we may hope to unify and save mankind.|$|E

50|$|The Thermidorian regime {{excluded}} {{the remaining}} Montagnards from power, <b>even</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> joined in conspiring against Robespierre and Saint-Just.
