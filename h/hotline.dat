5|$|LOCOG faced further {{criticism}} for how it handled {{the sale of}} tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online sale of tickets for wheelchair areas {{was replaced by a}} dedicated telephone <b>hotline.</b> Organisers were criticised for their use of an 0844 revenue share number for this <b>hotline,</b> and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be charged by the minute. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the <b>hotline.</b> LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.|$|E

A total of eighty-four billboards, including digital signs donated by Clear Channel, were also placed across the state of Massachusetts, encouraging individuals to report tips to the anonymous hotlines created for the child.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Many {{anticipated}} deployment scenarios, {{in particular}} military, healthcare, and disaster-recovery applications, of Wireless Sensor Networks require reliable source to sink communication. In this paper, we introduce a novel reliable topology that uses <b>hotlines</b> between sensor gateways {{to enhance the}} reliability of end-to-end transmissions. These <b>hotlines</b> {{reduce the number of}} average hops from source to the sink and serve as reliable and efficient backbone routing alternatives. We show analytically that communication using <b>hotlines</b> is noticeably more reliable than traditional Wireless Sensor Networks routing...|$|R

5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} Tropical Storm Warning from Englewood to Indian Pass, Florida while Henri was a {{tropical}} depression; however, warnings were discontinued {{by the time}} Henri made landfall. Flood warnings were issued across the state prior to the storm making landfall, with predictions of 5 to 10inches (125 – 255mm) of rainfall. As {{a result of the}} storm's approach, twelve shelters were placed on standby. Similarly, the Hurricane Shelter Information <b>Hotline</b> was placed on standby and ready to be activated within 10minutes. Levy County officials declared a state of emergency. There, sand bags and sand were sent to Cedar Key, Yankeetown, and Inglis in anticipation for storm surge and flooding.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{countries}} {{regulate the}} use of the term [...] "counselor". Telephone counseling and crisis <b>hotlines</b> provide a similar telephone support service, and both usually accept crisis and non-crisis calls. In the United States, many college campuses have established telephone counseling lines serviced by student volunteers to compensate for the high demand placed on college mental health services. These <b>hotlines</b> serve callers in crisis, but also serve to provide a listening ear for people who [...] "just need to talk." [...] Typically, <b>hotlines</b> are staffed by volunteers, and are not intended to replace professional, long-term counseling services. They are rather intended to carry callers through an immediate situation. Such <b>hotlines</b> exist at the University of Maryland, the University of Minnesota, [...] Tufts University, Columbia University, Cornell University, [...] Drexel University, and Caldwell University.|$|R

5|$|The building, {{including}} the load-bearing elements, was constructed of wood. There were 10 fire extinguishers and 11 fire hoses in the hotel. Only a few escape routes had proper emergency lighting and {{directions to the}} emergency exits, and the hotel was also not on a <b>hotline</b> with the emergency centre of the fire department. The building had been inspected by the fire department, first in February 1976, {{and later in the}} beginning of 1977, after which the hotel's management was notified in writing that there were severe fire safety defects. They issued a list of proposed improvements to be implemented by the hotel, such as complying with the building regulations and the regulations for residence facilities.|$|E
5|$|The episode starred Pemberton, Shearsmith, Jane Horrocks, Nikki Amuka-Bird and Tony Way as {{volunteers at}} Comfort Support Line, a crisis <b>hotline.</b> The story follows Andy (Pemberton), who is {{starting}} at the call centre.

5|$|In 1980, chief agent John Douglas, {{working with}} {{agents in the}} FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a {{psychological}} profile of the unidentified bomber which described the offender as a man with above-average intelligence with connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize the offender as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983 {{in favor of an}} alternative theory developed by FBI analysts concentrating on the physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments. In this rival profile, the bomber suspect was characterized as a blue-collar airplane mechanic. A 1-800 <b>hotline</b> was set up by the UNABOM Task Force to take any calls related to the Unabomber investigation, with a $1million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the Unabomber's capture.|$|E

5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce fraud and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare fraud <b>hotline</b> and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare fraud would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of fraud in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E
5|$|The episode's five flashbacks {{focus on}} the {{reactions}} and activities of the freighter's crew who made contact with the Oceanic 815 survivors; Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) is shown crying while watching a newscast confirming the deaths of all Oceanic 815 passengers.
