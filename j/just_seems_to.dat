Ray Stark had her cross-collateralized on three films and she was, figuratively speaking, escorted to the set every day by a team of lawyers. The picture does, however, contain some of Allen's most satisfying work, some of which she doesn't remember writing and <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have come out of nowhere.|$|E

The first season of The Office was met with a mixed response from critics {{with some of them}} comparing it to the short-lived NBC series Coupling which was also based on a British version. The New York Daily News called it [...] "so diluted there's little left but muddy water," [...] and USA Today called it a [...] "passable imitation of a miles-better BBC original." [...] A Guardian Unlimited review panned its lack of originality, stating, [...] "(Steve Carell) <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be trying too hard ... Maybe in later episodes when it deviates from Gervais and Merchant's script, he'll come into his own. But right now he's a pale imitation." [...] Tom Shales of the Washington Post said it was [...] "not the mishmash that [...] turned out to be, but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim, like when the copying machine is just about to give out." ...|$|E

When Steffy began pursuing Bill Spencer, Jr. in 2011, {{despite his}} marriage to Katie Logan, Jemmah Kelly of TV Soap remarked: [...] "Whoever coined the phrase 'there ain't no rest for the wicked', must have had The Bold and the Beautiful's Steffy Forrester in mind", writing that [...] "nothing is off limits for this scheming beauty". When Steffy became pregnant in 2013, Garrett said that while he [...] "loved seeing Jacquie play a vixen, it's equally a fascinating and entertaining watching her as a heroine". He noted that Steffy still had [...] "that edge", and Wood is a [...] "creative genius, an actress who <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> get better with time". Regan Cellura of Daytime Confidential criticized the motorcycle crash plot in which Steffy miscarries her baby, writing [...] "I'm sorry, but whose idea was it for a pregnant lady to ride a motorcycle?"

500|$|After reading God of War #1, Joe Juba of Game Informer said [...] "If {{you have}} a choice between reading this comic and doing {{something}} else, you should do something else...like play God of War III again." [...] He said that the story adds nothing of value and it is rough. Despite being written by Marv Wolfman, he said the story does not satisfy fans of the video game series: [...] "I didn't think the story made much sense, and it doesn't contribute to the overall lore of the universe; it <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be setting Kratos up for another fetch-quest." [...] He also felt that the writing was exceptionally low in quality. Comic Vine said, [...] "The idea here screams comic books," [...] however, the [...] "results were a mixed offering." [...] The reviewer stated that the idea of Kratos finding the Ambrosia to save Calliope was a [...] "perfect comic book incentive," [...] however, things started to disintegrate when the distinction between the present and the past became unclear. A four out of five star review from Binary Messiah praised the comic series, saying that it could be made into a full game: [...] "That's one freaking awesome story. That right there is a premise to a whole new God of War game." [...] They said that it [...] "does a good job showing the hot headedness of Kratos and his selfishness." [...] Saying that the comics do the video game series justice, for fans of God of War, this should be in their comic collection.|$|E
500|$|When {{the film}} was released, the {{distributor}} did not promote it heavily, and most reviewers disliked it. Because {{the film was}} X-rated, The New York Times refused to run the film's advertisement. [...] This was a somewhat awkward situation, as the ad included a positive review from The New York Times. According to Swenson, [...] "it didn't have a big following, ... {{but it is still}} in video stores." [...] The film played for about two weeks in New York City. Jerry Beck wrote a review in which he called the film [...] "raunchier than Ralph Bakshi's films." [...] He {{went on to say that}} the humor of the film [...] "is good, but the design and drawing is downright awful. It seems to be sort of a cross between Jules Feiffer and Gahan Wilson, if that can be imagined." [...] Beck also stated that the film was [...] "very similar to R. Crumb's Mr. Natural and Flakey Foont. There is no reason that the duck should be a duck. Every character in the film is human, and he <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be a duck just to give the film a catchy title. There are some highly imaginative animated ideas here, but the film's entertainment value is at a minimum." [...] Beck later called the film [...] "one of the most overlooked animated features of the 1970s, a glorious experimental mess of a film, which, from today’s vantage point, looks incredibly creative and daring, and something current Hollywood studios would never attempt." ...|$|E

Jack's in a relationship with someone else as Martha is, there <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be things {{getting in the way of}} them getting back together all the time." [...] Gordon also hoped for a happy ending for the two characters if they were to ever leave the serial adding: [...] "If I had it my way, and I got to write the scripts then I'd make it happily ever after, Martha and Jack riding off into the sunset." [...] Gordon has spoken of her understanding from the audiences point of view, that together Jack and Martha are [...] "the ultimate couple". She also reiterated her belief that it would be to tough at the time of Martha's downward spiral for them to work together, but if Martha is to get through her troubles and have a happy ending, that it would be with Jack. The Daily Telegraph commented on the Martha and Jack situation, saying it is played out in a [...] "classic soapie technique". They said [...] "Bring {{the characters}} together, push them apart, but always leave open the possibility that they could get back together.

Doyle described the writing process for the album as [...] "a bit like writing a poem" [...] because there was [...] "a certain structure" [...] that the band needed to work to whilst exercising [...] "as much freedom" [...] as they could. Goddard described the band's approach to song-writing as a [...] "mix of things [...] a lot of very careful thinking about rhythms, and interlaying a lot of different ideas and influences" [...] though, at certain points, there would be the sense that something needed to occur and these elements in songs were created spontaneously from the interaction between himself and Taylor: [...] "this melody will somehow suddenly explode in your mind.
