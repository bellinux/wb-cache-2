5000|$|It is, of course, {{possible}} that the disability may produce {{a situation in which}} further injury is caused. In such a case, the second injury fits into the chain of causation, the one following naturally from the other.

The chain of causation is considered broken and the new injuries will be regarded as caused by the claimant's own conduct and not by the defendant's fault or the <b>disability</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> that first negligence.|$|E
