5|$|From various {{symbolic}} motifs the tapestries seem to {{have been}} made to celebrate a marriage, probably that of Anne of Brittany (1477–1514) and Louis XII of France (1462–1515). The royal arms of Louis and Anne would <b>have</b> <b>once</b> decorated the sky in most of the tapestries.|$|E

5|$|Although it may <b>have</b> <b>once</b> been {{a towering}} stratovolcano, Goat Rocks has {{undergone}} extensive erosion since its extinction. Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, {{as well as}} hydrothermal alteration of the volcano's interior, stripped away layers of volcanic ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E

5|$|Regressive {{hypothesis}} : Viruses may <b>have</b> <b>once</b> been small {{cells that}} parasitised larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They {{lend support to}} this hypothesis, as their dependence on parasitism {{is likely to have}} caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell. This is also called the degeneracy hypothesis, or reduction hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|The {{causes of}} vampiric {{generation}} were many and varied in original folklore. In Slavic and Chinese traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly {{a dog or}} a cat, was feared {{to become one of}} the undead. A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In Russian folklore, vampires were said to <b>have</b> <b>once</b> been witches or people who had rebelled against the Russian Orthodox Church while they were alive.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden jackal}} may <b>have</b> <b>once</b> been tamed in Neolithic Turkey 11,000 years ago, {{as there is}} a {{sculpture}} of a man cradling a jackal found in Göbekli Tepe. French explorers during the 19thcentury noted that people in the Levant kept golden jackals in their homes. The Kalmyk people near the Caspian Sea were known to frequently cross their dogs with jackals, and Balkan shepherds once crossed their sheepdogs with jackals.|$|E

The western quoll is believed to <b>have</b> <b>once</b> occupied 70% of Australia, but because of cane toads, predators, habitat destruction, and poison baiting, it is now less abundant.|$|E
5|$|A temple {{dedicated}} to the goddess Satet, personification of the Nile floods, had stood {{on the island of}} Elephantine to the south of Egypt since at least the late Predynastic Period around 3200 BC. The temple was enlarged and renovated several times from the Early Dynastic Period onwards and was again rebuilt {{in the course of the}} Fifth Dynasty, possibly during Nyuserre's reign. A faience plaque bearing Nyuserre's name was discovered in a deposit of votive offerings located under the floor of the sanctuary. Unfortunately, this deposit does not represent the original context of the plaque, which could <b>have</b> <b>once</b> adorned the walls of the temple or could equally have been deposed in a foundational offering made in anticipation of the temple reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to <b>have</b> <b>once</b> killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E

5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; he claimed to <b>have</b> <b>once</b> worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of the causeway, the Petitcodiac River was home to many aquatic species. Fish originally included hundreds of thousands of Atlantic tomcod and rainbow smelt, tens of thousands of gaspereau and American shad, thousands of American eel, Atlantic salmon, brook trout, lamprey, and striped bass and hundreds of Atlantic sturgeon. Other fish include the blueback herring, the brown bullhead, the chain pickerel, the smallmouth bass, the white perch, and the white sucker. Marine mammals were uncommon, but normally consisted of pilot whales, Atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoise, harbour seals, and porbeagles. Freshwater mollusc species included the brook floater, the dwarf wedgemussel, the eastern ellipto, the eastern floater, the eastern pearlshell, and the triangle floater. Many other aquatic organisms are thought to <b>have</b> <b>once</b> entered the watershed due to the low salinity of the water.|$|E
5|$|By December 1, 1864, all {{soldiers}} {{had left the}} county to search for armed resistance {{in other parts of}} Pennsylvania. Though widespread draft evasion was evidenced in Columbia County, there was never serious armed resistance. At the end of Columbia County's occupation, the county's Democrats were deeply embittered by the arrests. It is likely that the rumor of the fort originated from sightings of large piles of shingles gathered by draft-evading shingle makers. Wooden tubs for gathering sap from sugar maples seen from a distance were likely mistaken for the fort's cannons. A deserters' hideout on North Mountain, a cabin 20 feet (6 meters) square and two stories high, may {{have been the subject of}} exaggerated claims by Republicans that the cabin was a fort. A structure that may <b>have</b> <b>once</b> been this cabin was rediscovered on July 13, 2007. In December 1864, the soldiers who left Columbia County went on to Clearfield County to continue their search for deserters and draft evaders.|$|E

5|$|Currently Ariel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. In the past, however, it may have been in a 5:3 resonance with Miranda, which could have been partially responsible for the heating of that moon (although the maximum heating attributable to a former 1:3 resonance of Umbriel with Miranda was likely about three times greater). Ariel may <b>have</b> <b>once</b> been locked in the 4:1 resonance with Titania, from which it later escaped. Escape from a mean motion resonance is much easier for the moons of Uranus than for those of Jupiter or Saturn, due to Uranus's lesser degree of oblateness. This resonance, which was likely encountered about 3.8 billion years ago, would have increased Ariel's orbital eccentricity, resulting in tidal friction due to time-varying tidal forces from Uranus. This would have caused warming of the moon's interior by as much as 20K.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years after}} the Brood War, the Dominion is once again the {{dominant}} Terran power in the Koprulu sector. News reports reveal that {{in the four years}} {{since the end of the}} Brood Wars, the standing Dominion military forces have been reduced and defense budget has instead been diverted to hunting down rebel forces that operate against the Dominion. For reasons unknown, Kerrigan gathered the swarm at Char and then vanished from sight. With the Zerg gone, the Protoss <b>have</b> <b>once</b> again taken a passive role in the galaxy. Jim Raynor has formed a revolutionary group named Raynor's Raiders in order to overthrow Dominion Emperor Arcturus Mengsk. On Mar Sara, Raynor meets with an old comrade, Tychus Findlay. Together, they liberate the local population from Dominion control and also discover a component of a mysterious Xel'Naga artifact. As the Zerg begin to overrun Mar Sara, Raynor arranges an evacuation to his battlecruiser, the Hyperion, captained by Matt Horner, Raynor's second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|Hari Parbat, {{also known}} as the Mughal fort, is a hill fort on Sharika hill that {{provides}} panoramic views of the Srinagar city and the Dal. It was first established by Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1590. However, he only erected the outer wall of the fort and his plans to build a new capital called Naga Nagor within it did not materialise. The fort in its current state was built much later in 1808 under the reign of Shuja Shah Durrani. Within the fort's precincts are temples, Muslim shrines, and a Sikh Gurudwara. The hill is the subject of many legends in Hindu mythology, and was said to <b>have</b> <b>once</b> been a large sea, inhabited by a demon known as Jalobhava and that the hill grew from a pebble.|$|E
