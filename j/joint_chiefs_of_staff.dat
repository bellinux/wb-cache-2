5|$|While Eisenhower {{appreciated}} Shoup's fiscal {{experience and}} apolitical outlook, Shoup was called upon most often by Kennedy. With Kennedy's {{relations with the}} <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> strained, particularly following the Cuban Missile Crisis, he called upon Shoup privately for many consultations. Shoup's biographer Howard Jablon wrote that Shoup was Kennedy's favorite general. In turn, Shoup was the most supportive of Kennedy {{of all of the}} <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff.</b> Kennedy had asked Shoup to remain as Commandant for a second term in 1963, but Shoup declined in order to allow the advancement of other Marine generals.|$|E

5|$|While {{the liberation}} of the Brunei area had been {{authorised}} by the United States <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff,</b> it was {{not supported by the}} British Chiefs of Staff Committee. The British leadership did not want the BPF to be diverted from the main theatre of operations off Japan and preferred to establish a base for the fleet in the Philippines. In response to a suggestion from the <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> that Brunei Bay could support future operations in south-east Asia, the Chiefs of Staff Committee judged that it would take too long to establish facilities there, especially as Singapore might have been recaptured {{by the time they were}} complete.|$|E

5|$|Arthur William Radford (27 February 1896â€“ 17 August 1973) was a United States Navy admiral {{and naval}} aviator.

5|$|At the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, the <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> {{approved}} {{the latest version}} of General MacArthur's Elkton plan for an advance on Rabaul. Owing to a shortage of resources, particularly heavy bomber aircraft, the final stage of the plan, the capture of Rabaul itself, was postponed until 1944. By July 1943, the Joint Chiefs were considering the possibility of neutralising and bypassing Rabaul, but the navy would still need a forward fleet base. The Admiralty Islands, already a part of the Elkton plan, could serve this purpose, as they contained flat areas for airstrips, space for military installations, and Seeadler Harbour, which was large enough to accommodate a naval task force. On 6 August 1943, the <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> adopted a plan that called for the neutralisation rather than the capture of Rabaul, and scheduled the invasion of the Admiralty Islands for 1 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the early nuclear arms control work, the Chairman of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff,</b> General Nathan F. Twining, sent a memorandum, in August 1959, to the Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, which {{suggested}} that the Strategic Air Command (SAC) formally be assigned responsibility to prepare the national nuclear target list, and a single plan for nuclear operations. Up to that point, the Army, Navy, and Air Force had done their own target planning. This had led to the same objectives being targeted multiple times by the different services. The separate service plans were not mutually supporting as in, for example, the Navy destroying an air defense facility on the route of an Air Force bomber going to a deeper target. While Twining had sent the memo to McElroy, the members of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> disagreed on the policy during early 1960. Thomas Gates, who succeeded McElroy, asked President Dwight D. Eisenhower to decide the policy.|$|E

5|$|However, he did {{not remain}} Chief of Staff for long. He was {{appointed}} Chairman of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> effective 1 July 1974.

He also dealt with the 1976 shootings and Axe Murder Incident in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, and oversaw the Panama Canal Treaty in 1977.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, the Chairman of the <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff,</b> General Omar Bradley, doubted that there would ever be another large scale amphibious operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Radford {{proposed}} protecting several military {{programs from}} funding cuts by reducing numbers of conventional forces, but {{the proposal was}} leaked to the press, causing an uproar in Congress and among U.S. military allies, and the plan was dropped. In 1957, after the other <b>Joint</b> <b>Chiefs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Staff</b> again disagreed on how to downsize force levels amid more budget restrictions, Radford submitted ideas for less dramatic force downsizing directly to Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson, who agreed to pass them along to Eisenhower.|$|E
