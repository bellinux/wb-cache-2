50|$|Notable players <b>jumped</b> to <b>the</b> Orioles <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rival National League (NL). In December 1901, Joe Kelley <b>jumped</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Brooklyn Superbas.

5|$|Kelley {{moved back}} to the infield, {{becoming}} the regular first baseman in 1901. After the 1901 season, Kelley denied reports that he would <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Superbas to the Detroit Tigers of the American League (AL), the former Western League which had decided to compete with the NL by creating franchises in east coast cities that housed NL franchises. However, the opportunity to return to Baltimore proved irresistible to Kelley, and after the AL's successful 1901 season, he jumped from the Superbas to the Baltimore Orioles AL. Kelley's father-in-law, John Mahon, was president and principal share holder of the AL's Orioles.|$|E
5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} his seat and {{struggled}} with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box, and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought {{he was part of}} the play.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Mulder and Doggett agree to <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> oil platform, which was shot {{in a way that}} recalls a scene in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, was filmed by having Patrick and Duchovny jump in front of a green screen. Separate footage of the rig exploding—created by {{combining}} actual shots of the rig with CGI—was then filmed, and the two shots were composited on top of one another.|$|E

5|$|David Boswell was amongst {{those in}} the 1980s who made the <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fanzine world when he began self-{{publishing}} Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman in 1980. From {{out of the same}} scene, Bill Marks started publishing the anthology Vortex in Toronto in 1982. Marks' Vortex Comics expanded into publishing other comics. The publisher gained publicity for Mister X, which employed the talents of Dean Motter, Gilberto and Jaime Hernandez and, later, Torontonians Seth and Jeffrey Morgan. Most notably, Marks picked up Chester Brown's Yummy Fur, a taboo-breaking series which started in 1983 as a self-published, photocopied minicomic. It had generated some buzz, and Vortex started publishing it professionally at the end of 1986. Yummy Furs stories were a mix of genres, with the improvised, surreal Ed the Happy Clown, straight adaptations of the Gospels, and revealing, bare-all autobiographical stories. Brown would become a major figure in Canadian comics.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, four {{female athletes}} – Anette Sagen, Helena Olsson Smeby, Line Jahr, and Lindsey Van – {{were invited to}} perform test jumps prior to the men's 2004 Continental Cup event in Vikersund. However, this was {{initially}} blocked by Torbjørn Yggeseth, founder of the Ski Jumping World Cup {{and a member of}} the FIS technical committee at the time, on the grounds that it was too dangerous to allow women on ski flying hills. Sagen challenged this and eventually won the right to <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hill, along with her fellow athletes. Both Sagen and Smeby jumped , which remains the third longest distance for women.|$|E
5|$|Maibaum {{may have}} thought the {{eventual}} oil-rig finale a poor substitute, but it was originally intended {{to be much more}} spectacular. Armed frogmen would <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> helicopters into the sea and attach limpet mines to the rig's legs (this explains why frogmen appear on the movie's poster). Blofeld would have escaped in his BathoSub and Bond would have pursued him, hanging from a weather balloon. The chase would have continued across a salt mine, with the two mortal enemies scrambling over white hills of salt before Blofeld would fall to his death in a salt granulator. Permission was not granted by the owners of the salt mine. It also made the sequence too long. Further problems followed when the explosives set up for the finale were set off too early; fortunately, a handful of cameras were ready and able to capture the footage.|$|E

5|$|Many of Royal Oaks crew who {{had managed}} to <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sinking ship were dressed {{in little more than}} their nightclothes and were {{unprepared}} for the chilling water. A thick layer of fuel oil coated the surface, filling men's lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived. Gatt switched the lights of Daisy 2 on and he and his crew managed to pull 386 men from the water, including Royal Oaks commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another {{two and a half hours}} until nearly 4:00am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to Pegasus. Although aided by boats from Pegasus and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Ski flying is {{a winter}} sport {{discipline}} derived from ski jumping, in which much greater distances can be achieved. It {{is a form}} of competitive Nordic skiing where athletes descend individually at very fast speeds along a specially built takeoff ramp using skis only; <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> end of it with as much power as they can generate; then glide – or 'fly' – as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill; and ultimately land within a target zone in a stable manner. Points are awarded for distance and stylistic merit by five judges, and events are governed by the International Ski Federation (FIS).|$|E
5|$|The next day, Nagarjuna goes to {{a temple}} with Priya in a car which has no brakes and Rao chases them along with Anjali.

On 10:20 AM when all the four are safe near the clock tower, a lorry driven by a drunk driver is shown rushing towards them.

5|$|Hansen locates Yusupov, {{who tells}} him that Anna Kamsky, Viktor's daughter, is onboard and must be saved. Yusupov had brought her to Sakhalin to {{blackmail}} Viktor into turning the exocels into biological weapons. Eventually, Viktor and his colleague, Dr. Pavel Bakharev, began to experiment on live human infection, and the Eastern Spirit {{was on its way}} from the Sakhalin to collect the next batch of human specimens supplied by the Mafia when the exocel outbreak occurred. An exocel then bursts out of Yusupov's chest, killing him. Hansen finds Anna, who tells them they must go to the radio room and contact her father. They contact the rig, but Bakharev tells Anna that Kamsky is missing and pleads with her not to return. She says no, telling Bakharev she will see him soon. They turn the ship back towards the Sakhalin but because the seas are so rough, they are unable to dock with the platform. As such, they head to the crow's nest and <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ship when it collides with the rig. Hansen makes the jump, but Anna falls into the sea.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} several notable jumpers as well. The first person to <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bridge was Robert Emmet Odlum, brother of women's rights activist Charlotte Odlum Smith, on May 19, 1885. He struck the water at an angle and died shortly {{thereafter}} from internal injuries. Steve Brodie dropped from underneath the bridge in July 1886, although there is some doubt about this. Larry Donovan made a slightly higher <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> railing a month later {{and went on to}} an international bridge jumping career. Cartoonist Otto Eppers jumped and survived in 1910, and was then tried and acquitted for attempted suicide. A lesser known early jumper was James Duffy of County Cavan, Ireland, who, on April 15, 1895, asked several men to watch him <b>jump</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bridge. Duffy jumped and was not seen again.|$|E
