5|$|In 1966, Tony {{married the}} family's {{housekeeper}} Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario. Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him. They {{would have a}} strained relationship for many years afterward. She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> during class—all so that the boys could see her underwear.|$|E
5|$|The event {{consisted}} of ten professional wrestling matches. The preliminary matches included a title defense by Intercontinental Champion The Honky Tonk Man against a surprise challenger, {{who turned out}} to be The Ultimate Warrior. The Ultimate Warrior won the match in just 31 seconds to end Honky Tonk's 14 month title reign, the longest Intercontinental Championship reign in history. The main event was a match pitting The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage) against their long-time rivals, The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant). Hogan and Savage won the match after Miss Elizabeth, Savage's manager, distracted André and DiBiase, by removing <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> to reveal a bikini bottom.|$|E
5|$|Amy is a 12-year-old, pink-furred {{anthropomorphic}} hedgehog girl {{created by}} Kenji Terada for the Sonic the Hedgehog manga series. She debuted in 1992, wearing a dress {{and with her}} then-orange hair pulled into 2 ponytails. The character was redesigned the next year for the Sega CD game, Sonic CD. Like the Sonic CD introduction Metal Sonic, an early grayscale concept sketch shows her very similar to her appearance in the game (except her shoes, which became larger and flatter). Her coloring was red at first (including <b>her</b> <b>skirt),</b> except for a green shirt. The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal and Princess Sally (a character in the Sonic the Hedgehog TV series). Amy received her present design, with a red dress and boots, in Sonic Adventure.|$|E

5|$|Hoshino enjoyed drawing Lenalee's hair, despite {{finding her}} D.Gray-man {{character}} Yu Kanda's hair impossible to top. She enjoyed drawing Lenalee {{because of her}} personality, and her relationship with other series' characters such as Komui and Reever Wenhamm. Because her hair grew longer as the series went on, the author gave her different hairstyles. When the manga moved to Jump Square, a magazine for older readers, Hoshino decided to increase Lenalee's sex appeal by having <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> shorter {{even though she is}} also wearing shorts beneath it. After Allen Walker became a fugitive from the Order, Hoshino wanted to have Lenalee chase after him, {{to the point where they}} would clash. When asked about Allen's farewell hug with Lenalee as he leaves the Order, Hoshino joked that she was happy with how Lenalee had matured, and at the same time become taller than Allen, in contrast to the beginning of the series when they were both the same height.|$|E
5|$|The Mega Powers {{took the}} early {{advantage}} over DiBiase, but after Hogan attacked André {{on the ring}} apron, the Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After several minutes and several advantage changes, all four began brawling, with DiBiase and André getting the upper hand and throwing both Hogan and Savage from the ring. At this point, Elizabeth jumped on the ring apron and began arguing with Ventura. With DiBiase and André pleading with Ventura to take drastic measures to get Elizabeth off the ring, she eventually tore off <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> and threw it into DiBiase's face. In the ensuing chaos, Hogan and Savage recovered and mounted a comeback, which saw André knocked {{out of the ring}} and DiBiase take both the Mega Powers' finishing moves -- Savage's flying elbow and Hogan's legdrop -- before taking the pinfall loss. While counting the pinfall, Ventura stopped counting at two and hesitated until Savage pushed Ventura's hand to the mat to complete the three count.|$|E
5|$|The {{first full}} day of filming on June 23 was {{predominantly}} shot on the set representing {{the bridge of the}} Enterprise. Two small establishing shots were postponed until the filming of the next episode. The following day, corridor scenes were filmed, as was the climactic scene featuring the creature's death. At that point, Daniels estimated that he was only a third of a day behind schedule. After a break for the weekend, production resumed on June 27 for scenes in the botany lab, the briefing room and sickbay. One of Grace Lee Whitney's favorite sets to work on throughout the series was the lab, which was the sickbay redecorated, as she enjoyed working with George Takei. The animated plant in that scene was a hand puppet controlled from under the table, and Whitney later recalled that the operator could see right up <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> throughout the shoot and would occasionally try to grope her using the puppet.|$|E
60|$|She passed him, {{and picking}} up <b>her</b> <b>skirts,</b> paused in the window.|$|R

5|$|The terrier George {{was played}} by Skippy, known as Asta in The Thin Man film series and co-starring with Grant (as Mr. Smith) in The Awful Truth. The tame leopard Baby and the escaped circus leopard were both {{played by a}} trained leopard, Nissa. The big cat was {{supervised}} by its trainer, Olga Celeste, who stood by with a whip during shooting. At one point, when Hepburn spun around (causing <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> to twirl) Nissa lunged at her and was subdued when Celeste cracked her whip. Hepburn wore heavy perfume to keep Nissa calm and was unafraid of the leopard, but Grant was terrified; most scenes of the two interacting are done in close-up with a stand-in. Hepburn played upon this fear by throwing a toy leopard through the roof of Grant's dressing room during production There were also several news reports about Hawks' difficulty filming a live leopard, and some scenes required rear-screen projection.|$|E
5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for a man to come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries her face with <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> and plays with its hem.|$|E
5|$|The last {{match of}} the night was the main event between The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage), {{accompanied}} by Miss Elizabeth, and The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant), accompanied by André's manager Bobby Heenan and DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil. Jesse Ventura was the special guest referee. The Mega Powers took the early advantage over DiBiase. After Hogan attacked André the Giant, {{who was on the}} ring apron, The Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After a while, all four men began brawling, and André knocked The Mega Powers out of the ring. Subsequently, as part of the scripted ending to the match, Miss Elizabeth began arguing with Ventura, the referee, and ripped off <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> to reveal her underwear. While the Mega Bucks were distracted, Savage climbed to the top rope and dropped the Macho Elbow on DiBiase, followed by Hogan hitting the leg drop on DiBiase. As Hogan pinned DiBiase, Ventura, a villainous character aligned with The Mega Bucks (despite being a long time on-air Savage fan and his former tag-team partner), began an obviously slow three-count. As a result, Savage slammed Ventura's arm down for the third time, indicating that Hogan and Savage had won the match.|$|E

25|$|In Tekken 7, Nina now {{wears an}} off-white long strapless wedding gown {{and the length}} of the right skirt of her wedding gown was long up to her leg and also has shreds at the edge of <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> and the front of <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> is covered in dirt and burns and its {{interior}} is dirty white. It also has a white single frill design on her waist to keep it attached within her gown. She also wears matching off-white long gloves with a white rose adorned on her left glove and a diamond bracelet on her wrist and a dark green and red gun holster on her left thigh where she keeps her handgun, two back up guns and her smoke grenade adorned with two off-white belts and a matching off-white crossed heels with a matching off white anklet on her right leg. She is also adorned with a white wedding veil on her head with two gray flower designs and her blonde hair is tied in a bun and at the right side of her hair is loose in a style of ringlets and wears a matching silver sparkling earrings on her ear.|$|E
25|$|Guaguancó is {{a couple}} dance of sexual {{competition}} between the male and female. The male periodically attempts to “catch” his partner with a single thrust of his pelvis. This erotic movement is called the vacunao (‘vaccination’ or more specifically ‘injection’), a gesture derived from yuka and makuta, symbolizing sexual penetration. The vacunao can also be expressed with a sudden gesture made by the hand or foot. The quinto often accents the vacunao, usually as the resolution to a phrase spanning more than one cycle of clave. Holding onto the ends of <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> while seductively moving her upper and lower body in contrary motion, the female “opens” and “closes” <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> in rhythmic cadence with the music. The male attempts to distract the female with fancy (often counter-metric) steps, accented by the quinto, until he is in position to “inject” her. The female reacts by quickly turning away, bringing the ends of her skirts together, or covering her groin area with her hand (botao), symbolically blocking the “injection.” Most {{of the time the}} male dancer does not succeed in “catching” his partner. The dance is performed with good-natured humor.|$|E

25|$|Patterson {{died from}} 27 stab wounds {{to her chest}} and back. Her body was {{discovered}} naked from the waist down, with <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> found in a nearby bedroom and her underwear around her ankles. Small pieces of yellow PVC tape were attached to her body and both of her breasts had been removed using a sharp knife. Her handbag and driver's licence were stolen during the attack. The murder weapon and Patterson's breasts have never been recovered.|$|E
25|$|Verhoeven {{followed}} those successes {{with the}} equally intense and provocative Basic Instinct (1992), an erotic thriller. The ninth-highest-grossing {{film of the}} year, the movie was a return to themes Verhoeven had explored in Turkish Delight and The Fourth Man. The film's most notorious scene shows Sharon Stone's character in a police interrogation, where she uncrosses her legs, briefly revealing her vulva (she does not wear underwear underneath <b>her</b> <b>skirt).</b> The film received two Academy Awards nominations, for Film Editing and for Original Music.|$|E
25|$|In Part 2 of his report, Usher {{stated that}} there were two deaths in recent years at the Casa that {{warranted}} investigations, but no one was charged. He also reported that in 2010, when de Faria visited Sedona, Arizona, the police department investigated him because a woman said he took her hands and placed them on his genitals; Mr de Faria also tried to pull down <b>her</b> <b>skirt.</b> The case never went to court; one of his associates encouraged the woman to drop the allegations.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the story, Piro {{had seen}} Nanasawa Kimiko at an Anna Miller's restaurant, {{where she is}} a waitress, after Tsubasa brought him and Largo there. Later on, Piro {{encounters}} Kimiko outside a train station, where she is worrying aloud that she will miss an audition because she has forgotten her money and railcard. Piro hands her his own railcard and walks off before she can refuse his offer. This event causes Kimiko to develop an idealized vision of her benefactor, an image which is shattered {{the next time they}} meet. Despite this, she gradually develops feelings for Piro, though she is too shy to admit them. Later on in the story, Kimiko's outburst on a radio talk show causes her to suddenly rise to idol status. Angered by the hosts' derisive comments about fanboys, she comes to the defense of her audience, immediately and unintentionally securing their obsessive adoration. Later, her new horde of fanboys find out where she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures up <b>her</b> <b>skirt.</b> Piro works undercover as a busboy {{to get rid of all}} cameras. The scene eventually builds to a climax, in which Kimiko shouts at the fanboys and lifts <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> in defiance, and they take photographs. Piro, provoked by her outburst into actively defending her, threatens the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their memory cards with the photos. On the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him to walk off.|$|E
25|$|The {{album cover}} is an {{illustration}} (in pencil) by artist Nick Price, {{who had also}} designed the cover for the programme for her 1979 tour. Bush {{was pleased with the}} results (it depicts a multitude of animals and monsters emerging from under <b>her</b> <b>skirt).</b> Of the concept, Bush said that it reflects the title, depicting good and bad things that emerge from you. The album was released on compact disc in Japan in 1987 with the cover art modified. A section of the original cover art was enlarged, creating two different booklet covers: the outer one modified; and underneath the original. The album's cover was voted 'Greatest Album Cover of 1980' by Record Mirror.|$|E
25|$|The Mega Powers' first feud {{was against}} The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant), whom they {{defeated}} in the main event of the first-ever SummerSlam pay-per-view event. The match, refereed by Jesse Ventura, was famous for Miss Elizabeth jumping up on the apron of the ring late in the match and removing <b>her</b> <b>skirt</b> to show red panties. This allowed both Savage and Hogan (who had been knocked to the outside) {{to get back in}} the ring and get the pin on DiBiase with Savage pushing a reluctant Ventura to the 3-count. The Mega Powers then began feuding with The Twin Towers (Big Boss Man and Akeem who was formerly the One Man Gang). In the case of the latter feud, Savage frequently became involved in Hogan's matches involving one of the two villains (and vice versa); the two rival factions captained opposing teams in the main event of the 1988 Survivor Series, which was won by the Mega Powers.|$|E
