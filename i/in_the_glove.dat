A large amount of the character and background art featured in the game was showcased, along with original art used to promote the character artwork, and other production sketches drawn when the game was still in development. Flowcharts outlining the story for the game were on display, along with the flowcharts for Clannad. Also at the exhibition was a life-size mannequin of Rin Natsume with a baseball glove in one hand, though instead of a baseball, a cat was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>glove.</b> This mannequin was later put onto the Japanese Yahoo!

40|$|Background An {{increased}} {{frequency of}} occupational contact hand dermatitis among surgical operating theatre personnel has been noticed. Objectives To evaluate patients with {{occupational contact dermatitis}} caused by their rubber gloves, and to describe a method for analysing the content of <b>the</b> allergens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloves.</b> Materials and methods Patch tests were performed with the baseline series, a rubber chemical series, and <b>the</b> patients' own <b>gloves.</b> A method for analysing 1, 3 -diphenylguanidine (DPG) and cetylpyridinium chloride <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> was developed. Results Contact allergy to thiuram mix was found in 8 of 16 patients, whereas 12 of 16 patients reacted to DPG. In 7 of 8 patients, contact allergy to cetylpyridinium chloride was found. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> patients' <b>gloves,</b> cetylpyridinium chloride and DPG were detected at higher concentrations {{on the inside of}} <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> than on <b>the</b> outside. Most patients had worked for decades in their present occupations, but their hand dermatitis had only been present for months. Conclusion Contact allergy to DPG in gloves has been disputed, but, in this study, we were able to confirm the presence of DPG and cetylpyridinium chloride <b>in</b> <b>the</b> causative <b>gloves</b> by using a modified method for the analysis. The presence of these chemicals in gloves caused an increase in occupational contact dermatitis in surgical operating theatre personnel...|$|R

However, few reports have compared the major allergen of HCWs to those in gloves that are routinely used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hospital. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the major NRL allergens in gloves used by HCWs. MethodsWe studied 20 HCWs who were suspected to have latex allergy (LA). We performed a skin prick test (SPT) using NRL allergens. Serological testing was performed using the ImmunoCAP™. The total amount of protein and the antigenic protein concentrations extracted from NRL gloves were measured. Four different types of FITkit™ were used to measure the concentrations of Hev b 1, 3, 5, and 6. 02 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloves.</b> ResultsA SPT using NRL extract identified 14 cases with positive reactions. The sensitivity and specificity of the SPT scores to <b>the</b> NRL <b>glove</b> extract were 100 %. The sensitivity of latex specific IgE was 100 % but the specificity was 14. 2 %. The sensitivity and specificity of rHev b 6. 02 specific IgE were 100 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> LA group. The total amounts of protein from <b>the</b> medical <b>gloves</b> for surgery and examination were 265 μg/g and 95 μg/g, respectively. The antigenic protein concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloves</b> were 24. 9 μg/g and 1. 0 μg/g, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. Phthalate esters (PAEs) {{have been}} widely added as the {{plasticizer}} to increase the flexibility and ductility of polymeric materials. In this study, organic solvents, such as methanol, hexane, ethyl ether and acetone, {{were used for the}} direct extraction of plasticizers in neoprene, nitrile, and PVC gloves, under a temperature range of 20 - 80 o C. The results showed that DEHP (Di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate) and DBP (Di-n-butyl phthalate) were analyzed in all three <b>glove</b> samples. <b>The</b> extraction capability of PAEs from <b>the</b> PVC <b>gloves</b> was <b>the</b> highest, while that from <b>the</b> neoprene <b>gloves</b> was <b>the</b> lowest.
