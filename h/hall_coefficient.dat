50|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} materials (and paramagnetic {{materials in}} a magnetic field), the Hall resistivity includes an additional contribution, {{known as the}} anomalous Hall effect (or the extraordinary Hall effect), which depends directly on the magnetization of the material, and is often {{much larger than the}} ordinary Hall effect. (Note that this effect is not due to the contribution of the magnetization to the total magnetic field.) For example, in nickel, the anomalous <b>Hall</b> <b>coefficient</b> is about 100 times larger than the ordinary <b>Hall</b> <b>coefficient</b> near the Curie temperature, but the two are similar at very low temperatures. Although a well-recognized phenomenon, there is still debate about its origins in the various materials. The anomalous Hall effect can be either an extrinsic (disorder-related) effect due to spin-dependent scattering of the charge carriers, or an intrinsic effect which can be described in terms of the Berry phase effect in the crystal momentum space (k-space).|$|E

Non-equilibrium martensitic phases with monoclinic structure were detected in all the alloys except Cu_ 33. 4 Zr_ 66. 6. Temperature dependencies of electrical resistivity in the temperature range of T = 4 - 300 K have been measured as well as room temperature values of <b>Hall</b> <b>coefficients</b> and thermal conductivity.

5000|$|One very {{important}} feature of the Hall effect is that it differentiates between positive charges moving {{in one direction and}} negative charges moving in the opposite. The Hall effect offered the first real proof that electric currents in metals are carried by moving electrons, not by protons. The Hall effect also showed that in some substances (especially p-type semiconductors), it is more appropriate to think of the current as positive [...] "holes" [...] moving rather than negative electrons. A common source of confusion with the Hall Effect is that holes moving to the left are really electrons moving to the right, so one expects the same sign of the <b>Hall</b> <b>coefficient</b> for both electrons and holes. This confusion, however, can only be resolved by modern quantum mechanical theory of transport in solids.|$|E
50|$|The van der Pauw Method is a {{technique}} commonly {{used to measure the}} resistivity and the <b>Hall</b> <b>coefficient</b> of a sample. Its power lies in its ability to accurately measure the properties of a sample of any arbitrary shape, so long as the sample is approximately two-dimensional (i.e. it is much thinner than it is wide), solid (no holes), and the electrodes are placed on its perimeter. The van der Pauw Method employs a four-point probe placed {{around the perimeter of the}} sample, in contrast to the linear four point probe: this allows the van der Pauw method to provide an average resistivity of the sample, whereas a linear array provides the resistivity in the sensing direction. This difference becomes important for anisotropic materials, which can be properly measured using the Montgomery Method, an extension of the van der Pauw Method.|$|E

40|$|The spin Hall {{effect in}} two {{dimensional}} hole systems is studied {{by using the}} four-terminal Landauer-Büttiker formula {{with the help of}} Green functions. The spin Hall effect exists even when there are not any correlations between the spin-up and -down heavy holes (light holes) and when the Γ-point degeneracy of the heavy hole and light hole bands is lifted by the confinement or recovered by the strain. When only a heavy hole charge current without any spin polarization is injected through one lead, under right choice of lead voltages, one can get a pure heavy (light) hole spin current, combined with a possible impure light (heavy) hole spin current from another two leads. The spin <b>Hall</b> <b>coefficients</b> of both heavy and light holes depend on the Fermi energy, devise size and the disorder strength. It is also shown that the spin Hall effect of two dimensional hole systems is much more robust than that of electron systems with the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and the spin <b>Hall</b> <b>coefficients</b> do not decrease with the system size but tend to some nonzero values when the disorder strength is smaller than some critical value.
