500|$|Blaming Roman {{rule for}} his family's fate, Judah rejects his {{patrimony}} and Roman citizenship. Learning that Tirzah is dying, Judah and Esther take Miriam and {{her to see}} Jesus Christ (Claude Heater), but the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate has begun. Judah witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus, and Miriam and Tirzah are miraculously healed during the rainstorm following the crucifixion. Judah declares, [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>His</b> voice take the sword out of my hand." ...|$|E
500|$|Tarwater {{was raised}} in a Christian home, but growing up he [...] "sort of went through the motions" [...] and didn't really hold strong beliefs. By college, he had {{abandoned}} any pretense of faith. [...] He later said that [...] "the Olympics had become an idol in my life." [...] After not making the Olympics in 2008, he met Doug Banister who challenged Tarwater to re-examine his worldview. [...] "The 'A-ha' moments were many," [...] Tarwater later recalled. [...] "y the time I had the ability to prayerfully repent and rebuke the stuff in my life, I was finally at a good time in life.... I would say I recommitted my life because I grew up in a Christian home, but really {{it was the first time}} where I knew what I was doing and committed my life to Christ." [...] Tarwater credits his Christian faith for helping him get through the ups and downs of being a competitive swimmer. On his 2012 Olympic experience, he said [...] "It was a real gift from God. [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>His</b> presence so much the past few weeks. [...] It was an unbelievable feeling." [...] Tarwater attends Hope Community Church in Charlotte.|$|E
500|$|On January 19, 2011 in a {{press conference}} at Times Square, New York, Bob Arum and Don King, working {{together}} for the first time in five years, officially announced that Cotto would defend his WBA light middleweight title against former two-division world champion Ricardo Mayorga at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada on March 12, 2011 live on Showtime PPV. In front of 7,247 at the MGM, Cotto defeated Mayorga via TKO in the 12th round, retaining his WBA light middleweight title. Throughout the fight, Mayorga looked to engage, however the discipline on Cotto played a big part in the win, saving his big shots for the final round. A left hook ended, which dropped Mayorga ended the bout. At the time of stoppage, Cotto was ahead by five points on all three judges scorecards. With the win, Cotto's record for world title fights improved to (17-2). Cotto earned $1 million from the fight and compubox stats showed that Cotto out punched Mayorga 249 to 176 in total punches. In the post-fight, Cotto explained how he won the fight, [...] "The game plan was not to get caught up in any of his antics. He was very heavy handed, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> punches the whole fight." [...] He also mentioned how before the last round, his trainer Emanuel Steward told him he would be able to stop Mayorga in the last round, which was the conclusion of the fight.|$|E

6000|$|... "We can read, and write, and count," [...] said I, {{taking the}} words out of Jack's mouth; for <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>his</b> brusque manner of {{replying}} was not calculated to commend us to the captain.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ravenor softly {{pulled down}} the green {{lampshade}} on the side nearest to him, and in the subdued light I could scarcely see <b>his</b> face, but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>his</b> interest in my story was growing.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} this type of experience: ‘My husband died in June 1945, and 26 years afterwards when I was at Church, I felt him standing beside me during the singing of a hymn. I felt I would see him if I turned my head. The feeling was so strong I was reduced to tears. I had not been thinking of him before <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> presence. I had not had this feeling before that day, neither has it happened since then.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Eden {{reported}} that Crowhurst's sailing techniques were good, [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> navigation was a mite slapdash. I prefer, {{even in the}} Channel, to know exactly where I am. He didn't take too much bother with it, merely jotting down figures on a few sheets of paper from time to time." [...] After struggling against westerlies and having to tack out into the Channel twice they arrived at 2.30pm on 15 October, where an enthusiastic BBC film crew started filming Eden in the belief he was Crowhurst. There were 16 days to get ready before the race's deadline on 31 October.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> {{strong hands}} close over {{my fingers and}} remove them one by one. His head was quite close to mine, and {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> mustache brush my cheek.|$|E
60|$|I {{returned}} to my breakfast, and, seeing I would not converse further, the man passed on and sat down. But <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>his</b> eyes were on me, and instinctively I {{made up my mind}} to be on my guard.|$|R
60|$|My life hung by a thread, and I knew it. At {{that final}} moment I thought with <b>HIS</b> mind, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> with <b>HIS</b> fingers--I was as certain as if I {{had seen it}} of what he kept hidden from me in the drawer.|$|R
60|$|Old Cotter {{looked at}} me for a while. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>his</b> little beady black eyes were {{examining}} me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from my plate. He returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the grate.|$|R
60|$|I shuddered as he spoke: <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> {{influence}} in my marrow--his hold on my limbs.|$|E
60|$|Ray {{stood by}} my side, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> hand descend like a vice upon my shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> hand, with gentle stress, [...] A moment laid on mine, [...] And {{wished to}} mark my {{consciousness}} [...] By some responsive sign.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> raillery in <b>his</b> words: {{it made me}} {{grave and}} quiet; but I folded up the letter and covered it from sight.|$|R
60|$|Once more he {{inclined}} {{his face}} to me—his face that was practically so odd a comment on my question, and <b>I</b> so <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> unspoken irony that I soon also turned and met his eyes. “No, sir. Not much, sir,” he added after a considerable interval.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will only}} pay a short visit, {{but it will}} be a great {{pleasure}} to me to see him; <b>I</b> have always <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> kindness to me." ...|$|R
60|$|My silence did {{not seem}} {{altogether}} to satisfy him. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> eyes challenge mine, and I was forced to meet his darkly questioning gaze.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> {{sympathy and}} {{delicacy}} too strongly {{to thank him}} in words; I could only look my gratitude as {{he asked me to}} follow him up stairs.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> book gently {{taken out of}} my hand. Cristel had been reading, while I read, over my shoulder. She wrote on the next blank leaf: [...] "Shall I make the tea?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>his</b> pockets, {{one after}} another. A few small coins, a thimble, and some thread and big needles, {{a piece of}} pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a tinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair.|$|R
6000|$|... "My orders are--" [...] the gendarme resumed; {{but already}} my {{sensitive}} ear had detected a faint wavering in the gruffness of his voice. The hectoring tone {{had gone out}} of it. I could not see him, of course, but somehow <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>his</b> attitude had become less arrogant and his glance more shifty.|$|R
2500|$|... a {{tremendous}} force {{in my personal}} and professional life. He was always {{in and out of}} my office, asking how things were going. Even as he was trying to convince me to do something I absolutely did not want to do, <b>I</b> always <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> intentions for me were the best. Marvin was always honest and unpretentious.|$|R
60|$|He took me {{down into}} the study, seated himself in his {{accustomed}} chair, and put me before him between his knees. His lips were awfully white, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> two hands, as they grasped my shoulders, shaking violently.|$|E
60|$|In {{about twenty}} minutes Tom dropped into a sound, easy slumber. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> pulse, listened to his respiration, and let him sleep. Everything was normal, and Tom was safe. I went {{into the other room}} and tumbled into bed.|$|E
60|$|Sampson {{moved his}} hand {{significantly}} {{and the action}} was a voiceless command for silence {{as well as an}} assertion that he would attend to this matter. I read him clearly so far. He had authority, and again <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> power.|$|E
6000|$|Alas! I DID know; and {{as there}} flashed upon {{me all the}} miserable scandals and gossip {{connected}} with this reckless, frivolous caravansary, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like resenting <b>his</b> suggestion. But my companion's next words were more significant:-- ...|$|R
60|$|He rose as I entered. He was a gentleman, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> at once. <b>His</b> manner was as deferential, as kind, and as {{considerate}} to my sensitiveness, {{as anything}} it's {{possible for you}} to imagine in anyone.|$|R
60|$|But {{it was the}} papers--always the papers--of which I thought. I opened <b>his</b> {{tunic and}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>his</b> shirt. Then I searched his {{holsters}} and his sabre-tasche. Finally I dragged off his boots, and undid his horse's girth so as to hunt under the saddle. There was not a nook or crevice which I did not ransack. It was useless. They were not upon him.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it {{had been}} done openly {{it would not have}} been so bad," [...] said Mr. Endicott. [...] "But it was done secretly, and Snogger was gone almost before I knew it. He was a {{valuable}} man and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> loss keenly." ...|$|E
60|$|A soft purr, {{like that}} of a great cat, {{indicated}} that Woola understood, and then, with a word to him to follow, I turned to the right along the ledge, but scarcely had I done so than <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> mighty fangs tugging at my leathern harness.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely had he {{departed}} on the errand when Bill Quigley, who lay at my feet, {{created a}} diversion. I jumped--yes, and I freely confess that I yelled--with startle and surprise, when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> paws clutch my ankles and his teeth shut {{down on the}} calf of my leg.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not excusing myself. God {{knows how}} bitterly I have {{condemned}} myself, all these years. I {{only want to}} show you that I had no idea of condemning him to starvation. He was my only son, and I loved him. <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> perhaps, <b>his</b> rebellion all the more, because he had never before given me a day's trouble. I was harsh, obstinate, and cruel.|$|R
5000|$|Interviewed {{in one of}} {{the witness}} shots, Bruno Bettelheim makes the {{following}} comment: The question of whether Zelig was a psychotic or merely extremely neurotic was a question that was endlessly discussed among his doctors. Now <b>I</b> myself <b>felt</b> <b>his</b> feelings were really not all that different from the normal, what one would call the well-adjusted, normal person, only carried to an extreme degree, to an extreme extent. <b>I</b> myself <b>felt</b> that one could really think of him as the ultimate conformist.|$|R
5000|$|... "He was an amazing, generous, caring guy but {{he would}} never cross boundaries. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{comfortable}} in <b>his</b> company. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> safe in <b>his</b> home and under his guardianship. The more time I spent at Crewe, I notice the caution he exercised within his role. ... For example, he wouldn’t come into the bedroom to wake you up {{but he would}} always shout through the door. ... I hate {{the fact that he}} might be doubted in any way or even remotely linked to such negativity and bad things. My experience is totally the opposite. ... I believe that if he had known what Barry Bennell had been doing, he would have put a stop to it." ...|$|R
