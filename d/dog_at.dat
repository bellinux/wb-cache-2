During the course of the show, he has fathered litters of puppies, passed obedience school, had surgery for bloat, replaced Duffman as the mascot for Duff Beer, and been trained as a police <b>dog</b> <b>at</b> Springfield's Animal Police Academy. Some of the episodes that focus on Santa's Little Helper have been inspired by popular culture or real experiences that staff members of the show have gone through.|$|E

5|$|The most {{successful}} <b>dog</b> <b>at</b> the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show was Ch. Warren Remedy, {{who won the}} Best in Show title three times between 1907 and 1909. These victories were followed by a further Best in Show title for Ch. Sabine Rarebit in 1910. Despite the Smooth Fox Terrier breed winning the first four Best in Show titles at Westminster, it has not won again since.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the show}} standard, {{there are several}} {{physical}} points which would be treated as faults in the show ring. These are for {{the height of the}} <b>dog</b> <b>at</b> the withers to be outside of the standard range, or for the dog to possess either pricked up ears, a liver or brown coloured nose, an overshot or undershot jawline or to have brindle markings.|$|E
5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue <b>dog</b> <b>at</b> the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for his body to be {{preserved}} at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the taxidermist {{and the director of}} the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought was a good example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.|$|E
50|$|Each of the 83 teams was {{composed}} of 16 <b>dogs</b> <b>at</b> {{the start of the}} competitive race in Willow. Mushers are allowed to drop <b>dogs</b> <b>at</b> any checkpoint, usually because of concern over their performance, but also or for their health. Veterinarians examine the <b>dogs</b> <b>at</b> each checkpoint, and also have the discretion to withdraw dogs. Dropped dogs are flown to Anchorage or Nome, where they are provided with medical care. Teams are usually reduced to between 9 and 12 dogs by the time they arrived in Nome.|$|R

5|$|Fifteen {{pages were}} filmed per day, {{six days a}} week, with three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular time}} with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with the dog and often groomed the <b>dog</b> <b>at</b> the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more believable, but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and the trainer was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.|$|E

As a result, new guitarist Splatter became the band's live guitarist.

25|$|Kelpies {{are partly}} descended from Dingoes, with 34% of their genes {{coming from the}} native Australian <b>dog.</b> <b>At</b> {{the time of the}} origin of the breed, it was illegal to keep dingoes as pets, some dingo owners {{registered}} their animals as Kelpies or Kelpie crosses. Kelpies and dingoes are similar in conformation and colouring. There is no doubt that some people have deliberately mated dingoes to their Kelpies, and some opinion holds that the best dilution is 1/16–1/32, but that 1/2 and 1/4 will work. As the Dingo has been regarded as a savage sheep-killer since the first European settlement of Australia, few will admit to the practice.|$|E
25|$|Aussie {{colors are}} black, red (sometimes called 'liver'), blue merle (marbled black, white, and gray), and red merle (marbled red, white, and buff); {{each of these}} colors may also have copper (tan) points or white {{markings}} in various combinations on the face, chest, and legs. A black or red dog with copper and white trim is called 'tricolor' or 'tri', a black or red dog with white trim but no copper is called 'bicolor' or 'bi'. White, rather than pigment, on or around the ears is an indicator of increased risk for white-related deafness. Excessive white on the face and ears can place an individual <b>dog</b> <b>at</b> greater risk for sunburn and subsequent skin cancer.|$|E
