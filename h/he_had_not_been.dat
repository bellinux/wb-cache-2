5|$|The 1961 tour of England was Davidson's {{overseas}} farewell, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> prolific on his {{two previous}} visits, never managing {{to take more}} than four wickets in an innings and toalling only 76 in 40 first-class matches.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was so serious that Augustus himself {{appeared at the}} trial, even though <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his auctoritas. He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, {{an insult to the}} 'August One'.|$|E

5|$|During this process, the Home Office {{declined}} to give Bamber the expert evidence it had obtained, so Bamber applied for judicial review of that decision in November 1994; this resulted in the Home Office handing over its expert evidence. In 1996, without informing Bamber or his lawyers, an Essex police officer destroyed many of the trial exhibits. He said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> aware that the case was ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Following a short illness, on {{the night}} of 14–15 June 1341 the emperor Andronikos III died at the {{relatively}} early age of 45, possibly due to chronic malaria. His nine-year-old son John (John V) was the obvious successor, but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> officially proclaimed or crowned as co-emperor. This left a legal vacuum, and raised the question of who would lead the Empire's government.|$|E

5|$|In March 1975 Massino {{was arrested}} {{at the scene of}} the arrest of one of his hijackers, Raymond Wean, and charged with {{conspiracy}} to receive stolen goods. He was scheduled to go on trial in 1977, but the charges were dropped after he successfully argued that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> properly mirandized, disqualifying statements Massino gave to police from being used in trial.|$|E
5|$|In early February 2016 {{there were}} rumors that Morales had had a child by a young woman, Gabriela Zapata Montaño, and had granted favors to the Chinese company for which she worked. Morales {{admitted}} that they had had a son (who had died in infancy), but denied vehemently any granting of favors and said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> in contact with Zapata Montaño since 2007.|$|E
5|$|Pietro Vidoni had {{the support}} of members of the Flying Squadron as well as Christina of Sweden and her ally Azzolino. He was not opposed by either France or Spain as well. Francesco Barberini, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, opposed Vidoni because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> asked about his {{candidacy}} previously.|$|E

5|$|William and {{his eldest}} son, George, Earl of Munster, were estranged at the time, but William hoped that {{a letter of}} condolence from Munster signalled a reconciliation.

5|$|After eight years, Soeprapto was honourably {{dismissed}} on 1 April 1959. {{the dismissal}} {{has been reported}} in several sources {{to be related to the}} acquittal of/dropping of charges against two foreigners, Junschlager and Schmidt, who had been accused of undermining the government; Junschlager died in prison, and Schmidt was freed on basis of time served in a high court decision which the prosecution did not appeal. As <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> given prior warning he was unable to go to Merdeka Palace for the related formalities; at the time he was visiting his parents in Yogyakarta. His wife later noted that this led to him becoming disillusioned in President Sukarno's regime.|$|E
5|$|Cienfuegos led electors {{that were}} part of the {{imperial}} party in an attempt to elect Giulio Piazza. Piazza was almost elected on May 13, but was short by four votes. The electors were confident that {{they would be able to}} elect him, because more cardinals were arriving to participate in the conclave, and it became public in Rome that Piazza was likely to be the new pope. Albani did not support this because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> a part of the negotiations despite being the original elector to suggest Piazza, and undermined his election by proposing Vincenzo Orsini as an alternate candidate.|$|E

5|$|Davidson's later {{career as}} a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His {{attempts}} at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine {{and that he did}} not deserve the humiliations he endured.|$|E
5|$|Factionalism again {{marked the}} Republican nominating {{convention}} in 1904. Bradley and his faction backed Augustus E. Willson for governor, while Hunter and Yerkes favored Louisville businessman Morris B. Belknap, the son-in-law of former governor Simon Buckner. When convention officials ruled against a county delegation committed to Willson, he {{withdrew from the}} contest. Bradley was angered as Belknap was nominated on the first ballot and subsequently lost to J. C. W. Beckham, who was allowed to seek a second term because a court ruled <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> elected to a full term in 1900.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and {{was asked}} about the gunfire and whether he knew its source. He said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, but he could not say with any certainty.|$|E

In response, Clark led another expedition into the Ohio country, destroying several Indian villages along the Great Miami River during the Battle of Piqua, the last major expedition of the war.|$|E
5|$|In his {{writings}} Henson {{referred to his}} two regrets in life. The first was that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> at a public school, a fact to which he ascribed his lifelong feeling of being an outsider. The second regret was {{that he and his}} wife had been unable to have children. They unofficially adopted a succession of poor boys and paid for their education. At least one of them became a priest and was ordained by Henson.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} inquiry, chaired by Rear Admiral Reinhold von Werner, Monts testified that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> given {{sufficient}} time to familiarize himself with the ship and its crew, who were themselves unfamiliar with the vessel. Monts argued that the mobilization process for the newly commissioned ship should have lasted four to six weeks, rather than the three he had been given. The day before the squadron left Wilhelmshaven, Batsch complained to General Albrecht von Stosch, {{the chief of the}} Kaiserliche Marine, that a significant number of dockyard workers were still finishing work on Grosser Kurfürst. Werner and the board determined that Admiral Batsch was at fault and exonerated Monts.|$|E
