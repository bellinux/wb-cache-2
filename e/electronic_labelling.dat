A metal screened (13) <b>electronic</b> <b>labelling</b> system having {{at least one}} information bearing electronic coded label including a label coil (12) and an interrogator including a transmitter coil (9). The system relies on a magnetic field coupling link containing the transmitter coil (9) and the label coil (12) for obtaining information from the label. The coupling link is arranged such that it operates in the near field thereof and substantially none or at most {{a minority of the}} magnetic flux which excites the label coil (12) also links the transmitter coil (9).

40|$|Paper is a cheap {{substrate}} {{which is}} in principle compatible with the process temperature applied in the plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and hot wire CVD (HWCVD) of thin film silicon solar cells. The main drawback of paper for this application is the porosity due to its fibre like structure. The feature size (micrometre scale) {{is larger than the}} thickness of the applied photovoltaic layers. To overcome this problem, UV curable lacquer was used to planarize the surface. Plain 80 grams printer paper was taken as a substrate and the lacquer smoothens the rough surface of the paper such that a designed nanostructure can be imprinted for light scattering. In this manner single junction amorphous silicon solar cells with a HWCVD deposited intrinsic layer were processed on paper, without any concessions to the process temperature of 200 °C. The cell performance is comparable to that of reference cells grown on stainless steel, proving that solar cells can be deposited on paper substrates without sacrificing performance. PV on paper could be applied as ”disposable” power source for gadgets, <b>electronic</b> <b>labelling,</b> remote sensing systems, etc. (Internet of Things) ...|$|E
40|$|High-performance <b>electronic</b> <b>labelling</b> systems {{require the}} {{separate}} components {{to be designed}} in an optimum way and with a consideration of their interactions with other components in the system. As with many system designs {{many aspects of the}} electrical and electronic discipline must be pursued with skill for a successful design to emerge. In addition to dealing with these matters, the author considers low cost and long range along with manufacturability as key criteria for a high-performance labelling system and thus has kept these aspects in mind throughout the component design process. The first part of the work describes the design of both near-field and far-field UHF antennas including a UHF antenna which is combined with an HF antenna. In a second part of the work are investigations of techniques for reading UHF tags on a metal surface and HF tags inside a hole formed in metal. Finally, the designs of low-power and low-cost microelectronic circuits for passive tags are discussed. Each system element designed by the author has been fabricated for successful empirical evaluation. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Copyright 2004 IEEEThe drill strings used in oil {{drilling}} {{have a limited}} life in that a section may be used 400 times or until the diameter reduces 20 mm from wear against the surrounding rock. RFID labelling {{the pieces of the}} drill string allows the recording of usage and location data at a particular depth of the drill head, aiding in the planning of a rotation scheme, so that any one particular section is not constantly at a position of high stress. Such RFID tags embedded in metal may be used for other metal asset tracking applications. Previous work (Pope, G. et al., Proc. 1 st Ann. Wireless and Portable Design Conf., p. 240, 1997; Cole, P. H. and Hall, D. M., "Metal Screened <b>Electronic</b> <b>Labelling</b> System", PCTWO 0005675, PCT/AU 99 / 00587) has been performed at HF frequencies but there is increasing interest in UHF frequencies as the frequency of choice for object tracking (Cole and Hall). We show that suitable antennas can be made from capacitor structures sensitive to electric fields perpendicular to the metal surface. An HFSS simulation environment for antenna applications was used to relate simulated results to known empirical results from both publications and their own experiments. Both the simulations and the measurements indicate that the antenna concept is suited to the application. Ranasinghe, D. C.; Hall, D. M.; Cole, P. H.; Engels, D. W...|$|E
40|$|In the {{beginning}} of the ' 00, new generation displays were introduced by the corporations E-INK and Gyricon. Common point of the developed technologies is the use of microencapsulated, electrically polarized particles which are specifically aligned on a pixel array. While E-INK uses differently polarized particles with a different colour (e. g. black and white), the Gyricon technology focuses on a spherical particle in which the two hemispheres are differently polarized and coloured. Both technologies are characterized by a very good resolution, competitive relative energy efficiency in comparison to other display technologies and low-priced production costs. The biggest drawbacks are certainly the limited capacity to display more than two colours as well as the need for electrodes and circuits. The technologies application field is therefore reduced to simple displays, for example electronic books (cf. Amazon Kindle) or <b>electronic</b> <b>labelling.</b> Fraunhofer researchers together with the research group of Professor Yadong Yin from the University of California Riverside have now developed a microcapsules based technology allowing a system which is tuneable in its colour scale without the need for an integrated energy supply, electrodes or circuits. A further characteristic of the encapsulated system is its memory effect thus leading to broad applicability. The approach, called "MikroMem - microcapsules with memory effect", is a patented technology from Fraunhofer-Society. Aim of the collaborative network research project MikroMem is to prove the system feasibility and its transfer into different industrial application. The collaborative research model imported from The U. S. has high potentiality and is moreover characterized by a great flexibility. Namely, a group of industrial companies from different application fields brought together by the goal of realizing a highly innovative technology shares the development risks and expense and will benefits from the technology realization as exclusive partner on the respective application area. The forthcoming technology developed by researcher at the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft and UCR will be presented together with the collaborative research approach...|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{technology}} nowadays {{is developing}} rapidly {{throughout the world}} and also in Hong Kong. The Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is a mature technology which has been applied {{in a lot of}} industries in recent years, such as retail, airline, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, logistics, and libraries etc. RFID technology acts as an <b>electronic</b> <b>labelling</b> and data-collection system to identify and track equipment. RFID is a more robust technology than bar coding and does not require line-of-sight to operate. It is able to provide not only the electronic data for unique identification, but also provides a paperless workflow automation solution. The application of palm and wireless technology using the RFID in conjunction with a Web Based Maintenance Service Management System in the Facility Management (FM) has the following advantages: (i) It improves operations and facilitates day-to-day maintenance activities and management of works. (ii) The RFID system helps to improve the management of facilities, decision-making and control of quality by providing enhanced processes and equipment visibility. The RFID system offers a dynamic and centralized approach to facilitate the above FM processes. The objective {{of this study is to}} quantify the benefits of RFID technology for the FM. Throughout the study of RFID pilot project carried out by the HKHA, we evaluate the factors that affect the application of RFID system in Hong Kong FM industry. Questionnaires were given out to explore maintenance professionals’ opinions on the satisfaction of RFID system for maintenance of Air Conditioning (A/C) system. The data and hypotheses are analysed by using the statistical methods. The survey concluded that RFID system can improve the user satisfaction rating in FM compared with the paper based system. From the regression analysis, we found that the processes of improvement, quantities of A/C equipment and training & education are more important in determining the satisfaction of RFID system and have positive effect on the use of RFID system. The analysis of various regression models helped to discover the key significant variables that correlated to the satisfaction of using the RFID system. According to the survey findings, the RFID system has proved to be very useful for FM as it offered significant benefits over traditional paper based approaches. From the survey result, we also found that the “Insufficient training for use of RFID system” is the important obstacle to the adoption of RFID system. As education and training are critical for development of staff capability to handle new process requirements and achieve better performance of using the RFID system, HKHA is highly recommended to strengthen the training and education in order to improve their work satisfaction and support the continued use of RFID system. This dissertation offers HKHA managers a valuable perspective on the RFID implementation in their organization. The findings also highlighted the significant potential and obstacle of RFID system for FM. To encourage the use and expand the benefits of RFID system in FM industry, the Government policy is crucial in driving the adoption of RFID system so as to accelerate its diffusion and stimulate the growth of related industries. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|E
