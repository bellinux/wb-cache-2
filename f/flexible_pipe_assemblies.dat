40|$|A <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe</b> {{consists}} of {{several layers of}} steel and fluid barriers, where the fluid barriers keep the inside (steel) of the <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe</b> dry. Unfortunately, the most frequently damaged component of the <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe</b> is the external sheath, which is the outer fluid barrier. Water in the annulus {{is an indication of}} leakage, and replacement is then needed. To protect against or avoid severe damage of the <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe,</b> several inspection methods to detect damage of different parts of the <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe</b> are available. To detect the presence of air or water inside a gap between two steel armour plates in this work, an inspection method was necessary. The performed inspection was normal incident pulse-echo ultrasonic inspection. Both unfocused (plane) and focused transducers were used to scan a simplified <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe</b> model. The model consisted of a high density polyethylene (HDPE) external sheath and steel armour plates beneath it. The gaps between two steel plates beneath the HDPE-sheath was filled with either air or water and inspected. A realistic gap size between steel plates was found in theory to be in the range from 1 to 2 mm if the gaps were evenly distributed over the circumference of the <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe.</b> To detect whether air or water was present, only the focused transducer fitted this purpose. The focused transducer detected difference between air and water for a 2 mm gap between steel plates when the transducer gradually inspected from steel over the gap and to steel again. From circle segment area consideration, it should be possible in theory to see a 180 ° phase-shift for 1. 2 mm gap between steel plates to differ air and water. Another way to differ air and water was to detect the plexiglass-container layer beneath both the HDPE-plate and the water layer. If air was present the layer could not be detected, but if water was present a 0. 5 mm gap between the steel plates could be identified by amplitude consideration. In the lab-test this layer was a plexiglass-container, but for a real <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe</b> this layer is an antiwear layer or another steel layer beneath the first steel layer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue is an {{important}} character for the <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> as they are always exposed to dynamic loading. For nonbonded <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes,</b> fatigue and stress analysis can be performed based on different assumptions of slip behaviour. Different slip assumptions used in estimating the slip stress always play a determinative role in the prediction of fatigue damage. Thus, this thesis {{will focus on the}} study of the slip behaviour between tensile armour layers of nonbonded <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes.</b> The results can be used to support the basic assumptions for further fatigue analysis. The main object of this thesis is to summarize the existing analytical methods for stress and slip analysis of nonbonded <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe</b> armouring layers and to verify that the improved finite element models can give adequate description of the <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe</b> slip behaviour. In previous version of BFLEX, the transverse slip effect for nonbonded <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> has been neglected. In this thesis, transverse slip regime has been activated in the updated BFLEX by developing a new type of beam element hshear 353 and a new type of contact element hcont 453. Finite element models use these two elements have been made and several case studies have been carried out. For axisymmetric loading, two analytical solutions, one obtained from the equations by Witz&Tan[13], one from S&# 230;vik[2] have been compared with the result from numerical simulation. It has been found that S&# 230;vik&# 146;s solution matches better with the BFLEX solution comparing to Witz&Tan&# 146;s solution. For <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> exposed to bending, influences on slip behaviour from several pipe parameters, namely friction coefficient, axial strain and global pipe curvature, have been investigated. The numerical results are also compared with analytical solutions obtained from S&# 230;vik[2]. It has been found that the numerical solutions can give excellent agreement with analytical solutions. It is further concluded that the outer tensile armour layer do not influence much on the inner layer slip behaviour. In addition, the cyclic bending effects on nonbonded <b>flexible</b> <b>pipes</b> have been investigated. It has been found that the tendon behaves differently from case to case. The inner and outer layers behave differently. Only a few cases have been studied for this problem due to time limitation. The overall conclusion is that the developed BFLEX model is capable of describing the stresses and local displacements of <b>flexible</b> <b>pipe</b> for simple cases. The developed numerical model can further be used in the study of fatigue in flexible risers. However, more studies on influence from multi-tensile layers and cyclic bending are needed in the future. </p...|$|R

All the layers except the tapes are included in the LS-DYNA model. The carcass and the pressure armour are simplified. They are modeled as a shell structure and special orthotropic material is utilized for these layers. The BFLEX 2010 model is modeled with beam elements.
