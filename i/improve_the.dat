5|$|The Ringway {{projects}} were extremely unpopular and drew wide-scale protests, {{which led to}} the cancellation of plans in 1972, particularly after the Westway had opened in the face of wide scale protest two years earlier. In 1974, the MOT scaled back plans to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> North Circular Road, though {{by the end of the}} decade they had revised plans to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> route to dual carriageway throughout without any property frontages. In 1979, the Ministry of Transport planned to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> Great Cambridge Road Roundabout with a £17 million scheme that would have demolished over 100 houses and shops. This was cancelled and replaced with a straightforward underpass in 1983, costing £22.3 million.|$|E

30|$|BM 3 D has two {{filtering}} {{steps and}} more than 20 parameters. <b>Improving</b> <b>the</b> way of adjusting any of the 20 parameters would participate on <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> output of the BM 3 D method. BM 3 D modifications would be categorized into four main categorizes: (1) modifications consider <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> shrinkage function, (2) modifications consider <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> transforms, (3) modifications consider <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> image similarity measures when collecting similar patches, and (4) modifications consider <b>improving</b> <b>the</b> Wiener filtering stages. Suwabe et al. [55] modified the way of collecting similar patches in the BM 3 D from non-locally to globally. They proposed using iterative filtering with Chebyshev polynomial approximation (CPA) in order to collect the patches from the whole noisy image. Bashar and El-Sakka [3] replaced the fixed hard thresholding scheme with a learning-based adaptive hard thresholding scheme that considers the context of corresponding blocks. Hasan and El-Sakka [24] <b>improved</b> <b>the</b> Wiener filter of BM 3 D by maximizing the structural similarity (SSIM) [60] between patches instead of using the mean square error (MSE). Moreover, they introduced a 3 D zigzag thresholding.|$|R

5|$|Amino acids {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{applications}} in industry, but their main use is as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> health or production of these animals.|$|E
5|$|By January 1974, a {{joint working}} party {{representing}} Greater Manchester had drawn up its county Structure Plan, ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county. The highest priority was {{to increase the}} quality of life for its inhabitants by improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation—much of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century growth, and was unsuited to modern lifestyles. Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in country parks to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> region's poor reputation on leisure facilities, and to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> county's transport infrastructure and patterns.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} of the Anarchy, in which the Empress Matilda and Stephen fought for control of England, Southampton was held by William le Gros, the Bishop of Winchester and a {{supporter}} of Stephen. When Henry II came to the throne in 1153, he took back Southampton and carried out improvements to the castle, as part of his attempt to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> general standard of security in the south. By {{the second half of the}} 12th century, Southampton was increasingly important for coastal defence and as a base for operations on the continent. Following the threat of French invasion in the 1170s, Henry II invested modest additional resources in the castle, but no efforts were undertaken to <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> town's ditches and banks.|$|E
