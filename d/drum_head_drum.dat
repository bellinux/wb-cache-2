5000|$|Double-tension is {{a method}} of {{applying}} tension to <b>drum</b> <b>heads.</b> <b>Drum</b> manufacturers use several methods to apply tension to drum heads; the preferred way is to tighten the heads with a hoop that is held tight to the drum shell {{with a number of}} individual threaded rods which connect to stanchions mounted with bolts onto the outside of the drum shell. When there are individual stanchions for both the lower head and the upper [...] "struck" [...] head, or when there is one common center-mounted stanchion that accepts the threaded rods from both the upper and lower <b>drum</b> <b>heads,</b> that {{is said to be a}} double-tension drum.|$|R

25|$|The <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> has {{the most}} effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high {{frequency}} harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing. <b>Drum</b> <b>heads</b> with a white, textured coating on them muffle the overtones of the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> slightly, producing a less diverse pitch. <b>Drum</b> <b>heads</b> with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more. And <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> with perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones (Howie 2005). Some jazz drummers avoid using thick <b>drum</b> <b>heads,</b> preferring single ply <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> or <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> with no muffling. Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated <b>drum</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{size of a}} lion drum is very big, and {{is widely}} used for the Lion dance. There are {{normally}} 2 types, the northern Lion drum (normally in red) and southern lion drum (painted in black). It is a single-headed drum, and its large size helps to create a majestic, booming resonance upon striking of the <b>drum</b> <b>head.</b> The lion <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> is made of thick, durable goat skin, and its wooden body is normally decorated with intricate hand-drawn drawings. The sound produce by it usually sound higher key than the datanggu.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 65 - 66) The basic acoustical {{characteristics of}} snare drums, {{such as the}} modes of vibration, the interaction between different drum parts, and the sound radiation patterns of low-frequency drum modes are investigated in this work. Two different snare drums {{were used in the}} experiments. One was a Ludwig drum with a metal shell. The other was a Remo drum with a shell of a composite material. First of all, tensions of the <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> were measured using the deflection method. Then, the vibrational modes of the <b>drum</b> <b>heads,</b> the <b>drum</b> shell, and the complete drum were carefully measured in experiments using both mode-scanning and modal analysis techniques. <b>Drum</b> <b>head</b> coupling was observed for the 01 and 11 <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> modes. It was found that the interactions between the two <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> are mainly caused by acoustical coupling through the air enclosure rather than by mechanical coupling through the drum shell. A two-mass/three-spring model was constructed to describe the coupling behavior in the 01 mode. Experimental results support the correctness of the model. Finally, sound radiation patterns of different drum modes were measured in an anechoic chamber. Monopole, dipole and quadrupole patterns were observed in radiation from the 0 1 and 11 coupled drum modes. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R

50|$|Drums with {{cylindrical}} shells can be open {{at one end}} (as is {{the case}} with timbales), or can have two <b>drum</b> <b>heads.</b> Single-headed <b>drums</b> typically consist of a skin stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. <b>Drums</b> with two <b>heads</b> covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African slit drum, also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the Caribbean steel drum, made from a metal barrel. <b>Drums</b> with two <b>heads</b> can also have a set of wires, called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name snare drum.|$|R
5000|$|The shime-daiko (締め太鼓) {{is a small}} Japanese drum. It has a {{short but}} wide body with animal skin drumheads on both its upper and bottom sides. The hide is first {{stretched}} on metal hoops, then stretched over the body. Similar to the tsuzumi and to African talking <b>drums,</b> both <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> are bound together with cords so that the <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> are bound by each other. Like the larger taiko drums, the shime-daiko is played with sticks called [...] "bachi," [...] while it's suspended on a stand. Being very taut, the shime-daiko has a higher pitch than that of normal taiko. Shime-daiko are used in various Japanese music ensembles, from nagauta (長唄), hayashi (囃子), taiko (太鼓), to folk music, or min'yō (民謡) ensembles.|$|R
50|$|The {{circular}} <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> {{is made of}} processed cow skin. Usually {{there are}} 12 hinges that hold the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> to the wooden trunk using thick ropes. Typical <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> size is about 32 cm and about 23 cm inner diameter. Playing area of <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> is about 20 cm in diameter. Wedges inserted inside the ropes are twisted to tighten or loosen the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> while tuning. A tubular wooden wedge is tied to edge of the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> to roll using dominant hand. Traditionally the chande must be tuned to an octave above singers tonic (Higher Shadja).|$|R
50|$|In the 2010s, {{general music}} stores {{typically}} carry {{a range of}} instruments used in popular music and traditional music such as the electric guitar, acoustic guitar, electric bass, guitar strings, instrument amplifiers (guitar amplifier, bass amplifier and keyboard amplifier), electronic effects (e.g., distortion pedals), electronic keyboards (including digital pianos, stage pianos, clonewheel organs and synthesizers), drum kit components, which include drums, cymbals, drum and cymbal stands and drum accessories (<b>drum</b> sticks, <b>drum</b> <b>heads,</b> etc.) and percussion instruments (e.g., tambourine, shakers, etc.). Some stores carry other types of stringed instruments, such as mandolins and ukuleles.|$|R
50|$|The bass <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> {{is known}} as the eda muchchige and the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> {{is known as}} the bala muchchige. The right <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> is similar to tabla <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> but differs {{slightly}} creating a major tonal difference. The maddale unlike Mrudangam, Parkwaj or Tabla produces tonic when playing on the rim and on ink. The left <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> produces lower pitched bass sounds. The right <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> has a circular disk in the centre called karne or the ink causing the drum to produce harmonic tones. The left drum is smeared with a tuning paste made from ash and rice called bona, before the performance to dampen the tone and to produce bass sound.|$|R

40|$|Most drums used in Africa and {{in other}} parts of the world have varied shapes and sizes in their design. The {{hourglass}} shaped talking drums in Ghana is a pressurized drum which alters the tension on the drumhead, and as a result the pitches of the sounds emanating from it due to the strings that hold the drumhead in place, both from its upper and lower circumference. Remarka-bly, and in contrast to the circular drum with constant tension on the <b>drum</b> <b>head,</b> this <b>drum</b> pos-sesses both harmonic and rhythmic characteristics. In this work the drumhead is modeled, by making the tension in it to vary as a periodic function of time, using the two dimensional wave equation. The separated Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are solved and the Fourier-Bessel coefficients are determined using the initial and boundary conditions imposed on the equation. For a suitable choice of radial functions, the normal modes from our model are in good agreement with experimental values for harmonic instruments which produce integral overtones...|$|R
