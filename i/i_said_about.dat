500|$|In a BBC investigative {{documentary}} {{broadcast in}} December 2014, an antique firearms collector named Dennis Meighan {{claimed that he}} had been hired by an unidentified senior Liberal to kill Scott, for a fee of £13,500. Having initially agreed, [...] Meighan says, he [...] changed his mind, but provided Newton with the gun used in the shooting. After confessing to the police, he was asked to sign a prepared statement which, according to him, [...] "left everything out that was incriminating, {{but at the same time}} everything <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the Liberal Party, Jeremy Thorpe, et cetera, was left out as well." [...] The [...] BBC's Tom Mangold said that Meighan's account, if true, indicated the existence of [...] "a conspiracy at the very highest level". [...] In 2016 the Avon and Somerset police passed their files to Gwent Police, for an independent review of the original investigation.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed reception {{by trade}} publications. Walton of The Moving Picture News stated, [...] "The tender end, mother, is good; it's well acted. What <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> The Doctor's Carriage I repeat. This theme is far-fetched; the convict stripes unnecessary. Whoever {{was at the}} helm in this picture {{was just a little}} bit mixed - as to the course." [...] The Moving Picture Worlds review was more neutral and stated the film was rather engaging and it will keep the audiences interest. The reviewer did not find either specific praise or fault in the actual production itself. The New York Dramatic Mirror was the most detailed in its review. The reviewer states, [...] "There are very strong situations in this picture story, based on the efforts of a young man and his sweetheart to prevent the young man's mother from knowing that he has been sent to prison. ... In a series of melodramatic scenes that are not as convincing as they might be, we see the son elude the penitentiary officers, and later he returns openly to his home with a newspaper in which is printed the confession of the criminal who had committed the offense of which the son had been convicted. Some of the scenes were handled too abruptly for the best results, but otherwise the acting appears satisfactory." [...] Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E
2500|$|Referee Valentin Ivanov set a {{new record}} {{for the number of}} red cards issued in a World Cup match with four, and tied the record for yellow cards with 16. FIFA {{president}} Sepp Blatter said of Ivanov, [...] "I consider that today the referee was not at the same level as the participants, the players. There could have been a yellow card for the referee," [...] although he later recanted, saying, [...] "I regret what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> his actions in the match between Portugal and the Netherlands." [...] The managers also blamed each other for not playing fairly; Portugal's Luiz Felipe Scolari said, [...] "FIFA talks about fair play. There was no fair play," [...] while the Netherlands' Marco van Basten responded, [...] "If you talk about fair play, you should watch yourself first... a bit more experienced with all these tricks and all this time wasting." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 2007, {{he became}} {{embroiled in a}} {{political}} scandal after former defense minister Irakli Okruashvili on September 25, 2007 accused Mikheil Saakashvili, the President of Georgia, of planning Patarkatsishvili's assassination. Arrested on corruption charges, however, Okruashvili retracted his accusations against the president, winning release on bail of 10 million Georgian lari (about 6,250,000 USD). He also said that his earlier accusations levelled against Saakashvili were not true and were aimed at gaining political dividends for himself and Badri Patarkatsishvili and at discrediting the President of Georgia. On November 6, Okruashvili, said on Patarkatsishvili's Imedi TV - by then managed by Fox TV's parent News Corporation [...] - {{that he had been}} forced into retracting his accusations against Saakashvili by pressure that he endured in prison. Down the line from Munich, he said: [...] "All of those accusations, all of those facts that I brought against Saakashvili, everything <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> him is the plain truth." ...|$|E
