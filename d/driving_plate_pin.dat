40|$|This report {{investigates the}} stress {{distribution}} in link plates with varying amounts of material behind the link <b>plate</b> <b>pins.</b> The link <b>plates</b> of I- 94 EB over Norfolk Southern Railroad and Portage Creek, Bridge ID R 02 - 39022, were not fabricated {{in accordance with}} AASHTO bridge design code due to less than the required amount of material behind the <b>pin.</b> These link <b>plates</b> were modeled, along with a similarly sized link plate with the required amount of material behind the pin, using finite element analysis verified by full scale tensile testing. End-of-plate stresses were found to increase dramatically as material behind the pin was removed; stresses immediately adjacent to the pin increased significantly, the overall yield and ultimate capacity decreased, and the mid-plate stresses remained relatively unchanged. The link plates of R 02 - 39022 were removed and replaced with correctly sized link plates; one of the salvaged plates was tested and found to have yielded and entered the strain hardening region. A method of estimating effective stresses in link plates with less than the required amount of material behind the pin was developed. 17.

30|$|The {{field of}} {{orthopaedics}} is a constantly evolving discipline. Despite the historical success of <b>plates,</b> <b>pins</b> and screws in fracture reduction and stabilisation, {{there is a}} continuing search for more efficient and improved methods of fracture fixation. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate shape-memory staples and to compare them to a currently used implant for internal fracture fixation. Multi-plane bending stability and interfragmentary compression were assessed across a simulated osteotomy using single and double-staple fixation and compared to a bridging plate.|$|R
50|$|Being able {{to degrade}} into {{innocuous}} lactic acid, PLA {{is used as}} medical implants {{in the form of}} anchors, screws, <b>plates,</b> <b>pins,</b> rods, and as a mesh. Depending on the exact type used, it breaks down inside the body within 6 months to 2 years. This gradual degradation is desirable for a support structure, because it gradually transfers the load to the body (e.g. the bone) as that area heals. The strength characteristics of PLA and PLLA implants are well documented.|$|R
50|$|Slab pull is {{the portion}} of motion of a tectonic plate that can be {{accounted}} for by its subduction. Plate motion is partly driven by the weight of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at oceanic trenches. This force and slab suction account for almost all of the force <b>driving</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics. The ridge push at rifts contributes only 5 to 10%.|$|R

Since the sensor module using the Kerr effect of the single domain exchange-coupled magnetic film utilizes magnetization rotation only, Barkhausen noise due to domain wall pinning can be excluded. The current sensor consists of a Laser-diode, a polarizer, a Fe-Si/Mn-Ir exchange-coupled film, a quarter-wavelength <b>plate,</b> <b>PIN</b> Photodiodes and a differentia...|$|R

Second Anode + Grid 2 (<b>Pin</b> 9) and <b>Plates</b> (<b>Pin</b> 10 & 11 and Pin 7 & 8) have a maximum value limit of 6000 volts dc.

Grid 1 (Pin 3) can receive either a Negative Bias or a Positive Bias. Pin-2 is the brightness voltage, and pin-3 is the video signal which rides on top of DC, and pin-2 is a DC Level which varies with the Brightness Control.

40|$|Surface {{topography}} influences {{friction and}} transfer layer formation during sliding. In the present investigating, {{various kinds of}} surface topography were produced on steel <b>plate.</b> <b>Pins</b> made of metals (pure Al, Cu and Pb) and alloys (Al- 4 Mg and Al- 8 Mg) were then slid against prepared steel plates using inclined pin-on-plate sliding tester to understand the role of surface topography of harder surface and load on friction and transfer layer formation under both dry and lubricated conditions. It was observed that the transfer layer formation and coefficient of friction along with its two components, namely adhesion and plowing, are strongly dependent on surface topography and independent of surface roughness (Ra). The plowing component of friction was highest for the surface that promotes plain strain conditions and was lowest for the surface that promote plane stress conditions near the surface...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to using their domesticated animals for food, {{the people of}} Huamachuco hunted game, such as deer and birds. They also hunted various types of rodents. The peoples depended on their domestic animals to satisfy much of their need for food, clothing, and transportation. They used them less in agriculture. Metal artifacts have been found, attesting to their skilled artisans. Their materials were not only gold, silver, and copper, but also gilded copper and some arsenic bronze mixtures. Common metal products included chisels, adzes, <b>plates,</b> <b>pins,</b> tupus, needles, and tweezers; ingots and scraps of pure metals have been recovered as archeological artifacts.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} active cloaking of {{a square}} array of evenly spaced pins in a Kirchhoff {{plate in the}} presence of flexural waves. Active sources are distributed exterior to the cluster and are represented by the non-singular Green's function for the biharmonic operator. The complex amplitudes of the active sources, which cancel out selected multipole orders of the scattered field, are found by solving an algebraic system of equations. For frequencies in the zero-frequency stop band, we find that a small number of active sources located on a grid is sufficient for cloaking. For higher frequencies, we achieve efficient cloaking with the active sources positioned on a circle surrounding the cluster. We demonstrate the cloaking efficiency with several numerical illustrations, considering key frequencies from band diagrams and dispersion surfaces for a Kirchhoff <b>plate</b> <b>pinned</b> in a doubly periodic fashion.
