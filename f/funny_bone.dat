[...] Ward further explained that the eponymous character was analogous to himself, noting, [...] "I'm made out of broken parts … but you can turn [...] into something worth displaying." [...] To voice Princess Monster Wife, Ward, Walch, and Little had to record each of their lines in tandem, mimicking the tones of one another.|$|E

6000|$|In the old prize-ring a round had no fixed duration. It was {{terminated}} {{by the fall}} of one of the combatants (in practice usually both of them), and was followed by an interval of half a minute for recuperation. The practical effect of this was that a combatant could always get a respite of half a minute whenever he wanted it by pretending to be knocked down: [...] "finding the earth the safest place," [...] as the old phrase went. For this the Marquess of Queensberry substituted a rule that a round with the gloves should last a specified time, usually three or four minutes, and that a combatant who did not stand up to his opponent continuously during that time (ten seconds being allowed for rising {{in the event of a}} knock-down) lost the battle. That unobtrusively slipped-in ten seconds limit has produced the modern glove fight. Its practical effect is that a man dazed by a blow or a fall for, say, twelve seconds, which would not have mattered in an old-fashioned fight with its thirty seconds interval,[1] has under the Queensberry rules either to lose or else stagger to his feet in a helpless condition and be eagerly battered into insensibility by his opponent before he can recover his powers of self-defence. The notion that such a battery cannot be inflicted with boxing gloves is only entertained by people who have never used them or seen them used. I may say that I have myself received, in an accident, a blow in the face, involving two macadamized holes in it, more violent than the most formidable pugilist could have given me with his bare knuckles. This blow did not stun or disable me even momentarily. On the other hand, I have seen a man knocked quite silly by a tap from the most luxurious sort of boxing glove made, wielded by a quite unathletic literary man sparring for the first time in his life. The human jaw, like the human elbow, is provided, as every boxer knows, with a [...] "funny bone"; and the pugilist who is lucky enough to jar that <b>funny</b> <b>bone</b> with a blow practically has his opponent at his mercy for at least ten seconds. Such a blow is called a [...] "knock-out." [...] The <b>funny</b> <b>bone</b> and the ten-seconds rule explain the development of Queensberry sparring into the modern knocking-out match or glove fight.|$|E
