50|$|Stone quoins {{are used}} on stone or brick {{buildings}}. Brick quoins may appear on brick buildings that extrude from the <b>facing</b> <b>brickwork</b> {{in such a}} way as to give the appearance of uniformly cut blocks of stone larger than the bricks. Where quoins are used for decoration and not for load-bearing, they may be made from a wider variety of materials beyond brick, stone or concrete, extending to timber, cement render or other stucco.|$|E
50|$|First, in the 1890s {{major repairs}} {{were made to}} the {{brickwork}} because engineers of the late Victorian era were concerned that the original lime mortar used in the viaduct's construction was inadequate. It was decided that this should be replaced with cement mortar. However, replacement <b>facing</b> <b>brickwork</b> and substandard mortar eventually caused its own failures prompting more expensive repairs. Second, as the parapets and pavilions were made from Caen stone, a high-quality limestone, they have been subject to heavy weathering. By 1956, the damage was extensive but the cost of refurbishment work was deemed too much by British Railways, the UK's nationalised rail operator.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{alterations}} {{and painting}} of the <b>face</b> <b>brickwork,</b> the Normanby Hotel retains its picturesque quality.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is constructed of <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> with a hipped corrugated iron roof and encircling timber verandah. Centred {{on the ridge}} is a skylight.|$|R
50|$|It is {{significant}} for its high quality workmanship {{in particular the}} <b>face</b> <b>brickwork,</b> which shows {{the influence of the}} Modern Movement popular in the 1930s.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} entire brick façades of XIII and XIV century palaces in Siena {{revealed}} traces of ancient treatments of the surfaces for aesthetic purposes. It was {{also possible to}} attribute such treatments, today presenting as calcium oxalate films, {{to the time when}} the façades were built. The aim of the present study of several XV and XVI century brick façades is to determine if the same finishing techniques continued to be used in time. The results indicate that the palaces of this second period present similar types and distribution of Ca-oxalate films on the various architectonic elements of the façade, and confirm the aesthetic purpose of the original treatments. From the historical-architectural point of view, these conclusions reveal the diffusion of <b>facing</b> <b>brickwork</b> in high- and medium-prestige buildings during XIII-XVI century, and the so far unknown use of chromatic enhancement, via transparent and/or variable red shading treatments, to differentiate the wall face from the architectonic and ornamental elements...|$|E
50|$|Side {{elevations}} {{finished in}} <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> terminate as parapets {{to conceal the}} corrugated iron gabled roof and box gutters behind. The right hand (east) wall has original window openings at first floor level.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} {{constructed}} of red-brown <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> on a rendered base with a hipped corrugated iron roof with timber verandahs {{to the east}} and timber verandahs and bedroom wing to the west. The house was not inspected during the site visit.|$|R
50|$|The 1880s brick renovations are {{rendered}} {{to resemble}} ashlar, {{and it is}} likely the <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> was first painted at this time. Wilston House presents a highly intact facade, with a recent kalsomine coating to the exterior brickwork and render and a Welsh slate roof.|$|R
50|$|Telecommunications House is {{important}} for its aesthetic characteristics including the deeply modelled facade of contrasting <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> and rendered classical details. The building makes a strong contribution to the streetscape, being complementary in scale and design to the GPO buildings opposite and the neighbouring St Stephens complex.|$|R
50|$|The Brisbane Arcade connects Queen and Adelaide Streets in {{the block}} between Edward and Albert Streets. The facades {{at each end}} have similar {{features}} - both are three storeys high and five window bays across, of <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> with cement dressings, and use plain Classical details.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{layout of}} the bank contained the banking chamber and associated offices {{on the ground floor}} level, with the manager's residence above. When constructed, Kullaroo House was <b>face</b> <b>brickwork,</b> but the building has subsequently been painted and this diminishes the architectural articulation of the design.|$|R
50|$|This {{building}} has a conspicuous roof with prominent gable verge held by brackets at the gable. The tuck pointed <b>face</b> <b>brickwork,</b> turned timber posts, roof vent, terracotta details including plaque with a date, the large semicircular arch, and the roof form differentiates {{the hall from}} the offices.|$|R
50|$|A parapet {{of exposed}} <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> with applied {{decoration}} in cement render dominates the Stanley Street facade. The central design element on this parapet is a pediment scroll with plant motifs; in the bays {{on either side}} of the scroll, arch forms in cement render are set in relief.|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} {{walls of the}} front and side elevations are mostly <b>face</b> <b>brickwork,</b> which is now painted. Outside the verandah, the walls above the upper sill are rendered in roughcast. The front verandah finishes short of each end, leaving a small bay for a double-hung window on each level.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is constructed of predominantly orange <b>face</b> <b>brickwork,</b> however two bands of decorative blue brick {{are located in}} sections along all elevations. On the rear (western) elevation, besides having two decorative bands of blue brick, there are several bands (about ten) of the same blue brick {{at the top of}} the facade.|$|R
50|$|Pinel House is vacant {{and is very}} intact {{with the}} {{exception}} of the painting some time ago of the external <b>face</b> <b>brickwork.</b> Female Ward 4 now houses the hospital's museum and is in a very intact condition. Clouston House is also in an intact condition and is vacant and used for storage.|$|R
50|$|The Mansions is {{important}} for its architectural attributes. The skilful and complex composition of <b>face</b> <b>brickwork,</b> stone detailing, shady arcaded verandahs, integrated gardens and fencing, and complex roof form are of aesthetic beauty and make a strong contribution to the George and Margaret Streets streetscape and to the government precinct in George and William Streets.|$|R
50|$|Ardrossan, a {{decorative}} three-storeyed rendered masonry structure with strong Spanish Mission/Mediterranean architectural styling references, is prominently {{located on the}} northern corner of Julius and Moray Streets, opposite Green Gables. The building has a hipped, corrugated fibrous cement roof, and <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> to ground floor sill height with stucco above. Most windows are multi-paned casements with face brick sills.|$|R
50|$|Prominently {{situated}} on Auckland Hill {{with the main}} entrance addressing Yarroon Street, the Gladstone Court House is a two-storeyed brick building with a hipped corrugated iron roof. Designed in a stripped classical style, the red <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> contrasts with rendered string courses at floor and window levels. A rendered masonry fence {{appears to have been}} designed with the building.|$|R
50|$|The {{eastern end}} of the {{building}} contains mainly public spaces, and from it run two parallel accommodation wings along {{the northern and southern}} boundaries. These have simple elevations of <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> and window penetrations. Between these wings a roof has been added enclosing the lightwell below. The rear of the site extends into an extensive public carpark.|$|R
50|$|Ainslie is a two-storeyed masonry {{structure}} with a tiled hipped roof with projecting gables to the southwest. The building has Old English architectural styling references, and is located between Syncarpia and Pine Lodge fronting Julius Street to the southeast. The building has stretcher bond <b>face</b> <b>brickwork,</b> with regularly spaced darker bricks giving a patterned finish, and expressed coursing at sill height.|$|R
50|$|The Fulton Residence {{is intimately}} {{associated}} with the esteemed architect Charles Fulton as the house he designed for his family. It displays many {{of the characteristics of}} his work including the use of <b>face</b> <b>brickwork,</b> the use of modern materials such as steel windows and stainless, corner windows, the eschewing of internal decoration and an interest in designing for a sub tropical climate.|$|R
50|$|The Mansions {{are also}} an {{excellent}} example of the work of George Henry Male Addison, a designer who made an important contribution to Queensland's built environment. Stylistically these highly finished and ornate terrace houses are unlike any others in Queensland but are characteristic of Addison's work as an accomplished designer achieving maximum effect with roof form and <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> relieved with stone detailing.|$|R
50|$|The facade {{retains its}} {{original}} <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> and rendered decoration, although considerable changes {{have occurred to}} the window openings and types. Internally, some evidence of the original structure and finishes remains, particularly the pressed metal ceilings {{to the first floor}} of the left hand bay. A brick water tank support tower exists at roof level at the rear of the building.|$|R
50|$|Generally, the {{interior}} of the church is quite dark and heavy. The internal walls of the church are all dark <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> with black pointing. The joinery is heavy and the small openings are mostly glazed with coloured glass. There is early electrical lighting within the church in the form of pendants in the nave and wall brackets along the walls of the side aisles.|$|R
50|$|All {{four of the}} building's facades {{are similar}} {{symmetrical}} articulated planes of <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> with projecting bays, stepped parapet and verandahs to both levels {{for most of the}} perimeter (although many of the verandah areas have been infilled). Whilst the principal facade addresses Bolsover Street, the building's other three facades can be viewed from Derby, Alma and William Streets, although other buildings sit within the block.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was of restrained Italianate design, with <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> and stucco mouldings, and originally featured a semicircular portico on the south-western {{face of the}} station building. The station had a single platform, with the train shed supported by iron columns trimmed with a timber valence, and a bluestone retaining wall ran along Canterbury Road. An engine depot and carriage shed were built later in 1856.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{elevation}} facing Olcott Lane is also finished with <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> and terminates at roof level as a gable end. A projecting face brick rear wing contains the ground level kitchen, and two upper floors housing {{male and female}} lavatories. A timber staircase with corrugated iron skillion roof and partially enclosed with corrugated metal sheeting connects landings at doorways to the hall, supper room, lavatories.|$|R
50|$|The lounge also {{features}} a pressed metal ceiling with borders, roses and cornice, also a picture rail and tall timber cornice. Opening from here and other rooms onto the balcony are panelled and glazed French doors with tilting fanlights. The facade treatment here is <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> with flat brick arch lintels, simple pilasters continuing from ground level to the parapet, and double-hung windows with moulded plaster sills.|$|R
5000|$|The Toowoomba Technical College Building, Block A, is a two storey brick structure, {{relieved}} with sandstone dressings {{and some}} stucco, {{such as the}} pebble-dash balustrades marking the colonnade facing Margaret Street. All natural stone dressings are painted and the <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> has been coated with a clear finish. The eastern end of the north wing is equipped with saw tooth skylights facing south [...]|$|R
25|$|Located on the {{southeast}} {{side of the}} show ring and set into the earth bank which rises up to the railway line is a toilet building. This houses female amenities and a baby change room. The walls are a combination of <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> and rendered masonry with high level fixed vent glass louvres. The roof consists of two intersecting gables and is clad with metal custom orb roof sheeting.|$|R
50|$|Hennessy, Hennessy and Co.'s {{work for}} the Catholic Church in Queensland {{included}} Villa Maria Convent on St Paul's Terrace, Fortitude Valley and plans for the Holy Name Cathedral, also in Fortitude Valley, which {{did not come to}} fruition. Hennessy, Hennessy and Co. were leading practitioners of mainstream interwar styles such as Spanish Mission and Romanesque and many of their buildings featured textured <b>face</b> <b>brickwork,</b> as in Bulolo Flats.|$|R
50|$|The {{substantial}} two storey {{buildings with}} corrugated iron roofs have red-brown <b>face</b> <b>brickwork</b> to first floor level and rough-cast render above relieved with contrasting lintels and multi-paned sash and frame windows. The projecting central wing {{on the front}} elevations was finished on both levels with rough cast render relieved with contrasting quoining, banding, copings and lintels. Two storey timber verandahs provided the infill between the projecting wings of the front elevation.|$|R
50|$|Externally-exposed walls {{have been}} painted, while those {{sheltered}} by the verandah are unpainted, and show light-coloured splayed brick lintels, stone sills, and darker <b>face</b> <b>brickwork.</b> The building has timber sash windows, French doors opening onto {{the second level}} verandahs, tripartite windows facing {{the street to the}} first floor level, and flat arches to window heads on second floor level. It sits on a rendered masonry base which has intricate brick and iron ventilators.|$|R
