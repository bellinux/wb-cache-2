25|$|In many {{simulations}} of a solute-solvent system {{the main focus}} is on the behavior of the solute with little interest of the solvent behavior particularly in those solvent molecules residing in regions far from the solute molecule. Solvents may influence the dynamic behavior of solutes via random collisions and by imposing a <b>frictional</b> <b>drag</b> on the motion of the solute through the solvent. The use of non-rectangular periodic boundary conditions, stochastic boundaries and solvent shells can all help reduce the number of solvent molecules required and enable a larger proportion of the computing time to be spent instead on simulating the solute. It is also possible to incorporate the effects of a solvent without needing any explicit solvent molecules present. One example of this approach is to use a potential mean force (PMF) which describes how the free energy changes as a particular coordinate is varied. The free energy change described by PMF contains the averaged effects of the solvent.|$|E

The density-matrix-calculated {{evolution of a}} quantum Prandtl-Tomlinson model, describing the <b>frictional</b> <b>dragging</b> by an external force of a quantum particle, shows that classical predictions can be very wrong. The strongest quantum effect occurs not for weak, but for strong periodic potentials, where barriers are high but energy levels in each well are discrete, and resonant tunnelling to excited states in the nearest well can preempt classical stick-slip with great efficiency.

Assuming fully resolved Landau levels, the linear response theory expression for the transresistivity ρ 21 is evaluated using diagrammatic techniques. The transresistivity is given by an integral over energy and momentum transfer weighted by {{the product of the}} screened interlayer interaction and the phase-space for scattering events.

40|$|We derive and {{evaluate}} expressions for the <b>frictional</b> Coulomb <b>drag</b> between disordered {{two-dimensional electron gas}} layers. Our derivation {{is based on the}} memory-function formalism and the expression for the drag reduces to previously known results in the ballistic limit. We find that Coulomb drag is appreciably enhanced by disorder at low temperatures when the mean-free-path within a layer is comparable to or shorter than the layer separation. In high mobility two-dimensional electron gas systems, where the drag has been studied experimentally, the effect of disorder on the drag is negligible at attainable temperatures. We predict that an enhancement due to disorder and a crossover in the temperature-dependence and layer-separation dependence will be observable at low temperatures in moderate and low mobility samples.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} large eddy simulation for predicting turbulent channel flows with two-dimensional roughness elements of square, circular and triangular shapes transversely placed on the bottom wall. Results are obtained for several values of the cavity width to the roughness height ratio using various subgrid-scale turbulence models. The present large eddy simulation predictions of mean streamwise velocity, root-mean-square velocity fluctuations, and skin <b>frictional</b> and form <b>drags</b> agree reasonably well with previously published results of direct numerical simulations at a low Reynolds number. All the subgrid-scale models examined here are capable of reproducing the relevant physics associated with {{the effect of the}} rough surface on the turbulent flow, exhibiting similar performances. Moreover, the use of the turbulence models leads to an improvement in the predictions of several turbulence statistics as compared with the case when no model is considered. Large eddy simulation can be combined easily with an immersed boundary method yielding satisfactory results based on a coarser grid resolution than in direct numerical simulation and, thus, it is suitable for the investigation of turbulent channel flows with riblets of various shapes.

40|$|Characterizing {{forces on}} {{deformable}} objects intruding into sand and soil requires understanding the solid and fluid-like responses of such substrates and {{their effect on}} the state of the object. The most detailed studies of intrusion in dry granular media have revealed that interactions of fixed-shape objects during free impact (e. g. cannonballs) and forced slow penetration can be described by hydrostatic and hydrodynamic-like forces. Here we investigate a new class of granular interactions: rapid intrusions by objects that change shape (self-deform) through passive and active means. Systematic studies of a simple spring-mass robot jumping on dry granular media reveal that jumping performance is explained by an interplay of nonlinear <b>frictional</b> and hydrodynamic <b>drag</b> as well as induced added mass (unaccounted by traditional intrusion models) characterized by a rapidly solidified region of grains accelerated by the foot. A model incorporating these dynamics reveals that added mass degrades the performance of certain self-deformations due to a shift in optimal timing during push-off. Our systematic robophysical experiment reveals both new soft matter physics and principles for robotic self-deformation and control, which together provide principles of movement in deformable terrestrial environments.

40|$|Rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri Richardson) with a {{body mass}} of 268 ± 36 g were used to {{determine}} the acceleration resistance of a fish during fast-starts. The mass of the fish was increased by mass loads of 75, 150, 225 and 335 g. The loads were made from nesting horseshoe-shaped brass saddles which fitted snugly over the fish so that the extra mass was equally distributed in all planes about the stretched-straight body centre of mass. The weight of the saddles was taken up by a 291 cm line attached to the dorsal surface of the fish above its centre of mass. The {{other end of the line}} was attached to the ceiling. The performance of the fish with and without saddles was measured during fast-starts, initiated by a 1 v. cm" 1 d. c. electric shock. Performance was determined in terms of the distance travelled with time, measured from high speed movie films (240 frames s" 1). The relation-ships between distance travelled and time were described by power functions for fish with and without mass loads. Exponents were not significantly different for the fish with various mass loads showing that <b>frictional</b> and form <b>drag</b> made negligible contributions to acceleration resistance in a fast-start. The resistance of the fish in a fast-start, due to fish mass and a resistance component of added water mass (apparent mass), was calculated using hydromechanical theory for representative fast-start sequences.
