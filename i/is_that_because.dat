5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if the money is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E
25|$|Another {{advantage}} of CAPP-Seq <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> it only targets {{specific areas of}} interest in the genome it is more cost effective than whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing which are 171X and 44X more expensive respectively.|$|E
25|$|The key {{assumption}} underpinning Black's thinking <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> {{people are}} living longer {{they will have to}} work longer - hence the need for more effective intervention when working people fall ill, so that they can remain in the workforce instead of retiring on medical grounds or going onto benefits.|$|E

5000|$|The Buddha {{expressed}} interdependent Co-Arising very simply: [...] "This <b>is,</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is.</b> This <b>is</b> not, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not. This {{comes to}} <b>be,</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> comes to <b>be.</b> This ceases to <b>be,</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> ceases to be." [...] These sentences occur {{hundreds of times}} in both the Northern and Southern transmissions. They are the Buddhist genesis.|$|R
25|$|Caregiver {{sensitivity}} {{has also}} {{been found to have}} a connection with empathy in children. Generally, securely attached children {{have been found to be}} more empathetic compared with insecurely attached children. The reasoning suggested for this result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> securely attached children receive more empathy from caregivers during times that they themselves are distressed, they are more likely to show empathy in a situation where someone else is distressed.|$|E
25|$|The idealist {{perspective}} {{on the number of}} the beast rejects gematria, envisioning the number not as a code to be broken, but a symbol to be understood. Because there are so many names that can come to 666 and that most systems require converting names to other languages or adding titles when convenient, it has been impossible to come to a consensus. Given that numbers are used figuratively throughout the book of Revelation, idealists interpret this number figuratively as well. The common suggestion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> seven is a number of completeness and is associated with the divine, that six is incomplete and the three sixes mean completely incomplete.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, the {{boundaries}} between the 88 constellations were devised by Eugène Delporte along vertical and horizontal lines of right ascension and declination. However, the data he used originated back to epoch B1875.0, which was when Benjamin A. Gould first made his proposal to designate boundaries for the celestial sphere, a suggestion upon which Delporte would base his work. The consequence of this early date <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of the precession of the equinoxes, the borders on a modern star map, such as epoch J2000, are already somewhat skewed and no longer perfectly vertical or horizontal. This effect will increase {{over the years and}} centuries to come.|$|E
50|$|The problem used to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of {{the nature}} of negligence, the courts were {{uncertain}} if it was proper to have multiple counts of culpable homicide for the same action.|$|R

25|$|I don't hate Islam. I {{consider}} it a backward culture. I have travelled much in the world. And wherever Islam rules, it's just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> <b>Because</b> they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, thank you very much.|$|E
25|$|A United Nations Special Rapporteur {{undertook}} {{a mission to}} Mexico in 2002 to investigate reports by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights that the country's judiciary and administration of law was not independent. During {{the course of his}} visit to a number of cities, the rapporteur observed that corruption in the judiciary had not been reduced significantly. One of the principal issues <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> the federal courts operate at a relatively high level, most citizens are compelled to seek justice in the inadequate state courts. Additionally, the rapporteur expressed concerns about such issues as disorganization in the legal profession, difficulties and harassment faced by lawyers, poor trial procedures, poor access to the justice system for indigenous peoples and minors, and lacklustre investigation of many crimes.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a survey}} by the {{regulatory}} body in 2007, only 30 percent of those connected to the public water network enjoyed continuous water supply. On average, customers received water 12 hours per day. Tap water quality, at least in some areas and at some times, is poor: For example, residents of Cilincing, North Jakarta, have complained that their tap water has been cloudy for two months and blame skin irritation and diarrhoe on the poor water supply. According to interviews with residents in South and West Jakarta, shown in a 2011 video by the Amrta Institute for Water Literacy, service quality has actually deteriorated since the concessions began. One of the reasons <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> of low pressure, some customers pump directly from the pipes, therefore sucking dirty groundwater through leakages of the pipes.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{translations}} of the idappaccayatā formula by contemporary scholars and translators. For example, Thich Nhat Hanh translates this expression as follows: This <b>is,</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> is.This <b>is</b> not, <b>because</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not.This ceases to <b>be,</b> <b>because</b> <b>that</b> ceases to <b>be.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Henchard gloomily. [...] "He won't <b>be</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> he's shortly {{going to}} leave me." [...] He looked towards Donald, who had come near. [...] "Mr. Farfrae's time as my manager is drawing to a close--isn't it, Farfrae?" ...|$|R
25|$|The major {{benefits}} of this tactic is that the team is in complete control over its opponents. Meanwhile, by knocking the ball around, opponents playing the pressing game can easily tire. And should an opportunity suddenly arise, defence may be quickly switched to attack. A major downfall <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the accuracy of passes needs to be high, short passes between the players are required. This significantly narrows {{the gap between the}} attack, midfield and defence (usually, the latter is forced to push up). So if the opponent gains possession, a long ball could effectively open up the defence. Similarly, if it is the attack and midfield that need to drop back, the team will have little chances of counter-attacking even if possession is won back.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of index-based insurance {{is that it}} can potentially be delivered at lower cost. A significant barrier that hinders uptake of claim-based insurance is the high transaction cost for searching for prospective policyholders, negotiating and administering contracts, verifying losses and determining payouts. Index insurance eliminates the loss verification step, thereby mitigating a significant transaction cost. A second {{advantage of}} index-based insurance <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> it pays an indemnity based on the reading of an index rather than individual losses, it eliminates much of the fraud, moral hazard and adverse selection, which are common in classical claim-based insurance. A further advantage of index insurance is that payments based on a standardized and indisputable index also allow for a fast indemnity payment. The indemnity payment could be automated, further reducing transaction costs.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{misfeasance}} provision reflects {{causes of}} action vested in the company, any money recovered under it is held {{so that it}} will go to pay off creditors in their ordinary order of priority. In Re Anglo-Austrian Printing & Publishing Union this meant that a liquidator who had successfully sued directors for £7000 had to give up the funds to a group of debenture holders, who had not yet been paid in full, so there is no discretion to apply the assets in favour of unsecured creditors. A potential benefit <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the causes of action are vested in the company, they may be assigned to third parties, who may prefer to take the risk and reward of pursuing litigation over the liquidator or administrator. These features are the reverse for money recovered through the statutory based causes of action of fraudulent and wrongful trading.|$|E
50|$|According to Valsad District Collector D Rawal {{the reason}} for the water in Gujarat tasting less salty than usual <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of the monsoon, two rivers Auranga and Banki were in spate and were flowing into the sea in the region.|$|R
25|$|These {{difficulties}} {{were eliminated}} in 570 BCE when pure silver coins were introduced. However, electrum currency remained common until approximately 350 BCE. The simplest {{reason for this}} <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> of the gold content, one 14.1gram stater was {{worth as much as}} ten 14.1gram silver pieces.|$|R
6000|$|... 1. And it must <b>be</b> <b>THAT,</b> <b>because,</b> as <b>was</b> said, {{the altar}} {{is greater than}} the gift; but there is nothing but Christ's divine nature greater than his human; to be sure, a sorry bit of wood, a tree, the stock of a tree, is not.|$|R
25|$|The Shias {{accept some}} of the same hadiths used by Sunnis as part of the sunnah to argue their case. In addition, they {{consider}} the sayings of Ahl al-Bayt that are not attributed directly to Muhammad as hadiths. Shias do not accept many Sunni hadiths unless they are also recorded in Shia sources or the methodology can be proven of how they were recorded. Also, some Sunni-accepted hadith are less favored by Shias; one example <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of Aisha's opposition to Ali, hadiths narrated by Aisha are not given the same authority as those by other companions. Another example is hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah, who is considered by Shias as the enemy of Ali. The Shia argument is that Abu Hurairah was only a Muslim four years of his life before Muhammad's death. Although he accompanied Muhammad for four years only, he managed to record ten times as many hadiths as Abu Bakr and Ali each.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} {{and interviews with}} members of open source projects have described a male-dominated culture within open source communities that can be unwelcoming or hostile towards females. There are an initiatives such as Outreachy that aim to support more women and other underrepresented gender identities to participate in open source software. However, within the discussion forums of open source projects the topic of gender diversity can be highly controversial and even inflammatory. A central vision in open source software <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the software is built and maintained on the merit of individual code contributions, open source communities should act as a meritocracy. In a meritocracy, the importance of an individual in the community depends {{on the quality of}} their individual contributions and not demographic factors such as age, race, religion, or gender. Thus proposing changes to the community based on gender, for example, to make the community more inviting towards females, go against the ideal of a meritocracy by targeting certain programmers by gender and no based on their skill alone.|$|E
500|$|A {{religious}} criticism {{brought forth}} by Charles M. Larson <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> God rebuked and punished the Israelites anytime they lapsed into paganism or {{mingled with the}} followers of other deities, and because the New Testament claims that [...] "God does not use pagan or ungodly vessels to bear his Truth", {{the claim that the}} Book of Abraham was found in Egyptian religious documents (i.e. pagan documents, by Biblical definition) conflicts directly with what is written in the Bible.|$|E

Sadly, Bohannon?s operation adds little to what we already know...|$|R
2500|$|...Before NHLPA 1 hit the market, {{pictures}} surfaced {{showing a}} Phoenix Coyotes Jersey Roenick {{figure in the}} Tony Amonte pose.

500|$|Another {{argument}} raised <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> {{the federal}} income tax is progressive, the discriminations and inequalities created by the tax should render the tax unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law. Such arguments have been ruled without merit under contemporary jurisprudence. [...] Notably, some tax protesters contend that the Fourteenth Amendment itself was never properly ratified, under {{the theory that the}} governments of southern states that supported the post-Civil War constitutional amendments were not representative of the people.|$|E
500|$|One {{argument}} {{that has been}} raised <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> the federal income tax is progressive (i.e., because the marginal tax rates increase, or progress, {{as the level of}} taxable income increases), the discriminations and inequalities created by the tax should render the tax unconstitutional. This argument was rejected by the United States Supreme Court in two companion cases [...] with respect to the income tax on individuals in Thorne v. Anderson, and with respect to the income tax on corporations in Tyee Realty Co. v. Anderson.|$|E
500|$|Between Klute in 1971 and Fun With Dick and Jane in 1977, Fonda did {{not have}} a major film success. She {{appeared}} in A Doll's House (1973), Steelyard Blues and The Blue Bird (1976). From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views: [...] "I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted." [...] However, in her 2005 autobiography, My Life So Far, she rejected such simplification. [...] "The suggestion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>because</b> of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed." [...] She reduced acting because of her political activism providing a new focus in her life. Her return to acting in a series of 'issue-driven' films reflected this new focus.|$|E
