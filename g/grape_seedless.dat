40|$|Indexación: Web of Science; PubMedBackground Berry size is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} main selection criteria in table grape breeding programs. However, this is a quantitative and polygenic trait, and its genetic determination is still poorly understood. Considering its economic importance, it is relevant to determine its genetic architecture and elucidate the mechanisms involved in its expression. To approach this issue, an RNA-Seq experiment based on Illumina platform was performed (14 libraries), including seedless segregants with contrasting phenotypes for berry weight at fruit setting (FST) and 6 – 8 mm berries (B 68) phenological stages. Results A group of 526 differentially expressed (DE) genes were identified, by comparing seedless segregants with contrasting phenotypes for berry weight: 101 genes from the FST stage and 463 from the B 68 stage. Also, we integrated differential expression, principal components analysis (PCA), correlations and network co-expression analyses to characterize the transcriptome profiling observed in segregants with contrasting phenotypes for berry weight. After this, 68 DE genes were selected as candidate genes, and seven candidate genes were validated by real time-PCR, confirming their expression profiles. Conclusions We have carried out the first transcriptome analysis focused on table <b>grape</b> <b>seedless</b> segregants with contrasting phenotypes for berry weight. Our findings contributed {{to the understanding of the}} mechanisms involved in berry weight determination. Also, this comparative transcriptome profiling revealed candidate genes for berry weight which could be evaluated as selection tools in table grape breeding programs. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Brazil is a {{very large}} country with a diverse climate. This fact allows a {{diversity}} of plants to grow ranging from tropical rainforest in the Amazon, passing through Atlantic Forest along the coast, the cerrados (Brazilian savannah) in the Central West region, and semi-arid area in the Northeast. Latitude ranges from 5 º N to 33 º S, with most of this territory in the tropical region. There are enough reasons to plant breeders devoting great amount of their effort to improve plants suitable for warm climates, though. Among fruit crops, results of breeder's work have been noticed in several species, especially on peaches, grapes, citrus, apples, persimmons, figs, pears and others not so common, such as acerola, guava, annonas (sour sop, sugar apple, atemoya, cherimoya) and passion fruit. Peach tree introduced at low latitude (22 ± 2 ºS) requires climatic adaptation to subtropical conditions of low chilling. In Brazil, the first peach breeding program aiming adaptation of cultivars to different habitats was developed by Instituto Agronômico de Campinas (IAC) beginning in the end of the 40 's. Apple low chill requirement cultivars obtained in a South state, Paraná, are now been planted at low latitudes. Banana and pineapple breeding programs from Embrapa units along the country are successfully facing new sanitary problems. Petrolina/Juazeiro, in the Northeastern region (9 ºS), is the main grape exporting region with more than 6, 000 ha. Grape growing in the region is based in the so called "tropical" rootstocks released by IAC, namely: IAC 313 'Tropical', IAC 572 'Jales'.

Economical evaluation was based on the crop enterprise budgets to estimate the profitability. Results revealed that TSS was not affected by treatments, rather by delayed harvest time, while all other parameters were substantially affected by temperature management and advance handling. Additionally, an increase in the farmer’s net profit and the benefit-cost ratio by 9. 3 %. and from 5. 62 to 6. 05, respectively.

This region is responsible for 97 % of the national exportation of table <b>grapes,</b> including <b>seedless</b> <b>grapes.</b> Based on the fact that organic fertilization can improve soil quality, we compared the effects of conventional and organic soil management on microbial activity and mycorrhization of <b>seedless</b> <b>grape</b> crops. We measured glomerospores number, most probable number (MPN) of propagules, richness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species, AMF root colonization, EE-BRSP production, carbon microbial biomass (C-MB), microbial respiration, fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic activity (FDA) and metabolic coefficient (qCO 2). The organic management led to an increase in all variables with the exception of EE-BRSP and qCO 2. Mycorrhizal colonization increased from 4. 7 % in conventional crops to 15. 9 % in organic crops. Spore number ranged from 4. 1 to 12. 4 per 50 g- 1 soil in both management systems. The most probable number of AMF propagules increased from 79 cm- 3 soil in the conventional system to 110 cm- 3 soil in the organic system. Microbial carbon, CO 2 emission, and FDA activity were increased by 100 to 200 % in the organic crop. Thirteen species of AMF were identified, the majority in the organic cultivation system. Acaulospora excavata, Entrophospora infrequens, Glomus sp. 3 and Scutellospora sp. were found only in the organically managed crop. S. gregaria was found only in the conventional crop.

40|$|The major {{objective}} of this project is to develop techniques to produce <b>seedless</b> Kyoho <b>grape</b> to improve its competitive ability {{and to develop a}} suitable culture system for the Kyoho seedless mutant to increase the possibility of commercializing this mutant. DNA molecular markers can be used as an early selection tool for hybrid progeny which will improve breeding efficiency and reduce the breeding cost. This study will develop a seedless-linked marker for Kyoho-related cultivars which will be very helpful for tetraploid grape breeding. The main works in the 98 fiscal year include: 1. Development of technique to induce seedlessness in Kyoho <b>grapes.</b> Induced <b>seedless</b> Kyoho <b>grape</b> will benefit farmers and the grape industry 2. Berry enlargement of <b>seedless</b> <b>grapes</b> and the <b>seedless</b> Kyoho mutant by plant growth regulators. 3.

Breeding new triploid <b>seedless</b> <b>grapes.</b> Another major {{objective of}} this project is to develop a girlding method to improve berry quality of Kyoho grapevine. Rootstocks have remarkable effects on vine growth and berry production, as well as berry coloration and quality. As observed in the vineyard, some rootstock scion combinations, e. g. Kyoho on 1202, produced high yeild and large berries with poor color under double cropping system in Taiwan's warm subtropical climate. Previous results indicated that girdling can improve berry color of the summer crop in Kyoho for double cropping system. The effect is likely variable among different rootstock scion combinations. The main works include: 1) to identify the effects of differnet rootstock/scion combinations on grape berry growth and quality. 2) {{to examine the effects of}} girdling on fruit coloration and quality under different rootstock/scion combinations and to evaluate the potential of girdling treatment in the double cropping system in Taiwan's subtropical climate. 3) to develop the best girdling procedule and the best rootstock/scion combination for the application of girdling. 本計畫主要目的為開發巨峰葡萄無子化之技術，增進國產巨峰葡萄之競爭力。也將針對巨峰無子變異株建立一適當栽培模式以增加其經濟栽培之可行性，以增加其經濟栽培之可行性。DNA分子標誌可以作為雜交後代早期選拔的工具，增加育種的效率並節省大量育種成本，本研究計畫將開發巨峰系葡萄無子性狀連鎖之DNA分子標誌，尋找與巨峰無子變異株的無子性狀連鎖之DNA分子標誌，未來可開發為世界第一個巨峰系四倍體葡萄無子性狀連鎖之DNA分子標誌，對四倍體無子葡萄之育種及相關之研究將有莫大之助益。 98 年度主要工作包括： 1. 巨峰葡萄無子化技術開發。 2. 無子葡萄品種及巨峰葡萄無子變異株之果粒催大。 3. 尋找與巨峰無子變異株無子化性狀連鎖之DNA分子標誌。 4. 培育三倍體無子葡萄新品種。另外，本計畫將利用環刻技術來改善國產巨峰葡萄之品質。目前巨峰葡萄果農所用之根砧種類對果實生產有顯著之影響，對果實著色亦有不同之效果。常見之 1202 根砧所產生之果實大，產量高，然成熟期在台灣之夏季高溫下果實著色極差。前期研究結果顯示環刻可以提昇一年二收巨峰葡萄夏果之著色與糖度。此效應在 1202 根砧上應更加顯著。如此將可利用 1202 砧生產果實大且著色良好之巨峰葡萄。以此簡單之技術克服葡萄著色不良，可大幅提高葡萄果實之商品價值及果農之收入。本計畫主要工作： 1. 分析巨峰葡萄目前主要之商業化砧穗組合之生長發育及果實品質。 2. 測試於著果期及轉色期環刻對於各不同砧穗組合之果實著色與品質之影響，探討環刻於我國溫暖之亞熱帶氣候及一年二收模式下之潛力， 3. 尋求在此一栽培體系下之最佳環刻時期及對環刻反應最佳之砧穗組合...|$|R
