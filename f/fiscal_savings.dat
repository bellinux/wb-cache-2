In the absence of reforms, public debt will increase to unsustainable levels. This paper uses the IMF''s Global Fiscal Model to compare the macroeconomic effects of different fiscal strategies to accommodate the rise in age-related spending. The simulations suggest that adopting a package of measures, including an increase in the retirement age, broadening the tax base, and raising indirect taxes, would be a more growth-friendly strategy than relying exclusively on raising the social security contribution rate.

30|$|There are {{two major}} {{approaches}} for reforming the energy subsidy-pricing framework – immediate and gradual energy subsidy reforms. Immediate reform typically involves moving prices for all fuels and electricity to their respective international reference prices. Prices for traded goods such as oil, natural gas and oil products are brought into line with international prices, or above the marginal cost but below international prices [50]. Prices for non-tradable goods and essential services, such as electricity and water, equate the price {{with the cost of}} production. In this process, the immediate reform can maximize <b>fiscal</b> <b>saving,</b> freeing up funds for mitigation measures or improving competitiveness in other ways.

40|$|Limited {{fiscal space}} limits Djibouti’s {{ability to meet}} the Millennium Development Goals and improve the living {{conditions}} of its population. Djibouti’s fiscal structure is unique in that almost 70 percent of government revenue is denominated in foreign currency (import taxes, foreign aid grants and military revenue) while over 50 percent of government expenditure is denominated in local currency (wages, salaries and social transfers). Djibouti’s economic structure is also unusual in that merchandise exports of local origin are insignificant, and the country relies heavily on imported goods (food, medicines, consumer and capital goods). A currency devaluation, by reducing real wages, could potentially generate additional fiscal space that would help meet Djibouti’s fundamental development goals.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{macroeconomic}} effects of three public pension reforms, namely {{an increase in}} retirement age, a reduction in benefits {{and an increase in}} contribution rates. Using a five-region version of the IMF‘s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model (GIMF), we find that public pension reforms can {{have a positive effect on}} growth in both the short run, propelled by rising consumption, and in the long run, due to lower government debt crowding in higher investment. We also find that a reform action undertaken cooperatively by all regions results in larger output effects, reflecting stronger capital accumulation due to higher world savings. An increase in the retirement age reform yields the strongest impact in the short run, due to the demand effects of higher labor income and in the long run because of supply effects.

A key policy concern regarding subsidy reform is the adverse welfare impact on households, in particular poor households.

Fuel subsidies are found to be badly targeted, with the richest ten percent of households receiving seven times more in benefits than the poorest ten percent. Although subsidy reform would generate substantial <b>fiscal</b> <b>savings,</b> the associated increases in fuel and other prices would lower household real incomes of all income groups.
