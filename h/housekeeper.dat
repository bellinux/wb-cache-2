50|$|<b>Housekeepers</b> are an {{important}} part of up keeping nursing homes. <b>Housekeepers</b> play a huge part in ensuring that nursing homes are kept clean and free of disease causing agents. <b>Housekeepers</b> have a long list of duties which include cleaning floors, changing linens, disinfecting bathrooms, changing towels, washing clothes, emptying garbage cans, sanitizing rooms, replenishing supplies, dusting and polishing furniture, vacuuming, and keeping windows and woodwork clean. These duties can be different from facility to facility but will overall include basic cleaning. Housekeeping does not require any licensure or schooling, but some housekeeping jobs may prefer prior job experience.|$|R

5|$|Nazi {{official}} Hans Frank {{suggested that}} Alois's {{mother had been}} employed as a <b>housekeeper</b> by a Jewish family in Graz, and that the family's 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered Alois.

60|$|The <b>housekeeper's</b> {{thin lips}} {{maintained}} their motherly smile; the <b>housekeeper's</b> amiable manner lost {{none of its}} modest deference, but the expression of her eyes suddenly changed from a look of attention to a look of inquiry. Magdalen quietly said a few words more, and then waited again for results. The change spread gradually all over Mrs. Lecount's face, the motherly smile died away, and the amiable manner betrayed a slight touch of restraint. Still no signs of positive recognition appeared; the <b>housekeeper's</b> expression remained {{what it had been}} from the first--an expression of inquiry, and nothing more.|$|R

40|$|Background: It is {{believed}} that occupation influences cardiovascular risk factors. To assess blood pressure (BP) and other cardiovascular risk factors in three occupation groups—teachers, military personnel and female <b>housekeepers</b> residing in Shiraz, southern Iran. Methods: We studied 2783 teachers, 366 military personnel, and 1896 female <b>housekeepers</b> who attended various medical education centers in Shiraz. BP, anthropometric parameters as well as fasted lipid profile and blood glucose level were measured determined for each participant. Results: The mean values of all analyzed cardiovascular risk factors were higher among female <b>housekeepers</b> compared to female teachers. The mean systolic and diastolic BP was significantly (P< 0. 001, and P= 0. 047, respectively) higher in female <b>housekeepers</b> than female teachers. Neither systolic nor diastolic BP had association {{with the type of}} occupation in men (military personnel vs. male teachers). Conclusion: Housekeeping compared to teaching, may increase both systolic and diastolic BP in women...|$|R

50|$|On August 31, 2009, 98 <b>housekeepers</b> {{at three}} Boston-area Hyatt hotels (the Hyatt Regency Boston, the Hyatt Regency Cambridge, and the Hyatt Harborside at Logan International Airport) were fired and {{replaced}} by workers from a Georgia-based temporary agency. The fired <b>housekeepers,</b> {{some of whom had}} worked for the Hyatt for more than 20 years, were given no advance notice of the layoffs. They claim that they were asked to train the workers that replaced them under the pretense that these workers could fill in for them when they were sick or on vacation. The <b>housekeepers</b> originally earned around $14-16 per hour, while the replacement workers are paid $8 per hour.|$|R
5|$|According to the Council of Trent, every Catholic {{church is}} {{required}} to have a residing pastor. Before {{the building of the}} rectory began in 1944, the three priests and their <b>housekeeper</b> had lived in the Leslie Mansion (the mansion on the property). The mansion was over a hundred years old, was a frame building, had very few rooms, provided poor living conditions, and had a water pump at the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|Braun was {{a member}} of Hoffman's staff when she {{attended}} the Nuremberg Rally {{for the first time in}} 1935. Hitler's half-sister, Angela Raubal (the dead Geli's mother), took exception to her presence there, and was later dismissed from her position as <b>housekeeper</b> at his house in Berchtesgaden. Researchers are unable to ascertain if her dislike for Braun was the only reason for her departure, but other members of Hitler's entourage saw Braun as untouchable from then on.|$|E
5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez. Before leaving England, he {{returned}} to the farmhouse, gaining entry by the downstairs bathroom window. He said he did this because he had left his keys in London and needed some papers from the house for the trip to France; he entered through the window rather than borrow keys from the farm's <b>housekeeper</b> who lived nearby. When he returned to England on 29 September, he was re-arrested and charged with the murders.|$|E
