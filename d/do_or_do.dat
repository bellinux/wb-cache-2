25|$|Regardless of {{the medical}} considerations, Jehovah Witnesses {{advocate}} that physicians should uphold {{the right of a}} patient to choose what treatments they <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> not accept (though a Witness is subject to religious sanctions if they exercise their right to choose a blood transfusion). Accordingly, US courts tend not to hold physicians responsible for adverse health effects that a patient incurred out {{of his or her own}} requests. However, the point of view that physicians must, in all circumstances, abide by the religious wishes of the patients is not acknowledged by all jurisdictions, such as was determined in a case involving Jehovah's Witnesses in France.|$|E
25|$|Evans & Treisman (2005) {{proposed}} a hypothesis that humans rapidly detect disjunctive sets of unbound features of target categories {{in a parallel}} manner, and then use these features to discriminate between scenes that <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> not contain the target without necessarily fully identifying it. An {{example of such a}} feature would be outstretched wings {{that can be used to}} tell whether or not a bird is in a picture, even before the system has identified an object as a bird. Evans & Treisman propose that natural scene perception involves a first pass through the visual processing hierarchy up to the nodes in a visual identification network, and then optional revisiting of earlier levels for more detailed analysis. During the 'first pass' stage, the system forms a global representation of the natural scene that includes the layout of global boundaries and potential objects. During the 'revisiting' stage, focused attention is employed to select local objects of interest in a serial manner, and then bind their features to their representations.|$|E

2500|$|Religious {{discrimination}} is valuing or treating {{a person or}} group differently {{because of what they}} <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> not believe or because of their feelings towards a given religion.

The word is sometimes translated as 'cattle' rather than 'flock' or 'subjects' in order to emphasize the Christian population's inferior status to that of the Muslim rayah.|$|E

The “unity” which matters is a linkage between that articulated discourse and the social forces with which it can, under certain historical conditions, but need not necessarily, be connected. Thus, a theory of articulation is both a way of understanding how ideological elements come, under certain conditions, to cohere together within a discourse, and a way of asking how they <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> not become articulated, at specific conjunctures, to certain political subjects.

2500|$|Three {{studies have}} found a {{statistically}} significant inverse relationship between consumption of raw milk and asthma and allergies. However, all of these studies have been performed in children living on farms and living a farming lifestyle, rather than comparing urban children living typical urban lifestyles and with typical urban exposures who <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> not consume raw milk, so {{it is likely that}} other aspects of the overall urban vs. farming environment lifestyle play a role in these effects; for this reason, the overall phenomenon is termed the [...] "farm effect." [...] In the largest of these studies, exposure to cows and straw as well as raw milk were associated with lower rates of asthma, and exposure to animal feed storage rooms and manure with lower rates of atopic dermatitis. A recent scientific review concluded that “most studies alluding to a possible protective effect of raw milk consumption do not contain any objective confirmation on the raw milk status or a direct comparison with heat-treated milk. Moreover, it seems that the observed increased resistance seems to be rather related to the exposure to a farm environment or to animals than to raw milk consumption.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Academic {{analyses}} of the character typically focus on the character's ethnicity, her social class (middle), and her status {{as a role model}} to young viewers. Martha has been described in newspaper reports as the [...] "first ethnic-minority companion in the 43-year television history of Doctor Who" [...] or the Doctor's [...] "first black assistant" [...] (Agyeman herself was born to Ghanaian and Iranian parents.) Martha's status as [...] "first black companion" [...] is [...] "thrown into dispute" [...] by consideration of Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and his companion role in the 2006 series. In her introduction, Martha is represented as being 'normal' in ways previous Doctor Who companions were not. For example, she becomes the first character to use (light) swear words when she exclaims [...] "We're on the bloody moon!" [...] Davies felt that this level of swearing was both normal and appropriate, citing a Harry Potter film in which the young audience reacted with laughter rather than shock when a young character cursed [...] "Bloody hell". In some instances, Martha's status as a middle-class woman distinguish her from earlier black companion Mickey Smith, who is male and, like Rose Tyler, working-class. Articles which focus on Martha's race normally attempt to make distinctions between Martha's social status and that of Mickey, and to what extent race or class <b>do</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> not play a part.|$|E
