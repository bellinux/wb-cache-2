5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm {{that live in}} caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function in that environment, but they show some red because of the haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> orange coloured riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar colour for the same reason.|$|E
25|$|Both {{types of}} {{chloroplast}} contain {{large amounts of}} chloroplast peripheral reticulum, which they use to get more surface area to transport stuff {{in and out of}} them. Mesophyll chloroplasts <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more peripheral reticulum than bundle sheath chloroplasts.|$|E

25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

500|$|... "It's {{called the}} Tour of the Mongoose, and the {{mongoose}} is basically {{one of the}} few animals who can defeat the most venomous snakes with just one bite. And that's why I decided to name my tour that way, because I think that if we all <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> mongoose inside that can defeat the hatred and the resentment and the prejudice of everyday, we can probably win the battle." ...|$|E

'We should've took that snare out,'" [...] Mars said. [...] "It's just a sickness that we have." ...|$|E
500|$|Bell stated {{she never}} thought of herself as womanly because [...] "I always play and look and act 10 years younger than I am," [...] however, she said, [...] "Something magical {{happened}} when I turned 25—I {{looked in the mirror}} and was like, You might not get carded for an R-rated movie anymore.

[...] Bell has said that many of her characters are tomboys because she was [...] "not homely enough to play the nerdy girl and not nearly pretty enough to play the pretty girl".|$|E

In 1992, American guitarist Bill Frisell covered {{the song in}} his fourth album, <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> Faith. In 1998, Blonde Ambition released a dance single of the song featuring 6 different hi-NRG remix versions. Italian singer Lucrezia made an uptempo dance version of the song that was remixed by David Morales. It peaked at number two for two weeks on Billboards [...] Hot Dance Club Play, and {{was included in the}} 2001 album Logic Pride, Vol. 4. Canadian jazz singer Carol Welsman, covered it on her eponymous 2007 album.|$|E

500|$|Tenacious D are {{supporters}} of cannabis legalization. They have also performed at a NORML benefit concert. Black described his view that allowing drug use would remove {{the stigma of}} feeling [...] "naughty" [...] attached to users, making the activity mundane and less attractive. Black was the executive producer for a documentary about Randy Credico entitled Sixty Spins Around the Sun. It calls for the so-called Rockefeller drug laws to be repealed. Black said of it, [...] "They're populating our prisons with people, you know, first time drug offenders—single mothers that <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of coke end up going to prison for 20years or something. It's just cruel and unusual punishment." ...|$|E
500|$|The year 1984 found Como {{traveling}} the US with his 50th Anniversary tour. Having {{spent most of}} his professional life in radio or recording studios and on television soundstages, he was enjoying doing live performances. Even after his 80th birthday, Perry continued the concert tours. Gone, however, were the cardigan sweaters which had been a staple of his weekly television shows, and which he had actually hated having to wear. Como now performed in a tuxedo, saying, [...] "It shows respect for the audience." [...] The return to live appearances also provided Como with an opportunity to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fun with his [...] "Mister Nice Guy" [...] image in a song Ray Charles and Nick Perito his closest collaborator since 1963, wrote and composed for him: ...|$|E
500|$|John Hurt plays Harold [...] "Ox" [...] Oxley, Mutt's {{surrogate}} {{father and}} Indiana's old friend. Frank Darabont had suggested Hurt while writing the screenplay. The character {{is inspired by}} Ben Gunn of Treasure Island. Hurt read the script before agreeing to his role, unlike other cast members who came on [...] "because Steven— you know, 'God'— was doing it. And I said, 'Well, I need to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of previous knowledge even if God is doing it.' So they sent a courier over with the script from Los Angeles, {{gave it to me}} at three o'clock in the afternoon in London, collected it again at eight o'clock in the evening, and he returned the next day to Los Angeles." ...|$|E

500|$|The song's lyrics, which discuss escapism, are {{constructed}} {{in a way}} resemblant of nursery rhymes. During the chorus, Ellis-Bextor sings [...] "It's just my imagination / Running away / Girl's gotta <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> daydream / It's a secret escape / It's just my imagination / Running away / Don't worry baby, I'm here to stay". Considine highlighted [...] "I could tie up the bed sheets and slide down the house / Be gone before the morning comes" [...] as lyrics exemplificative of Ellis-Bextor's [...] "artistic freedom" [...] in Wanderlust. Reviewing the song for Loud and Quiet, Stuart Stubbs wrote that it [...] "sees our protagonist pull herself out of squalor and onto a road of self discovery." [...] The song concludes with a short outro where Ellis-Bextor repeats the line [...] "Don't worry baby, I'm here to stay" [...] twice.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that three fossil species may be nemerteans, but none is confirmed. Traditional taxonomy divides the phylum in two classes, Anopla ("unarmed" [...] – their proboscises do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dagger) with two orders, and Enopla ("armed" [...] with a dagger) with two orders. However, it is now accepted that Anopla are paraphyletic (have given rise to another group), as one order is more closely related to Enopla than to the other order of Anopla. The phylum Nemertea is monophyletic. Its synapomorphies include the rhynchocoel and eversible proboscis. Traditional taxonomy says that nemerteans are closely related to flatworms and that both are relatively [...] "primitive" [...] acoelomates. Now both phyla are regarded as members of the Lophotrochozoa, a very large [...] "super-phylum" [...] that also includes molluscs, annelids, brachiopods, bryozoa and many other protostomes.|$|E
500|$|There are 44 {{letters to}} White's friend Thomas Pennant (1726–1798), {{of which the}} first nine were never posted and are thus undated. Of those that were posted, the first, Letter 10 giving an {{overview}} of Selborne, is dated 4 August 1767; the last, Letter 44 on wood pigeons, is dated 30 November 1780. It is not known how the men became friends, or even if they ever met; White writes repeatedly {{that he would like}} to meet [...] "to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> conversation face to face after we have corresponded so freely for several years" [...] so it is certain they did not meet for long periods, and possible they never met at all. The letters are edited from the form in which they were actually posted; for example, Letter 10 as posted had a cringing introductory paragraph of thanks to Pennant which White edited out of the published version.|$|E
