50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Corps</b> (EMC) is an {{incident}} response {{team that was}} launched on 15 February 2016 by the European Union to provide an emergency response force to deal with outbreaks of epidemic disease anywhere in the world. The EMC was formed after the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa when the WHO was criticized for a slow and insufficient response {{in the early stages}} of the Ebola outbreak.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an article}} in JAMA on 9 May 2016, the Georgetown University Law Center called for the WHO to form an {{emergency}} committee {{to determine whether a}} public health emergency of international concern should be declared. On 12 May, the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection of the European Union announced plans to send a team of the <b>European</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Corps</b> to Angola on a two-week mission to help control the outbreak and assess the risk of further spread outside Angola. The medical corps was formed after the Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in 2013, and the mission to Angola was its first deployment. The team included [...] "emergency medical teams, public health and medical coordination experts, mobile biosafety laboratories, medical evacuation planes and logistical support teams".|$|E
40|$|The 2013 – 2016 Ebola {{epidemic}} in West Africa challenged traditional international mechanisms {{for public health}} team mobilisation to control outbreaks. Consequently, in February 2016, the European Union (EU) launched the <b>European</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Corps</b> (EMC), a mechanism developed {{in collaboration with the}} World Health Organization (WHO) to rapidly deploy teams and equipment in response to public health emergencies inside and outside the EU. Public Health Teams (PHTs), a component of the EMC, consist of experts in communicable disease prevention and control from participating countries and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), to support affected countries and WHO in risk assessment and outbreak response. The European Commission’s Directorate-General European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations and Directorate-General Health and Food Safety, and ECDC, plan and support deployments. The first EMC-PHT deployment took place in May 2016, with a team sent to Angola for a yellow fever outbreak. The aims were to evaluate transmission risks to local populations and EU citizens in Angola, the risk of regional spread and importation into the EU, and to advise Angolan and EU authorities on control measures. International actors should gain awareness of the EMC, its response capacities and the means for requesting assistance...|$|E

5000|$|When the Nazis came to {{national}} power in 1933, the SS was reorganized and {{an office of}} the SS Surgeon General was established.

Because SS <b>Medical</b> <b>Corps</b> members could now serve in any branch of the SS, this expansion allowed medical professionals to join every SS office and participate in a variety of duties.|$|R
