40|$|This thesis was an {{exploration}} into the implementation process <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> cities. Western debates on implementation {{are usually not}} applicable <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> cities and the question asked was why. The main reason has been found is that the characteristics of governments and people <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> cities are different and therefore different approaches are required to make implementation successful. Of particular interest is waste management. Different approaches are employed {{in the management of}} waste <b>in</b> some <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> cities and the results have been mediocre with no real impact on the urban environment. To this end, this thesis set out to understand implementation within these cities. In the course of this research, some very interesting factors were discovered about policy implementation <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> cites. It is hoped that this thesis has been able to add to the body of knowledge in understanding implementation <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> cities...|$|R

5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> are not using a modern birth control method.

By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E

5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. <b>In</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the most}} recent (July 2015) {{revision}} of the official United Nations World Population Prospects, the world population is projected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up from the current 7.3 billion (July 2015), to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, and to reach 11.2 billion by the year 2100. Most of the increase will be <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and this would have declined to 1.15 billion but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. Long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten billion people, and then a slow decrease to 8.4 billion by 2100.|$|E
