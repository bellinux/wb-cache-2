50|$|While Chief Designer Sergei Korolev had {{originally}} envisioned a manned lunar spacecraft launched in pieces by R-7 boosters and assembled in Earth orbit, {{the advent of}} Vladimir Chelomei's large UR-500 booster theoretically {{made it possible to}} do the job in a single launch. However, Chelomei also proposed his own, competing lunar spacecraft, the LK-1, and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev gave his approval in August 1964. Two months later, Khrushchev was expelled from power and Chelomei lost his principal patron. At the end of the year, Korolev revived his proposal for the Soyuz spacecraft, but concealed his true intentions by billing it as merely an Earth orbital vehicle for testing rendezvous and docking maneuvers. In October 1965, a mere three months before his death, Korolev was granted official approval for developing a manned lunar spacecraft, which would be a modified Soyuz. This would be launched towards the Moon on a UR-500 topped with the Blok <b>D</b> <b>stage</b> under development by the OKB-1 Bureau.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} green house {{gas emissions}} from compost preparations, methane {{and carbon dioxide}} concentrations and emission rates at different accumulative times and composting periods were determined. While the accumulative time was less than 10 min with a closed acrylic chamber, meth ane and carbon dioxide emissions in creased slightly but with high fluntuation in the sampling e ror, and these values decreased significantly when the accumulative time was more than 20 min. During the 8 weeks of composting, the methane emission rate reaches its peak {{near the end of}} the second week and the carbon dioxide emission rate does the same near the end of third week. Meth ane and carbon dioxide emissions had high val ues at the first stage of com post ing and then de creased grad u ally for the ma tu rity of com post. Carbon dioxide emission (y) was significantly related to temperature (x 1), moisture content (x 2), and total or ganiccarbon (x 3); and there gression equation is: y = 3. 11907 x 1 + 6. 19236 x 2 - 6. 63081 x 3 - 50. 62498.

We present a classification method for SNe based on the comparison of their observed colors with synthetic ones, calculated from a large database of multi-epoch optical spectra of nearby events.

50|$|An {{investigation}} into the failure concluded that it was most likely caused by design modifications to the GATV versus a standard Agena <b>D</b> <b>stage.</b> The Agena D was designed to have its engine restarted just once while the GATV {{would need to be}} restarted five times. While a standard Agena D pumped oxidizer into the combustion chamber first and then followed with the fuel, the GATV was modified to do the reverse because the normal start method had a tendency to leak oxidizer. While this would not be a problem for the Agena D with its single restart, the multi-restart GATV would eventually lose all of its oxidizer before the stage's operating life (which would last weeks instead of hours) could be completed. Unfortunately, pumping the fuel into the combustion chamber first caused the engine to backfire and rupture from mechanical shock. It was found out that Lockheed engineers did not properly test the GATV to root out this problem (it had been tested at a simulated altitude of 21 miles up when actual Agena engine start would occur at around 75 miles up). The solution to the problem was switching back to the normal oxidizer-first engine start and also testing the GATV in appropriate conditions. Bell Aerosystems, the manufacturer of the Agena's engine, were also instructed to perform further ground-level tests.|$|E

It {{is currently}} accepted that, in the atherogenic process, platelets {{play an important}} role, contributing to endothelial activation and modulation of the inflammatory phenomenon, promoting the beginning and formation of lesions and their subsequent thrombotic complications. The objective of the present work was to study using immunohistochemistry, the presence of platelets, monocytes/macrophages, and cell adhesion molecules (CD 61, CD 163, and CD 54), in two stages of the atheromatous process. CF- 1 mice fed a fat diet were used to obtain early stages of atheromatous process, denominated early stage of atherosclerosis, and ApoE−/− mice fed a fat diet were used to observe advanced stages of atherosclerosis. The CF- 1 mice model presented immunostaining on endothelial surface for all three markers studied; the advanced atherosclerosis model in ApoE−/− mice also presented granular immunostaining on lesion thickness, for the same markers.
