The Search for Spock {{was one of the}} first major feature films to use Eastman 5294, a color high speed negative film stock. The film allowed Correll latitude in choosing a broad range of exposure indexes. Since The Search for Spock was shot with anamorphic lenses and many theatergoers would see widescreen 70mm prints, Correll needed to produce a crisp depth of field, a difficult task on many sets. For scenes on the bridge, Correll pushed the <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> above the Eastman recommendation to keep the image crisp at less than 50foot-candles.|$|E

Job interview data consisting of a chronological timetable of job histories were translated into detailed <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> by an expert group of hygienists and chemists. Total and individual asbestos fibre type concentrations were quantified by transmission electron microscopy with fibre identification by energy dispersive chi ray spectrometry after deparaffinisation of tissue blocks and low temperature plasma ashing. Geometric mean or median asbestos content was higher in subjects with an asbestos exposed job history than those without for retained dose of amosite, total commercial amphiboles, and total asbestos fibre. Except for crocidolite fibre diameter, which was significantly less in the lungs of exposed workers, no consistent {{differences were found in}} measurements of fibre dimension for any fibre type. Subgroups of subjects exposed to silica, metals, or smokers and non-smokers without significant occupational exposure showed varying patterns of lung asbestos fibre type deficit compared with the asbestos exposed subgroup. There was an overall trend for higher lung asbestos content proportional to higher <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> for asbestos representing concentration, frequency, and reliability. These <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> as well as duration of exposure (in years) were independent predictors of total asbestos content in regression analyses when combined in a model with age.

Materials and MethodsThe International Standards Organization (ISO) transmission electron microscopy (TEM) method for asbestos was modified to increase the statistical precision of fiber size determinations, improve efficiency, and reduce analysis costs. Comparisons of the fiber size distributions and <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> by laboratory and counting method were performed. ResultsNo significant differences in size distributions by the ISO and modified ISO methods were observed. Small but statistically-significant inter-lab differences in the proportion of fibers in some size bins were found, but these differences had little impact on the summary <b>exposure</b> <b>indices.</b> The modified ISO method produced slightly more precise estimates of the long fiber fraction (> 15).

We estimated individual exposures by developing <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> based on activity, exposure duration, and distance of residence from the plant. Most people left home after the gas leak by walking and running. About 60 % used some form of protection (wet cloth on face, splashing water). Mean and median values of the <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> showed a declining trend with increasing distance from the plant. For those subjects reporting any versus no exposure, prevalence ratios were elevated for most respiratory and nonrespiratory symptoms. We examined exposure-response relationships using <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> to determine which were associated with health outcomes. The <b>index</b> total <b>exposure</b> weighted for distance was associated with most respiratory symptoms, one measure of pulmonary function in the cross-sectional sample [mid-expiratory flow (FEF) (25 - 75), p = 0. 02], and two measures of pulmonary function in the hospitalized subset [forced expiratory volume (FEV) (1), p = 0. 02; FEF(25 - 75), p = 0. 08). Indices that correlated with FEV(1) and forced vital capacity in the hospitalized subset did not correlate with the cross-sectional sample, and most <b>indices</b> (except total <b>exposure)</b> that correlated with the hospitalized subset did not correlate with the cross-sectional sample. Incorporation of distance into every index increased the number of symptoms associated; an improvement was also noted in the strength of the association for respiratory symptoms, but not for pulmonary function. The sum of duration (p = 0. 02) and total exposure (p = 0. 03) indices independently demonstrated stronger associations with percent predicted FEF(25 - 75) than the distance variable (p = 0. 04).
