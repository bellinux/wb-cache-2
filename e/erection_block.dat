40|$|The cGMP-binding cGMP-specific {{phosphodiesterase}} (PDE 5) degrades cGMP and {{regulates the}} intracellular level of cGMP in many tissues, including the smooth muscle of the corpus cav-ernosum of the penis. Sildenafil (Viagra), a specific PDE 5 inhib-itor, promotes penile <b>erection</b> by <b>blocking</b> {{the activity of}} PDE 5, which causes cGMP to accumulate in the corpus cavernosum. In the present study, sildenafil, like other PDE 5 inhibitors, stim-ulates cGMP binding to the allosteric sites of PDE 5 by inter-acting at the catalytic site of this enzyme, but the drug does not compete with cGMP for binding at the allosteric sites. Both sildenafil and zaprinast are competitive inhibitors of PDE 5, and double-inhibition analysis shows that these two inhibitors added together interact with the catalytic site of PDE 5 in a mutually exclusive manner.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{suggests}} an event-based scenario manager capable of creating and editing a scenario for shipbuilding process simulation based on multibody dynamics. To configure various situation in shipyards and easily connect with multibody dynamics, the proposed method has two main concepts: an Actor and an Action List. The Actor represents the anatomic unit {{of action in}} the multibody dynamics and can be connected to a specific component of the dynamics kernel such as the body and joint. The user can make a scenario up by combining the actors. The Action List contains information for arranging and executing the actors. Since the shipbuilding process {{is a kind of}} event-based sequence, all simulation models were configured using Discrete EVent System Specification (DEVS) formalism. The proposed method was applied to simulations of various operations in shipyards such as lifting and <b>erection</b> of a <b>block</b> and heavy load lifting operation using multiple cranes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a part of}} new developments included inside a holistic optimisation strategy during the design cycle of ships. The {{first part of the}} paper describes an algorithm to maximize the number of ship blocks and ship sections to produce in workshops during a certain time window.

Thanks to this software, the scheduling is now done more efficiently and above all it takes less time. The second part of the paper describes a recent development of an algorithm able to generate a feasible <b>blocks</b> <b>erection</b> sequence starting from the blocks splitting definition. The idea is to integrate this module as a new functionality inside simulation software in order to take into account blocks sequence during the elaboration of the optimised production strategy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) {{has been}} implicated as a {{mediator}} of penile erection, because the neuronal isoform of NO synthase (NOS) is localized to the penile innervation and NOS inhibitors selectively <b>block</b> <b>erections.</b> NO can also be formed by two other NOS isoforms derived from distinct genes, inducible NOS (iNOS) and endothelial NOS (eNOS). To clarify the source of NO in penile function, we have examined mice with targeted deletion of the nNOS gene (nNOS- mice). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mating behavior, electrophysiologically induced penile erection, isolated erectile tissue isometric tension, and eNOS localization by immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed on nNOS- mice and wild-type controls. RESULTS: Both intact animal penile erections and isolated erectile tissue function are maintained in nNOS mice, in agreement with demonstrated normal sexual behaviors, but is stereospecifically blocked by the NOS inhibitor, L-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME). eNOS is abundantly present in endothelium of penile vasculature and sinusoidal endothelium within the corpora cavemosa, with levels that are significantly higher in nNOS- mice than in wild-type controls. CONCLUSIONS: eNOS mediates NO-dependent penile erection in nNOS- animals and normal penile erection. These data clarify the role of nitric oxide in penile erection and may have implications for therapeutic agents with selective effects on NOS isoforms...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} shown that {{adolescent}} smoking is associated with health risk behaviors, including high-risk sexual activity and illicit drug use. Using rat as an animal model, we evaluated the behavioral and biochemical effects of a 4 -day, low-dose nicotine pretreatment (60 [*]μg/kg; intravenous) during adolescence and adulthood. Nicotine pretreatment significantly increased initial acquisition of cocaine self-administration, quinpirole-induced locomotor activity, and penile erection in adolescent rats, aged postnatal day (P) 32. These effects were long lasting, remaining evident 10 days after the last nicotine treatment, and were observed when nicotine pretreatment was administered during early adolescence (P 28 – 31), but not late adolescence (P 38 – 41) or adulthood (P 86 – 89). Neurochemical analyses of c-fos mRNA expression, and of monoamine transmitter and transporter levels, showed that forebrain limbic systems are continuing to develop during early adolescence, and that this maturation is critically altered by brief nicotine exposure. Nicotine selectively increased c-fos mRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens shell and basolateral amygdala in adolescent, but not adult animals, and altered serotonin markers in these regions as well as the prefrontal cortex. Nicotine enhancement of cocaine self-administration and quinpirole-induced locomotor activity was blocked by co-administration of WAY 100 [*] 635 (N-{ 2 -[4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl] ethyl}-N-(2 -pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide), a selective serotonin 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) receptor antagonist. Early adolescent pretreatment with the mixed autoreceptor/heteroceptor 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, 8 -OH-DPAT, but not the autoreceptor-selective agonist, S- 15535, also enhanced quinpirole-induced locomotor activation. Nicotine enhancement of quinpirole-induced penile <b>erection</b> was not <b>blocked</b> by WAY 100 [*] 635 nor mimicked by 8 -OH-DPAT. These findings indicate that early adolescent nicotine exposure uniquely alters limbic function by both 5 -HT 1 A and non- 5 -HT 1 A receptor mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|M. Ed. The year 1976 rung a bell of {{education}} pandemonium in the Republic of South African schools {{to the entire}} world. Every South African citizen was puzzled as to what remedy could be administered in South Africa to re-normalize this situation. The Education System was collapsing and worsening day by day. Schools were burnt down, physical facilities either stolen, broken or never supplied. The 1994 first elections that included all South African citizens was hailed as a step towards the right track to restoring school effectiveness. A spark of hope was lit that physical facilities would be provided to schools {{and the culture of}} learning and teaching would be restored and learners pass rate improved. The poor grade 12 results, however attested to the deeply embedded problems of schools ineffectiveness caused by the huge backlogs at schools in respect of toilets, text books and stationery, furniture, administration blocks and security fences which was inherited from the apartheid regime. Every caring citizen wondered whether: Sufficient toilets provision could render schools effective; Provision of the necessary textbooks and stationery could promote school effectiveness; Furniture supply to schools could improve school effectiveness; <b>Erection</b> of administration <b>blocks</b> could contribute positively towards school effectiveness;and Provision of security fence could make schools effective. These wonderings were prompted by both educators and learners who, whenever on strikes, demanded and cited scarcity of these facilities as contributing to the burdens of schools ineffectiveness. This anormally led to this research conducted to investigate what in actual fact constitutes school effectiveness. Literature survey has unearthed the underpinning problems of shortage of physical facilities. The Mpumalanga Department of Education gives much attention to salaries for personnel which tendency culminates into the continued backlog in provisioning of physical resources to schools, thus rendering them ineffective. Budgetary constraints is the single major contributory factor to this plight. Empirical findings have exhumed educator's perceptions regarding these physical facilities. The empirical findings have clustered all five facilities under three factors namely : accountable collaborative management, which enjoyed preference over other factors, namely: open democratic management and normative management. Both the Mpumalanga Provincial Department of Education in collaboration with the Non-Governmental Organization could {{play a vital role in}} rescuing this situation. In fact, stakeholders with vested interest in education could be the answer to this problem.

40|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} faces {{two main}} challenges: more quality at lower {{prices and the}} need for the productivity improvement. In ship building industry, companies need to respond to market requirements efficiently, keeping their products competitive while reducing the cost. When considering complicated ship production processes up to final hull <b>block</b> <b>erection,</b> the productivity of each work station for hull assembly mainly depends on the dimensional quality of hull blocks. Poor dimensional accuracy leads to reworks such as re cutting, mechanical or thermal correction against misalignment, excessive welding for wide gap and thermal straightening and this will subsequently increases the total production cost. One of the major dimensional accuracy control activities is the shrinkage margin design, which means that the optimal excess of plate is calculated and assigned into ship production drawings in order to compensate for the accumulated welding shrinkage through block assembly phases. In Sri Lankan context the most common practise to compensate for shrinkage has been to add excess material, usually 50 - 100 mm on one or two sides of a block that would be trimmed at the erection stage. Normally, this added material would be adequate to compensate for any weld shrinkage incurred during block assembly. It is however, a commitment to rework. This has been adopted {{due to the lack of}} accurate and reliable weld shrinkage and distortion allowance data. Even though there are some research findings on shrinkage factors it can’t be directly apply for the Sri Lankan industry as shrinkage factors may vary from shipyard to shipyard due to facilities, welding equipment, joint design, welding sequence, ambient temperature, and type of material. This research project provides a comprehensive weld shrinkage factor identification that enables neat construction capabilities for the shipbuilding industry in Sri Lanka. A key component of the research is a predictive weld shrinkage factor based on current ship designs, materials, and construction practices. Through this study, the shrinkage factors will be identified by a statistical analysis of data. It will be done from the development of check sheets, establishing of checking procedures, data gathering, and finally the statistical analysis of data. Since variety of variables can affect the determination of a shrinkage factor, it has to be decided the most crucial factors for particular production process and consider only those factors as the variables. Even though there are three major processes (panel fabrication, block construction, block assembly) in ship building the data was analysed only for data collected from panel fabrication and sample testing. Finally two equations were derived for sample testing and panel fabrication separately by providing dedicated factor for each and every considered variable. The obtained results were validated again by means of another sample testing and the deviation is less than 0. 2 mm. The other processes were not considered due to complexity of the structures and data collection difficulty with in limited time frame. The block construction and assembly processes can be considered for the next step of this research and it can be done with the involvement of modelling software. From the modelling software the differences in each of complex blocks can be identified easily and measured values can be analysed against those differences. Then a comprehensive welding shrinkage compensation factor can be identified and it can be entered to the modelling software at the time of modelling the vessel...|$|R
