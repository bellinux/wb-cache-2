40|$|A new quality {{assurance}} system was developed and implemented operationally for the National Climatic Data Center’s Cooperative Summary of the Day (SOD) {{quality assurance}} process. The system uses rules-based GIS technology to fully automate spatial quality assurance of observed daily temperature values. Gridded fields are derived from quality controlled ASOS (Automated Surface Observation System) and AWOS (Automated Weather Observing System) hourly and daily temperature values as “ground truth ” to quality assure the Cooperative Observers Network (COOP) daily temperature data. This automated temperature validation (TempVal) system replaces the interactive <b>Graphical</b> <b>Edit</b> Analysis (GEA) temperature validation system. Parallel tests {{of the old and}} new systems were made using regression analysis. Manual comparisons between the systems using outliers exceeding a pre-described threshold were performed. The results of the tests will be shown. Higher confidence in TempVal is attributed to a change in methodology (using grid fields) and access to higher quality data for use as “ground truth”. The GEA methodology derives and uses three climatological best neighbors to quality assure a flagged data value. Additionally, TempVal is able to estimate daily replacement temperatures for any number of missing days whereas the GEA system can only generate temperature values under certain conditions...|$|R

40|$|The Aviation Scenario Definition Language (ASDL) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a domain-specific language providing a well-structured definition language to specify departure, enroute, re-route, and landing scenarios. Exploiting the capabilities of Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), ASDL provides a holistic conceptual metamodel construct to define all entities, attributes, and relationships needed to specify a complete flight scenario. Representing scenario models graphically, increases effectiveness of communication by providing fast, easy, and accurate method of transferring information among interested parties. It {{is well known that}} graphical diagrams are more effective than text in the communication between end-users and or domain experts. As such, models are majorly delivered graphically and supported by <b>graphical</b> design and <b>editing</b> tools. In order to provide an easy-to-use drag and drop framework to construct flight scenario models, here we present a <b>graphical</b> modeling and <b>editing</b> interface to ASDL. The proposed graphical scenario specification tool is developed using EMF Forms within EMF which provides a rapid mechanism to develop tools for modelling languages. The effort presented here will provide a <b>graphical</b> modeling and <b>editing</b> tool to specify ASDL flight scenarios while automatically validating user input and providing consistency and completeness checking. Backed by model-driven approach, the graphical modeling interface will hide all the ASDL language development details, making the tool suitable for non-developers such as pilots and air traffic controllers. This paper will include details on building the graphical framework with Eclipse Modeling Framework. We provide the detailed components of the generated GUI, highlighting the tool’s capabilities and user’s interactions. As a case-study, we also provide an example flight scenario model built using the presented tool...|$|R
