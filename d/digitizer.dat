25|$|A {{person who}} creates a design {{is known as}} an {{embroidery}} <b>digitizer</b> or puncher. A <b>digitizer</b> uses software to create an object-based embroidery design, which can be easily reshaped and edited. These files retain important information such as object outlines, thread colors, and original artwork used to punch the designs. When the file is converted to a stitch file, it loses much of this information, rendering editing difficult or impossible.|$|E
25|$|In August 2013, MakerBot {{released}} the <b>Digitizer,</b> a 3D scanner. The product {{was designed to}} allow MakerBot users to scan physical objects {{and turn them into}} digital, 3D printable models. The accompanying software allowed models to be edited, printed immediately, or uploaded to Thingiverse.|$|E
25|$|Digitized {{embroidery}} design files can {{be either}} purchased or created with industry-specific embroidery digitizing software. Embroidery file formats broadly fall into two categories. The first, source formats, are specific to the software used to create the design. For these formats, the <b>digitizer</b> keeps the original file {{for the purposes of}} editing. The second, machine formats, are specific to a particular brand of embroidery machine. In this case, the files are available for use with particular embroidery machines and are not easily edited or scaled.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} systems capable of model {{deformation}} measurements was conducted. The survey included stereo-cameras, scanners, and <b>digitizers.</b> Moire, holographic, and heterodyne interferometry techniques were also looked at. Stereo-cameras with passive or active targets {{are currently being}} deployed for model deformation measurements at NASA Ames and LaRC, Boeing, and ONERA. Scanners and <b>digitizers</b> are widely used in robotics, motion analysis, medicine, etc., {{and some of the}} scanner and <b>digitizers</b> can meet the model deformation requirements. Commercial stereo-cameras, scanners, and <b>digitizers</b> are being improved in accuracy, reliability, and ease of operation. A number of new systems are coming onto the market...|$|R
40|$|The {{phase and}} ratio errors of {{transducers}} for distribution electrical grids can be measured, {{in a wide}} frequency range, by a synchronized couple of <b>digitizers</b> Agilent 3458 A working in DCV mode. The high metrological performances of the <b>digitizers</b> is degraded by the input low pass filter cut-off frequency, which depends on the selected range. This paper proposes a technique to identify and model, for each range, the filter complex function up to several tens of kilohertz. First tests show its potentiality in reducing the errors introduced by the <b>digitizers,</b> when set on different ranges, in frequency calibration of voltage/current transducer...|$|R

25|$|Following {{a series}} of arcade game successes in the early 1980s, Nintendo made plans to create a cartridge-based console called the Famicom, which is short for Family Computer. Masayuki Uemura {{designed}} the system. Original plans called for an advanced 16-bit system which would function as a full-fledged computer with a keyboard and floppy disk drive, but Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi rejected this and instead {{decided to go for}} a cheaper, more conventional cartridge-based game console as he felt that features such as keyboards and disks were intimidating to non-technophiles. A test model was constructed in October 1982 to verify the functionality of the hardware, after which work began on programming tools. Because 65xx CPUs had not been manufactured or sold in Japan up to that time, no cross-development software was available and it had to be produced from scratch. Early Famicom games were written on a system that ran on an NEC PC-8001 computer and LEDs on a grid were used with a <b>digitizer</b> to design graphics as no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time.|$|E

2500|$|Rundgren {{has long}} been {{on the cutting edge}} of music and video technologies. His music video for the song [...] "Time Heals" [...] was among the first videos aired on MTV, and a video he {{produced}} for RCA, accompanied by Gustav Holst's The Planets, was used as a demo for their videodisc players. His experience with computer graphics dates back to 1981, when he developed one of the first computer paint programs, dubbed the Utopia Graphics System; it ran on an Apple II with Apple's <b>digitizer</b> tablet. He is also the co-developer of the computer screensaver system Flowfazer.|$|E

2500|$|The {{economic}} {{conditions of the}} Reagan years, coupled with tax incentives for home businesses, helped propel Melco {{to the top of}} the market. [...] At the Show of the Americas in 1980, Melco unveiled the Digitrac, a digitizing system for embroidery machines. The digitized design was composed at six times the size of the embroidered final product. The Digitrac consisted of a small computer, similar in size to a BlackBerry, mounted on an X and Y axis on a large white board. It sold for $30,000. The original single-needle sample head sold for $10,000 and included a 1" [...] paper-tape reader and 2 fonts. [...] The <b>digitizer</b> marked common points in the design to create elaborate fill and satin stitch combinations.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{marked the}} debuts of Amy Rose and Metal Sonic, both {{designed}} by artist Kazuyuki Hoshino. Although the final in-game Amy graphics {{were created by}} Hoshino, many staff members contributed ideas to her design. Her head band and trainer shoes reflected Oshshima's tastes while her mannerisms reflected the traits Hoshino looked for in women at the time. Metal Sonic was designed in response to Ohshima wanting a strong rival to Sonic. Hoshino had a clear image of the character in his mind {{from the moment he}} was briefed, and Metal Sonic's design emerged after only a few sketches. The character graphics were created using Sega's own proprietary graphics system for the Genesis called the [...] "Sega <b>Digitizer</b> MK-III". The suite featured a bitmap and animation editor. The prevalent computers they used at the time were Macintosh IIci. Graphics data was stored on 3.5-inch floppy disks which were handed off to the programmer to work into the game.|$|E
50|$|Along {{the bottom}} of the <b>digitizer</b> was a {{template}} with commands which could be selected as required, so the keyboard was often not required. Assembly was aided for many users by the familiar look of the large <b>digitizer,</b> which looked much like the drawing boards common at the time. To aid the process of aclimatistion, the <b>digitizer</b> was used with an electronic pen, which made placing components both quick and accurate.|$|E
40|$|Modular {{oscilloscopes}} and <b>digitizers,</b> {{including those}} with embedded EPICS IOCs, provide powerful off-the-shelf solutions for accelerator controls and beamline data acquisition applications requiring fast sampling, high resolution and/or tight multi-channel synchronization. This presentation discusses features and capabilities of EPICS and non-EPICS LXI, VXI, PXI/cPCI and PCI oscilloscopes and <b>digitizers</b> as they specifically relate to accelerator and beamline applications. Modular oscilloscopes and <b>digitizers</b> with on-board DSP and FPGAs provide the advanced waveform acquisition and analysis capabilities of benchtop instruments with the size and channel-density advantages of modular instruments. Instruments with on-board processing, such as those from ZTEC Instruments, enable real-time waveform math and waveform parameter analysis. Advanced triggering and multiple acquisition modes are other features found on some of today’s advanced modular instruments. Furthermore, instruments with embedded EPICS IOCs save users {{the time and money}} of developing their own EPICS drivers and display panels...|$|R
