50|$|Several {{researchers}} have questioned however {{to what extent}} additional hours worked really increase the marginal productivity of labour; particularly in services, the work that gets done in five days could often also be done in four.

5000|$|Calculate all intensities for all {{possible}} combinations of intervals. This means {{that for every}} start time and end time combination the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> is calculated. For this the times of all jobs whose arrival time and deadline lie inside the interval are added and divided by the interval length. To speed up the process, only combinations of arrival times and later deadlines need to be considered, as times without arrival of a process or deadline can be shrunk to a smaller interval with the same processes, thus increasing intensity, and negative intervals are invalid. Then the maximum intensity interval is selected. In case of multiple equally intense intervals, one can be chosen at will, as intensities of non-overlapping intervals do not influence each other, and removing a part of an interval will not change {{the intensity of the}} rest, as processes are removed proportionally.|$|E
50|$|The state {{serves as}} a {{safeguard}} for the ownership and as the coordinator of production through a universal economic plan. For the purpose of reducing waste and increasing efficiency, scientific planning replaces market mechanisms and price mechanisms as the guiding principle of the economy. The Marxist-Leninist state's huge purchasing power replaces the role of market forces, with macroeconomic equilibrium not being achieved through market forces but by economic planning based on scientific assessment. In the socialist economy, {{the value of a}} good or service is based on its use value, rather than its cost of production or its exchange value. The profit motive as a driving force for production is replaced by social obligation to fulfil the economic plan. Wages are set and differentiated according to skill and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> While socially utilised means of production are under public control, personal belongings or property of a personal nature that doesn't involve mass production of goods remains relatively unaffected by the state.|$|E
50|$|Radioactive uranite, black uranium {{and some}} other {{radioactive}} minerals were mined here without any protective aids and with minimum food rations. The exploitation of uranium was very intensive but because of its secrecy, its extent and importance was considerably exaggerated for public consumption {{over the course of}} time. In addition to the extensive gallery work, a total of 23 primary shafts were sunk within a relatively small area and within {{a very short period of}} time. The entire process of uranium mining and usage was strictly secret and detailed information on the mining was not published until 1989. A total of 2668 tons of uranium were mined in the Slavkov uranium mining area, which incidentally was the smallest mined uranium area in Bohemia. Its significance for the political situation at the time primarily consisted in the speed of acquisition of the metal as a result of the definite knowledge of the geological situation in the area (analogous to the Jáchymov deposit). The assignment of labour, the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and the size of the investment, however, did not at all match the size of the deposit and the state of its reserves.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade a great many authors have shown that {{computers}} have a large impact on skill demand, production processes, and the organization and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Analyses have indicated that the rates of change of these variables have been {{the largest in the}} more computer- intensive sectors. Empirical findings, however, suggest that the effects of computers on the labor market are complicated and difficult to trace. This paper offers a simple model to explain how computers have changed the labor market. The model demonstrates that wage differentials between computer users and other workers are consistent with the observation that computers are first introduced in high-wage jobs because of cost efficiency. It also shows that neither computer skills nor complementary skills are needed to explain skill upgrading, changes in product characteristics, and the organization and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Finally, it is shown that these findings shed a different light on the way computers have changed the labor market and on the changes to be expected following the further diffusion of computers. ...|$|E
