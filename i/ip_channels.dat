40|$|NASA {{is moving}} toward a networkcentric {{communications}} architecture and, in particular, is building toward use of Internet Protocol (IP) in space. The use of IP is motivated by its ubiquitous application in many communications networks and in available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology. The Constellation Program intends to fit two or more voice (over <b>IP)</b> <b>channels</b> on both the forward link to, and the return link from, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) during all mission phases. Efficient bandwidth utilization of the links is key for voice applications. In Voice over IP (VoIP), the IP packets are limited to small sizes to keep voice latency at a minimum. The common voice codec used in VoIP is G. 729. This new algorithm produces voice audio at 8 kbps and in packets of 10 -milliseconds duration. Constellation has designed the VoIP communications stack to use the combination of IP/UDP/RTP protocols where IP carries a 20 -byte header, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) carries an 8 -byte header, and RTP (Real Time Transport Protocol) carries a 12 -byte header. The protocol headers total 40 bytes and are equal in length to a 40 -byte G. 729 payload, doubling the VoIP latency. Since much of the IP/UDP/RTP header information does not change from IP packet to IP packet, IP/UDP/RTP header compression can avoid transmission of much redundant data as well as reduce VoIP latency. The benefits of IP header compression are more pronounced at low data rate links such as the forward and return links during CEV launch. IP/UDP/RTP header compression codecs are well supported by many COTS routers. A common interface to the COTS routers is through frame relay. However, enabling IP header compression over frame relay, according to industry standard (Frame Relay IP Header Compression Agreement FRF. 20), requires a duplex link and negotiations between the compressor router and the decompressor router. In Constellation, each forward to and return link from the CEV in space is treated independently as a simplex link. Without negotiation, the COTS routers are prevented from entering into the IP header compression mode, and no IP header compression would be performed. An algorithm is proposed to enable IP header compression in COTS routers on a simplex link with no negotiation or with a one-way messaging. In doing so, COTS routers can enter IP header compression mode without the need to handshake through a bidirectional link as required by FRF. 20. This technique would spoof the routers locally and thereby allow the routers to enter into IP header compression mode without having the negotiations between routers actually occur. The spoofing function is conducted by a frame relay adapter (also COTS) with the capability to generate control messages according to the FRF. 20 descriptions. Therefore, negotiation is actually performed between the FRF. 20 adapter and the connecting COTS router locally and never occurs over the space link. Through understanding of the handshaking protocol described by FRF. 20, the necessary FRF. 20 negotiations messages can be generated to control the connecting router, not only to turn on IP header compression but also to adjust the compression parameters. The FRF. 20 negotiation (or control) message is composed in the FRF. 20 adapter by interpreting the incoming router request message. Many of the fields are simply transcribed from request to response while the control field indicating response and type are modified...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCalcium-mediated {{signalling}} is {{ubiquitous in}} both animals and plants. Changes in cytoplasmic free Ca 2 + concentration couple diverse arrays of stimuli to their specific responses, {{the specificity of}} the stimulus being determined by integrated actions between multiple Ca 2 + mobilization pathways. In this work, a pharmacological approach is reported, aimed at deciphering the role of calcium as a second messenger in the transduction pathway leading to the inhibitory effect of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D), in regulating monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) biosynthesis in Catharanthus roseus cells. It is demonstrated here that auxin-dependent MIA biosynthesis is differentially regulated by two distinct calcium release components from internal stores in C. roseus showing pharmacological profiles similar to those displayed by animal RyR and <b>IP</b> 3 <b>channels.</b> MIA biosynthesis is stimulated by caffeine (Ca 2 +-release activator through RyR channels) and by heparin and TMB 8 (Ca 2 +-release inhibitors of <b>IP</b> 3 <b>channels)</b> whereas MIA biosynthesis is inhibited by mastoparan (Ca 2 +-release activator of <b>IP</b> 3 <b>channels)</b> and by ruthenium red and DHBP (Ca 2 +-release inhibitors of RyR channels). Furthermore, calcium, as 2, 4 -D, acts on MIA biosynthesis by regulating the monoterpene moiety of the MIA biosynthesis pathway since calcium channel modulators preferentially modulate g 10 h expression, the gene encoding the enzyme of the secoiridoid monoterpene pathway, that is the major target of 2, 4 -D action. In addition, the simultaneous use of caffeine (an activator of RyR channel in animals) and TMB 8 (an inhibitor of the <b>IP</b> 3 <b>channel)</b> in 2, 4 -D treated cells triggers a synergistic effect on MIA accumulation. This finding suggests an opposite and co-ordinated action of multiple Ca 2 +-release pathways in 2, 4 -D signal transduction, adding {{a new level of}} complexity to calcium signalling in plants and questioning the existence of RyR and <b>IP</b> 3 <b>channels</b> in plants...|$|R

40|$|A {{covert channel}} can occur when an {{attacker}} finds and exploits a shared resource {{that is not}} {{designed to be a}} communication mechanism.

40|$|The {{research}} effort {{presented in}} this paper focuses on two main issues encountered in designing real time FoIP gateways using ITU-T T. 38 protocol recommendations. The first issue deals with reducing the complexity of FoIP gateways whereas the second issue aims to provide the required Quality of Service (QoS). The former is accomplished by minimizing the T. 30 state machine required to be implemented in the gateways with an alternative architecture. This architecture maps a full duplex <b>IP</b> <b>channel</b> over a half duplex facsimile session in a T. 38 gateway. Thus, two simplex channels operate concurrently, transferring facsimile control and image data in either direction. The latter of the two issues discussed here is traditionally resolved in FoIP gateways via spoofing. Here, the required QoS is achieved mainly through minimizing the packetization and de-packetization latencies within the gateways to the minimum by transmitting Internet Facsimile Protocol (IFP) packets that contain partial T. 30 High Level Data Link Control(HDLC) frames. Additionally, implementation of some unique spoofing techniques is also discussed that utilize special HDLC frames. This unique spoofing technique is required to keep the facsimile session alive when the packet switched network introduces excessive latencies.
