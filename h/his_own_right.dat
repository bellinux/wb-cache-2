Spain had become fascinated by splicing technology when he came upon a Titlist cue split down the middle in 1965 {{and set out to}} perfect and even improve on the Titlist splice. Spain's original intent was to be predominantly a cuemaker in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>right</b> using his proprietary spliced blanks. However, by 1966 Spain's superior blanks were in high demand and he instead turned to making blanks for other cuemakers full-time, which he continued until 1970.|$|E

60|$|Longstreet was {{an entirely}} {{different}} man.

He was never on the lookout to detect a slight, but saw one as soon as anybody when intentionally given.|$|R
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>right.</b> George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention.

Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept it if it came to him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E
5|$|Levi Lincoln Sr. (May 15, 1749 – April 14, 1820) was an American revolutionary, lawyer, and statesman from Massachusetts. A Democratic-Republican, he {{most notably}} served as Thomas Jefferson's first Attorney General, {{and played a}} {{significant}} role in the events that led to the celebrated Marbury v.

Lincoln was unsuccessful in his bid to be elected governor in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>right</b> in 1809.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln ran for {{election}} as governor in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>right</b> in 1809, {{but he was}} perceived by moderate Federalists as overly partisan and lacked the charisma of Sullivan. His support for Jefferson's economic policy, particularly that of embargoing trade with Great Britain and France (who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars) was costly. Federalists, who had regained control of the Massachusetts legislature in 1808, attacked his statements in support of Jefferson, and he lost the election to Christopher Gore, amid a complete Federalist takeover of the Massachusetts government (the outgoing Jefferson administration's repeal of the embargo before the election notwithstanding).|$|E

5|$|Rosas {{acquired}} a {{working knowledge of}} administering ranchlands and, beginning in 1811, took charge of his family's estancias. In 1813, he married Encarnación Ezcurra, daughter of a wealthy family from Buenos Aires. He soon afterwards sought to establish a career for himself, leaving his parent's estate. He produced salted meat and acquired landholdings in the process. As the years passed he became an estanciero (rancher) in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>right,</b> accumulating land while establishing a successful partnership with second cousins from the politically powerful Anchorena clan. His hard work and organisational skills in deploying labour were key to his success, rather than creating new or applying nontraditional approaches to production.|$|E

Two years of exposure with the Brown–Roach ensemble meant that Powell was beginning to achieve some recognition in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
60|$|Upon {{approaching}} Milnwood, Henry's knock {{upon the}} gate no longer intimated the conscious timidity of a stripling {{who has been}} out of bounds, but the confidence of a man in full possession of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>rights,</b> and master of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> actions,--bold, free, and decided. The door was cautiously opened by his old acquaintance, Mrs Alison Wilson, who started back when she saw the steel cap and nodding plume of the martial visitor.|$|R
