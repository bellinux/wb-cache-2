5|$|Teeth {{belonging}} to the dusky shark are fairly well represented in the fossil record, though assigning Carcharhinus teeth to species can be problematic.

Teeth <b>dating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Late Miocene or Early Pliocene (11.6-3.6 Ma) are abundant in the Yorktown Formation and the Pungo River, North Carolina, and from the Chesapeake Bay region; these teeth differ slightly from the modern dusky shark, and have often been misidentified as {{belonging to}} the oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus). Dusky shark teeth have also been recovered from the vicinity of two baleen whales in North Carolina, one preserved in Goose Creek Limestone <b>dating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Late Pliocene (c. 3.5 Ma), {{and the other in}} mud <b>dating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pleistocene-Holocene (c. 12,000 years ago).|$|E

5|$|A Neo-Assyrian chamber tomb {{was found}} {{at the foot of}} the citadel mound during {{construction}} activities in 2009. It was subsequently excavated by the local Antiquities Service and archaeologists from the German Archaeological Institute (DAI). The tomb was plundered in antiquity but still contained pottery <b>dating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 8th and 7th centuries BC. The cooperation between the Antiquities Service and the DAI was continued later that year with a further investigation of the tomb and with a small excavation nearby and geophysical survey of the surrounding area, in which also students from Salahaddin University participated. These investigations revealed the presence of architecture probably <b>dating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Neo-Assyrian period, as well as more burials belonging to subsequent centuries.|$|E
5|$|An inscribed block <b>dating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> later Ramesside period (1292–1077 BC) {{and now in}} the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, was {{uncovered}} by Lepsius {{in a house in}} Abusir and shows Menkauhor enthroned beside four other deified kings of the Old Kingdom: the name of the first, partially lost, but probably Sneferu is then followed by Djedefre, Menkaure, Menkauhor and finally Neferkare. The owner of the tomb stands before the kings, in worship. Another relief <b>dating</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same period shows a similar scene. It was inscribed on the lintel of the tomb chapel of Mahy buried in Saqqara North. Four deified kings of the Old Kingdom are shown, all of whom built their pyramids at Saqqara: Djoser, Teti, Userkaf and Menkauhor.|$|E

40|$|Growing-degree {{units were}} {{calculated}} for the North Central Region by using the so-called National Weather Service Method.

50|$|The {{archaeological site}} {{near the village}} of Breitenbach in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany is an {{important}} open-air settlement that <b>dates</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> period of initial colonization of Europe by anatomically modern humans. <b>The</b> occupations <b>date</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> early Upper Palaeolithic and more specifically belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Aurignacian cultural complex.
