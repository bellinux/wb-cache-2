Records {{at the age of}} 17, and released his debut album <b>For</b> <b>You</b> <b>in</b> 1978. His 1979 album Prince went platinum, and his next three records—Dirty Mind (1980), Controversy (1981), and 1999 (1982)—continued his success, showcasing Prince's prominently sexual lyrics and blending of funk, dance, and rock music. In 1984, he began referring to his backup band as The Revolution and released Purple Rain, the soundtrack album to his eponymous 1984 film debut. It quickly became his most critically and commercially successful release, spending 24 consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200 and selling over 20 million copies worldwide. After releasing the albums Around the World in a Day (1985) and Parade (1986), The Revolution disbanded, and Prince released the double album Sign o' the Times (1987) as a solo artist. He released three more solo albums before debuting The New Power Generation band in 1991.|$|E

[...] The performance of the camera was also criticized, with IGN noting [...] "Considering that the camera will sometimes choose some horrible angles <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> battle or during puzzles, it's annoying to have to fight {{it as well as}} mutants that want you dead." [...] GameZone said [...] "I just wish the camera wouldn’t be such a hindrance sometimes."

He would also write, [...] "I wrote Di kishefmakhern (The Witch) in Romania, where the populace – Jews as much as Romanians – believe strongly in witches."
