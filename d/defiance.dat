5|$|SR163 {{begins as}} Pearl Street at a partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with the SR16 freeway in Tacoma north of Tacoma Community College. Pearl Street travels north, serving Woodrow Wilson High School and Truman Middle School, before leaving Tacoma and entering Ruston and serving Point <b>Defiance</b> Elementary School. The highway re-enters Tacoma at Point <b>Defiance</b> Park and passes the Science and Math Institute before traveling onto the Point Defiance–Tahlequah Ferry.|$|E
5|$|The September 1964 {{issue of}} Ebony dramatized MalcolmX's <b>defiance</b> of these threats by {{publishing}} {{a photograph of}} him holding an M1 carbine while peering out a window.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} reduced to reserve again after their return on 16 October 1882. She became an {{accommodation}} ship for the overflow from the barracks at Devonport in 1897. Inconstant {{was taken out of}} service in 1904 and became a gunnery training ship in June 1906, assigned to the boy's training establishment Impregnable. She was renamed Impregnable III in 1907, then <b>Defiance</b> IV in January 1922 after she was transferred to the torpedo training school at Plymouth, <b>Defiance,</b> and then <b>Defiance</b> II in December 1930. The ship was sold for scrap in September 1955 and arrived at the breaker's yard in Belgium on 4 April 1956 for demolition, when she was the second-to-last Welsh-built naval vessel afloat.|$|E
5|$|According to Catholic teaching, this commandment {{does not}} {{preclude}} the use of God's name in taking solemn oaths administered by legitimate authority. However, lying under oath, invoking God's name for magical purposes, or voicing words of hatred or <b>defiance</b> against God are considered sins of blasphemy.|$|E
5|$|Baxter {{was free}} of the sectarianism that marked the rivalry between Glasgow's two leading teams. His close friends {{included}} the Celtic players Billy McNeill, Pat Crerand and Mike Jackson, in <b>defiance</b> of the unwritten rule that rivals did not associate.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's {{personal}} {{religious convictions}} {{have been much}} debated by scholars. She was a Protestant, but kept Catholic symbols (such as the crucifix), and downplayed the role of sermons in <b>defiance</b> of a key Protestant belief.|$|E
5|$|He {{has helped}} create a senior center in his hometown, <b>Defiance,</b> and helped add a heart center at <b>Defiance</b> Medical Center. During a race weekend at Texas Motor Speedway, Hornish (an avid bowler) {{promoted}} a charity bowling event. His work with Speedway Children’s Charities has raised over $500,000 to benefit North Texas children. Hornish collects and customizes classic automobiles; he owns a 1930 Model A Ford, a 1951 Mercury, a 1955 Chevrolet Del Ray, a 1965 Cadillac Coupe de Ville, a 1967 Chevrolet pickup truck and a Corvette ZO6 Indianapolis 500 pace car. Hornish has also worked as a substitute school teacher while away from the track, and has also taught Vacation Bible School.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, the Russian {{government}} {{issued an}} edict to confiscate {{the properties of}} the Armenian Church, including the treasures of Etchmiadzin. Russian policemen and soldiers entered and occupied the cathedral. Due to popular resistance and the personal <b>defiance</b> of Catholicos Mkrtich Khrimian, the edict was canceled in 1905.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 Kim started Kim Ki-young Productions, {{and began}} making melodramas, {{the most popular}} film genre in South Korea at the time. His first {{independent}} production was Touch-Me-Not (1956). In 1957, Kim was living near the red-light district of Yongsan, and the atmosphere of this neighborhood influenced his films, A Woman's War and Twilight Train (both 1957). With First Snow (1958), Kim moved from melodrama to a more socially conscious realism. <b>Defiance</b> of a Teenager (1959) and Sad Pastorale (1960) followed in this style. <b>Defiance</b> of a Teenager was one of Kim's most successful and respected early works, and he attended the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1960 for a showing of this film.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, it was {{announced}} drummer Jason Bittner would join Arizona thrash metal band Flotsam and Jetsam, and guitarist Matt Bachand would join Act of <b>Defiance,</b> along with the former members of Megadeth.|$|E
5|$|In October 2001, Jennings was {{inducted}} into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In one final act of <b>defiance,</b> he did not attend the ceremony and opted instead to send son Buddy Dean Jennings.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Zajc's 1876 opera Nikola Šubić Zrinski is {{his most}} famous and popular work in Croatia. This recounts the heroic <b>defiance</b> of the Croats towards the Turks, {{as a metaphor for}} their later {{nationalist}} impulses within the Habsburg monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Khrimian {{collaborated with}} the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF or Dashnaktsutyun) to {{organize}} mass demonstrations against the edict. According to the historian Rouben Paul Adalian, {{it was a combination}} of Dashnaktsutyun's popular resistance and Khrimian's personal <b>defiance</b> that resulted in the edict being canceled in 1905.|$|E
5|$|SR163 was re-designated in 1991 along Pearl Street from SR16 in Tacoma to the Point <b>Defiance</b> ferry terminal. The route was {{extended}} onto the Point Defiance–Tahlequah Ferry serving Vashon Island in 1994. No major revisions have occurred since 1994 to the highway's route.|$|E
5|$|Screen Gems backed Roddenberry's {{first attempt}} at {{creating}} a pilot. His series, The Wild Blue, went to pilot, but was not picked up. The three main characters had names that later appeared in the Star Trek franchise: Philip Pike, Edward Jellicoe, and James T. Irvine. While working at Screen Gems, an actress, new to Hollywood, wrote to him asking for a meeting. They quickly became friends and met every few months; the woman was Majel Leigh Hudec, later known as Majel Barrett. He created a second pilot called 333 Montgomery about a lawyer, played by DeForest Kelley. It was not {{picked up by the}} network, but was later rewritten as a new series called <b>Defiance</b> County. His career with Screen Gems ended in late 1961, and shortly afterward, he had issues with his old friend Erle Stanley Gardner. The Perry Mason creator claimed that <b>Defiance</b> County had infringed his character Doug Selby. The two writers fell out via correspondence and stopped contacting one another, though <b>Defiance</b> County never proceeded past the pilot stage.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, several hardships {{struck the}} band in 2014. In May, bassist David Ellefson lost a brother to cancer, {{following}} which, the band cancelled {{a number of}} scheduled shows. On October 4, Mustaine's Alzheimer's-afflicted mother-in-law went missing from a campground. Her remains were discovered on November 26. Furthermore, drummer Shawn Drover and guitarist Chris Broderick announced their resignations from the band that November. The pair would later emerge in a new band, Act of <b>Defiance.</b>|$|E
5|$|Colonel Henry Dodge was at Gratiot's Grove {{when the}} war descended upon Spafford Farm, having just sent his volunteers to their forts to {{resupply}} and recuperate. Shortly after he arrived back at his home fort, he received word of the Aubrey murder at Fort Blue Mounds and the incident at Spafford Farm. Dodge ordered militia detachments from Fort <b>Defiance,</b> Fort Jackson, and Fort Hamilton {{to the scene of}} the massacre.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Marie becomes {{smitten with}} her target. In <b>defiance</b> of Corentin and the Chouans whom she detests, she devises {{a plan to}} marry the Chouan leader. Fooled by Corentin into believing that Montauran loves her mortal enemy Madame du Gua, Marie orders Hulot to destroy the rebels. She discovers her folly too late and tries, unsuccessfully, to save her husband the day after their marriage.|$|E
5|$|Fort <b>Defiance</b> {{was also}} being {{constructed}} at this time, located farther southwest, past Fort Box, near present-day Red Hook. In {{addition to these}} new forts, a mounted battery was established on Governors Island, cannons were placed at Fort George facing Bowling Green, and more cannons placed at the Whitehall Dock, which sat on the East River. Hulks were sunk at strategic locations to deter the British from entering the East River and other waterways.|$|E
5|$|Hazareesingh (2004) explores how Napoleon's {{image and}} memory are best understood. They {{played a key}} role in {{collective}} political <b>defiance</b> of the Bourbon restoration monarchy in 1815–1830. People from different walks of life and areas of France, particularly Napoleonic veterans, drew on the Napoleonic legacy and its connections with the ideals of the 1789 revolution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} oil {{study for the}} {{defeated}} warrior (York Art Gallery), Etty gave the character a more defiant appearance than seen in the finished version. In this preliminary sketch he is not on his knees, but thrusts his leg out to brace himself. He has an expression of <b>defiance</b> and determination, rather than the plea for mercy and posture of total defeat shown in the final work.|$|E
5|$|Kikuyu girls {{cut each}} other's vulvas in the 1950s {{as a symbol}} of <b>defiance,</b> {{in the context of the}} {{campaign}} against female genital mutilation in colonial Kenya. The movement came to be known as Ngaitana ("I will circumcise myself"), because to avoid naming their friends the girls said they had cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas described the episode as significant in the history of FGM because it made clear that its victims were also its perpetrators.|$|E
5|$|Other leading film roles include Sword of Honour (2001); The Mother (2003) with Anne Reid; Sylvia (2003) with Gwyneth Paltrow; Layer Cake (2004) with Sienna Miller; Enduring Love (2004) with Rhys Ifans; Steven Spielberg's Munich (2005) with Eric Bana; Infamous and Casino Royale (2006); The Golden Compass (2007); Quantum of Solace and <b>Defiance</b> (2008); Cowboys & Aliens (2011); The Girl {{with the}} Dragon Tattoo (2011); Dream House (2011); Skyfall (2012); and Spectre (2015).|$|E
5|$|She and Rue become {{allies and}} friends, but Rue is later fatally wounded by another tribute, whom Katniss kills with an arrow. Katniss sings to Rue until she dies and spreads flowers {{over the body}} to show her <b>defiance</b> against the Capitol. In an {{unprecedented}} move, Rue's district sends Katniss a gift of bread.|$|E
5|$|Surrounded, he {{told his}} men to die as martyrs, and opened fire. His <b>defiance</b> and manner of his death (which stunned the {{traditional}} leadership) electrified the Palestinian people. Thousands forced their way past police lines at the funeral in Haifa, and the secular Arab nationalist parties invoked his memory as the symbol of resistance. It was the largest political gathering ever to assemble in mandatory Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The Tilhas Tizig Gesheften, a {{small group}} formed from the British Army's Jewish Brigade, {{obtained}} a supply of counterfeit pounds from Jaacov Levy, one of Schwend's money-laundering agents. The forged notes were used to buy equipment and to bring displaced persons to Palestine, in <b>defiance</b> of the British blockade of the territory.|$|E
5|$|The Victory Tests {{started in}} May 1945 between the Australian Services and England {{in celebration of}} the allied victory in Europe. In {{previous}} seasons, the English cricket administrator and former captain Pelham Warner had organised matches between the RAAF and various English military teams {{as an expression of}} <b>defiance</b> against Nazi air raids, and the Victory Tests were a continuation of this, although the matches were only three days long and did not have Test status.|$|E
5|$|Within minutes Calypso {{had also}} veered its cable so that Italienne, now beached, could resume {{fire on the}} British squadron, but the frigate overcompensated and drifted stern-first onto the shore. The British ships {{continued}} their fire until the rapidly falling tide forced them to retire one by one, with <b>Defiance</b> being the last to retire at 12:15. The squadron then returned for one more pass, the final shots fired by Donegal, before Stopford ordered them to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Word of {{the attack}} at Spafford's farm spread quickly to Fort <b>Defiance,</b> about five miles {{southeast}} of Mineral Point. A small volunteer force of 13 men was assembled at Fort <b>Defiance</b> and they set off to hunt down the band of Native Americans responsible for the massacre. The group reached Fort Hamilton at around midnight on June 15. On the morning of June 15, survivor Bennett Million guided the militia volunteers back {{to the site of}} the massacre. One of the volunteers was Alexander Higgenbotham, a survivor of the St. Vrain massacre. The bodies of the dead were badly mutilated and Spafford's corpse was headless. His head was found scalped and tossed into the grass along the river bank. The volunteers buried the mangled bodies of the fallen and searched in vain for Spencer, whom they also assumed dead.|$|E
5|$|After two of Flagg's {{followers}} fail to {{kill the}} leaders of the Free Zone, the Boulder community sends a group of men to Las Vegas to stop him. The three who reach the city are taken prisoner, and Flagg orders one of them executed for his <b>defiance.</b> As the other two are being prepared for a public execution, one of Flagg's most loyal followers, the Trashcan Man, arrives with a nuclear warhead salvaged from a military base. As Trash dies of radiation poisoning the Hand of God appears, detonating the warhead and annihilating Flagg, his followers, and the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Although the Junta of Seville was defeated, {{a new one}} {{was created}} afterwards, the Regency Council. The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it, but the Royal Audiencia did so in <b>defiance</b> of the local authority. The Junta summoned them, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled them to Spain with the pretext {{that there was a}} threat to their lives. The Junta {{appointed}} new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno wrote in the Gazeta that the Audiencia attacked the good faith of the government, and that the Junta left their usual moderation {{for the safety of the}} people.|$|E
5|$|Between 1594 and 1603, Elizabeth {{faced her}} most severe test in Ireland during the Nine Years' War, a revolt {{that took place}} at the height of {{hostilities}} with Spain, who backed the rebel leader, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. In spring 1599, Elizabeth sent Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to put the revolt down. To her frustration, he made little progress and returned to England in <b>defiance</b> of her orders. He was replaced by Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, who took three years to defeat the rebels. O'Neill finally surrendered in 1603, a few days after Elizabeth's death. Soon afterwards, a peace treaty was signed between England and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Both {{halves of}} the road trace their origins to {{the early days of}} Aspen's {{settlement}} in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom. Prospectors who had missed out on the earlier mining boom that built Leadville began to head west, drawn by reports of vast untapped silver deposits in the Roaring Fork Valley just beyond the Continental Divide. They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, in <b>defiance</b> of an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin not to do so until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.|$|E
5|$|But the Parthian Empire, {{weakened}} by internal strife and wars with Rome, {{was soon to}} be followed by the Sassanid Empire. Indeed, shortly afterward, Ardashir I, the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern Fars Province, Iran) from Estakhr began subjugating the surrounding territories in <b>defiance</b> of Arsacid rule. He confronted Artabanus V at the Battle of Hormozdgān on 28 April 224AD, perhaps at a site near Isfahan, defeating him and establishing the Sassanid Empire. There is evidence, however, that suggests Vologases VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228AD.|$|E
5|$|By 1761, the Maratha menace had diminished and by 1763, Haider Ali had {{captured}} the Keladi kingdom, defeated {{the rulers of}} Bilgi, Bednur and Gutti, invaded the Malabar {{in the south and}} conquered the Zamorin's capital Calicut with ease in 1766 and extended the Mysore kingdom up to Dharwad and Bellary in the north. Mysore was now a major political power in the subcontinent and Haider's meteoric rise from relative obscurity and his <b>defiance</b> formed one of the last remaining challenges to complete British hegemony over the Indian subcontinent – a challenge which would take them more than three decades to overcome.|$|E
5|$|Celtic secured their {{progress}} to the knock-out {{stages of the}} Champions League on 5 December 2012 with a 21 home win over Spartak Moscow, Kris Commons scoring the winning goal in 82 minutes with a penalty. Celtic were drawn against Juventus but succumbed to 50 aggregate defeat in the Spring of 2013 {{to go out of}} the tournament. Despite the emphatic scoreline over the two legs, Celtic were not outclassed by their Italian opponents in terms of general play but while Juventus defended with a ruthless <b>defiance,</b> Celtic in contrast shipped their goals all far too easily. Despite the result against Juventus, Celtic and Neil Lennon won praise for their Champions League campaign.|$|E
