5|$|Metal borides {{are used}} for coating tools through {{chemical}} vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition. <b>Implantation</b> of boron ions into metals and alloys, through ion <b>implantation</b> or ion beam deposition, results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness.

5|$|With the {{exception}} of the walrus, which has five- to six-year-long inter-birth intervals, female pinnipeds enter estrous shortly after they give birth. All species go through delayed <b>implantation,</b> wherein the embryo remains in suspended development for weeks or months before it is implanted in the uterus. Delayed <b>implantation</b> postpones the birth of young until the female hauls-out on land or until conditions for birthing are favorable. Gestation in seals (including delayed <b>implantation)</b> typically lasts a year. For most species, birthing takes place {{in the spring and summer}} months. Typically, single pups are born; twins are uncommon and have high mortality rates. Pups of most species are born precocial. Unlike terrestrial mammals, pinniped milk has little to no lactose.|$|E

5|$|River otters {{typically}} breed from December to April. Copulation lasts from 16–73 {{minutes and}} may occur in water or on land. During the breeding, the male grabs the female {{by the neck}} with his teeth. Copulation is vigorous, and is interrupted by periods of rest. Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. Female estrus lasts about a month per year, and true gestation lasts 61–63 days. Because the otters delay <b>implantation</b> for at least eight months, the interval between copulation and parturition can reach 10–12 months. Delayed <b>implantation</b> distinguishes the species from the European otter, which lacks this feature. Young are born between February and April, and parturition lasts three to eight hours.|$|E

Injections of LRH-Aa (0. 1 μg/g body weight) or pellet implants of LRH-At (25 and 125 μg/fish) alone increased serum GtH levels, but were relatively ineffective for inducing ovulation in goldfish (≅ 25 % rate of occurrence). Pimozide greatly potentiated the GtH release response to LRH-Aa injections or LRH-At pellet <b>implantations.</b> A high rate of occurrence of ovulation (87 %) was observed within 24 h when pimozide was injected prior to or with the first of two injections of LRH-Aa, or following <b>implantations</b> of LRH-At pellets that give continuous release of LRH-At. These results are consistent with the idea that dopamine acts directly at the pituitary level as a GtH release-inhibitory factor in goldfish...|$|R
5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to <b>implantation</b> success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after <b>implantation.</b> Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.|$|E

40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine whether cardiac resynchronisation therapy upgrade procedures are more complex and associated with more complications than de novo <b>implantations.</b> Method We retrospectively compared 134 upgrade procedures performed between 2006 - 2012 with a random, equally sized, sample of de novo CRT device <b>implantations</b> in the same period. Procedural data and the occurrence of periprocedural (≤ 30 days) and long-term device-related (≤ 1 year) complications were analysed. Complications with consequences were defined as those in need of adjustment of standard care. Results Median time to upgrade was 57 (31 - 115) months. There were no significant differences in procedure duration, radiation time or total hospitalisation between upgrades and de novo <b>implantations.</b> Perioperative complications occurred in 6. 7 % of upgrade patients and in 9. 0 % of de novo patients. The most frequently seen complications were phrenic nerve stimulation, coronary sinus dissection and pocket haematoma. Procedure success was comparable (upgrade: 98. 5 % versus de novo: 96. 3 %). A total of 236 patients completed 1 year of follow-up. Ten (4. 2 %) patients had a long-term device-related complication with consequences including phrenic nerve stimulation, lead dislodgement/dysfunction, and infection (upgrade: 3. 5 % versus de novo: 4. 9 %). Conclusion Upgrade procedures are not more complex nor associated with more complications than de novo CRT <b>implantations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Laser {{surface melting}} of a {{chromium}} steel results in tensile stresses, which have deleterious effects on its wear behaviour. <b>Implantations</b> at 360 K with neon and nitrogen {{have been carried}} out in order to convert these stresses into compressive ones.

Transmission Electron Microscopy shows that neon precipitates into large bubbles which appear to nucleate preferentially at dislocations. The bubble nucleation is affected by the high dislocation density of a laser melted surface and the bubble growth is enhanced by the tensile stress state of the surface layer. ...|$|R
