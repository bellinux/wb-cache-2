Based on an <b>income</b> survey from 2006 in rural Mozambique, this study assesses the seasonal contribution of different <b>income</b> sources to total household <b>income.</b> The results indicate that forest and environmental <b>income</b> was the second largest contributor to households’ total <b>income</b> next to crop <b>income,</b> the relative share being 23. 7 percent of total <b>income.</b> With regard to seasonal <b>income</b> contributions, wage <b>income</b> and other <b>income</b> sources (gold in particular) are important in filling the gap when <b>income</b> from crop production is low, although they do not completely offset the fall. All <b>income</b> sources, including forest and environmental <b>income,</b> were fluctuating significantly between seasons, except for livestock and business <b>income.</b> The volatility did vary across <b>income</b> sources; crop <b>income</b> seems the most volatile <b>income</b> component.
