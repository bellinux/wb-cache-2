25|$|For {{search engine}} {{optimization}} purposes, some companies offer to sell high PageRank links to webmasters. As links from higher-PR pages {{are believed to}} be more valuable, they tend to be more expensive. It can be an effective and viable marketing strategy to buy link advertisements on content pages of quality and relevant sites to drive traffic and increase a webmaster's link popularity. However, Google has publicly warned webmasters that if they are or were discovered to be selling links for the purpose of conferring PageRank and reputation, their links will be devalued (ignored in the calculation of other pages' PageRanks). The practice of buying and selling links is intensely debated across the Webmaster community. Google advises webmasters to use the nofollow <b>HTML</b> <b>attribute</b> value on sponsored links. According to Matt Cutts, Google is concerned about webmasters who try to game the system, and thereby reduce the quality and relevance of Google search results.|$|E

50|$|An <b>HTML</b> <b>attribute</b> is a {{modifier}} of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies {{the default}} functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute {{is added to}} an HTML start tag.|$|E

5000|$|Script code may be {{associated}} with an event and element by writing code in an <b>HTML</b> <b>attribute.</b> The name of the attribute must be that of a supported intrinsic event for the element (for example, [...] "onLoad"). The script is executed whenever the event occurs for that element. These scripts are mostly JavaScript. The HTML intrinsic event model consist of the following events: ...|$|E
5000|$|Before the {{widespread}} implementation of CSS, tables {{were commonly used}} to lay out pages. Sometimes the layout required several tables to be nested inside each other. Although placing the columns inside table cells easily achieves the desired visual appearance, using a table is semantically incorrect (although the [...] "role" [...] WAI-ARIA <b>HTML</b> <b>attribute</b> can be set to [...] "presentation" [...] to regain semantic context). There is also no way to control {{the order of the}} columns in the page source.|$|E
5000|$|The exploit employs scripts {{on a page}} {{of average}} interest, which rewrite the page with an {{impersonation}} of a well-known website, after the page has been left unattended for some time. A user who returns after a while and sees the rewritten page may be induced to believe the page is legitimate and enter their login, password and other details {{that will be used}} for improper purposes. The attack can be made more likely to succeed if the script checks for well known Web sites the user has loaded in the past or in other tabs, and loads a simulation of the same sites. This attack can be done even if JavaScript is disabled, using the [...] "meta refresh" [...] meta element, an <b>HTML</b> <b>attribute</b> used for page redirection that causes a reload of a specified new page after a given time interval.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Deep Web offers {{approximately}} 500 {{times more}} information than the Open Web, but is “hidden ” behind search-forms intended for human users, and typically requires interaction, which {{makes it difficult to}} index by Web crawlers. We argue that traditional data extraction is therefore not suitable for the Deep Web and suffers from coverage problems similar to those search engines face when trying to index its content. Instead, it is proposed to trans-form and forward queries on demand using Global-as-View Mediators. To al-low automated interaction with databases on the Deep Web, we use rules that exploit features (e. g. <b>HTML</b> <b>attribute</b> values) to identify elements on a Web page and infer semantic annotations that link these elements to known concepts (e. g. query parameters or result values). Using a prototypical implementation, Deep Web Mediator, the performance of this approach is demonstrated in a classified-advertising use case. Our system is able to answer complex queries by transforming and forwarding them to multiple sites as well as integrating the local results...|$|E
50|$|Originally {{introduced}} with applet, {{this element}} is now used with, and should only {{occur as a}} child of object. It uses <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes</b> to set a parameter for the object, e.g. width, height, font, background colour, etc., {{depending on the type}} of object. An object can have multiple params.|$|R
5000|$|A multiple-line text area, {{the size}} of which is {{specified}} by [...] (where a col is a one-character width of text) and [...] <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes.</b> The content of this element is restricted to plain text, which appears in the text area as default text when the page is loaded.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the general}} form, a [...] element {{specifies}} [...] and associated [...] <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes</b> describing {{aspects of the}} HTML page. To prevent possible ambiguity, an optional third attribute, , may be supplied to specify a semantic framework that defines {{the meaning of the}} key and its value: for example: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>HTML</b> <b>attributes</b> are {{generally}} classed as required attributes, optional attributes, standard attributes, and event attributes. Usually the required and optional <b>attributes</b> modify specific <b>HTML</b> elements, while the standard attributes {{can be applied}} to most HTML elements. [...] Event <b>attributes,</b> added in <b>HTML</b> version 4, allow an element to specify scripts to be run under specific circumstances.|$|R
5000|$|The HTML 4.01 {{specification}} reserves a syntax for the [...] "future {{support of}} script macros" [...] in <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes,</b> {{but they have}} not been incorporated into later standards and are not supported by any current browser. A polyfill (entities.js) has been created in order to allow [...] "script macros" [...] in browsers that do not natively support this feature.|$|R
50|$|Though VML is {{deprecated}} as {{a standard}} in Internet Explorer, it is most commonly used {{in relation to the}} development of HTML emails rendered in Microsoft Outlook 2007, 2010, and 2013. The use of background-images in email campaigns requires the use of VML to be displayed in Outlook because Outlook does not support the CSS or <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes</b> for background-images.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] element only {{includes}} the global <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes</b> such as contenteditable, id, and title. However, pubdate, an optional boolean attribute of the [...] element, {{is often used}} in conjunction with [...] If present, it indicates that the [...] element is the date the [...] was published. Note that pubdate applies only to the parent [...] element, or to the document as a whole.|$|R
5000|$|An HTML {{element is}} an {{individual}} component of an HTML document or web page, once this has been parsed into the Document Object Model. HTML is composed of a tree of HTML nodes, such as text nodes. Each node can have <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes</b> specified. Nodes can also have content, including other nodes and text. Many HTML nodes represent semantics, or meaning. For example, the [...] node represents {{the title of the}} document.|$|R
5000|$|Because of its refreshable {{braille display}} and text-to-speech-friendly interface, Lynx {{can be used for}} {{internet}} access by visually impaired users. As Lynx substitutes images, frames and other non-textual content with the text from , [...] and [...] <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes</b> and allows hiding the user interface elements, the browser becomes specifically suitable for use with cost-effective general purpose screen reading software. A version of Lynx specifically enhanced for use with screen readers on Windows was developed by IIT Madras.|$|R
50|$|Firebug 2.0 {{introduced}} {{many new}} features to the Firebug extension including JavaScript syntax highlighting, pretty print for minified JavaScript code, and a DOM Event Inspector {{to handle all}} event handlers on a web page. Additionally, users can search for page elements using CSS selectors in the search bar. The debugging tool now allows users to inspect JavaScript expressions as they are evaluated. Moreover, users can inspect values returned from JavaScript functions. It also adds {{the ability to create}} new <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes</b> for existing <b>HTML</b> elements.|$|R
50|$|Created in 1998, _readme.html (Own, Be Owned or Remain Invisible) {{is a work}} of net.art {{that spoke}} to the time period in which it was created, and yet still remains {{relevant}} to the contemporary moment. The piece is a simple web page with a white background and light grey text taken from an article about Heath Bunting. A vast majority of the words are hypertext, but not all. As coded for by simple <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes,</b> hyperlinked words turn from grey to black once visited.|$|R
5000|$|Can be used {{to specify}} {{additional}} metadata about a document, such as its author, publication date, expiration date, page description, keywords, or other information not provided through the other header elements and <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes.</b> Because of their generic nature, [...] elements specify associative key-value pairs. In general, a meta element conveys hidden information about the document. Several meta tags can be used, all of which should be nested in the head element. The specific purpose of each meta element is defined by its attributes.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{attribute}} , {{the anchor}} becomes a hyperlink to either {{another part of}} the document or another resource (e.g. a webpage) using an external URL. Alternatively (and sometimes concurrently), with the [...] or [...] <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes</b> set, the element becomes a target. A Uniform Resource Locator can link to this target via a fragment identifier. In HTML5, any element can now be made into a target by using the [...] attribute, so using [...] is not necessary, although this way of adding anchors continues to work.|$|R
5000|$|In HTML, '''''' and '''''' {{elements}} {{are used to}} define parts of a document {{so that they are}} identifiable when a unique classification is necessary. While other HTML elements such as [...] (paragraph), [...] (emphasis) and so on accurately represent the semantics of the content, the use of [...] and [...] leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors. Where no existing HTML element is applicable, [...] and [...] can represent parts of a document so that <b>HTML</b> <b>attributes</b> such as , , , or [...] can be applied.|$|R
