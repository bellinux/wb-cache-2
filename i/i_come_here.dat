25|$|So at this moment, I begin my {{tenure in}} this Chamber, {{uncertain}} of what history will say of my tenure here. <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E
500|$|... (From {{heaven on}} high <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here)</b> {{is the first}} stanza of a hymn by Martin Luther, , a {{paraphrase}} of the Annunciation to the shepherds. It is set for four parts in E-flat major and alla-breve as an a cappella motet, with the soprano singing the melody in long notes, the lower voices in imitation of the motifs.|$|E
3000|$|<b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> with {{my parents}} and my younger brother. My parents opened a {{restaurant}} in the Dashilar area. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> {{after graduating from high}} school. (A 7, female, age 23) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean. What {{do you think}} <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> for? To play cricket? Rot! I'd much rather have gone on tour with the Authentics. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to propose to Dolly Burn." ...|$|R
6000|$|She sprang lightly to {{her feet}} and stood over me as I knelt before her. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to be made love to, Stephen! <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to be loved! And you talk that nonsense! You remind me of everything--wretched!" ...|$|R
500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2011 {{marked the}} first time that a great-grandchild of Woody Guthrie {{performed}} a solo set when Krishna Guthrie (Arlo Guthrie's grandson; Abe Guthrie's son) took the stage at the Brick Street Cafe on Thursday afternoon on his great-grandfather's 99th birthday. Krishna Guthrie has been attending the festival since he was ten or twelve years old and says, “Every time <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> it's like a history lesson.” A familial theme seemed to carry through the festival with Butch Hancock being joined on stage by his 13-year-old son, Rory, and Kevin Welch performing in tandem with his son, Dustin.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{have had}} three adventurous months since I last saw you. I know the Police Court, the Quarter Sessions Court, the High Court with one judge and the High Court with five judges. But {{whenever}} the court {{let me go}} I was arrested again. I have learnt to speak English better. Perhaps I do not speak King's English but it's Kisch English anyhow. I did not come here to tell there is terrorism in Europe. <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> {{to tell you how}} to stop it. I have been an eye-witness. I was arrested the day the Reichstag was burnt down by Göring and his lieutenants. I saw my friend, Erich Mühsam, the poet, whose works I translated, made to walk naked, even in winter, and to lick up the spittle of his captors. All his limbs were broken gradually, and he died." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Great expectations? I mean, we’re {{trying to}} win a World Series. <b>I</b> didn’t <b>come</b> <b>here</b> for a haircut. We’re {{trying to get it}} on. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> for jewelry." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> {{to listen}} to what you have to say.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] he said, [...] "is {{something}} for which God forbid that I should take credit. What you are {{is due to}} the development of a germ within you, a development in which I have always had faith. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to see you, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> because <b>I</b> love you, because I have always loved you, Honora." ...|$|R
2500|$|After their finals defeat, Qureshi {{spoke to}} the crowd to [...] "say {{something}} {{on behalf of all}} Pakistanis, [...] every time <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> there's a wrong perception about the people of Pakistan. They are very friendly, very loving people. We want peace in this world as much as you guys." [...] He then made a political appeal to the controversial [...] "Ground Zero mosque" [...] saying [...] "For me, as a Muslim, that's what makes America the greatest country in the world - freedom of religion, freedom of speech. If the mosque is built, I think it's a huge gesture to all the Muslim community out there in the world. I would really appreciate it." [...] Indian and Pakistani fans filled the stadium for the final as the two U.N. ambassadors again sat together in the President's Box. Pakistan's ambassador Abdullah Hussain Haroon said [...] "They've proven that when Indians and Pakistanis get together we can raise fire. I think on a people-to-people basis, they're setting an example that the politicians should follow." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{glad to see}} you!" [...] {{he exclaimed}} almost vehemently. [...] "Why, {{what else do you}} suppose <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> for every Thursday evening? I never dance; they all make game of me because they know <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> on the chance of seeing you again. I'm a fool! I know that! You just amuse {{yourself}} here with me, and then you go away, back to your friends--and forget! And I hang about round here, like the silly ass that I am!" ...|$|E
60|$|CLARE. But {{not where}} you think. You say I need advice. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> for it.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{situation}} in a nutshell," [...] she said. [...] "You have arranged it all beautifully, even to my triumphal exit. Well, and what then? No, you needn't answer, it has no interest. I assure you <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> not with any notion of marching out in triumph, as you call it. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here,</b> to speak in the most vulgar way, to save your skin--and mine." ...|$|R
60|$|ABSOLUTE Oh, a joke, sir, a joke! <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> {{on purpose}} {{to look for}} you, sir.|$|R
6000|$|... "You come," [...] {{she whispered}} persuasively. [...] "No. 36, over the tailor's shop. You {{will find it}} easily. Afterwards <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to dine! So?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Indignantly.] Then what 'ave {{you got to}} turn up {{your nose}} about, eh? What d'you mean by sneerin' and snarlin' at me when <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here?</b> ...|$|E

6000|$|Well, {{whenever}} <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> he's {{out for a}} walk.... I say, old tart, {{could you}} oblige me {{with a couple of}} sovereigns till next Saturday? ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'It was not,' replied Eugene composedly, 'in {{the least}} true. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here,</b> because <b>I</b> had {{information}} that I should find you here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Maisie waited; {{her silence}} seemed to signify that she too had no {{alternative}} to suggest. But she made another appeal. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> you'll come to see me?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes. And <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in his company, {{intending}} to return with him. But you shall know all soon. Picotee shall write to Faith.' ...|$|R
60|$|THE MAN. Oh, I'm a fool {{to listen}} to you and argue with you. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to kill you and then kill myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>came</b> down <b>here,</b> and <b>I</b> was afeard, and I went back; but I didn't like {{to speak}} to her, because of the gentleman, and <b>I</b> <b>came</b> on <b>here</b> again." ...|$|R
