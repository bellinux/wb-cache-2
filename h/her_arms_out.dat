But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long {{procession}} of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> to them in welcome." ...|$|E
60|$|Just then Jeannie woke up, and {{stretched}} <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> to her.|$|E
60|$|She held <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> widely, and the {{moonlight}} shone {{in her eyes}} as she turned her face to him.|$|E
60|$|Her {{astonishing}} quickness of perception, {{detected a}} change in my voice, or my manner, when I put that question, which warned her that I had been speaking all along with some ulterior object in view. She stopped, and taking <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> of mine, looked me searchingly in the face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all!" [...] I cried. [...] "There's an {{abundance}} of room. My wife's keeping the places for you,"--in fact, I saw <b>her</b> putting <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> along the bench, and explaining to a couple who had halted {{in front of her}} that the seats were taken--"and she'll be disappointed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, make up {{your mind}} soon. The old man 'll fill me with {{buck-shot}} if he catches sight o' me." [...] He drew <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> of the window and laid his bearded cheek to it. [...] "Come, little one, we're made for each other; God knows it. Come! It's him 'r me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Carrie held <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out.</b> [...] "I wouldn't be {{anything}} else if I could. You know that, too. Come and kiss me, Charley, and never say {{anything of the}} kind again." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{held her}} wrists {{and in a}} happy, irresponsible way was {{swinging}} <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> and in, all the while that he was drinking in the joy of seeing her again.|$|E
60|$|These {{words were}} not {{especially}} touching or sympathetic. But {{the fact of}} that resemblance insisted upon was enough in itself to act upon her emotions powerfully. With a little faint cry, and throwing <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out,</b> Mrs Verloc burst into tears at last.|$|E
60|$|A woman, {{wiping the}} suds off <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> came <b>out</b> {{of the cottage}} next the sweetmeat shop.|$|R
60|$|Disdaining to reply, she {{stretched}} <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>out,</b> {{pointing to the}} chair. He bit his lip, frowned, laughed, {{and sat down in}} it, with a baffled, irresolute, impatient air, he was unable to conceal; and biting his nail nervously, and looking at her sideways, with bitter discomfiture, even while he feigned to be amused by her caprice.|$|R
60|$|Noel {{was sitting}} in front of the empty drawing-room hearth, with <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{stretched}} <b>out</b> as if there had been a fire there.|$|R
6000|$|At {{first there}} was no change in Gwendolen's attitude: she only began to tremble visibly; then she looked before her with dilated eyes, as at {{something}} lying in front of her, till she stretched <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> straight, and cried with a smothered voice-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} was," [...] said the young woman: [...] "if I hadn't shown {{her how to}} make the horse back, she would have pulled <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> for nothing. It is easy to see that she does not know {{anything}} about managing horses." ...|$|E
60|$|Anna {{thought of}} her {{blistered}} hands, and hesitated, till a look at Clara's hopeful face decided her to accept. She did so, and rode like an Amazon for several hours, in spite of heat, dust, and a hard-mouthed horse, who nearly pulled <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> of the sockets.|$|E
60|$|Presently she {{uttered a}} scream, and {{snatched}} <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> of the hole. To it, or rather to her hand, was hanging a great hooded snake of the cobra variety {{such as the}} Boers call ringhals. She shook it off, and the reptile, after sitting up, spitting, hissing and expanding its hood, glided back into the wall. Tabitha sat still, staring at her lacerated finger, which Ivana seized and sucked.|$|R
60|$|Now Madonna, perceiving {{that the}} {{stranger}} showed evident signs, on approaching her, of what appeared like confusion to her apprehension, quietly drew <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> of Zack's, and, to his unmeasured astonishment, stepped forward {{in front of}} him--looked up brightly into the grim, scarred face of Mat--dropped her usual curtsey--wrote a line hurriedly on her slate--then offered it {{to him with a}} smile and a nod, to read if he pleased, and to write on in return.|$|R
6000|$|... (Suddenly {{becoming}} aware of herself and breaking down. She stoops and clasps Tommy in <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> crying <b>out,</b> in anxiety and fear, and from love of her boy.) Oh, Tommy! Tommy! ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} instant, evidently startled by Woola's fierce cry, they halted and looked about. Then, of a sudden, one of them, a woman, held <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> toward me, {{and even at}} that great {{distance}} I could see that her lips moved--it was Dejah Thoris, my ever beautiful and ever youthful Princess of Helium.|$|E
6000|$|She spread <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> over it, with a piteous gesture, like {{a mother}} {{trying to keep her}} child from harm. [...] "Oh, don't! Oh, don't!" [...] she implored. [...] "It's my cloth! I spun it, I wove it, every thread! It's all we've got for our clothes this winter! Don't touch it, don't tear it!" ...|$|E
60|$|Burst {{into tears}} she did. Sitting {{down on a}} chair by the table, flinging <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> upon it, and burying her face in them, she {{proceeded}} to cry stormily. Marilla and Matthew {{looked at each other}} deprecatingly across the stove. Neither of them knew what to say or do. Finally Marilla stepped lamely into the breach.|$|E
60|$|That {{moment she}} turned, she came running towards me, <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{stretched}} <b>out,</b> <b>her</b> face incarnadined {{for the one}} moment with heavenly blushes, the next pale as death. ‘Monsieur de. Saint-Yves!’ she said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you join}} me?" [...] he had asked, {{giving her a}} look in which admiration was no longer {{disguised}} and yet felt itself half {{at the mercy of}} her replying that a jeune fille shouldn't be seen following a gentleman. But it drew a breath which filled its lungs for a long time afterwards when she replied simply that if she had overtaken him he might have accepted <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> of politeness, whereas she wished to have the pleasure of seeing him walk alone.|$|R
60|$|I {{leaned against}} the wall, and a sob broke from me. Then, in an instant, the passage was flooded with light, and in the open doorway Giuliana stood all white before me, <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> held <b>out.</b>|$|R
60|$|She came in {{with her}} latch-key, put down her sunshade, and stood looking {{at herself in the}} glass. Her cheeks were flushed as if the sun had burned them; her lips were parted in a smile. She {{stretched}} <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> as though to embrace herself, with a laugh that for all the world was like a sob.|$|E
60|$|She {{had wandered}} about the woods by the river’s brink all day, and then, when evening fell and the grey {{twilight}} spread its dusky robe upon the waters, she stretched <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> to the silent river that had known her sorrow and her joy. And the old river {{had taken her}} into its gentle arms, and had laid her weary head upon its bosom, and had hushed away the pain.|$|E
6000|$|She {{stretched}} <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out,</b> pleading; {{she turned}} those subtle eyes to him, appealingly. She {{was a beautiful}} woman. Alan Merrick was human. The man in him gave way; he seized her in his clasp, and pressed her close to his bosom. It heaved tumultuously. [...] "I could do anything for you, Herminia," [...] he cried, [...] "and indeed, I do sympathize with you. But give me, at least, till to-morrow to think this thing over. It is a momentous question; don't let us be precipitate." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{took up a}} {{cloak and}} hood, and, {{throwing}} them over <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> she slipped <b>out</b> of the room.|$|R
6000|$|Francie sank to a {{chair by}} the table {{as if she were}} too tired to stand longer, and with <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> spread <b>out</b> on the lamplit plush she looked up at him. [...] "Was it there you saw it?" ...|$|R
50|$|A {{crucifix}} suspension is {{a variation}} on a suicide suspension in which hooks are also placed in the arms, such that the suspendee appears to be hanging on a cross, with his or <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> held <b>out</b> to the side.|$|R
60|$|Shefford {{dared not}} look at Fay. Yet, dimly, {{from the corner of}} his eye, he saw her, a pale shadow, turned to stone, with <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out.</b> If he looked, if he made sure of that, he was lost. When had he drawn his gun? It was there, a dark and glinting thing in his hand. He must fly--not through cowardice and fear, but because in one more moment he would kill a man. Swift as the thought he dove through the open window. And, leaping up, he ran under the dark pinyons toward camp.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] she murmured, [...] "I {{shall be}} just {{what you want me}} to be. I think you could make me just what you want. Be very kind to me, please," [...] she begged, {{stretching}} <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> to him. [...] "I suppose it is because I have been ill so long, but I feel so helpless, and I love your strength and I want you to take care of me. Your own hands are quite cold," [...] she added anxiously. [...] "You look pale, too. You're not ill, Everard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he {{has treated}} me!" [...] She shot <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> from her sleeves, and we saw with horror {{that they were all}} mottled with bruises. [...] "But this is nothing--nothing! It is my mind and soul that he has {{tortured}} and defiled. I could endure it all, ill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could still cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I know that in this also I have been his dupe and his tool." [...] She broke into passionate sobbing as she spoke.|$|E
60|$|A ragged and filthy nursing mother, {{with her}} last {{addition}} to our Imperial People on <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> comes <b>out</b> of a drinkshop, and stands a little unsteadily, and wipes mouth and nose comprehensively {{with the back of}} a red chapped hand....|$|R
5000|$|The Daily Mirror {{reported}} that, whilst on the shoot, Alesha accidentally {{knocked out}} one of her dancers, saying, [...] "she flung <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>out</b> and clocked {{one of the girls}} with a giant ring, leaving her out cold". [...] Dixon later confirmed the Mirrors story, saying [...] "I got her right in the head. She just fell back and didn't move. She was lying there, really trying to fight back the tears. I started crying because I felt so bad! She had a massive bump on her head immediately. But she was back up {{by the end of the}} video because she's a professional".|$|R
5000|$|When {{the city}} started {{appearing}} in Tokyo, The Hall of Ancestors {{was the first}} to arrive. Junzo and Hiromitsu {{made their way to the}} Great Hall, where Junzo introduced himself to Yü-Ti and the Dragon Kings. With Hiromitsu’s help, they then took control of the Dragon Kings and imprisoned Yü-Ti. The Hand then imprisoned Rand, who demanded to know what had become of Misty Knight; when Junzo cruelly explained how he ripped <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>out,</b> Danny attacked him, only to be defeated. Yü-Ti then revealed how Hiromitsu had murdered his parents; Junzo then killed his uncle and took his powers of sorcery from his corpse.|$|R
