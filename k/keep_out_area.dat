In wet locations, conduit may resemble standard threaded pipe in appearance, with gasketed box openings to <b>keep</b> moisture <b>out.</b> <b>Areas</b> with potentially explosive gases need further protection to prevent electrical sparks from igniting the gases, and internal conduit gas-tight barriers to prevent potentially ignited gases from traveling inside the conduit {{to other parts}} of the building.|$|R
5000|$|Fort Tilden is an {{important}} nesting area for the threatened Piping Plover, a species which NPS—as {{part of a large}} global effort—is working to protect. The eggs and chicks are very small and highly camouflaged, so they are extremely difficult to see. It is very easy to step on the eggs and kill the unhatched chicks. [...] "Under New York and Federal laws persons may be arrested and fined for killing, harassing, teasing, or in any way disturbing birds nesting in this area."

During 1945 after the end of the war, after Romola had moved with him to Vienna, he encountered a group of Russian soldiers in an encampment, playing traditional folk tunes on a balalaika and other instruments. Inspired by the music and hearing his first language, he started dancing, astounding the men with his skills. Drinking and laughing with them helped him start to speak again. He had maintained long periods of almost absolute silence during his years of illness. His wife Romola had protected them by staying for a time at the border of Hungary and Austria, trying to <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> of major <b>areas</b> of fighting.|$|R
40|$|Distress call playbacks {{are used}} as deterrents to <b>keep</b> birds <b>out</b> of <b>areas</b> where they are causing problems. However, the calls often are ineffective, owing to birds 2 ̆ 7 rapid {{habitation}} to them. Recent studies on the functional significance of distress calls indicate that adult passerines only distress call when physically constrained and that the calls are designed to startle the predator holding the caller into releasing it. Further, distress calls attract other birds, which approach the caller to acquire information about the predator. These findings suggest that distress calls {{would be more effective}} if their broadcast is paired with a predator model that appears to be grasping the caller. Such a pairing should reinforce a bird 2 ̆ 7 s fear of the predator model and delay its habituation to the distress call...|$|R
40|$|The safety {{controls}} below apply to {{areas on the}} UC Irvine campus where high intensity direct current (dc; steady-state; 0 Hertz) magnetic fields exist. These controls are based on exposure guidelines developed by the International Commission for Non-ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), which are summarized on page 2. Note: 1 Tesla (T) = 10, 000 Gauss (G). � Only authorized personnel may be allowed into areas where high-intensity magnetic fields (HIMFs) exceed 100 mT (1, 000 G). Further, such authorized personnel shall be carefully screened before beginning work that exposes them to very high magnetic fields. � Magnetic fields can interfere with the body's sense of time when day and night cues are absent. Therefore, personnel should not work more than 12 hours per shift in areas where fields exceed 100 mT. � Caution signs must be posted in areas where magnetic field strengths could exceed 0. 5 mT (5 G), warning people with heart pacemakers or other medical electronic implants to <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> of the <b>area,</b> and warning individuals with magnetizable implants to check with EH&S or the facility supervisor before entering the area. � People with metallic medical implants shall be kept <b>out</b> of <b>areas</b> where field strength...|$|R
