5|$|According to {{specialist}} Gabriel Defert on {{the basis}} of statistical data available from the Portuguese and Indonesian authorities, and from the Catholic Church, between December 1975 and December 1981, approximately 308,000 Timorese lost their lives; this constituted about 44% of the pre-invasion population. Similarly Indonesian Professor George Aditjondro, formerly of Salatiga University in Java, concluded from <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> Indonesian Army data that in fact 300,000 Timorese had been killed {{in the early years of}} the occupation.|$|E
5|$|His mysticism is {{informed}} by the influences of Böhme and Franckenberg {{as well as of}} prominent writers Meister Eckhart (1260–1327), Johannes Tauler (–1361), Heinrich Suso (–1366), and Jan van Ruysbroeck (1293/4–1381). Critic and literary theorist Georg Ellinger surmised in <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> Silesius that his poetry was influenced by loneliness (especially due to the death of his parents and becoming an orphan early in life), ungoverned impulsivity, and lack of personal fulfillment, rendering much of his poetry confessional and exhibiting internal psychological conflict.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} few {{decades of the twentieth}} century, American {{paleontologist}} E. C. Case authored many studies on Dimetrodon and described several new species. He received funding from the Carnegie Institution for <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> many Dimetrodon specimens in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History and several other museums. Many of these fossils had been collected by Cope but had not been thoroughly described, as Cope was known for erecting new species on the basis of only a few bone fragments.|$|E

His Géométrographie and {{relation}} of equations to tetrahedrons and triangles, as well as <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> concurrencies and concyclities, contributed to the modern triangle geometry of the time. The definition of points of the triangle such as the Lemoine point was also {{a staple of the}} geometry, and other modern triangle geometers such as Brocard and Gaston Tarry wrote about similar points.|$|E

5|$|Though cyclizations {{following}} the general template above had been observed prior to Nazarov's involvement, it was <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones {{that marked the}} first major examination of this process. Nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopentenone product. The reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone.|$|E

While he continued to exhibit sculpture and drawings, he also began printmaking, a medium which, he said, combines the carving quality of sculpture with the subtleties of light and shade in drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|Willard Spiegelman, in <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> Romantic poetry, {{suggests}} that the indolence of the poem arises from the narrator's reluctance to apply himself to the labour associated with poetic creation.

5|$|After the {{publication}} of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple—the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500years. While <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.|$|E
5|$|Although Emerson {{credits his}} grandfather's {{gift of a}} Barlow knife {{to him at the}} age of eight years with {{starting}} his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that he turned to making them. The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a balisong knife for <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford one on his salary, Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} from 1935 to 1956, Jolin {{spent much of his}} time travelling. In 1954, he toured the United States with an exhibition.

Secretary-General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld, attended the exhibition and bought a painting depicting Riddarholmen for <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> the United Nations building. The exhibition was shown on national TV in the United States. Jolin also exhibited his works at galleries in several other countries, and in 1957, the Liljevalchs konsthall hosted a retrospective exhibition featuring over 200 of his paintings.|$|E

5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in his laboratory, could have {{had no idea where}} the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. His scientific work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E
5|$|Following a footballing career spent {{exclusively}} with Torpedo, Streltsov, {{a supporter of}} Spartak Moscow, repeatedly complained about his failure to play for his favourite team. After his retirement, Torpedo continued to pay his salary to fund <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> football coaching at the Institute of Physical Culture. Streltsov returned to Torpedo in the capacity of youth team manager following his qualification; he also spent a brief spell as manager of the first team {{before returning to the}} youth team in 1982. He also took part in matches contested by former players before dying in 1990 from throat cancer, which his first wife Alla later claimed had been brought about by irradiated food served to him in the camps. Seven years later, Marina Lebedeva, the woman Streltsov had confessed to raping, was seen laying flowers at his grave in Moscow on the day after the anniversary of his death.|$|E
5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is <b>his</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> symbolic interaction.

Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life, social interaction, the social construction of self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E
