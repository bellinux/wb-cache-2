5|$|While many welding {{applications}} {{are done in}} controlled environments such as factories and repair shops, some welding processes are commonly used {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, such as open air, underwater, and vacuums (such as space). In open-air applications, such as construction and outdoors repair, shielded metal arc welding is the most common process. Processes that employ inert gases to protect the weld cannot be readily used in such situations, because unpredictable atmospheric movements can result in a faulty weld. Shielded metal arc welding is also often used in underwater welding in the construction and repair of ships, offshore platforms, and pipelines, but others, such as flux cored arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding, are also common. Welding in space is also possible—it was first attempted in 1969 by Russian cosmonauts, when they performed experiments to test shielded metal arc welding, plasma arc welding, and electron beam welding in a <b>depressurized</b> environment. Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades, and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other welding processes in space, such as laser beam welding, resistance welding, and friction welding. Advances in these areas may be useful for future endeavours similar to the construction of the International Space Station, which could rely on welding for joining in space the parts that were manufactured on Earth.|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that methane production from hydrate-bearing porous media by means of depressurization-induced dissociation can be a promising technique. In this study, a 2 D axisymmetric model for simulating the gas production from hydrates by depressurization is developed to investigate the gas production behavior with different <b>depressurizing</b> approaches. The simulation results showed that the depressurization process with <b>depressurizing</b> range has significant influence on the final gas production. On the contrary, the <b>depressurizing</b> rate only affects the production lifetime. More amount of cumulative gas can be produced with a larger depressurization range or lowering the <b>depressurizing</b> rate for a certain <b>depressurizing</b> range. Through the comparison of the combined depressurization modes, the Class 2 (all the hydrate dissociation simulations are performed by reducing the initial system pressure with the same <b>depressurizing</b> range initially, then to continue the depressurization process conducted by different <b>depressurizing</b> rates and complete when the system pressure decreases to the atmospheric pressure) is much superior to the Class 1 (different <b>depressurizing</b> ranges are adopted in the initial period of the gas production process, when the pressure is reduced to the corresponding value of depressurization process at the different <b>depressurizing</b> range, the simulations are conducted at a certain <b>depressurizing</b> rate until the pressure reaches the atmospheric pressure) for a long and stable gas production process. The parameter analysis indicated that the gas production performance decreases and the period of stable production increases with the initial pressure for the case of <b>depressurizing</b> range. Additionally, for the case of <b>depressurizing</b> range, the better gas production performance is associated with higher ambient temperature for production process, and the effect of thermal conductivity on gas production performance can be negligible. However, for the case of <b>depressurizing</b> rate, the ambient temperature or thermal conductivity is dominant in different period of gas production process...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{different}} saturations of hydrate samples were formed in a cubic hydrate simulator (CHS) filled with silica sand. Subsequently, the hydrate was dissociated by depressurization {{in conjunction with}} warm water stimulation using dual horizontal wells. The hydrate dissociation process includes the <b>depressurizing</b> period and the injection period (the constant-pressure period). Hydrate was dissociated simultaneously in the whole reservoir during the <b>depressurizing</b> period. Meanwhile, gas production in the <b>depressurizing</b> period is mainly determined by the <b>depressurizing</b> rate, and it has little relation to the hydrate saturation (when the hydrate saturation ranges from 15. 5 % to 39. 1 %). During the injection period, more gas can be produced for the reservoir with the higher hydrate saturation, whereas the highest average gas production rate can be obtained for the reservoir with the middle-higher hydrate saturation. With respect to the gas production in the <b>depressurizing</b> period, gas production in the injection period is the dominant factor affecting the whole production efficiency in the experiment. In addition, the energy ratio only increases {{with the increase of}} the hydrate saturation in the prior stage of the constant-pressure period, and the final energy ratio with the middle-higher hydrate saturation is the maximum. Moreover, energy analysis indicates that heat injection plays the leading role for hydrate dissociation in the constant-pressure production period when the initial hydrate saturation is higher than 32. 4 %...|$|R

25|$|In a {{conventional}} design with a pressurized core, refuelling the system requires the core {{to shut down}} and the pressure vessel to be opened. Due to the arrangement used in CANDU, only the single tube being refuelled needs to be <b>depressurized.</b> This allows the CANDU system to be continually refuelled without shutting down, another major design goal. In modern systems, two robotic machines hook up to the reactor faces and open the end caps of a pressure tube. One machine pushes in the new fuel, whereby the depleted fuel is pushed out and collected at the other end. A significant operational advantage of online refuelling is that a failed or leaking fuel bundle can {{be removed from the}} core once it has been located, thus reducing the radiation levels in the primary cooling loop.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe methane {{dissociation}} phenomena from hydrate-bearing sediment {{with different}} hydrate saturations by depressurization are experimentally investigated in the cubic hydrate simulator (CHS). The experiments {{have been carried}} out over the hydrate saturation range of 16. 0 %- 40. 7 %. The hydrate dissociation process consists of two periods: <b>depressurizing</b> and steady pressure. In different experiments, the cumulative gas productions are similar in the <b>depressurizing</b> period and increase with the hydrate saturation in the steady pressure period. The average gas production rate increases with the increase of the hydrate saturation while decreases at the hydrate saturation of 40. 7 % in the steady pressure period. The temperature in different regions in the reactor changes by similar degrees in the <b>depressurizing</b> period and has the similar lowest values for different experiments...|$|R

25|$|The {{agent is}} emptied and <b>depressurized</b> and the valve is removed. After a {{thorough}} {{internal and external}} visual inspection, the cylinder is filled with water, placed inside a safety cage, and pressurized to the specified test pressure (varies with the type, age, and cylinder material) for the specified time period. If no failure, bulges, or leaks are detected, the cylinder passes. The cylinder is then emptied of water and thoroughly dried, and labeled with the test date and company that performed the test. CO2 types have the test information stamped on the cylinder, all other types get a sticker {{on the back of}} the cylinder. Once dry, the units are recharged. Unlike the UK, the US does not rebuild extinguishers and replace valves at specific intervals unless parts are found to be defective, with the exception of halon. Halon types are often given new o-rings and valve stems at every internal maintenance to minimize any leakage potential.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, NASA {{released}} a detailed report on survivability {{aspects of the}} Columbia reentry. The crew would have had {{less than a minute}} between the beginning of orbiter disintegration and depressurization. The structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin, although they {{had no way of knowing}} that the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin. All evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of Columbia as it began to spin out of control, but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right, exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration. The crew cabin separated from the rest of the orbiter and rapidly <b>depressurized,</b> which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds. Afterwards, the cabin spun around at high RPM, which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail. They were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and falling objects from the disintegrating cabin, along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets, which were not designed to provide any head protection. Even if the cabin had remained structurally intact and reached a lower altitude where air could refill it, the high altitude depressurization would have been fatal to the astronauts unless they received medical attention within 5 minutes, approximately the amount of time it would take between cerebral hypoxia and brain death.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 2012, the Byron Unit 2 {{was shut}} down and <b>depressurized</b> after a failed {{insulator}} in the plant's switchyard caused the loss of one phase to the plant's startup transformers. This caused low voltage conditions on the plant's emergency power buses and also {{for two of the}} reactor coolant pumps to trip which caused the plant to shut down. The trip of the plant then caused the other two reactor coolant pumps to trip (as they had been receiving power directly from the main generator) and natural circulation had to be used during the shutdown. When operators discovered the loss of the single phase, they manually tripped the breaker feeding the startup transformers, allowing the emergency diesel generators to start and restore normal voltages to the safety buses. Steam was vented from the non-radioactive, secondary side of the plant to aid in the cooling process while the turbines remained offline. A small amount of radioactive tritium was released into the local environment during the initial venting procedure, but was deemed no threat to the public by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A similar insulator failure occurred at Unit 1 on February 29 again affecting the unit's startup transformers. In this case the breaker feeding the transformers tripped automatically and the emergency diesel generators immediately started up to restore power to the safety buses. Additionally, all of the non-safety power generation buses transferred to the unit auxiliary transformers, which receive power from the plant's turbine generator, preventing a trip of the plant. After this second failed insulator event, Exelon took both units offline and replaced all of the insulators in the plant's switchyard.|$|E

500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin <b>depressurized,</b> the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin <b>depressurized</b> and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E

500|$|The next morning, flight day five, Young and Duke ate {{breakfast and}} began {{preparations}} for the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA), or moonwalk. After the pair donned and pressurized their space suits and <b>depressurized</b> the Lunar Module cabin, Young climbed out onto the [...] "porch" [...] of the LM, a small platform above the ladder. Duke handed Young a jettison bag full of trash to dispose of on the surface. Young then lowered the equipment transfer bag (ETB), containing equipment for use during the EVA, to the surface. Young descended the ladder and, upon setting foot on the lunar surface, became the ninth human {{to walk on the}} Moon. Upon stepping onto the surface, Young expressed his sentiments about being there: [...] "There you are: Mysterious and Unknown Descartes. Highland plains. Apollo 16 is gonna change your image. I'm sure glad they got ol' Brer Rabbit, here, back in the briar patch where he belongs." [...] Duke soon descended the ladder and joined Young on the surface, becoming the tenth and youngest human to walk on the Moon, at age 36. After setting foot on the lunar surface, Duke expressed his excitement, commenting: [...] "Fantastic! Oh, that first foot on the lunar surface is super, Tony!" [...] The pair's first task of the moonwalk was to unload the Lunar Roving Vehicle, the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph (UVC), and other equipment, from the Lunar Module. This was done without problems. On first driving the lunar rover, Young discovered that the rear steering was not working. He alerted Mission Control to the problem before setting up the television camera and planting the flag of the United States with Duke. The day's next task was to deploy the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP); while they were parking the lunar rover, on which the TV camera was mounted, to observe the deployment, the rear steering began functioning without explanation. While deploying a heat-flow experiment (that had burned up with the Lunar Module Aquarius on Apollo 13 and had been attempted with limited success on Apollo 15), a cable was inadvertently snapped after getting caught around Young's foot. After ALSEP deployment, they collected samples in the vicinity. About four hours after the beginning of EVA-1, they mounted the lunar rover and drove to the first geologic stop, Plum Crater, a [...] crater on the rim of Flag crater, about [...] across. There, at a distance of [...] from the LM, they sampled material from the vicinity of Flag Crater, which scientists believed penetrated through the upper regolith layer to the underlying Cayley Formation. It was there that Duke retrieved, at the request of Mission Control, the largest rock returned by an Apollo mission, a breccia nicknamed Big Muley after mission geology principal investigator William R. Muehlberger. The next stop of the day was Buster Crater, about [...] from the LM. There, Duke took pictures of Stone Mountain and South Ray Crater while Young deployed a magnetic field experiment. At that point, scientists began to reconsider their pre-mission hypothesis that Descartes had been the setting of ancient volcanic activity, as the two astronauts had yet to find any volcanic material. Following their stop at Buster, Young did a demonstration drive of the lunar rover while Duke filmed with a 16 mm movie camera. After completing more tasks at the ALSEP, they returned to the LM to close out the moonwalk. They reentered the LM 7 hours, 6 minutes, and 56 seconds after the start of the EVA. Once inside, they pressurized the LM cabin, went through a half-hour briefing with scientists in Mission Control, and configured the cabin for the sleep period.|$|E
