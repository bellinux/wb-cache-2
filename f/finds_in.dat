Excavations in Pilestræde have also led to the discovery of a well from the late 12th century. The remains of an ancient church, with graves dating to the 11th century, have been unearthed near where Strøget meets Rådhuspladsen.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil {{exploration}} and production continued to expand and stabilize. Oil production became established in North Texas, Central Texas, the Panhandle, and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The <b>finds</b> <b>in</b> North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, were particularly significant, bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was twice that of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E

5|$|The {{change from}} a body plan for {{breathing}} and navigating in water to a body plan enabling the animal to move on land {{is one of the}} most profound evolutionary changes known.

5|$|Throughout the 20th century new fossil finds {{continued}} {{to contribute to}} understanding the paths taken by evolution. Examples include major taxonomic transitions such as <b>finds</b> <b>in</b> Greenland, starting in the 1930s (with more major <b>finds</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s), of fossils illustrating the evolution of tetrapods from fish, and fossils in China during the 1990s that {{shed light on the}} dinosaur-bird relationship. Other events that have attracted considerable attention have included the discovery of a series of fossils in Pakistan that have shed light on whale evolution, and most famously of all a series of finds throughout the 20th century in Africa (starting with Taung child in 1924) and elsewhere have helped illuminate the course of human evolution. Increasingly, {{at the end of the}} 20th century, the results of paleontology and molecular biology were being brought together to reveal detailed phylogenetic trees.|$|E
5|$|A more {{substantial}} Bronze Age settlement {{is known to}} have existed; the remains of what may have been a causeway were discovered in 1934, in the form of wooden piles unearthed by a farmer between Little Thetford and nearby Barway. A Bronze Age ring and a late Bronze Age sherd were excavated nearby. There {{have been a number of}} Bronze Age <b>finds</b> <b>in</b> the area, including a pre–701BC palstave at nearby Fordey farm, Barway, and at Little Thetford, a middle Bronze Age (1600–1001BC) rapier in 1953, and a late Bronze Age flesh-hook in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Although sauropods {{may have}} been the prey of choice for Majungasaurus, discoveries {{published}} in 2007 detail <b>finds</b> <b>in</b> Madagascar that indicate the presence of other Majungasaurus in their diet. Numerous bones of Majungasaurus have been discovered bearing tooth marks identical to those found on sauropod bones from the same localities. These marks have the same spacing as teeth in Majungasaurus jaws, are of the same size as Majungasaurus teeth, and contain smaller notches consistent with the serrations on those teeth. As Majungasaurus is the only large theropod known from the area, the simplest explanation is that it was feeding on other members of its own species. Suggestions that the Triassic Coelophysis was a cannibal have been recently disproven, leaving Majungasaurus as the only non-avian theropod with confirmed cannibalistic tendencies, although {{there is some evidence that}} cannibalism may have occurred in other species as well.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} <b>finds</b> <b>in</b> the Taynton Limestone Formation, in 1939 Sidney Hugh Reynolds {{referred}} remains to Megalosaurus {{that had been}} found in the older Chipping Norton Limestone Formation dating from the early Bathonian, about thirty single teeth and bones. Though the age disparity makes it problematic to assume an identity with Megalosaurus bucklandii, in 2009 Benson could not establish any relevant anatomical differences with M. bucklandii among the remains found at one site, the New Park Quarry, and therefore affirmed the reference to that species. However, in another site, the Oakham Quarry, the material contained one bone, an ilium, that was clearly dissimilar.|$|E

She eventually consents, and finally <b>finds</b> <b>in</b> the film an insightful view into historical Human-Vulcan relations. Meanwhile, Mayweather makes his intended modifications without permission, resulting in a confrontation when Paul finds out. The ship comes under further attack from an alien vessel, and Paul offers up the cargo as planned. The aliens refuse and demand the vessel as well. Left without any other option, Paul tells Mayweather to re-initiate the modifications, and to detach the command module from the cargo section. They soon disable the alien ship. The brothers reconcile, and Mayweather leaves, promising to visit again soon.|$|E
5|$|Edward Drinker Cope {{described}} his <b>finds</b> <b>in</b> two 1878 {{issues of the}} American Naturalist, and assigned them to the new genus Amphicoelias. He placed it in a unique family, Amphicoeliidae, though this is now considered a nomen oblitum (forgotten name). The genus is usually assigned to the family Diplodocidae, though some modern analyses have found it {{at the base of}} the larger group Diplodocoidea or as a diplodocid incertae sedis (uncertain placement). The first named species in the genus, Amphicoelias altus (holotype specimen AMHD 5764), was discovered by Cope in 1877. But while it is only represented by a partial skeleton, there are enough diagnostic characteristics to provisionally define the genus. A. altus is known from better remains, but is smaller than A. fragillimus. Cope also named a second species in 1878: Amphicoelias latus.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{show how}} to <b>find</b> <b>in</b> Hamiltonian graphs {{a cycle of}} length nΩ(1 /loglogn) =exp(Ω(logn/loglogn)). This is a {{consequence}} of a more general result in which we show that if G has a maximum degree d and has a cycle with k vertices (or a 3 -cyclable minor H with k vertices), then we can <b>find</b> <b>in</b> O(n 3) time a cycle in G of length kΩ(1 /logd). From this we infer that if G has a cycle of length k, then one can <b>find</b> <b>in</b> O(n 3) time a cycle of length kΩ(1 /(log(n/k) +loglogn)), which implies the result for Hamiltonian graphs. Our results improve, for some values of k and d, a recent result of Gabow (2004) [11] showing that if G has a cycle of length k, then one can <b>find</b> <b>in</b> polynomial time a cycle in G of length exp(Ω(logk/loglogk)). We finally show that if G has fixed Euler genus g and has a cycle with k vertices (or a 3 -cyclable minor H with k vertices), then we can <b>find</b> <b>in</b> polynomial time a cycle in G of length f(g) kΩ(1), running in time O(n 2) for planar graphs...|$|R
