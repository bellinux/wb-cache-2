500|$|Critic Lyman B. Hagen {{states that}} much of Angelou's poetry and most of her writings, {{especially}} [...] "Worker's Song", the first poem in I Shall Not Be Moved, praises the laborer. [...] He says, [...] "In Angelou's writings, rarely <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anyone</b> who does not work. [...] Everyone of her characters—singers, dancers, railway workers, etc.—works hard". [...] Critic Hazel Rochman, who calls the poem an [...] "exquisitely simple worksong", states that Angelou connects physical action with wit and longing. [...] She compares it to the performances of singer Paul Robeson and to Langston Hughes' poem [...] "Florida Road Workers". [...] Michele Howe calls I Shall Not Be Moved [...] "a collection that testifies to the undaunted spirit of oppressed people everywhere", and states that it [...] "relates a history of hard work, pain, joy, and the affection and heartbreak often associated with love". [...] She also mentions [...] "Worker's Song" [...] in her article in the New Jersey newspaper The Star-Ledger, stating that it describes the struggles of the workers that [...] "keep the whole world running".|$|E
2500|$|The Elijah {{of legend}} {{did not lose}} any {{of his ability to}} afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai is illustrative. Once, when walking a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man—the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, [...] "Peace be with thee, Rabbi." [...] Instead of {{returning}} the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, [...] "How ugly you are! <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anyone</b> as ugly as you in your town?" [...] Elijah responded with, [...] "I don’t know. Perhaps you should tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction." [...] The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.|$|E

Ay, sir, and he would have had her remaining money, had not her lawyer from the country prevented her disposing of it.

6000|$|Surely, {{when all}} is said, the {{ultimate}} objection to the English public school is its utterly blatant and indecent disregard of the duty of telling the truth. I know there does still linger among maiden ladies in remote country houses a notion that English schoolboys are taught to tell the truth, but it cannot be maintained seriously for a moment. Very occasionally, very vaguely, English schoolboys are told not to tell lies, which is a totally different thing. I may silently support all the obscene fictions and forgeries in the universe, without once telling a lie. I may wear another man's coat, steal another man's wit, apostatize to another man's creed, or poison another man's coffee, all without ever telling a lie. But no English school-boy is ever taught to tell the truth, for the very simple reason that he is never taught to desire the truth. From the very first he is taught to be totally careless about whether a fact is a fact; he is taught to care only whether the fact {{can be used on}} his [...] "side" [...] when he is engaged in [...] "playing the game." [...] He takes sides in his Union debating society to settle whether Charles I ought to have been killed, with the same solemn and pompous frivolity with which he takes sides in the cricket field to decide whether Rugby or Westminster shall win. He is never allowed to admit the abstract notion of the truth, that the match is a matter of what may happen, but that Charles I is a matter of what did happen--or did not. He is Liberal or Tory at the general election exactly as he is Oxford or Cambridge at the boat race. He knows that sport deals with the unknown; he has not even a notion that politics should deal with the known. If anyone really doubts this self-evident proposition, that the public schools definitely discourage the love of truth, there is one fact which I should think would settle him. England is the country of the Party System, and it has always been chiefly run by public-school men. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>anyone</b> out of Hanwell who will maintain that the Party System, whatever its conveniences or inconveniences, could have been created by people particularly fond of truth? ...|$|E
