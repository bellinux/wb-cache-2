5|$|In Afton village, NY41 {{connects to}} I-88 {{by way of}} an eastward {{extension}} of Maple Avenue. NY41 turns northwest at this junction, following Maple Avenue across the Susquehanna River and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village. Here, NY41 briefly overlaps with NY7 before exiting the village and heading northwestward through two more river valleys {{to the town of}} Coventry, where it meets NY206 in the hamlet of Coventryville.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Ranger Company entered {{action on}} 11 April, {{part of a}} tank-infantry task force {{conducting}} aggressive reconnaissance in a wide valley near the river. Encountering a village, the 3rd Platoon cleared the village and killed two Chinese stragglers. After the lead elements of the tank company and the 3rd Platoon had taken the Kantongyon village, the tank company commander wanted to move his company west <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley before continuing north. Captain and now Executive Officer, Bob Channon was near {{the rear of the}} company column. CO, Jess Tidwell, riding with the tank Co, called Channon on the radio and instructed him to come up and take control of the 1st and 2nd Platoons.|$|E
5|$|West of I-87, {{the route}} crosses the Blue Line of Catskill Park and becomes the Onteora Trail. Although still four lanes wide, the route {{is no longer}} a limited-access highway as it has an {{at-grade}} intersection with Modica Lane, a local dead-end street, just west of where it passes over the Thruway. Not long afterward, the highway meets US209 by way of a cloverleaf interchange. Past US209, the highway enters a rural area as it heads northwest <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state park.|$|E
30|$|Tubers, fruits, bulbs, and corms, for 30 {{different}} host plants, were inoculated {{with each}} of the 10 tested bacterial isolates. Equal slices of each tested plant material were inoculated with 0.5 [*]ml of each isolate at a rate of 108 [*]CFU[*]ml− 1 by pipetting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> each of five slices. For the control, sterilized water was pipetted as well <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> five slices. Disease rating, as explained, was measured following all treatment incubation at 30 [*]°C for a 4 -day period.|$|R

5|$|Garista, the {{strategist}} for the Niren Corps, attempts to dissuade Niren {{but to no}} avail. The investigation in the fortress {{turns out to be}} more dangerous as the aer begins to turn the fortress into a living weapon to attack the knights. The knights make their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortress, where a giant blastia is found to be using the aer. Niren uses the device given by Rita to stifle the gushing of aer, but a backlash is caused by the sudden ceasing of aer flow, and the blastia explodes, destroying the barrier blastia that keeps Shizontonia safe, knocking out Chastel, and causing the fortress to begin to crumble. As Niren attempts to carry Chastel to safety, the floor beneath him crumbles. Niren is able to throw Chastel to Yuri and is stranded in a sinkhole of gushing aer. Despite Yuri's attempts to save him, due to a wound he received during the investigation, Niren is unable to pull himself to safety. Leaving his blastia with Yuri, Niren has the knights leave without him.|$|E
5|$|In Fairport, NY250 follows South Main Street down a large {{hill that}} levels {{off at the}} {{southern}} edge of the village's business district. Here, NY250 intersects Church Street (NY31F) and passes by the First Baptist Church of Fairport, located on the northwestern corner of the junction. The route continues north <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village, passing by several small businesses and Fairport Village Landing—the largest shopping plaza in the village—before crossing over the Erie Canal by way of a lift bridge and becoming North Main Street. Once {{on the north side of}} the canal, NY250 crosses the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester and West Shore Subdivisions at a single grade crossing ahead of High Street. At this point, the businesses give way to homes as the highway ascends a hill at the north end of the village and meets Whitney Road at the northern village line.|$|E
5|$|For three days, {{beginning}} on September 26, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed planes into the hurricane {{as part of}} Project Stormfury, the fourth hurricane {{to be a part}} of the weather control experiment. The plane dropped silver iodide <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane, although there was no effect due to Ginger's large eye and diffuse nature; this was the last seeding done by the project. By September 28, Ginger was moving northwestward toward North Carolina and was steadily intensifying. At around 06:00 UTC the next day, the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h), which it maintained for about 18 hours. Afterward, Ginger slowly weakened, and late on September 30 it made landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). It quickly deteriorated over land, weakening first to a tropical storm and then to a tropical depression by late on October 1. Ginger turned to the north, entered southern Virginia, and later turned to the east. On October 3, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while crossing Hampton Roads into the Atlantic Ocean. The remnants of Ginger continued east-southeastward until being absorbed by a cold front on October 5.|$|E

25|$|Participants in the {{memorial}} service paddle out to a suitable location with flower leis around their necks or with loose flowers (sometimes held between their teeth). The participants then get into a circular formation, hold hands, and silently pray. Sometimes they will raise their clasped hands skyward before tossing their flowers or leis <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring. Afterward, they paddle back toward the beach to begin their surf session. Often these services take place at sunrise or sunset. In locations with a pier, such as Huntington Beach, Orange County, California, the service can take place {{near the end of}} the pier so that any non-surfers, such as elderly relatives, can watch and participate. Often the participants on the pier will throw down bouquets of flowers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring.|$|E
25|$|By May 21, 2008, Iraqi Army Units {{had secured}} or {{captured}} all of Sadr City, receiving little resistance as the 10,000 man force backed by tanks rolled past barricades and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city.

25|$|About 54 {{globular}} clusters {{have been identified}} in this galaxy, but the actual number may be 122 or more. The confirmed clusters may be several billion years younger than {{globular clusters}} in the Milky Way, and cluster formation appears to have increased during the past 100 million years. This increase is correlated with an inflow of gas <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galaxy.

25|$|Electron guns facing ring axis. These shoot {{electrons}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring structure. Once inside, {{the electrons}} are confined by the magnetic fields. This has been measured in polywells using Langmuir probes. Electrons that have {{enough energy to}} escape through the magnetic cusps can be re-attracted to the positive rings. They can slow down {{and return to the}} inside of the rings along the cusps. This reduces conduction losses, and improves the overall performance of the machine. The electrons act as a negative voltage drop attracting positive ions. This is a virtual cathode.|$|E
25|$|Broad Street Station was {{the first}} of the great {{passenger}} stations built by the PRR. Opened in 1881, the station was expanded in the early 1890s by famed Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. For most of its existence it was with City Hall one of the crown jewels of Philadelphia's architecture, and until a 1923 fire had the largest train shed in the world (a 91 m span). It was the terminal for the PRR in Philadelphia, bringing trains <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. It was demolished in 1953 after the PRR moved to 30th Street Station.|$|E

25|$|North of Town Line Road, NY269 crosses {{into the}} towns of Somerset and Yates, where it {{initially}} continues across more rural terrain.
