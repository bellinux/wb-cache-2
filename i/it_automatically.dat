5|$|For team matches, bots {{are used}} to fill {{the roles of the}} player's teammates. The player can choose the bots' skill level or have <b>it</b> <b>automatically</b> adjust to the player's performance. Bots can be further {{customized}} by changing attributes such as names, appearance, and weapon preferences. In team matches, players can give orders to bots on their team. The PC version supports multiplayer mode over the internet or a local area network (the original Unreal was mainly a single-player game).|$|E
5|$|The player {{character}} {{is equipped with}} an energy shield which nullifies damage from weapons fire and forceful impacts. The shield's charge appears as a blue bar {{in the corner of}} the game's heads-up display, and <b>it</b> <b>automatically</b> recharges if no damage is sustained for a brief period. When the shield is fully depleted, the player is highly vulnerable, and further damage reduces the hit points of a secondary health meter. When this health meter reaches zero, the character dies and the game reloads from a saved checkpoint. Health can be replenished through the collection of health packs scattered around the game's levels, but the game's introduction of a regenerating shield mechanic represented a departure from FPS games of the time.|$|E
5|$|Completing {{objectives}} and defeating enemies is rewarded with experience points, {{which are used}} to unlock or upgrade existing disciplines and improve each characters' statistics, such as strength or agility. Weapons, armor, and other accessories can be purchased or upgraded using money or valuable items, which are collected throughout the game. The character's inventory is grid-based; objects occupy an allotted amount of space, requiring {{the management of the}} storage space available. A belt allows some items to be selected for immediate use during gameplay, such as healing items, without the need to access them in the main inventory. The first version of the game allows progress to be saved only in the main character's haven or safehouse; <b>it</b> <b>automatically</b> saves other data at specific points. An update to the game enabled players to save their in-game data at any point in the in-game narrative.|$|E

5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that fights malicious software (malware), including computer viruses, spyware, Trojan horses and rootkits. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, {{and the free}} Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 only protected users from adware and spyware. <b>It</b> <b>automatically</b> checks for and downloads the virus definitions it relies on from Microsoft Update, a web-based software service updated three times a day. Users may alternatively download the updates manually from the Microsoft Security Portal website. On 30 September 2011, a faulty definition update caused the product to incorrectly tag Google Chrome as malware. The issue was resolved within three hours. MSE originally ran on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, although versions 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP and Microsoft stopped producing definition updates for Windows XP on 14 July 2015.|$|E
5|$|Players can add non-Steam {{games to}} their libraries, {{allowing}} {{the game to}} be easily accessed from the Steam client and providing support where possible for Steam Overlay features. The Steam interface allows for user-defined shortcuts to be added. In this way, third-party modifications and games not purchased through the Steam Store can use Steam features. Valve sponsors and distributes some modifications free-of-charge; and modifications that use Steamworks can also use VAC, Friends, the server browser, and any Steam features supported by their parent game. For most games launched from Steam, the client provides an in-game overlay that can be accessed by a keystroke. From the overlay, the user can access his or her Steam Community lists and participate in chat, manage selected Steam settings, and access a built-in web browser without having to exit the game. Since the beginning of February 2011 as a beta version, the overlay also allows players to take screenshots of the games in process; <b>it</b> <b>automatically</b> stores these and allows the player to review, delete, or share them during or after his or her game session. As a full version on February 24, 2011, this feature was reimplemented so that users could share screenshots on websites of Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit straight from a user's screenshot manager.|$|E

25|$|Another {{tool that}} generates full {{reaction}} networks from {{a set of}} rules is the Allosteric Network Compiler (ANC). Conceptually, ANC sees molecules as allosteric devices with a Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) type regulation mechanism, whose interactions are governed by their internal state, as well as by external modifications. A very useful feature of ANC is that <b>it</b> <b>automatically</b> computes dependent parameters, thereby imposing thermodynamic correctness.|$|E
25|$|One {{practical}} {{implication of}} explicitly declaring {{the state to}} be a republic in 1949 was that <b>it</b> <b>automatically</b> terminated the state's membership of the British Commonwealth, {{in accordance with the}} rules in operation at the time. However, despite this, the United Kingdom legislated that Irish citizens would retain similar rights to Commonwealth subjects and were not to be regarded as foreigners.|$|E

25|$|Wajib As-salat are compulsory, {{non-performance}} {{of which}} renders one a sinner. However, {{the evidence of}} the obligation is open to interpretation, with some of the madhab saying it is obligatory while others saying it is optional. To deny that a fard salah is obligatory is an act of disbelief while denying the obligation of a wajib salat is not disbelief. There are some who believe that as the 5 prayers are obligatory, <b>it</b> <b>automatically</b> renders all other prayers optional.|$|E
25|$|In Germany {{and some}} other European countries, the {{pneumatic}} two-tone (hi-lo) siren consists of two sets of air horns, one high pitched and the other low pitched. An air compressor blows the air into one set of horns, and then <b>it</b> <b>automatically</b> switches to the other set. As this back and forth switching occurs, the sound changes tones. Its sound power varies, but could get as high as approximately 125dB, depending on the compressor and the horns. Comparing with the mechanical sirens, it uses much less electricity but needs more maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Indian {{authorities}} say that Nehru's telegrams and speeches have no legal importance, nor it is compulsory to apply {{them as they}} were never passed by the Parliament of India. The white paper on Kashmir also {{does not have any}} legal importance as it was published in 1948 while the Constitution of India came into force into 1950 and defined Kashmir {{as an integral part of}} India as well as protecting the 'unity and integrity' of India. Constitution of India doesn't has any provision for plebiscite and 1948 white paper was against Constitution of India so <b>it</b> <b>automatically</b> got abolished.|$|E
