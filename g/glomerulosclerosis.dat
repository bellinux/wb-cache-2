5|$|Mortality under captivity is {{generally}} high; reasons include stillbirths, birth defects, cannibalism, hypothermia, neglect of cubs by mothers, and infectious diseases. A study comparing {{the health of}} captive and wild cheetahs noted that despite having similar genetic make-up, wild cheetahs are far healthier than their captive counterparts. The study identified possible stress factors such as restricted habitat and interaction with human beings and other carnivores, and recommended private and spacious areas for captive cheetahs. A study of diseases suffered by captive cheetahs in the period 1989â€“92 in several North American zoos showed that hepatic veno-occlusive disease, a disease of the liver, had affected 82% of the deceased cheetahs, caused nine deaths, and occurred in 51% of living females. Chronic gastritis was detected in 91% of the population. <b>Glomerulosclerosis,</b> a disease of the kidneys, emerged as another significant disease, affecting 84% of the cheetahs; another renal disease, nephrosclerosis, affected 39% of the cheetahs. Feline infectious peritonitis caused two deaths. Pneumonia was a major cause for juvenile deaths. Another study concluded that excess of vitaminA in their diets could result in veno-occlusive disease in their livers.|$|E

25|$|Kidney tests {{revealed}} that {{nine of the}} ten steroid users developed a condition called focal segmental <b>glomerulosclerosis,</b> a type of scarring within the kidneys. The kidney damage in the bodybuilders has similarities to that seen in morbidly obese patients, but appears {{to be even more}} severe.|$|E
25|$|The atherosclerotic, hypertension-related {{vascular}} lesions in {{the kidney}} primarily affect the preglomerular arterioles, resulting in ischemic {{changes in the}} glomeruli and postglomerular structures. Glomerular injury {{may also be a}} consequence of direct damage to the glomerular capillaries due to glomerular hyperperfusion. Glomerular pathology progresses to <b>glomerulosclerosis,</b> and eventually the renal tubules may also become ischemic and gradually atrophic. The renal lesion associated with malignant hypertension consists of fibrinoid necrosis of the afferent arterioles, sometimes extending into the glomerulus, and may result in focal necrosis of the glomerular tuft.|$|E

2500|$|CRISPR can be {{utilized}} to create human cellular models of disease. For instance, applied to human {{pluripotent stem cells}} CRISPR introduced targeted mutations in genes relevant to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and focal segmental <b>glomerulosclerosis</b> (FSGS). These CRISPR-modified pluripotent stem cells were subsequently grown into human kidney organoids that exhibited disease-specific phenotypes. Kidney organoids from stem cells with PKD mutations formed large, translucent cyst structures from kidney tubules. The cysts were capable of reaching macroscopic dimensions, up to one centimeter in diameter. Kidney organoids with mutations in a gene linked to FSGS developed junctional defects between podocytes, the filtering cells affected in that disease. This was traced to the inability of podocytes ability to form microvilli between adjacent cells. [...] Importantly, these disease phenotypes were absent in control organoids of identical genetic background, but lacking the CRISPR modifications.|$|E
50|$|Proteinuria (large {{amounts of}} protein in urine) {{is one of}} the signs of <b>glomerulosclerosis.</b> Scarring {{disturbs}} the filtering process of the kidneys and allows protein to leak from the blood into urine. However, <b>glomerulosclerosis</b> is one of many causes of proteinuria. A kidney biopsy (removal of tiny part of kidney with a needle) may be necessary to determine whether a patient has <b>glomerulosclerosis</b> or another kidney problem. About 15 percent of people with proteinuria turn out to have <b>glomerulosclerosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Both {{children}} and adults can develop <b>glomerulosclerosis</b> and it can result from different types of kidney conditions. One frequently encountered type of <b>glomerulosclerosis</b> is caused by diabetes. Drug use or infections may cause focal segmental <b>glomerulosclerosis</b> (FSGS), a very chronic kidney condition. FSGS may also occur in patients with AIDS but most are of unknown cause.|$|E
