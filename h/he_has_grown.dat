5|$|Gandhi's London {{lifestyle}} {{incorporated the}} values <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> up with. When {{he returned to}} India in 1891, his outlook was parochial {{and he could not}} make a living as a lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to this problem and developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough {{and they had to}} include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was surprised when he saw the additions, because he originally thought they were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> to like them.|$|E

He summons Athena, who states that if Kratos {{performs}} one final act—the murder of Ares—he will be forgiven for killing his family. Ares is waging war on the city of Athens out of hatred and jealousy of his sister Athena, who assigns Kratos to destroy Ares because Zeus has forbidden divine intervention. Athena guides Kratos to the war-torn Athens.

Overworked and underpaid, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> jaded with the {{profession}} and has trouble connecting with his parishioners. During confession, a mysterious and unnamed prostitute (Kristin Chenoweth) confesses to a sin she has not yet committed: she plans to commit suicide on her birthday. Father John is taken aback. The confession ends abruptly, and {{he is unable to}} stop the woman before she disappears. He only knows she wears a crucifix and is an Aries, which means her birthday is soon.

6000|$|The judge, an untidy old man {{of great}} ability and probity, was in his seat, looking out absently over the spectators. [...] "The next case" [...] to him was only a case. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> gray in dealing with infractions of the law, and though kindly {{disposed}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> indifferent--use <b>had</b> dulled his sympathies. His beard, yellow with tobacco stain, was still venerable, and his voice, deep and melodious, was impressive and commanding.|$|R
25|$|Knuckles is a 16-23 year-old red {{anthropomorphic}} echidna, {{the only}} living descendant of a well-established clan of echidnas. For many years, his clan guarded a giant gemstone called the Master Emerald, which controls the Chaos Emeralds, objects {{central to the}} Sonic the Hedgehog game series. As such, Knuckles {{has spent most of}} his life atop a floating island called Angel Island, guarding the Emerald from harm. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> up fairly introverted as a result.|$|E
25|$|When {{analyzing}} these 12 lines, Sethna {{suggests that}} the lovely boy is becoming substantially older in years with out losing any beauty; in fact he is increasing with beauty: <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> by waning, he has turned more boyishly lovely as the span of his life lessens further and further. Sethna believes that the boy's lack of aging underscores Shakespeare's aging, and Shakespeare's aging highlight's nature's ability to ignore Time in the boy's case. This is emphasized by Nature's capacity to foil Time's destructiveness. Nonetheless, the capacity can only last so long.|$|E
25|$|Roderick tells Dongalor he {{has found}} no weapons in the castle, but says <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>grown</b> fond of the peasant girl and taking her with him, despite Dongalor’s protests.

60|$|Mary {{looked up}} with some roguishness at Fred, and that look of hers was very dear to him, though the eyes {{were nothing more than}} clear windows where {{observation}} sat laughingly. He was certainly an affectionate fellow, and as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> from boy to man, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>grown</b> in love with his old playmate, notwithstanding that share in the higher education of the country which had exalted his views of rank and income.|$|R
