5|$|Although {{it appears}} that the Council of Chelsea {{approved}} Lichfield's elevation to an archdiocese, Hygeberht, who was present, remained a bishop at its conclusion; he signed the council's report still as a bishop. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that he played any significant part in the council nor in the actions that led to him becoming an archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Although many of {{the coins}} bear {{the name of a}} moneyer, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> of the mint where each coin was struck. As a result, the number and {{location}} of mints used by Offa is uncertain. Current opinion is that there were four mints, in Canterbury, Rochester, East Anglia and London.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} Copperhead is unclear. The visit was {{reported}} up the German chain of command, and some double agents later received {{requests for information}} about Montgomery's movements. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that Montgomery's appearance affected German views of the imminent invasion threat. Writing in 2011, historian Joshua Levine attributes this {{to the fact that}} the deception was carried out ten days before D-Day, arguing that there would be no reason for a flying visit to North Africa to preclude an imminent invasion.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{the fleet}} sent by Darius {{consisted}} of 600 triremes. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> {{in the historical}} sources of how many transport ships accompanied them, if any. Herodotus claimed that 3,000 transport ships accompanied 1,207 triremes during Xerxes's invasion in 480 BC. Among modern historians, some have accepted this number of ships as reasonable; {{it has been suggested}} either that the number 600 represents the combined number of triremes and transport ships, or that there were horse transports in addition to 600 triremes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his Thracian campaign, Philip moved {{against the}} city of Perinthos, {{formerly}} his ally. Diodorus says that this was because the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that this was the case. One possible explanation is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it. Either way, since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.|$|E

5|$|From the 12th century on, the {{crossbow}} (called , tzangra in Greek) {{became increasingly}} important in Mediterranean warfare, remaining the most deadly weapon available until {{the advent of}} fully rigged ships with gunpowder artillery. The Byzantines made infrequent use of the weapon, chiefly in sieges, although its use is recorded in some sea battles. Cannons were introduced {{in the latter half}} of the 14th century, but they were rarely used by the Byzantines, who only had a few artillery pieces for the defence of the land walls of Constantinople. Unlike the Venetians and Genoese, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that the Byzantines ever mounted any on ships.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{this was}} true, {{but at the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E
5|$|The Zurich council {{decided that}} no {{compromise}} was possible. On 7 March 1526 it released the notorious mandate {{that no one}} shall rebaptise another under the penalty of death. Although Zwingli, technically, {{had nothing to do}} with the mandate, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that he disapproved. Felix Manz, who had sworn to leave Zurich and not to baptise any more, had deliberately returned and continued the practice. After he was arrested and tried, he was executed on 5 January 1527 by being drowned in the Limmat. He was the first Anabaptist martyr; three more were to follow, after which all others either fled or were expelled from Zurich.|$|E

5|$|Under the new constitution, {{the voters}} chose electors who then elected the {{governor}} {{and members of the}} Kentucky Senate. Though there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that Shelby actively sought the office of governor, he was elected unanimously to that post by the electors on May 17, 1791. He took office on June 4, 1792, the day the state was admitted to the Union. Though not actively partisan, he identified with the Democratic-Republicans. Much of his term was devoted to establishing basic laws, military divisions and a tax structure.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such {{a small percentage of the}} electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference in the opinion of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in the world, with a high population growth rate of 2.5%per year and nearly 70% of the population living in poverty. The country is also burdened with high levels of debt and limited resources. These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts, even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN/SSC as a critical primate region for over 20years. Due to its relatively small land area—587,045km2 (226,659sq mi)—compared to other high-priority biodiversity regions and its high levels of endemism, the country {{is considered one of the}} world's most important biodiversity hotspots, with lemur conservation being a high priority. Despite the added emphasis for conservation, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that the extinctions that began with the arrival of humans have come to an end.|$|E

5|$|Planned by the London Controlling Section, Ironside was {{communicated to}} the Germans via double agents between May and June 1944. Unlike other Bodyguard deceptions, the plan was put across entirely by double agents without support by {{physical}} deception. Agent Bronx took the lead with support from Tate, Rudloff and Garbo. Ironside's story included an initial two-division assault, using Overlord formations, staged out of the United Kingdom. This would then be followed up with six divisions sailing from {{the east coast of}} the United States. Historians disagree on the impact of Ironside on German plans. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that the operation was successful in convincing the Germans of imminent Allied plans to invade the Bay of Biscay. On the other hand, Allied planners attributed the delay of a panzer division moving to Normandy in part to the deception.|$|E
5|$|Slow-swimming but active, the blackmouth {{catshark}} is a generalist that preys {{on a wide}} variety of crustaceans, cephalopods, and fishes. Its visual and electroreceptive systems are adept at tracking moving, bioluminescent prey. This species is oviparous, with females producing batches of up to 13 egg cases throughout the year. Because of its abundance, the {{blackmouth catshark}} forms a substantial part of the bycatch of deepwater commercial fisheries across much of its range. It has low economic value and is usually discarded, though the largest sharks may be marketed for meat and leather. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that its numbers have declined despite fishing pressure.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> of {{feathering}} on {{the upper}} neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E

5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank into the mud, which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink into the mud or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Bows of {{any kind}} seldom survive in the archaeological record. Composite bows may have been invented first by the nomads of the Asiatic steppe, who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian {{laminated}} bows. However, archaeological investigation of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy; literary records {{of any kind}} are late and scanty and seldom mention details of bows. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100–1700 BCE, but the bow that shot them has not survived. Other sites of the Sintashta culture have produced finds of horn and bone, interpreted as furniture (grips, arrow rests, bow ends, string loops) of bows; there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that the bending parts of these bows included anything other than wood. These finds are associated with short arrows, 50–70cm long, and the bows themselves may have been correspondingly short. The Andronovo Culture, descendant of the Sintashta culture, {{was the first to}} extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan, and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo-Aryan migration. It has been suggested that the Srubna culture (contemporaneous with, and a neighbour to, the Andronovo culture) used composite bows, but no archaeological evidence is known.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1976 the {{military}} command structure was simple and direct. Major General Samantar {{was not only}} commander of the National Army – and therefore commander of the organizationally subordinated navy and air force- but also {{secretary of state for}} defence and a vice president of SRC and thus a member of the major decision-making body of the government. Holding the two highest.. posts, he stood alone in the command structure between the army and President Siad, the head of state. When in July 1976 the SRC relinquished its power to the newly appointed SSRP, Samantar retained the portfolio of the Ministry of Defense. The country's real power appeared to be in the SSRP's Politburo, of which Samantar became a vice president. Before {{the military}} coup, command channels ran directly from the commander of the National Army to army sector commanders who exercised authority over military forces.. in the field, and by 1986 combat units had been reorganized along Soviet lines. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>indication</b> that either the chain of command to lower echelons or the organisation of combat units has changed significantly since the coup.|$|E
