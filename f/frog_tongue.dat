The present communication deals with the conditions in frog skin. The capillaries of the <b>frog</b> <b>tongue,</b> web, and mesentery have become classical objects of study while those of {{the skin of the}} body are employed but seldom. Yet in some species the skin offers opportunities beyond those of any of the stmc. tures mentioned. To watch tongue and mesentery they must of necessity be exposed and pinned out, subjected to more or less trauma, and kept wet with a drip, which differs from frog lymph (3). In the web two skin layers come together with result in complicated vascular pictures, and the circulation is far more frequently irregular than over the body.

40|$|Morphological {{changes of}} oral cavity during {{metamorphosis}} with special {{reference to the}} taste organ were examined in Ezo salamanders (Hynobius retardatus) and axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum), and compared with those in bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana). The non-distensible tongue of salamanders changed the structure progressively during metamorphosis: a small area of the rostrum protruded and developed caudally with recession of the flat area of the tongue. The protrusion that developed on the tongue had numerous papillae, {{as seen in the}} <b>frog</b> <b>tongue.</b> The apical region of the papillae occasionally had a cell mass similar to the taste disk of frogs (termed a taste disk-like cell mass). On the flat area of the tongue, the barrel-shaped taste buds of larval salamanders were transformed into taste buds with a wider receptor area. The barrel-shaped taste buds decreased progressively during metamorphosis, while taste disk-like cell masses increased. Neuronal labeling with an antibody to neuron-specific enolase and fluorescent carbocyanine dye showed that the taste disk-like cell masses in metamorphosed salamanders were innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (nerve IX). Nerve IX responded to taste stimulation as well as mechanical stimulation applied to the rostral tongue. During metamorphosis the salamanders undergo transformation and rearrangement of taste organs on the tongue possibly as an adaptation to the terrestrial environment. Chem.

40|$|Frogs (Lissamphibia: Anura) use {{adhesive}} tongues {{to capture}} fast moving, elusive prey. For this, the tongues are moved quickly and adhere instantaneously to various prey surfaces. Recently, the functional morphology of <b>frog</b> <b>tongues</b> was discussed in {{context of their}} adhesive performance. It was suggested that {{the interaction between the}} tongue surface and the mucus coating is important for generating strong pull-off forces. However, despite the general notions about its importance for a successful contact with the prey, {{little is known about the}} surface structure of <b>frog</b> <b>tongues.</b> Previous studies focused almost exclusively on species within the Ranidae and Bufonidae, neglecting the wide diversity of frogs. Here we examined the tongue surface in nine different frog species, comprising eight different taxa, i. e., the Alytidae, Bombinatoridae, Megophryidae, Hylidae, Ceratophryidae, Ranidae, Bufonidae, and Dendrobatidae. In all species examined herein, we found fungiform and filiform papillae on the tongue surface. Further, we observed a high degree of variation among <b>tongues</b> in different <b>frogs.</b> These differences can be seen in the size and shape of the papillae, in the fine-structures on the papillae, as well as in the three-dimensional organization of subsurface tissues. Notably, the fine-structures on the filiform papillae in frogs comprise hair-like protrusions (Megophryidae and Ranidae), microridges (Bufonidae and Dendrobatidae), or can be irregularly shaped or absent as observed in the remaining taxa examined herein. Some of this variation might be related to different degrees of adhesive performance and may point to differences in the spectra of prey items between frog taxa...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the tongue shape for /s/ and /&# 8747;/ sounds {{in three different}} groups of children with and without speech sound disorder.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{possible}} {{interaction among}} different sensory {{units in the}} <b>frog</b> <b>tongue</b> was studied using several single papillae dually innervated by the medial and lateral branches of the glossopharyngeal (IXth) nerve. The afferent activity in one branch exposed to NaCI stimulation of the papilla revealed marked inhibition after antidromic electrical stimulation (100 Hz, 30 s, and 3 V) of the other branch. The degree of inhibition depended {{on the number of}} sensory responses observed in the electrically stimulated branch as well as the nature of the stimulated sensory units. Statistical analysis suggested that antidromic activation of gustatory units conducting the responses to NaC 1 and quinine and slowly adapting mechanosensitive units produced a large antidromic inhibition amounting to 19 - 25 %, but that of gustatory units conducting the responses to acetic acid and rapidly adapting mechanosensitive units gave rise to only a slight inhibition. To examine the differential effects of these sensory units in antidromic inhibition, antidromic impulses were evoked by chemical stimulation of the adjacent papilla neuronally connected with the dually innervated papilla under study. Antidromic volleys of impulses elicited by NaCI or quinine stimulation produced a large inhibition of the afferent activity in the other branch, as induced by NaC 1 stimulation of the dually innervated papilla. Plausible mechanisms of synaptic interaction in peripheral gustatory systems are considered...|$|E
40|$|When the {{velocity}} of capillary blood flow in the <b>frog</b> <b>tongue</b> declined to an intermediate range of 0. 2 – 0. 7 mm/s, the glosso-pharyngeal nerve stimulation induced a biphasic slow depolarizing and slow hyperpolarizing potential (HP) in taste cells. The objective of this work {{was to examine the}} generative mechanisms of the biphasic slow potentials. The biphasic slow response was always preceded by a slow depolarizing potential (DP) component and followed by a slow HP component. Intravenous injection of tubocurarine completely blocked the biphasic slow responses, suggesting that both components of the biphasic slow potentials are evoked by the parasympathetic nerve (PSN) fibers. Membrane conductance of taste cells increased during slow DPs and decreased during slow HPs. The reversal potential of either component of a biphasic slow response was the almost same value of 12 mV. An antagonist, L- 703, 606, for neurotransmitter substance P neurokinin 1 receptor completely blocked both components of the biphasic slow responses. An antagonist, flufenamic acid, for nonselective cation channels on the taste cell membrane completely blocked the biphasic slow responses. These results suggest that PSN-induced biphasic slow responses are postsynaptically elicited in taste cells by releasing substance P at the PSN axon terminals. It is concluded that the slow DP componentmay be generated by opening one type of nonselective cation channel on taste cells and that the slowHP component may be generated by closing the other type of nonselective cation channel. We discussed that a second messenger inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate might be related to a slow DP component and another second messenger diacylglycerol might be relate...|$|E
40|$|While {{retaining}} {{a feeding}} apparatus that is surprisingly conservative morphologically, frogs {{as a group}} exhibit great variability in the biomechanics of tongue protraction during prey capture, {{which in turn is}} related to di¡erences in neuromuscular control. In this paper, I address the following three questions. (1) How do <b>frog</b> <b>tongues</b> di¡er biomechanically? (2) What anatomical and physiological di¡erences are responsible? (3) How is biomechanics related to mechanisms of neuromuscular control? Frog species use three non-exclusive mechanisms to protract their tongues during feeding: (i) mechanical pulling, in which the tongue shortens as its muscles contract during protraction; (ii) inertial elongation, in which the tongue lengthens under inertial and muscular loading; and (iii) hydrostatic elongation, in which the tongue lengthens under constraints imposed by the constant volume of a muscular hydrostat. Major di¡erences among these functional types include (i) the amount and orientation of collagen ¢bres associated with the tongue muscles and the mechanical properties that this connective tissue confers to the tongue as a whole; and (ii) the transfer of inertia from the opening jaws to the tongue, which probably involves a catch mechanism that increases the acceleration achieved during mouth opening. The mechanisms of tongue protraction di¡er in the types of neural mechanisms that are used to control tongue movements, particularly in the relative importance of feed-forward versus feedback control, in requirements for precise interjoint coordination, in the size and number of motor units, and in the a¡erent pathways that are involved in coordinating tongue and jaw movements. Evolution of biomechanics and neuromuscular control of <b>frog</b> <b>tongues</b> provides an example in which neuromuscular control is ¢nely tuned to the biomechanical constraints and opportunities provided by di¡erences in morphological design among species...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{anatomical}} properties of parasympathetic postganglionic neurons in the <b>frog</b> <b>tongue</b> and their modulatory effects on taste cell responses. Most of the parasympathetic ganglion cell {{bodies in the}} tongue were found in extremely small nerve bundles running near the fungiform papillae, which originate from the lingual branches of the glossopharyngeal (GP) nerve. The density of parasympathetic postganglionic neurons in the tongue was 8000 – 11, 000 /mm 3 of the extremely small nerve bundle. Themeanmajor axis of parasympathetic ganglion cell bodies was 21 lm, and themean length of parasympathetic postganglionic neurons was 1. 45 mm. Electrical stimulation at 30 Hz of either the GP nerve or the papillary nerve produced slow hyperpolarizing potentials (HPs) in taste cells. After nicotinic acetyl choline receptors on the parasympathetic ganglion cells in the tongue had been blocked by intravenous (i. v.) injection of D-tubocurarine (1 mg/kg), stimulation of the GP nerve did not induce any slow HPs in taste cells but that of the papillary nerve did. A further i. v. injection of a substance P NK- 1 antagonist, L- 703, 606, blocked the slow HPs induced by the papillary nerve stimulation. This suggests that the parasympathetic postganglionic efferent fibers innervate taste cells and are related to a generation of the slow HPs and that substance P is released from the parasympathetic postganglionic axon terminals. When the resting membrane potential of a taste cell was hyperpolarized by a prolonged slow HP, the gustatory receptor potentials for NaCl and sugar stimuli were enhanced in amplitude, but those for quinine-HCl and acetic acid stimuli remained unchanged.

(b) The responses to hydrophilic L-amino acids (glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, L- threonine, L-cysteine, and L-proline) were of a tonic type, but those to hydrophobic L-amino acids (L-valine, L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L- methionine, L-phenylalanine, and L-tyrptophan) were usually composed of both phasic and tonic components. (c) The properties of the tonic component were quite {{different from those of the}} phasic component: the tonic component was largely enhanced by the alkaline treatment and suppressed by the acidic treatment that increases binding of Ca 2 + to the tissue. Also, the tonic component was suppressed by the presence of low concentrations of salts, or the action of pronase E, whereas the phasic component was unchanged under these conditions. These properties of the phasic component were quite similar to those of the response to hydrophobic substances such as quinine. These results suggest that the hydrophilic L-amino acids stimulate receptor protein(s) and that the hydrophobic L-amino acids stimulate both the receptor protein and a receptor site similar to that for quinine.

50|$|The muscles used in {{elongation}} and shortening maintain support {{through the}} constant volume principle and their antagonistic relationships with each other.

Extra-oral tongues show higher length/width ratios than intra-oral tongues, allowing for a greater increase in length (more than 100% of resting length, as compared to intra-oral tongues at only about 50% of resting length increase). Greater elongation lengths trade off with the force produced by the organ; as the length/width ratio is increased elongation increases while force is decreased.

5000|$|Chameleons, {{frogs and}} some lungless {{salamanders}} have tongues that {{act like a}} tethered projectile.

Lungless salamanders use a similar method, however, both the tongue and underlying hyoid bone project (in contrast to chameleons, whose hyoid remains fixed while the fleshy portion of the tongue projects). [...] In both salamanders and chameleons, the movement is too fast and requires too much mechanical power for muscle alone to provide - instead, muscles slowly pre-load elastic elements such as connective tissue, which can then recoil and release the stored energy at a much higher rate. [...] In order to retract their tongues over such great distances, the tongue muscles of chameleons have perforated Z-disks, allowing each sarcomere to shorten far greater distances than those of other vertebrates.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityPreliminary {{observations}} {{were made on}} the reactions of the cellular and vascular elements of the retrolingual membrane of the <b>frog's</b> <b>tongue</b> to stimulation by certain foreign particles. The technique of Pratt and Reid (1930) was used in preparing the membrane. Microscopic drops of irritants, croton oil and turpentine, and a non-irritant, cedar oil, were applied from a micropipette, using the Emerson micro-manipulator, to the different experimental membranes. Non-irritating substances, neutral red, trypan blue, and India ink were injected into the abdominal cavity of frogs in successive experiments. Responses {{to each of the}} substances were compared with the condition in the normal membrane. The ciliated epithelium responded to all stimulation except the neutral red. Vacuoles of trypan blue were found in these cells. There vrere many carbon granules in the membranes of frogs treated with India ink. Both the cedar oil and croton oil were lifted from the membrane by the ciliated epithelial cells, with cilia beating. There was no evidence of phagocytosis of the cedar oil, but pink vacuoles appeared in the ciliated cells of the croton oil preparation. When croton oil with Sudan III was placed on the membranes of frogs previously injected with trypan blue, epithelial cells with active cilia and large blue vacuoles removed the drop from the surface and phagocytized some of the oil. Phagocytosis of the dye did not incapacitate these cells for further ingestion of foreign particles. Other substances should be used experimentally {{to determine the extent of}} the power of phagocytosis by the epithelial cells of the retrolingual membrane of the frog. Histiocytes phagocytized neutral red and India ink. Their only response to irritants was migration toward the substance. Leucocytes phagocytized India ink. They responded to irritants by migrating from the blood stream into the tissues, but showed no evidence of phagocytizing the irritant. Further study should be made in regard to the materials phagocytized by each one of these cells. There were no vascular changes in the membranes when non-irritating substances were used. Irritating substances stimulated blood vessels changes which followed the basic pattern of inflammation. A greater number of capillaries opened at the site of irritation; dilation of the small blood vessels occurred; the permeability of the endothelium was increased, as demonstrated by stasis and the migration of leucocytes from the blood vessels...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Based on {{studies of}} a few model taxa, {{amphibians}} have been consid-ered stereotyped in their feeding movements relative to other vertebrates. How-ever, recent studies {{on a wide variety}} of amphibian species have revealed great diversity in feeding mechanics and kinematics, and illustrate that stereotypy is the exception rather than the rule in amphibian feeding. Apparent stereotypy in some taxa may be an artifact of unnatural laboratory conditions. The common ancestor of lissamphibians was probably capable of some modulation of feeding movements, and descendants have evolved along two trajectories with regard to motor control: (1) an increase in modulation via feedback or feed-forward mechanisms, as ex-emplified by ballistic-tongued plethodontid salamanders and hydrostatic-tongued frogs, and (2) a decrease in variation dictated by biomechanics that require tight coordination between different body parts, such as the tongue and jaws in toads and other <b>frogs</b> with ballistic <b>tongue</b> projection. Multi-joint coordination of rapid movements may hamper accurate tongue placement in ballistic-tongued frogs as compared to both short-tongued frogs and ballistic tongued-salamanders that face simpler motor control tasks. Decoupling of tongue and jaw movements is associated with increased accuracy in both hydrostatic-tongued frogs and ballistic-tongued salamanders...|$|R
5|$|Frogs have maxillary teeth {{along their}} upper jaw {{which are used}} to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. The tongue {{normally}} lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed. Some <b>frogs</b> have no <b>tongue</b> and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands. The eyes assist in the swallowing of food {{as they can be}} retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat. The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the small intestine (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the small intestine, where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.|$|R
40|$|Using {{high-speed}} video motion analysis, the kinematics {{of feeding}} behavior was studied in Rana pipiens. Rana pipiensexhibits differing behavior patterns depending upon prey type. When feeding on small prey such as waxworms, R. pipiensuses tongue protraction to catch prey, minimizing head and body movements. When feeding {{on the larger}} earthworm, it arches its body, flexes the head downwards and uses jaw prehension to capture the prey. Time to completion of tongue retraction, time to completion of mouth closing, duration of tongue retraction, duration of mouth closing, total time that the mouth is open and maximum tongue reach were significantly longer during waxworm feedings than during earthworm feedings. The tongue angle and degree of head flexion were significantly greater during earthworm feedings. These different kinematic patterns correspond to differences in feeding behavior among major taxa of anurans. Phylogenetically primitive archaeobatrachian <b>frogs</b> have short <b>tongues</b> which can be protracted only a few millimeters.
