40|$|We study {{classical}} and quantum dynamics of two spinless particles confined in a quantum wire with repulsive or attractive Coulomb interaction. The interaction induces irregular dynamics in classical mechanics, which {{reflects on the}} quantum properties of the system in the <b>energy</b> level <b>statistics</b> (the signatures of quantum chaos). We investigate especially closer correspondence between the {{classical and}} quantum chaos. The present classical dynamics has some scaling property, which the quantum counterpart does not have. However, we demonstrate that the <b>energy</b> level <b>statistics</b> implies {{the existence of the}} corresponding scaling property even in the quantum system. Instead of ordinary maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE), we introduce a novel kind of MLE, which is shown to be suitable measure of chaotic irregularity for the present classical system. We show that tendency of the energy dependence of the Brody parameter, which characterizes the <b>energy</b> level <b>statistics</b> in the quantum system, is consistent with that of the novel kind of MLE...|$|R

5000|$|International <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> are {{typically}} {{broken down by}} carrier, sector and sub-sector, and country. [...] Energy carriers ( [...] energy products) are further classified as primary energy and secondary (or intermediate) energy and sometimes final (or end-use) energy. Published energy datasets are normally adjusted {{so that they are}} internally consistent, meaning that all energy stocks and flows must balance. The IEA regularly publishes <b>energy</b> <b>statistics</b> and energy balances with varying levels of detail and cost and also offers mid-term projections based on this data. [...] The notion of an energy carrier, as used in energy economics, is distinct and different from the definition of energy used in physics.|$|E

30|$|The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) {{recently}} released a <b>statistics</b> report, <b>Energy</b> Consumption <b>Statistics</b> by Prefecture, which provides time-series data by energy sector for each prefecture. The statistics clearly distinguish between industrial and commercial electricity demand, thus {{making it possible}} to conduct a sector-based demand analysis; however, it only reports data on total electricity demand by prefecture. The total electricity demand, nevertheless, includes not only sales volume but also the power generated and consumed by privately owned power facilities. 1 Therefore, we focus on the trend of total electricity demand as a whole and not electricity sales volume in particular. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use sectoral data from the <b>Energy</b> Consumption <b>Statistics</b> by Prefecture to measure the price elasticity of industrial and commercial electricity demand and analyze factors that increase electricity demand.|$|R

40|$|As nations {{complete}} national {{inventories of}} carbon dioxide emissions and attempt to achieve emissions reduction targets as part of international treaty obligations, independent verification of reported emissions becomes essential. However, organizations that report carbon dioxide emissions utilize different methods and produce data that are not directly comparable with each other, making verification of national inventories and climate modeling efforts difficult and potentially misleading. Carbon emission estimates are based directly on <b>energy</b> use <b>statistics.</b> Unfortunately, there is great unrecognized uncertainty and differences among organizations that independently report <b>energy</b> use <b>statistics.</b> International <b>energy</b> data reporting organizations include different energy sources, utilize different calorific contents of fossil fuels, and utilize different and inconsistent primary energy equivalencies in their annual statistics.
