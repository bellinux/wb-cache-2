5|$|In an August 3, 1973, {{memo to the}} Atari {{engineering}} department, co-founder Nolan Bushnell {{laid out}} plans {{for the company to}} create a prototype 20-player version of <b>Gotcha</b> in time for a trade show later that year, though no such game was ever made. Instead, released {{at the same time as}} <b>Gotcha</b> and showcased at the early November 1973 Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition were two additional versions of Gotcha: one with a tinted color overlay, and a true multi-color version of <b>Gotcha</b> with red, blue, and green colors. The color version of <b>Gotcha</b> was not widely produced, with between 20 and 100 machines released, but is believed to be the first color arcade game ever made, released over a month before Wimbledon, a color Pong clone.|$|E
5|$|Development on <b>Gotcha</b> {{began in}} July 1973, as Atari's fourth game after Pong, Space Race, and Pong Doubles. The company was {{interested}} in producing a very different game from their previous success of Pong, as they felt that innovative design was what would separate them from their competitors, which they saw as flooding the market with Pong clones rather than making new video games. After the release of Space Race, development immediately moved on to <b>Gotcha.</b> The design of the game was done by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong and developer for Space Race. Alcorn had {{the idea for the}} game from a defect he sometimes saw when testing Pong machines: if part of the circuit that converted scores to images on the screens was broken, then parts of the numbers would be scattered across the screen. Alcorn thought that combining that defect intentionally with a motion circuit could create dynamically changing mazes. A prototype design was developed by Steve Mayer of Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gotcha</b> is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari and released in October 1973. It {{was the fourth}} game by the company, after the 1972 Pong, which {{marked the beginning of}} the commercial video game industry, and the 1973 Space Race and Pong Doubles. In the game, two players move through a maze, which continually changes over time. One player, the Pursuer, attempts to catch the other, the Pursued; if they do, a point is scored, and the players reset positions. The game emits an electronic beeping sound, which increases in pace as the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, and each game lasts a set amount of time.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{propose a}} {{strategy}} for assessing the development and effectiveness of configuration management systems within Programs, Projects, and Design Activities performed by technical organizations and their supporting development contractors. Scope: Various entities CM Systems will be assessed dependent on Project Scope (DDT&E), Support Services and Acquisition Agreements. Approach: Model based structured against assessing organizations CM requirements including best practices maturity criteria. The model is tailored to the entity being assessed dependent on their CM system. The assessment approach provides objective feedback to Engineering and Project Management of the observed CM system maturity state versus the ideal state of the configuration management processes and outcomes(system). center dot Identifies strengths and risks versus audit <b>gotcha's</b> (findings/observations). center dot Used "recursively and iteratively" throughout program lifecycle at select points of need. (Typical assessments timing is Post PDR/Post CDR) center dot Ideal state criteria and maturity targets are reviewed with the assessed entity prior to an assessment (Tailoring) and {{is dependent on the}} assessed phase of the CM system. center dot Supports exit success criteria for Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews. center dot Gives a comprehensive CM system assessment which ultimately supports configuration verification activities. ...|$|R
40|$|The Athena Startup Kit (ASK), is an {{interactive}} front-end to the Atlas software framework (ATHENA). Written in python, {{a very effective}} "glue" language, it is build on top of the, in principle unrelated, code repository, build, configuration, debug, binding, and analysis tools. ASK automates many error-prone tasks that are otherwise left to the end-user, thereby pre-empting a whole category of potential problems. Through the existing tools, which ASK will setup for the user if and as needed, it locates available resources, maintains job coherency, manages the run-time environment, allows for interactivity and debugging, and provides standalone execution scripts. An end-user who wants to run her own analysis algorithms within the standard environment can let ASK generate the appropriate skeleton package, the needed dependencies and run-time, {{as well as a}} default job options script. For new and casual users, ASK comes with a graphical user interface; for advanced users, ASK has a scriptable command line interface. Both are built on top of the same set of libraries. ASK does not need to be, and isn't, experiment neutral. Thus it has built-in workarounds for known <b>gotcha's,</b> that would otherwise be a major time-sink for each and every new user. ASK minimizes the overhead for those physicists in Atlas who just want to write and run their analysis code.

5|$|<b>Gotcha</b> was {{designed}} by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, and a prototype was constructed by Cyan Engineering, Atari's semi-independent research and development subsidiary. Development began in July 1973 as part of Atari's strategy to develop multiple types of games to separate themselves from their competitors, who they saw as focused primarily on creating Pong clones. The cabinet {{was designed}} by George Faraco, initially with the joysticks encased in pink domes meant to represent breasts. Although this design inspired the advertising flyer on which it appears behind a man chasing {{a woman in a}} nightdress, it was changed to use regular joysticks soon after release.|$|E
5|$|The {{engineering}} and prototyping for Asteroid {{was done by}} Alcorn. The game is encoded entirely in discrete electronic components, like Atari's earlier games, and unlike later computer-based arcade games; the graphics are all simple line elements {{with the exception of}} the spacecraft, which are generated based on diodes on the circuit board arranged in the shape of half of a ship to represent the shape they create. That half ship is mirrored on the screen, similar to the diode array in Computer Space, which generated eight directions of a rotating ship with a mirrored four images. The game was completed quickly, and Alcorn soon moved on to Atari's third game, <b>Gotcha.</b> When the game was complete, the design was given to Midway to sell under that name, only for Atari to produce a nearly identical version itself titled Space Race, which was released on July 16, 1973.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, Atari began work on a driving game, an idea founder Nolan Bushnell had wanted to do since the company was {{initially}} founded in June 1972 before it was shelved in favor of Pong. The design work itself was handled by Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari and had previously handled the prototype design of <b>Gotcha.</b> Larry Emmons developed the circuits to control the car itself in the game, creating the feel of braking, acceleration, and movement. Emmons also used integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)— in his circuit design to store graphical data such as the tracks, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used. This {{is believed to be}} the first use of integrated circuit-based memory in an arcade game, and ROMs thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. The mechanical designs for the game, including the steering wheel, pedal, and gear shift controllers, were developed by Eigen Systems, located in the same building as Cyan and founded by ex-coworkers of the Cyan founders Emmons and Steven Mayer. At one point, the game's design included a small printer that would print high scores when achieved, but this was removed prior to the final design.|$|E
25|$|Some recent traditions include Team <b>Gotcha</b> (Assassins using water guns), an Iron Chef competition, and a Faculty Dessert Night {{with an open}} talent show. Avery House also {{probably}} participates in Interhouse Sports, holds an annual Interhouse party, and organizes annual ski trips, beach trips, and BBQs. In line with its historical position as an alternate option to the House system, Avery embraces an accepting mindset whereby {{anyone who wants to}} become an Avery member only needs to attain ten signatures from Avery members who are living in the house or have lived there previously.|$|E
25|$|UCLA has {{attracted}} filming for decades with {{its proximity to}} Hollywood. Much of the film <b>Gotcha!</b> (1985) was shot at UCLA, as well as John Singleton's Higher Learning (1995). Legally Blonde (2001), Old School (2003), The Nutty Professor (1995), Erin Brockovich (2000), How High (2001), National Lampoon's Van Wilder (2002), American Pie 2 (2001), and Bring It On Again (2004) were all mainly shot around campus. In January 2009, the Bollywood movie My Name is Khan (2010) was shot at UCLA. UCLA is also often cast as Stanford in television shows such as The Mindy Project and Chuck. Some of the exterior shots of the fictional UC Sunnydale in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and ABC Family original series Greek were also filmed at UCLA. In response to the major demand for filming, UCLA has instated a policy to regulate filming and professional photography at the campus.|$|E
500|$|<b>Gotcha</b> was not commercially successful; later {{sources have}} {{described}} it as receiving a [...] "lukewarm reception" [...] and [...] "arousing little more than controversy". Ralph Baer, however, claims it sold 3,000 units. Additionally, despite Gotchas prominence as Atari's fourth game and their second game not related to Pong, the 1973 arcade video game market was largely dominated by Pong clones; while Pong was the fourth arcade video game ever produced, <b>Gotcha</b> was approximately the twentieth, with nearly all the other games released before and after <b>Gotcha</b> {{through the end of}} the year Pong clones. <b>Gotcha</b> was the first arcade maze video game, though non-commercial maze-based video games had been developed as early as the 1959 Mouse in the Maze computer game. In 1977, Atari produced a version of <b>Gotcha</b> for the Atari 2600—then called the Atari VCS—named Maze Craze. Developed by Rick Maurer, the game featured one or two players controlling policemen chasing a robber through a maze, with added sound, graphics, and adjustable movement speeds and visibility of the maze. Maze Craze was a [...] "highly popular" [...] game on the system.|$|E
500|$|Dwight {{claims that}} the radio is using <b>Gotcha</b> journalism. In order to cover up for Oscar, Kevin starts {{chanting}} [...] "U-S-A!", a popular Olympic chant. When Oscar admits that he lied to Toby, Toby goes on a tangential rant about the Scranton Strangler, {{a reference to a}} minor plot development that occurred during the show's sixth and seventh seasons.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} not commercially successful; later sources have termed it as [...] "arousing {{little more than}} controversy", though one source claims it sold 3,000 units. In {{addition}} to the main black-and-white game, limited runs were produced of a tinted color version and a true multi-color version of the game; the latter {{is believed to be}} the first color arcade game. <b>Gotcha</b> inspired an enhanced version featuring cops and robbers titled Maze Craze for the Atari 2600 in 1977, which was more popular than the original.|$|E
500|$|After Palin's memoir, , {{achieved}} best-seller status through pre-orders, Fey {{announced she}} would resume impersonating the former Governor despite having [...] "retired" [...] the act months previously. On April 10, 2010, Fey hosted SNL, {{and once again}} played Palin, who unveiled her own television network featuring shows such as Hey Journalist, I <b>Gotcha,</b> Todd! starring her husband Todd Palin (Jason Sudeikis) and Are You Smarter than a Half-Term Governor? Fey hosted SNL in May 2011 while pregnant. A new sketch was made in which parodies of Mitt Romney (Jason Sudeikis), Newt Gingrich (Bobby Moynihan), Michele Bachmann (Kristen Wiig), Palin (Fey), Donald Trump (Darrell Hammond), and Jimmy McMillan (Kenan Thompson) fought in a Republican Party debate between undeclared candidates, with Shepard Smith (Bill Hader) coordinating.|$|E
500|$|<b>Gotcha</b> is a two-player maze game {{in which}} one player {{attempts}} to catch the other. The maze is composed of a repeating pattern of elements set in multiple columns on the screen. The [...] "Pursuer" [...] is represented by a square, while the [...] "Pursued" [...] is identified by a plus sign. As the Pursuer gets closer to the Pursued, an electronic beeping sound plays at an increasing rate until the Pursuer reaches the Pursued. Whenever the Pursued is caught, the Pursuer scores a point, the maze disappears for a brief moment, and the Pursuer is moved to a random position {{on the right side}} of the screen. There is no score for the Pursued, so determining who won is left to the players. The maze itself is continually changing, with two invisible lines half a screen apart scanning down the maze and overwriting maze elements. Above the maze is the Pursuer's score and the time elapsed in the game. Each game is for a set period of time. When time runs out, the game enters attract mode, where the score resets and the square and plus sign begin bouncing around the maze in a diagonal pattern as the maze continues to change. Each game costs a quarter. The time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 30 seconds to 2 minutes.|$|E
500|$|The cabinet for {{the game}} was {{designed}} by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. His designed featured a joystick for each player, which was encased in a pink dome that the player would rest their hands on to control the joysticks, meant to resemble breasts. Faraco later acknowledged that [...] "they didn't have bumps on them or anything, but {{the way they were}} the size of grapefruits next to each other, you got the impression of what they were supposed to be." [...] Atari's second engineer, Don Lange, who assisted with the game, has also stated that the design was intentional on the part of Faraco, who fellow Atari designer Regan Chang has claimed [...] "had some really far out ideas". According to rumor, Faraco got the idea from a joke that joysticks resembled phalluses, and that Atari should make a game with female controls. Like Faraco's initial design for Space Race, which was changed due to its expense after a few dozen units, the joysticks for <b>Gotcha</b> were changed to standard ones shortly into the production run prior to the October 1973 release. The design did inspire the advertising flyer {{for the game}}, however, which features a man chasing a woman in a nightdress with the initial design of the cabinet behind them. The final cabinet stands over 5 feet tall and weighs nearly 200 pounds. The breast-like controllers reappeared in yellow in prototype versions of the 1974 Touch Me arcade game, but were not used in production.|$|E
