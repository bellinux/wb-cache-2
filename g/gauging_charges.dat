40|$|We {{construct}} a Kerr–Newman-like spacetime starting from higher dimensional (HD) Einstein–Yang–Mills black holes via complex transformations suggested by Newman–Janis.

40|$|We {{describe}} symmetry {{structure of}} a general singular theory (theory with constraints in the Hamiltonian formulation), and, in particular, we relate the structure of gauge transformations with the constraint structure. We show that any symmetry transformation can be represented as a sum of three kinds of symmetries: global, gauge, and trivial symmetries. We construct explicitly all the corresponding conserved charges as decompositions in a special constraint basis. The global part of a symmetry does not vanish on the extremals, and the corresponding charge does not vanish on the extremals as well. The gauge part of a symmetry does not vanish on the extremals, but the <b>gauge</b> <b>charge</b> vanishes on them. We stress that the <b>gauge</b> <b>charge</b> necessarily contains a part that vanishes linearly in the first-class constraints and the remaining part of the <b>gauge</b> <b>charge</b> vanishes quadratically on the extremals. The trivial part of any symmetry vanishes on the extremals, and the corresponding charge vanishes quadratically on the extremals. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} increasingly tighter observational constraints on dark matter, several {{models have been}} proposed recently in which dark matter particles are charged under some hidden gauge group. Hidden <b>gauge</b> <b>charges</b> are invisible for the standard model particles, hence such scenarios {{are very difficult to}} constrain directly. However black holes are sensitive to all <b>gauge</b> <b>charges,</b> whether they belong to the standard model or not. Here, we examine the constraints on the possible values of the dark matter particle mass and hidden <b>gauge</b> <b>charge</b> from the evolution of primordial black holes. We find that the existence of the primordial black holes with reasonable mass is incompatible with dark matter particles whose charge to mass ratio is of the order of one. For dark matter particles whose charge to mass ratio is much less than one, we are able to exclude only heavy dark matter in the mass range of 10 ^(11) GeV - 10 ^(16) GeV. Finally, for dark matter particles whose charge to mass ratio is much greater than one, there are no useful limits coming from primordial black holes. Comment: accepted for publication in JCA...|$|R

40|$|A {{black hole}} may carry quantum {{numbers that are}} not {{associated}} with massless gauge fields, contrary {{to the spirit of}} the "no-hair" theorems. We describe in detail two different types of black hole hair that decay exponentially at long range. The first type is associated with discrete <b>gauge</b> <b>charge</b> and the screening is due to the Higgs mechanism. The second type is associated with color magnetic charge, and the screening is due to color confinement. In both cases, we perform semi-classical calculations of the effect of the hair on local observables outside the horizon, and on black hole thermodynamics. These effects are generated by virtual cosmic strings, or virtual electric flux tubes, that sweep around the event horizon. The effects of discrete <b>gauge</b> <b>charge</b> are non-perturbative in ħ, but the effects of color magnetic charge become ħ-independent in a suitable limit. We present an alternative treatment of discrete <b>gauge</b> <b>charge</b> using dual variables, and examine the possibility of black hole hair associated with discrete global symmetry. We draw the distinction between primary hair, which endows a black hole with new quantum numbers, and secondary hair, which does not, and we point out some varieties of secondary hair that occur in the standard model of particle physics.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{hedgehog}} suppression in the O(3) sigma model in D = 2 + 1. We show via Monte Carlo simulations that the sigma model can be disordered while effectively forbidding these point topological defects. The resulting paramagnetic state has <b>gauge</b> <b>charged</b> matter with half-integer spin (spinons) and also an emergent gauge field (photons), whose existence is explicitly demonstrated. Hence, this is an explicit realization of fractionalization in a model with global SU(2) symmetry. The zero-temperature ordering transition from this phase {{is found to be}} continuous but distinct from the regular Heisenberg ordering transition. We propose that these phases and this phase transition are captured by the noncompact CP 1 model, which contains a pair of bosonic fields coupled to a noncompact U(1) gauge field. Direct simulation of the transition in this model yields critical exponents that support this claim. The easy-plane limit of this model also displays a continuous zero temperature ordering transition, which has the remarkable property of being self-dual. The presence of emergent <b>gauge</b> <b>charge</b> and hence Coulomb interactions is evidenced by the presence of a finite temperature Kosterlitz-Thouless transition associated with the thermal ionization of the <b>gauge</b> <b>charged</b> spinons.

For this purpose, two main tools will be used: the Epstein–Glaser inductive and causal construction of the perturbation series for the scattering matrix and the concept of perturbative operator quantum gauge invariance borrowed from non-Abelian quantum gauge theories. The first method deals with the ultraviolet problem of quantum gravity and the second one ensures gauge invariance at the quantum level, formulated by means of a <b>gauge</b> <b>charge,</b> in each order of perturbation theory.
