There was an exit door through the display area to the outside balcony, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> and could only be opened with a key. As Bryant moved, Robert Elliott stood up. He {{was shot in the}} arm and head, left slumping against the fireplace but alive.|$|E
25|$|Bozděch elected {{instead to}} carry the dog instead rather than killing {{him as one of}} the others suggested, and after a while they began to take turns {{carrying}} Ant over their shoulders. They reached Blois and were directed to a train to Montpellier further down the track where found it overwhelmed with people trying to board. Ant shot off towards the rear of the train, before stopping by a cattle truck. Bozděch tried to open it up, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>locked.</b> He banged on it in the hope someone was already inside and was surprised when it was opened, revealing that the only people inside were a woman and her two daughters. The reason why Ant had been attracted to that particular carriage, was because one of the girls had been eating chocolate at the time. When she later offered him a piece, he didn't wait for it to be melted like when he was a puppy, but instead ate it excitedly.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the wake}} up call, the two crews began the {{procedures}} {{to move the}} Leonardo MPLM out of the orbiter's payload bay to install it on the Earth-facing port of the Harmony module. Using the station's robotic arm, Pettit and Kimbrough began maneuvering the 27,000 lb container around 16:45 UTC, and by at 18:04 UTC <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> in place. After performing leak checks, the hatch was opened at 23:43 UTC. The crews took air samples and examined the container for any signs of condensation or shifting of the contents during launch. The container had no issues, and transfer of cargo between the container and the station began shortly after the hatch was opened. The team also worked on experiments that were flown with Endeavour, including one that involves observing spiders and butterflies in space. The experiment from Florida, Texas and Colorado schoolchildren is being conducted to compare spider webs created in microgravity with those on Earth. The insects {{will be returned to}} Earth with the shuttle for additional study.|$|E

Sam, still dizzy and {{unsure of what}} is going on after being knocked {{unconscious}} by Dean, reveals that he no longer sleeps and has become a better hunter. Castiel has an idea of what's wrong and decides to read Sam's soul by reaching inside him, and the truth is finally revealed: that Sam has no soul, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> in the cage with Lucifer. Both Dean and Castiel are unsure whether Sam is still Sam without his soul, but they let Sam go and Castiel heals his wounds from being beaten by Dean.|$|E
500|$|Relatively {{few changes}} were made during the war to Saratogas aircraft-handling equipment. Her crew removed her forward arresting wires in late 1943, {{although}} their hydraulic systems were not removed until her refit in mid-1944. At that time she received two Type H hydraulic catapults mounted in her forward flight deck to handle the heavier aircraft entering service. Before the war, plans were made to replace the aft elevator with a [...] model, but manufacturing delays and operational demands prevented this from ever happening. By mid-1942, the increasing size and weight of naval aircraft exceeded {{the capacity of the}} aft elevator and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> in place. It was removed in March 1945 to save weight and the opening in the flight deck was plated over. The machinery for the forward elevator was scheduled to be upgraded before the war, but this was not done until mid-1944. A new, 44-by-48-foot lightweight forward elevator identical to those used in the [...] carriers was installed in March 1945.|$|E
500|$|Lucan's {{friends and}} family were {{critical}} of the inquest, which they felt offered a one-sided view of events. His mother told reporters {{that it did not}} serve [...] "any useful purpose at all". Veronica's sister, Christina, said that she felt [...] "great sadness and sorrow" [...] at the verdict. Susan Maxwell-Scott continued to press the earl's claims of innocence and claimed to feel [...] "awfully sorry" [...] for the countess. However, as Lucan remained absent, his description of [...] "a traumatic night of unbelievable coincidence" [...] came only from the letters he authored and the people he spoke with soon after Rivett's murder. While his fingerprints were not found at the scene, his assertions make no provision for the lead pipe discovered in the boot of the Ford Corsair, the claims by some that he discussed murdering his wife, or the lack of a viable suspect for the man he claimed to have seen fighting her. No sign of a forced entry was found, and officers attempting to demonstrate that Lucan could have seen into the basement kitchen, from the street, could only do so by stooping low to the pavement. The basement light was not working, making it even more difficult to see into the room; its lightbulb (which was tested and found to be in working order) was found removed from its holder and left lying on a chair. Furthermore, Lady Lucan claimed not to have entered the basement that night, contradicting the earl's version of events; his wife's account is supported by the forensic examination made of the blood splashes and stains around the property. Some traces of her blood were found in the basement, the rear garden and on the canvas sack used to store Rivett's body; this may have been due to contamination at the scene. The man Lucan claimed to have seen could not have left through the basement's front door as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>locked,</b> and the rear door led to a walled garden through which no trace of an escape was found. No signs that the man left by the ground level front door were discovered, and no witnesses reported seeing any such person near 46Lower Belgrave Street.|$|E

It then focused more on its fraternal roles such as social activities for its membership. By the 1980s it focused on its insurance program, with 300,000 members and assets of over $176 million.|$|E
2500|$|Kabbalistic texts, {{including}} the Zohar, appear to affirm dualism, as they ascribe all evil to the separation from holiness {{known as the}} Sitra Achra ("the other side") which is opposed to Sitra D'Kedushah, or the Side of Holiness. The [...] "left side" [...] of divine emanation is a negative {{mirror image of the}} [...] "side of holiness" [...] with which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>locked</b> in combat[...] While this evil aspect exists within the divine structure of the Sephirot, the Zohar indicates that the Sitra Ahra has no power over Ein Sof, and only exists as a necessary aspect of the creation of God to give man free choice, and that evil is the consequence of this choice. It is not a supernatural force opposed to God, but a reflection of the inner moral combat within mankind between the dictates of morality and the surrender to one's basic instincts.|$|E
