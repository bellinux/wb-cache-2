5|$|<b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> point I {{was trying}} to push with these two {{programmed}} robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviewing}} Epiphany 2.30 in July 2010 Jack Wallen {{described it}} as [...] "efficient, but different" [...] and noted its problem with crashes. [...] "When I first started working with Epiphany it crashed on most sites I visited. After doing a little research (and then a little debugging) <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> issue was with JavaScript. Epiphany (in its current release), for some strange reason, doesn't like JavaScript. The only way around this was to disable JavaScript. Yes this means a lot of features won't work {{on a lot of}} sites – but this also means those same sites will load faster and won't be so prone to having issues (like crashing my browser)." [...] Wallen concluded positively about the browser, [...] "Although Epiphany hasn't fully replaced Chrome and Firefox as my one-stop-shop browser, I now use it much more than I would have previously. [...] small footprint, fast startup, and clean interface." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{director}} and choreographer Ortega {{stated that the}} rehearsal footage and concept of making a film to document {{the preparation of the}} concerts had come about as [...] "an accident". Ortega stated the film was pieced together from [...] "private footage", shot by documentarians Sandrine Orabona and Tim Patterson of Jackson, and that before Jackson's death, was never intended to be released to the public, or even in general. [...] "The recordings were made so we could use them, then the tapes were destined for Michael 's private library. They have a real unguarded honesty to them." [...] Ortega stated that he had gotten the idea to use the rehearsal footage from Jackson's fans after his death: [...] "At first I got so many messages from fans around the world asking to see the shows, asking to see the footage and eventually <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> journey wasn't over and we had to do this", and Ortega also stated that the film was made only for the Jackson fans: [...] " [...] is for the fans and the film will show the development and intentions of the show, and the concert as it moved closer to London." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ruth Reinhardt: [...] "Limited space {{suggested}} the final name. Jazz Ltd. has caused much comment, and, having worked for Billy Rose for four consecutive years (1931-35), <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> {{commercial value of}} comment" [...] "Jazz, Ltd."

500|$|Bakke {{complained to}} Dr. George Lowrey, {{chairman}} of the admissions committee at the medical school, about the special admissions program. [...] At Lowrey's request, Assistant Dean Peter Storandt told Bakke his candidacy had come close and encouraged him to reapply. [...] If he was not accepted the second time, “he could then research the legal question. [...] He {{had been a good}} candidate. [...] I thought he’d be accepted and that would end the matter.” [...] Storandt also gave Bakke the names of two lawyers interested in the issue of affirmative action. The general counsel for the University of California said, “I don’t think Storandt meant to injure the university. [...] It’s simply an example of a non-lawyer advising on legal matters.” [...] Storandt stated, “I simply gave Allan the response you’d give an irate customer, to try and cool his anger. [...] <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> university might be vulnerable to legal attack because of its quota, and I had the feeling by then that somebody somewhere would sue the school, but I surely didn’t know this would be the case.” Storandt was demoted and later left the university. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of the Bakke case, Storandt was fired.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the group harmonising [...] "Sha la la la" [...] over pianos. The lyrics are about puppy love, as they yearningly sing [...] "Last night I lay in bed so blue / Cause' <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> truth/ They can't love me like you / I tried to find {{somebody}} new / Baby they ain't got a clue/ Can't love me like you." [...] Fuse writer Jeff Benjamin described the song as being reminiscent of 1960s girl group The Ronettes but with a more modern feel for 2015 radio, highlighting the line [...] "They try to romance me but you got that nasty and that's what I want" [...] as an example. Digital Spy writer Lewis Corner thought that the line [...] "He might got the biggest ca-aa-ar" [...] does not fool listeners into thinking that [...] "they're not actually talking about his Fiat 500." [...] Several music critics compared the song to recordings from the Motown era in the 1950s and 1960s, with Andy Gill of The Independent likening it to material composed by Shadow Morton. Emilee Lindner of MTV News likened the production to material composed by Phil Spector. The Christmas mix version features added church bells and jingles.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 Reddit IAmA, Jennings {{recalled}} how in 2004 the Democratic politicians Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid unsuccessfully asked Jennings {{to run for}} the United States Senate from Utah.

2500|$|Richard Brown, then a white {{graduate}} student at Harvard University, recalls that the March fostered direct actions for economic progress: [...] "Henry Armstrong and I compared notes. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> Congress of Racial Equality might help black employment in Boston by urging businesses to hire contractors like Armstrong. He agreed to help start a list of reliable contractors that CORE could promote. It was a modest effort — but it moved in the right direction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked {{about the}} play after the game, Jessee said “I did {{not touch the}} ball. [...] I {{thought it was a}} forward pass and I was looking at the ball being thrown and I was {{signaling}} for a grounding penalty. Then, when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> ball was in play, I pulled my hands back… The guys played a great game. The focus shouldn't be on this.” [...] During the game, Mack Brown was furious with the penalty call and insisted that Jessee did not touch the ball. [...] After the game Brown said that Jessee stepping onto the field [...] " [...] how bad our family wanted to win the game".|$|E

5000|$|Andy Greenwald of Grantland {{thought the}} episode was [...] "no-less brilliant" [...] than the episode that preceded it, {{but that it}} [...] "suffered slightly" [...] for being [...] "richness on top of richness." [...] He says [...] "it’s only in retrospect, looking over my notes, that <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> {{material}} in the second half-hour might have actually been stronger.".|$|R
6000|$|... "So far," [...] he replied, [...] "I owe no debt to humanity. The longer I {{live and}} the wiser I get, <b>the</b> more <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>the</b> {{absolute}} importance of self-care. Individualism {{is the only}} real and logical creed.

60|$|Then it {{was that}} <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> {{commander}} was pinned to the earth by his dead horse, and, without being really conscious of my movements, I ran to his side.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> {{object of}} this cross-examination. The colour flared {{suddenly}} into my cheeks, and as suddenly left them. The absence of those papers was extraordinary to me. I utterly {{failed to understand}} it.|$|E
5000|$|.....Aaron {{dealt with}} his {{indictment}} so badly {{because he thought}} he was part of a special class of people that this didn't happen to. I am from a rundown shack in Arkansas.

60|$|We {{had hardly}} got well upon the street before <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> {{enormous}} change that total prohibition had effected.

6000|$|... "I will go as a spectator," [...] he said. Removing his {{sword-belt}} {{and taking}} the pistols from his holsters he handed them to his servant, who took them back to headquarters. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> brutality of my remark, but not clearly seeing my way to an apology, said nothing.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> {{futility}} of {{any attempt to}} dissuade her; so we left her there, spent an hour at the Academy and did a little shopping.

60|$|Poirot had conferred with Japp {{in a low}} tone on the way up, and it was {{the latter}} functionary who {{requested}} that the household, {{with the exception of the}} servants, should be assembled together in the drawing-room. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>the</b> significance of this.

6000|$|... "Not exactly; but I took {{a certain}} {{interest}} in Winthrop--I liked the man.
