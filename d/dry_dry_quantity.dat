In addition, the information available about this process is relquite limited. Thus, this work evaluated four <b>drying</b> techniques likely to be implemented by lombricultores: sun <b>drying,</b> oven <b>drying,</b> <b>drying</b> tunnel and microwave assisted <b>drying.</b> <b>Drying</b> kinetics values were obtained for all <b>drying</b> techniques, and specific parameters as the following were evaluated: <b>drying</b> tray material (stainless and ceramic steel) for sun <b>drying,</b> microwave power (30 %, 50 % and 80 %) and amount of material to be <b>dried</b> (72 and 100 g) for microwave assisted <b>drying,</b> temperature (50, 65, 90 and 100 °C) for oven <b>drying,</b> and temperature (50 and 63 °C) and air speed (2. 9 to 3. 6 m/s) for tunnel <b>drying.</b> It was determined that the most efficient technique is the <b>drying</b> tunnel, because this allows the combination of heat transfer by conduction and convection, and enables controlling the operating parameters. Finally, nutritional analyzes were performed in samples obtained by each <b>drying</b> technique evaluated. The crude protein content for sun <b>drying,</b> microwave assisted <b>drying,</b> oven <b>drying</b> and tunnel <b>drying</b> were 66. 36 %, 67. 91 %, 60. 35 % and 62. 33 % respectively, indicating that the <b>drying</b> method and operating parameters do not significantly affect the crude protein content...|$|R

30|$|As an edible microalgae, Spirulina is {{not only}} a human food supplement, but also {{valuable}} as an animal feed formulation component due to its high protein (60 – 70 % <b>dry</b> weight), vitamin, and mineral contents (Harun et al. 2010). Global production as of 2010 was 5000 metric ton/year (Norsker et al. 2011) with producers in the United States, China, India, and Chile. Commercial production occurs in shallow raceway ponds mixed by a paddle wheel (Belay 2013) in high saline and alkaline conditions and the biomass is then harvested and processed for inclusion in animal feed formulations (Yaakob et al. 2014). Harvesting and processing include filtration, concentration, neutralization, grinding/homogenization, and dehydration. <b>Drying</b> methods include drum <b>drying,</b> spray <b>drying,</b> sun <b>drying,</b> solar <b>drying,</b> cross-flow air <b>drying,</b> vacuum-shelf <b>drying,</b> and freeze <b>drying</b> (Belay 2013). Typically, Spirulina is neutralized with an acidic solution and <b>dried</b> or dehydrated as this allows for easy integration into animal feed formulations (Ahsan et al. 2008).|$|R

Health hazards associated with PERC included {{central nervous system}} depression, liver and kidney damage, memory impairment, dermatitis, respiratory irritation, and other symptoms. <b>Dry</b> cleaning machine types included first generation transfer machines, second generation <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> vented machines, third generation <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> nonvented machines, fourth generation <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> nonvented machines with secondary vapor control, and fifth generation <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> nonvented machines with secondary vapor control and drum monitors. <b>Dry</b> cleaning machines evolved over time from the first through fifth generations, becoming safer with each successive generation. The manual transfer of clothing required with transfer machines was eliminated with <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> machines. The development of nonvented <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> machines utilizing refrigerated condensers led to considerable solvent savings and PERC emissions reduction. Residual PERC present in the machine cylinder {{at the end of}} the <b>dry</b> cycle was reduced via a refrigerated condenser plus carbon absorber in <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> nonvented machines with secondary vapor control. Fifth generation machines were essentially fourth generation machines in which the vapor concentration in the machine drum was monitored. The current OSHA permissible exposure limit for PERC was an 8 hour time weighted average exposure of 100 parts per million (ppm). Only fourth and fifth generation machines were able to keep worker exposures below the OSHA maximum peak of 300 ppm. Important machine design features included a <b>dry</b> to <b>dry</b> design, primary and secondary vapor control systems, a <b>drying</b> sensor that monitored solvent recovery, and a door locking mechanism for the loading and unloading door of the <b>dry</b> cleaning machine.
