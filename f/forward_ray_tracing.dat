Consequently, the skew ray error in Placido-based topography is demonstrated. A quantitative analysis comparing FRT-based algorithms and Placido-based algorithms in reconstructing the front surface of the cornea shows that arc step algorithms are more sensitive to noise (imprecise). Furthermore, they are less accurate in determining corneal aberrations particularly the quadrafoil aberration. On the other hand, FRT-based algorithms are more accurate and more precise showing that point to point corneal topography is superior compared to its Placido-based counterpart. © 2010 Optical Society of America...|$|E

(2009) in the OH airglow layer near Brasilia, at 15 &deg; S, 47 &deg; W, during the Spread F Experiment (SpreadFEx) in Brazil in 2005. We reverse and <b>forward</b> <b>ray</b> <b>trace</b> these GWs to the tropopause {{and into the}} thermosphere using a <b>ray</b> <b>trace</b> model which includes thermospheric dissipation. We identify the convective plumes, convective clusters, and convective regions which may have generated these GWs. We find that deep convection is the highly likely source of four of these GWs. We pinpoint the specific deep convective plumes which likely excited two of these GWs on the nights of 30 September and 1 October. On these nights, the source location/time uncertainties were small and deep convection was sporadic near the modeled source locations. We locate the regions containing deep convective plumes and clusters which likely excited the other two GWs. The last 2 GWs were probably also excited from deep convection; however, {{they must have been}} ducted ~ 500 – 700 km if so. Two of the GWs were likely downwards-propagating initially (after which they reflected upwards from the Earth's surface), while one of the GWs was likely upwards-propagating initially from the convective plume/cluster. We also estimate the amplitudes and vertical scales of these waves at the tropopause, and compare their scales with those from a simple, linear convection model. Finally, we calculate each GW's dissipation altitude, location, and amplitude. We find that the dissipation altitude depends sensitively on the winds at and above the OH layer. We also find that several of these GWs may have penetrated to high enough altitudes to potentially seed equatorial spread F (ESF) if located somewhat farther from the magnetic equator...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} URCHIN, {{a reverse}} ray tracing radiative transfer scheme optimised to model self-shielding from the post-reionisation ultraviolet (UV) background in cosmological simulations. The reverse ray tracing strategy provides several benefits over <b>forward</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> codes including: (1) {{the preservation of}} adaptive density field resolution (2) completely uniform sampling of gas elements by rays; (3) the preservation of galilean invariance; (4) the ability to sample the UV background spectrum with hundreds of frequency bins; and (5) exact preservation of the input UV background spectrum and amplitude in optically thin gas.

40|$|A new {{solution}} for light simulation using <b>forward</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> is presented. Aiming to archive statically right physical resemblance, the framework is {{trying hard to}} be faithful to the physics of light and its interaction with matter. The complexity of the system is controlled by dividing the sphere around each scattering event into discrete patches, grouping the irradiance into these patches. A ray represent one patch with radiant intensity. Phenomena incorporated are reflection, refraction, dispersion, absorption and subsurface scattering. A proof of concept is implemented in C++, and a simple deterministic scene descriptions with point light source and a copper sphere serves as test cases. The input is given with XML files and the output is post processed into nonuniform polar plots. The results are few but promising. Some aspects of the underlying physics needs to be refined and yet to be answered is how the system will respond to a complex scene description. 1 Universe Representation There are many ways to represent a simulation universe. The complex structure of paper sheets can be represented in at least three different ways. The most common parameterization in ray tracing is the deterministic model from synthesis.

40|$|The {{correction}} of chromatic aberrations is typically performed using aberration formulas or by using real <b>ray</b> <b>tracing.</b> While {{the use of}} aberration formulas might be effective for some simple optical systems, it has limitations for complex and fast systems. For this reason chromatic aberration correction is usually accomplished with real <b>ray</b> <b>tracing.</b> However, existing optimization tools in lens design software typically mix the {{correction of}} monochromatic and chromatic aberrations by construction of an error function that minimizes both aberrations at the same time. This mixing makes the correction of one aberration type dependent on the correction of the other aberration type.

40|$|The {{use of a}} ray file {{to model}} the optical {{characteristics}} of a light source is a well-known and popular method to achieve accurate results when simulating luminous intensity distributions of luminaires, especially if the source is interacting with optical components at a close distance. However, lighting industry {{becomes more and more}} interested in the spatial luminance distribution of the luminaire itself. Luminance maps offer a tool to predict the degree of discomfort glare early in the design process, especially when developing fixtures using small and intense LED light sources. The generation of luminance maps is commonly based on the reverse ray tracing technique, requiring one or more surfaces to be defined as light sources. However, ray files can not be considered as surface sources, but as a collection of ray data that model the near field of a light source. Despite the fact that ray files are constructed from experimental data they do not explicitly contain the geometry of the light source. This excludes the use of reverse ray tracing. For this reason the implementation of brute force <b>forward</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> to obtain luminance maps was investigated. To be able to compare the results of both techniques an inhomogeneous surface source was defined. Luminance maps were then generated using both the brute force ray tracing approach and the conventional reverse ray tracing approach. A good agreement was obtained.

40|$|Atmospheric {{gravity waves}} {{are a major}} cause of {{uncertainty}} in atmosphere general circulation models. This uncertainty affects regional climate projections and seasonal weather predictions. Improving the representation of gravity waves in general circulation models is therefore of primary interest. In this regard, measurements providing an accurate 3 -D characterization of gravity waves are needed. Using the Gimballed Limb Observer for Radiance Imaging of the Atmosphere (GLORIA), the first airborne implementation of a novel infrared limb imaging technique, a gravity wave event over Iceland was observed. An air volume disturbed by this gravity wave was investigated from different angles by encircling the volume with a closed flight pattern. Using a tomographic retrieval approach, the measurements of this air mass at different angles allowed for a 3 -D reconstruction of the temperature and trace gas structure. The temperature measurements were used to derive gravity wave amplitudes, 3 -D wave vectors, and direction-resolved momentum fluxes. These parameters facilitated the backtracing of the waves to their sources on the southern coast of Iceland. Two wave packets are distinguished, one stemming from the main mountain ridge in the south of Iceland and the other from the smaller mountains in the north. The total area-integrated fluxes of these two wave packets are determined. <b>Forward</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> reveals that the waves propagate laterally more than 2000  km away from their source region.

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} the potential sound insulation benefit by using damping material to absorb vibrational energy along its transmission path. Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) {{was used to}} evaluate the effect on system performance of adding damping globally, as well as its influence on individual transmission paths. Nine different theoretical models were studied using both bending only and three-wave SEA models to predict the system behaviour in different frequency regions. The results suggest that global damping treatment generally increases the sound insulation in buildings. Initial increases in the internal loss factor (a term used in SEA to describe material damping properties) were found to provide significant initial improvements in sound insulation and flanking paths as opposed to direct paths were found to benefit more from damping treatment. A simple approximation was proposed to predict the damping benefit of paths of specific order without the need to run a full SEA model. In the presence of heavily damped structural element, where SEA is less likely to provide accurate prediction, a <b>forward</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> algorithm was proposed as a supplement. It enables one to predict the energy transmission through a heavily damped component coupling two or more lightly damped components (or SEA subsystems). The energy distribution along the edges of the damped component was studied. The contribution from the direct field was found to dominate the incident energy and resulting transmission, especially in areas close to the source when damping is high. Different passive damping treatment techniques were reviewed as well as the theoretical damping level that is achievable as a guidance for theoretical and experimental validation. Several damping measurement techniques were studied and experimental validation of the ray tracing code was undertaken...|$|E

We also attempted to observe the long-offset wide-angle reflection phases from mantle reflectors recorded by a previous long-offset OBS survey (Ohira et al. 2017 b). Because the OBS deployment was sparse, we modeled the crustal velocity structure by applying a simple <b>forward</b> 2 -D <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> approach (Zelt and Smith 1992; Fujie et al. 2008) to all OBS data.

In addition, we applied a travel time mapping method (Fujie et al. 2006) to reflection phases at large offsets to image the deep lithospheric structure. Each OBS was relocated by using direct water-wave arrivals. The observed waveforms were band-pass-filtered (5 – 20  Hz), and adjacent traces within the 200 -m offset range were stacked to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.|$|R

40|$|The {{principles}} of phase controlled excitation and processing of ultrasonic signals {{are used in}} nondestructive testing and medical diagnostics. A phased array system is a multi channel ultrasonic system, which uses the principle of a time-delayed triggering of the transmitting transducer elements, combined with a time - corrected receiving of detected signals. The main advantage of the phased array systems is their ability to vary the angle of insonification in the inspection object (sweeping and focusing of the sound beam). A new phased array technique - sampling phased array (SPA) {{was developed in the}} Fraunhofer-Institute for non-destructive testing (IZFP), which uses a patented technology. Conventional phased array requires several shots at different angles to cover the entire section. In contrast, in the sampling principle, the same can be achieved with a single insonification (single shot). For this, it is necessary to calculate the to and fro travel times for different points inside the test specimen. Faster inspection speeds with simultaneous enhancement of information content (qualitative and quantitative), fast 2 D and 3 D imaging in real time, cost reduction are some of the important advantages of SPA technique. The ultrasonic testing of steel billets is typically carried out in a water bath to achieve maximum sensitivity and high eproducibility. Inline inspection takes place with the movement of steel billet along its longitudinal axis. This approach can be extended to examination of rods, pipes and other cylindrical structures. In immersion technique, the sound has to travel through two different media. The sound paths in each medium are straight-lines but at interface between different media, refraction causes ray direction to change. In present work we present the results for billets and rods. For planar interface, Taylor series expansions for travel times can be used which involve velocities in different media and their even order moment. This gives accurate results for small offset to depth ratio. For curved interfaces, <b>forward</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> can be used with generalized 2 D interpolation to find travel times...|$|E
40|$|With an {{expanding}} population and uncertain consequences of climate change, {{the need to}} both stabilise and increase crop yields is important. The relationship between biomass production and radiation interception suggests one target for improvement. Under optimal growing conditions, biomass production {{is determined by the}} amount of light intercepted and the efficiency with which this is converted into dry matter. The amount of light at a given photosynthetic surface is dependent upon solar movement, weather patterns and the structure of the plant, amongst others. Optimising canopy structure provides a method by which we can improve and optimise both radiation interception and also the distribution of light among canopy layers that contribute to net photosynthesis. This requires knowledge of how canopy structure determines light distribution and therefore photosynthetic capacity of a given crop species. The aim of this thesis was to assess the relationships between canopy architecture, the light environment and photosynthesis. This focused on two core areas: the effect of varietal selection and management practices on canopy structure and the light environment and; the effect of variable light on select photosynthetic processes (photoinhibition and acclimation). An image-based reconstruction method based on stereocameras was employed with a <b>forward</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> algorithm in order to model canopy structure and light distributions in high-resolution. Empirical models were then applied using parameterisation from manually measured data to predict the effects of variable light on photosynthesis. The plasticity of plants means that the physical structure of the canopy is dependent upon many different factors. Detailed descriptions of canopy architecture are integral to predicting whole canopy photosynthesis due to the spatial and temporal differences in light profiles between canopies. This inherent complexity of the canopy means that previous methods for calculating light interception are often not suitable. 3 -dimensional modelling can provide a quick and easy method to retain this complexity by preserving small variations. This provides a means to more accurately quantify light interception and enable the scaling of cellular level processes up to the whole canopy. Results indicate that a canopy with more upright leaves enables greater light penetration to lower canopy layers, and thus higher photosynthetic productivity. This structural characteristic can also limit radiation-induced damage by preventing exposure to high light, particularly around midday. Whilst these features may lead to higher photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area, per unit ground area, photosynthesis is usually determined by total leaf area of the canopies, and within this study, the erect canopies tended to have lower total leaf areas than the more horizontal canopies. The structural arrangement of plant material often led to low levels of light within the lower canopy layers which were punctuated by infrequent, high light events. However, the slow response of photosynthesis to a change in light levels meant that these sun flecks cannot be used by the plant and thus the optimal strategy should be geared towards light harvesting and efficient photosynthesis under low light conditions. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of photosynthetic processes within the whole canopy and provide a foundation for future work in this area...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is {{daylight}} in buildings. More specifically, the thesis presents {{studies on the}} performance characteristics of venetian blinds used on the interior side of vertical windows. A particular emphasis is put on the daylighting properties of different blind types, {{and the performance of}} daylight redirecting blinds is compared to the performance of traditional white blinds. Three factors are highly important for daylight in buildings: the daylight source, the optical properties of the fenestration or daylighting system, and the characteristics of the architectural space that receives the daylight. Earlier works on daylighting systems in buildings have often documented the daylight levels and the daylight distribution within the space. With that approach {{it can be hard to}} pinpoint exactly why one daylighting system performs differently from another. For the work presented here it has been a goal to focus on the properties of the fenestration system itself, while operating under various daylight conditions that are relevant for high latitudes. Some assumptions have been made regarding the architectural space (sidelighted with an elevated daylight opening), but apart from this it has been sought to describe the system performance more or less independently from the architectural space. This approach can be compared to the approach that has been used in the field of electric lighting. There, luminaries are typically specified by performance characteristics that are not depending on the space in which they are to be applied. For electric luminaries, photometric properties such as luminous flux, light distribution and light output ratio are commonly used to describe the performance of the luminaire, and these values are independent of the space where the luminaire is to be used. In other words, in this thesis, the venetian blind system is treated more or less as a “daylight luminaire”. The main tool applied to analyse the photometric properties of the “daylight luminaire” is Monte Carlo <b>forward</b> <b>ray</b> <b>tracing.</b> The software TracePro is used extensively for this purpose. This software tool is tailor-made for analysing optical systems (including luminaries). Unfortunately, daylight sources are not available in TracePro. For this reason, a substantial effort was made in order to generate TracePro light sources that represent the light from ground, sky and sun. However, once these sources were established and validated, many positive features of the program could be utilised with good effect in order to quantify a variety of different photometric characteristics (e. g. transmittance, light distribution and luminance) of venetian blind systems. In order to analyse these characteristics in a systematic manner the fundamental geometrical properties of venetian blinds need to be understood and these properties have therefore been derived and described. A new evaluation method for daylight redirection systems is presented in this thesis. This method is based on quantification of performance metrics already applied for such systems combined with new performance indicators suggested on the basis of literature findings as well as own studies of venetian blind performance. The main goal of the new method is to provide a tool that can be used to indicate performance of a particular system with respect to 8 different important criteria that are determined by the properties of the daylighting system: (1) supply of daylight, (2) room darkening, (3) light distribution, (4) glare protection, (5) outward view, (6) privacy protection, (7) solar heat supply, and (8) overheating protection. Star diagrams are used to provide a graphical illustration of the performance of the systems, where each of the 8 star points represents one of the 8 performance criteria used to evaluate the system. The new evaluation method has been applied in order to compare the performance of traditional white blinds with that of daylight redirecting blinds. The results show that, when both blinds are operated in the semi-closed position, the performance is roughly the same for all of the performance criteria considered. However, when both blind types are operated in the open blind position, the daylight redirecting blind can perform better with respect to daylight supply and light distribution. The results presented in this thesis also show that these benefits can be obtained without worsening the performance with respect to the other criteria. The performance of blinds has been studied for daylight conditions that are representative for high latitudes. It has sometimes been argued that, due to the typical low sun conditions, especially during the winter months, daylight redirecting blinds are less suitable at high latitudes. However, results presented in this thesis show that daylight redirecting blinds can function very well under most sun conditions that are typical for high latitudes, provided that the spacing to width ratio is carefully selected.

The possibility of using <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> for this game in real-time has been demonstrated first on servers and after further progress later on workstations and last on an early prototype of the Larrabee hardware.After Quake 3: <b>Ray</b> <b>Traced</b> and Quake 4: <b>Ray</b> <b>Traced</b> {{this is the third}} large project that embeds this technique in a modern game for research purposes of alternative rendering algorithms. A successor of this project Wolfenstein: <b>Ray</b> <b>Traced</b> has been created in 2010.|$|R
50|$|The term {{distributed}} <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> {{also sometimes}} {{refers to the}} application of distributed computing techniques to <b>ray</b> <b>tracing,</b> but because of ambiguity this is more properly called parallel <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> (in reference to parallel computing).|$|R
50|$|One {{particular}} form of <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> is radio signal <b>ray</b> <b>tracing,</b> which traces radio signals, modeled as rays, through the ionosphere where they are refracted and/or reflected back to the Earth. This form of <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> involves the integration of differential equations that describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves through dispersive and anisotropic media such as the ionosphere. An example of physics-based radio signal <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> is shown to the right. Radio communicators use <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> to help determine the precise behavior of radio signals as they propagate through the ionosphere.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparative}} study of <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> algorithms implemented on a GPU for three published papers using different spatial data structures evaluated for performance on nine static scenes in walk-through animation. We compare the performance for uniform grids, bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs), and kd-trees evaluated on a GPU for ray casting and Whitted-style <b>ray</b> <b>tracing.</b> We show that performance of <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> with BVHs exceeds the performance of <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> with kd-trees for coherent rays. Contrary, the <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> with kd-trees is faster than that with BVHs for incoherent rays. The performance of <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> with uniform grids is slower than both <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> with BVHs and kd-trees except for uniformly populated scenes. We show that the performance is highly sensitive to details of implementation on kd-trees...|$|R

40|$|Recognizing the {{applicability}} of tomographic imaging in the ionosphere, the reconstruction method {{has been applied to}} generate more realistic low latitude ionospheric background based on the Ionex TEC data and also direct measurement TEC data over West Bengal, India. Using these backgrounds, <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> of high frequency waves has been performed. Influence of Earth’s magnetic field and also the existence of horizontal gradient of electron concentration in the ionosphere are considered separately for analyzing the <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> algorithm. Evaluation of <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> parameters and maximum usable frequency for different ground range ensures the possibility of application of ionospheric tomography technique for accurate <b>ray</b> <b>tracing.</b> The analysis shows accurate <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> for HF waves, thus defeating the restriction of choice of ionospheric model for analytical <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> methods. Performance analysis of the <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> technique presented in this paper ensures the consistency of speed with the other methods...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, the well known <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> {{algorithm}} gained new popularity {{with the introduction}} of interactive <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> methods. The high modularity and the ability to produce highly realistic images make <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> an attractive alternative to raster graphics hardware. Interactive <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> also proved its potential in the field of Mixed Reality rendering and provides novel methods for seamless integration of real and virtual content. Actor insertion methods, a subdomain of Mixed Reality and closely related to virtual television studio techniques, can use <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> for achieving high output quality in conjunction with appropriate visual cues like shadows and reflections at interactive frame rates. In this paper, we show how interactive <b>ray</b> <b>tracing</b> techniques can provide new ways of implementing future virtual studio applications...|$|R
