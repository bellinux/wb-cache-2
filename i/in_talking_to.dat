5|$|The Sûreté's {{indirect}} {{penetration of}} military affairs involved linking the military intelligence service (SRM) to the Sûreté {{and the information}} provided by it, thereby making itself dependent on the political information and even political judgement and agenda of the civilian authorities. The central SRM then relayed this information to its local branches {{as part of its}} SRM Bulletin. As a result of the uprising, the SRM became more closely linked to the Sûreté and its methodology and philosophy in of analysing Vietnamese anti-colonial activity. It was further resolved to have all officers involved in studying revolutionary parties. The focus widened from observing only internal army activities to include developments among Vietnamese anti-colonial organisations at large. General Aubert cited complacency and laziness as a factor in the ineffectiveness of the officers in implement French intelligence strategy. He further asserted that the flow of intelligence between French officers and Vietnamese warrant officers was not as smooth as desired. He felt that his men were often not tactful and discreet enough; citing a lack of language skills or interest <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> their Vietnamese colleagues in an attempt to extricate information. Aubert also believed that the Vietnamese troops were effective in hiding their anti-colonial sentiments from their French colleagues.|$|E

Whitehead's daughter Rose was three years old when the alleged 1901 powered flight took place, and the other children had not yet been born.|$|E
25|$|On September 21, 2007 writers Antonio Socci and Solideo Paolini, {{who have}} {{competing}} books on Fatima, attempted to crash a {{reception at the}} Pontifical Urbanianum University where Bertone was to introduce his book The Last Fatima Visionary: My Meetings with Sister Lucia. They stated that they wished {{to participate in the}} question and answer part of the reception. When told that the cardinal would not be taking questions, they then tried to confront Bertone, who is the Vatican Secretary of State. Security guards hustled them. <b>In</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> reporters afterwards, Socci and Paolini produced a tape recording in which they claimed Archbishop Loris Francesco Capovilla, revealed that there were two texts of the Third Secret, although Capovilla had stated otherwise less than two weeks before.|$|E

25|$|The Venetian Gasparo Gozzi {{was another}} Italian who {{returned}} to Gelli for inspiration in the 14 prose Dialoghi dell’isola di Circe (Dialogues from Circe's Island) published as journalistic pieces between 1760 and 1764. In this moral work, the aim of Ulysses <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the beasts is to learn more of the human condition. It includes figures from fable (The fox and the crow, XIII) and from myth to illustrate its vision of society at variance. Far from needing the intervention of Circe, the victims find their natural condition {{as soon as they}} set foot on the island. The philosopher here is not Gelli’s elephant but the bat that retreats from human contact into the darkness, like Bruno’s fireflies (VI). The only one who wishes to change in Gozzi's work is the bear, a satirist who had dared to criticize Circe and had been changed as a punishment (IX).|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} serious rifts {{occurred}} when Zelda told Scott that their sex life had declined because he was [...] "a fairy" [...] and was likely having a homosexual affair with Hemingway. There is no evidence that either was homosexual, but Scott nonetheless decided to have sex with a prostitute to prove his heterosexuality. Zelda found condoms that he had purchased before any encounter occurred, and a bitter fight ensued, resulting in lingering jealousy.

500|$|Diefenbaker ran on a {{platform}} which concentrated on changes in domestic policies. He pledged {{to work with the}} provinces to reform the Senate. He proposed a vigorous new agricultural policy, seeking to stabilize income for farmers. He sought to reduce dependence on trade with the United States, and to seek closer ties with the United Kingdom. St. Laurent called the Tory platform [...] "a mere cream-puff of a thing—with more air than substance". Diefenbaker and the PC party used television adroitly, whereas St. Laurent stated that he was more interested in seeing people than <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> cameras. Though the Liberals outspent the Progressive Conservatives three to one, according to Newman, their campaign had little imagination, and was based on telling voters that their only real option was to re-elect St. Laurent.|$|E
500|$|Director Csupó {{stated that}} they had no actors {{initially}} in mind for the film. The first actor cast was AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie Burke. Robb wrote Csupó [...] "such a beautiful, heartwarming letter" [...] that expressed her love for the book and the character. Csupó said that he cast her because of [...] "her letter, her enthusiasm, and her love of the material". Robb also conversed with producer Lauren Levine before casting even began, and [...] "their conversation convinced her that, without a doubt, AnnaSophia was meant for this role". Levine said that [...] "it was just so clear <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie, that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence. She might be physically different from Leslie in the book, but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical. It was a match made in heaven." [...] With regard to the character, Robb said [...] "'s one of those people who's just always lit up, who has this glow about her, and no one can bring her down. Leslie's such a lively and energetic character, it was really fun for me to become her." ...|$|E
500|$|Inevitably {{linked with}} Roosevelt, Taft {{generally}} {{falls in the}} shadow of the flamboyant Rough Rider, who chose him to be president, and who took it away. Yet, a portrait of Taft as a victim of betrayal by his best friend is incomplete: as Coletta put it, [...] "Was he a poor politician because he was victimized or because he lacked the foresight and imagination to notice the storm brewing in the political sky until it broke and swamped him?" [...] Adept at using the levers of power in a way his successor could not, Roosevelt generally got what was politically possible out of a situation. Taft was generally slow to act, and when he did, his actions often generated enemies, as in the Ballinger–Pinchot affair. Roosevelt was able to secure positive coverage in the newspapers; Taft had a judge's reticence <b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> reporters, and, with no comment from the White House, hostile journalists would supply the want with a quote from a Taft opponent. And it was Roosevelt who engraved in public memory the image of Taft as a Buchanan-like figure, with a narrow view of the presidency which made him unwilling to act for the public good. Anderson pointed out that Roosevelt's Autobiography (which placed this view in enduring form) was published after both men had left the presidency (in 1913), was intended in part to justify Roosevelt's splitting of the Republican Party, and contains not a single positive reference to the man Roosevelt had admired and hand-picked as his successor. While Roosevelt was biased, he was not alone: every major newspaper reporter of that time who left reminiscences of Taft's presidency was critical of him. Taft replied to his predecessor's criticism with his constitutional treatise on the powers of the presidency.|$|E

2500|$|Shifting identities (cf. [...] "the {{theme of}} identity") makes the past ambiguous: Goldberg is called [...] "Nat," [...] {{but in his}} stories of the past {{he says that he}} was called [...] "Simey" [...] (73) and also [...] "Benny" [...] (92), and he refers to McCann as both [...] "Dermot" [...] (<b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Petey [...] ) and [...] "Seamus" [...] (<b>in</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> McCann [...] ). Given such contradictions, these characters' actual names and thus identities remain unclear. According to John Russell Brown (94), [...] "Falsehoods are {{important}} for Pinter's dialogue, not least when they can be detected only by careful reference from one scene to another....

2500|$|When used together, the SB-300 {{receiver}} and SB-400 transmitter could transceive and had many other {{features of the}} S/Line, including crystal bandwidth filters and 1kHz tuning dial resolution.
