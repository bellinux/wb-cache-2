It is also time to evolve beyond the (second-stage) sensitive and caring wimp ideal, all heart and no spine. Heart and spine must be united in a single man, and then gone beyond in the fullest expression of love and consciousness possible, which requires a deep relaxation into the infinite openness of this present moment. And this takes {{a new kind of}} (third-stage) guts. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> the superior man."

2500|$|During one of {{the many}} festivals that would take place in the city, the people would gather in their temple and place offerings of food before their idols.

Can they help you or hurt you?" [...] The people would reply, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> our forefathers." [...] Ibrahim declared [...] "I am sick of your gods! Truly I am their enemy." [...] After several years, Ibrahim became a young man. He still could not believe that his people were worshipping the statues. He laughed whenever he saw them entering the temple, lowering their heads, silently offering the statues the best of their food, crying and asking forgiveness from them. He started feeling angry towards his people, who could not realize that these are only stones that could neither benefit nor harm them.|$|E
2500|$|The texts {{attributed}} to the Apostolic Fathers, the earliest post-Biblical texts we have, share several key themes, particularly the call to unity {{in the face of}} internal divisions and perceptions of persecution, the reality of the charisms, especially prophecy, visions and Christian gnosis, which is understood as [...] "a gift of the Holy Spirit that enables us to know Christ" [...] through meditating on the scriptures and on the Cross of Christ. (This understanding of gnosis {{is not the same as}} that developed by the Gnostics, who focused on esoteric knowledge that is available only to a few people but that allows them to free themselves from the evil world.) These authors also discuss the notion of the [...] "two ways", that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life and the way of death; this idea has biblical roots, being found in both the Sermon on the Mount and the Torah. The two ways are then related to the notion of purity of heart, which is developed by contrasting it against the divided or duplicitous heart and by linking it to the need for asceticism, which keeps the heart whole/pure. Purity of heart was especially important given perceptions of martyrdom, which many writers discussed in theological terms, seeing it not as an evil but as an opportunity to truly die for the sake of God—the ultimate example of ascetic practice. Martyrdom could also be seen as symbolic in its connections with the Eucharist and with baptism.|$|E
