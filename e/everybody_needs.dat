50|$|As part of {{exchange}} theory, bilateral trading models consider sellers and buyers and use game theory {{models of the}} bargaining in networks in order to predict the behaviour of agents {{depending on the type}} of network. The outcome of transactions can be determined by, for example, the number of sellers a buyer is connected to, or vice versa for which Corominas-Bosch built a very simple model. Another case is when the agents agree on the transaction through an auction and their decision making during the auction depends on the link structure. Kranton and Minehart came to the conclusion that if we consider markets as networks it can enable sellers to pool uncertainty in demand. As building links is costly, due to the trade-off not <b>everybody</b> <b>need</b> to be linked to everybody in the network. Sparsity in the network will prove to be efficient.|$|R
