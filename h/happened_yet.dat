25|$|Today, as a {{non-nuclear-weapon state}} {{party to the}} NPT, Brazil has the right under {{international}} norms to manufacture a naval reactor and produce highly enriched uranium to fuel it. While that has not <b>happened</b> <b>yet,</b> the possibility of Brazil enriching uranium at a level higher than the 20-percent threshold and employing it at a military facility has prompted continued concerns over its nuclear intentions.|$|E
25|$|Alford {{takes as}} his {{starting}} point {{the golden rule}} that the pharaoh had {{to be buried in}} the earth, i.e. at ground level or below, and this leads him to conclude that Khufu was interred in an ingeniously concealed cave whose entrance is today sealed up in the so-called Well Shaft adjacent to a known cave called the Grotto. He has lobbied the Egyptian authorities to explore this area of the pyramid with ground penetrating radar, and although nothing has <b>happened</b> <b>yet</b> {{it is quite possible that}} one day this theory will be put to the test.|$|E

Additionally, the marker mii can be used with any type of intransitive verb.|$|E

500|$|An {{election}} {{may also}} {{happen if the}} governing party loses {{the confidence of the}} legislature, by the defeat of a supply bill or tabling of a confidence motion, but in Alberta's history of massive majorities in the assembly, this has not <b>happened</b> <b>yet</b> in the province's history.

500|$|In Louisiana, Thompson helped draft a 2006 bill {{sponsored}} by state representative Roy Burrell {{to ban the}} sale of violent video games to buyers under 18 (HB1381). In an effort to avoid constitutional problems, it avoided trying to define [...] "violent" [...] and instead adopted {{a variation of the}} Miller obscenity test: sales to minors would be illegal based on community standards if the game appealed to [...] "the minor's morbid interest in violence", was patently offensive based on adult standards of suitability for minors, and lacked serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors. The bill was passed unanimously by the state House and approved by the Senate Judiciary A Committee, despite industry opposition and predictions that it too would be unconstitutional. The Shreveport Times editorialized that Thompson's support of the bill [...] "should immediately set off alarms" [...] and described Thompson as someone who [...] "thrives on chasing cultural ambulances". In defense of the bill, Thompson said that it was needed for public safety, and that it was a [...] "miracle" [...] that a Columbine-type event hadn't <b>happened</b> <b>yet</b> in Louisiana. However, the ESA filed suit under Entertainment Software Association v. Foti, and U.S. District Judge James Brady issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the law from taking effect until full judicial review can be done. The law was permanently enjoined in late November 2006, and the state was ordered to pay the legal fees of the plaintiffs. Judge Brady was [...] "dumbfounded" [...] that state legislators and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco wasted taxpayer money by trying to enact the law.|$|E

No cause of death was {{immediately}} determined; although his manager Michael Lippman conjectured that heart failure was the cause of death, and that Michael [...] "passed away peacefully". Fawaz described, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, finding the performer on Christmas morning, [...] "I went round there to wake him up and he was just gone, lying peacefully in bed. We don't know what <b>happened</b> <b>yet.</b> Everything had been very complicated recently, but George was looking forward to Christmas, and so was I." ...|$|E

It was the pairs first title since coming back together after the 2012 Olympics. The win was commended by the Indian media as the duo were the only women's doubles pair from the country to win a Grand Prix title. Jwala expressed her concerns for lack of support for doubles in the country and prompted the association and the government to promote doubles. Jwala told NDTV in an interview, [...] "We though big wins would wake up concerned people but it hasn't <b>happened</b> <b>yet.</b> We are still confident of representing India at an international level but here, extra support is needed as we can't afford it on our own.|$|E

'However trivial a thing,' he says, 'a rotten shell may appear to some, yet these monuments of nature are more certain tokens of antiquity than coins or medals, since the best of those may be counterfeited or made by art and design, as may also books, manuscripts, and inscriptions, as all the learned are now sufficiently satisfied has often been actually practised,' [...] 'and though it must be granted that {{it is very difficult to}} read them and to raise a chronology out of them, and to state the intervals of the time wherein such or such catastrophes and mutations have <b>happened,</b> <b>yet</b> it is not impossible.|$|E
2500|$|Boyzone manager Louis Walsh {{is quoted}} as saying: [...] "We're all {{absolutely}} devastated. I'm in complete shock. I was only with him on Monday at an awards ceremony. We don't know much about what's <b>happened</b> <b>yet.</b> I only heard after The X Factor (UK television talent show on which Walsh is a judge) and we will rally around each other this week. He was a great man." [...] Walsh {{dropped out of the}} live results show of The X Factor on 11 October 2009 {{as a direct result of}} Gately's death. Simon Cowell addressed the issue at the start of the programme. He said: [...] "This is really, really tragic news I want to send out my condolences to the family, our thoughts are with Louis". That edition of the show attracted an [...] "absolutely huge" [...] audience which was said to have been seeking updates on the singer's death. Walsh also was absent from the second week of The X Factor which coincided with Gately's funeral,—later commenting: [...] "I never want to watch the show at home again. I've been shouting at the TV all night"—at which Walsh was too upset to speak. My First Time, a stage show which was set to star bandmember Keith Duffy, was cancelled entirely. Duffy, Graham, Keating and Lynch had memorial [...] "76 09" [...] tattoos (Gately's birth and death years) engraved on their bodies when they brought Gately's body home.|$|E
30|$|In {{the group}} of one to two-year-old babies who have not fully {{developed}} their language skills, some babies often bite each other.

2500|$|For {{the most}} part, the {{adaptation}} followed Q1 exactly (and F1 for 3.2) with some minor alterations. For example, {{a few lines}} were cut from various scenes, such as Lavinia's [...] "Ay, for these slips have made him noted long" [...] (2.3.87), thus removing the continuity error regarding {{the duration of the}} Goths residence in Rome. Other examples include Titus' [...] "Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands,/To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o'er,/How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?" [...] (3.2.26–28), Marcus' [...] "What, what! The lustful sons of Tamora/Performers of this heinous, bloody deed" [...] (4.1.78–79), and Titus and Marcus' brief conversation about Taurus and Aries (4.3.68–75). The adaptation also includes some lines from Q1 which were removed in subsequent editions; at 1.1.35 Titus' [...] "bearing his valiant sons/in coffins from the field" [...] continues with [...] "and at this day,/To the Monument of that Andronicy/Done sacrifice of expiation,/And slaine the Noblest prisoner of the Gothes." [...] These lines are usually omitted because they create a continuity problem regarding the sacrifice of Alarbus, which hasn't <b>happened</b> <b>yet</b> in the text. However, Howell got around this problem by beginning the play at 1.1.64 – the entrance of Titus. Then, at 1.1.168, after the sacrifice of Alarbus, lines 1.1.1 to 1.1.63 (the introductions of Bassianus and Saturninus) take place, thus Titus' reference to Alarbus' sacrifice makes chronological sense.|$|E
