40|$|Consumption of {{migrating}} juvenile Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) and steelhead(Salmo gairdneri) by gulls {{was estimated}} below the turbine area of Wanapum Dam on theColumbia River in 1982. Foraging {{success of the}} gulls, chiefly ring-billed gulls (Larusdelawarensis), averaged 65 % during bright light conditions and 51 % during the evening. Thenumber <b>of</b> <b>salmonids</b> consumed by gulls ranged from 50 to 562 fish/h. Multiple-regressionanalysis indicates that the number <b>of</b> <b>salmonids</b> consumed by gulls is significantly affected by thepassage rate of fish through the turbines and spillgates, and by light intensity. The number ofsalmonids consumed by gulls foraging below the turbines during 25 d <b>of</b> peak <b>salmonid</b> migrationwas approximately 111, 750 to 119, 250 fish or 2 % of the estimated spring migration. Althoughsome salmonids consumed by gulls had been killed when passing through the turbines, themortality <b>of</b> <b>salmonids</b> caused by gulls is potentially important. Inexpensive measures could beimplemented to discourage foraging by gulls below the turbine area of Columbia River dams,thereby enhancing survival <b>of</b> emigrating <b>salmonids...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{special issue}} of Evolutionary Applications {{comprises}} 15 papers that illustrate how evolutionary principles can inform the conservation and management <b>of</b> <b>salmonid</b> fishes. Several papers address the past evolutionary history <b>of</b> <b>salmonids</b> to gain insights into their likely plastic and genetic responses to future environmental change. The remaining papers consider potential evolutionary responses to climate warming, biological invasions, artificial propagation, habitat alteration, and harvesting. All of these papers consider how such influences might alter selective regimes, which should then favour plastic or genetic responses. Some of the papers {{then go on to}} document such responses, at least some of which are genetically based and adaptive.
