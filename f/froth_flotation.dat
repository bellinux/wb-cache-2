5|$|Most lead ores {{contain a}} low {{percentage}} of lead (rich ores have a typical content of 3–8%) {{which must be}} concentrated for extraction. During initial processing, ores typically undergo crushing, dense-medium separation, grinding, <b>froth</b> <b>flotation,</b> and drying.

5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{separation}} of cobalt from copper and nickel. They depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore. One separation step involves <b>froth</b> <b>flotation,</b> in which surfactants bind to different ore components, leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores. Subsequent roasting converts the ores to the cobalt sulfate, whereas the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide. Leaching with water extracts the sulfate together with the arsenates. The residues are further leached with sulfuric acid, yielding a solution of copper sulfate. Cobalt can also be leached from the slag of copper smelting.|$|E

40|$|A {{literature}} review has highlighted {{the need to}} measure <b>flotation</b> <b>froth</b> rheology in order to fully characterise {{the role of the}} <b>froth</b> in the <b>flotation</b> process. The initial investigation using a coaxial cylinder viscometer for froth rheology measurement {{led to the development of}} a new device employing a vane measuring head. The modified rheometer was used in industrial scale flotation tests at Mt. Isa Copper Concentrator. The measured froth rheograms show a non-Newtonian nature for the <b>flotation</b> <b>froths</b> (pseudoplastic flow). The evidence of the non-Newtonian flow has questioned the validity of application of the Laplace equation in froth motion modelling as used by a number of researchers, since the assumption of irrotational flow is violated. Correlations between the froth rheology and the froth retention time, water hold-up in the froth and concentrate grades have been found. These correlations are independent of air flow rate (test data at various air flow rates fall on one similar trend line). This implies that froth rheology may be used as a lumped parameter for other operating variables in flotation modelling and scale up. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Recent advances in hydrometallurgical techniques resulted in significantly purer metallic nickel product. Most sulfide deposits have traditionally been processed by concentration through a <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> process followed by pyrometallurgical extraction. In hydrometallurgical processes, nickel sulfide ores are concentrated with flotation (differential flotation if Ni/Fe ratio is too low) and then smelted. The nickel matte is further processed with the Sherritt-Gordon process. First, copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide, leaving a concentrate of cobalt and nickel. Then, solvent extraction is used to separate the cobalt and nickel, with the final nickel content greater than 99%.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography : leaves 157 - 163. This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of a machine vision system for the on-line analysis of <b>flotation</b> <b>froth</b> images. The size and shape of bubbles that constitute the <b>flotation</b> <b>froth</b> convey considerable information on the performance of the flotation process. A method whereby this size and shape information can be automatically extracted from froth images is highly desirable. In this research, a system was developed which acquires froth image using a video camera, and then rapidly identifies the bubbles in the froth by segmenting the image using a morphological operation known as the Fast Watershed Transform. Bubble size and shape information is extracted from the segmented images and can be correlated with metallurgical and other data from concentrator plants in order to elucidate relationships between froth appearance and plant performance. The machine vision system developed was tested on a platinum concentrator plant, and is able to identify and characterise variations in <b>flotation</b> <b>froth</b> appearance, which occur in response to changes in process inputs.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} use of a machine vision system to explore the relationships between the structure of the <b>flotation</b> <b>froth</b> surface, <b>flotation</b> performance and selected operational parameters in a flotation operation aimed at the beneficiation of Platinum Group Minerals. The machine vision system employed made use of the Fast Watershed Transform to resolve the froth surface into a distribution of bubble sizes. This distribution was then used to describe changes occurring {{in the structure of the}} <b>flotation</b> <b>froth</b> surface. An initial batch flotation programme concentrated on the influences that changing the frother and depressant dosage levels had on a flotation system treating a sample of Merensky ore, which originated from Rustenburg Platinum Mine's Amandelbult Section. It was found that both depressant and frother dosage had marked influences on the metallurgical performance of the flotation system. Furthermore, it was found that changes in these operational variables resulted in changes in the structure of the <b>flotation</b> <b>froth</b> surface, which were quantified by the machine vision system. These results highlighted the potential of the machine vision system to identify when either the frother or the depressant dosages had moved towards levels that would negatively influence flotation performance. A plant-based experimental campaign was then conducted on the Amandelbult Merensky Primary Rougher Flotation Section, in which the frother and depressant levels were manipulated. In terms of metallurgical performance of the flotation system, it was found that a strong relationship existed between the grade of concentrate being recovered and the rate of mass yield from the flotation unit. Furthermore, it was found that increasing the frother dosage led to an increased rate of mass yield and a decrease in concentrate grade, while increasing the depressant led to a decreased rate of mass yield at an increase in concentrate grade. As both of these variables influence metallurgical performance, a strategy that enables the automatic identification of which reagent dosage had deviated from the desired level would clearly be of great value. A strategy based on the observation of bubble size distributions at the top and bottom of the flotation bank, and which is capable of identifying whether either the frother or the depressant dosages are changing, is suggested in this work...|$|R

25|$|When the Basinghall Mining Syndicate {{took over}} the mine in 1936 all the old {{equipment}} in the mill was removed and a completely new electrically-powered plant was designed for high production rates. The entire output of the mine was crushed in a ball mill {{to the size of}} fine sand before being passed into a bank of <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> cells. In these, organic oils and acids caused the galena particles to become attached to rising air bubbles to form a grey foam which overflowed a weir at the top. These gave a good separation: concentrates averaged 75% galena and the waste tailings only 0.2% galena. The concentrate was dried, conveyed to ore-bins and then hand-loaded onto lorries for carriage to smelting mills at Ryton near Newcastle upon Tyne. However the ball mill was unable to cope with the high volumes of ore in the early 1940s. New concentrating tables were introduced. By the 1950s these processed 60% of the ore and produced concentrates of 82% galena. The remaining 40% of ore went to the ball mill and <b>froth</b> <b>flotation</b> plant.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of robust automatic control systems has proved {{difficult because of}} the complexity of the problem. Flotation is notorious for its susceptibility to process upsets and consequently its poor performance, making successful flotation control systems an elusive goal. Machine vision systems provide a novel solution to several of the problems encountered in conventional flotation systems for monitoring and control. In previous work powerful techniques have been developed for the extraction of <b>flotation</b> <b>froth</b> appearance features such as average bubble size, froth mobility and stability, chromatic information and textural properties of surface froth.

40|$|Integrated {{hardware}} and software (HW&SW) solutions are very cheap and easy to implement at industrial level in many sectors. These innovations can thus be profitably applied {{in the field of}} mineral processing and more specifically in flotation processes, especially adopting new processing detection strategies and analysis of <b>flotation</b> <b>froth</b> features oriented to analyze both the whole and the single <b>flotation</b> <b>froth</b> characters. In this perspective new procedures can be successfully applied to carry out quite "simple" and "easy-to-apply" determinations and new control actions on routine bases, both at laboratory ("off-line" control) and processing plant scale ("on-line" control). The possibility to utilize new analytical "on-line" digital imaging techniques in the field of flotation can open new horizons. To successfully reach these goals, several conditions, linked with the particular nature of the samples (froth images) have to be verified: the adoption of specific sampling procedures (easy and correct acquisition of the images necessary for the analysis); the identification of those parameters that extracted from the images can describe the characters concerning the froths (morphological and morphometrical parameters, color and/or textural information); the procedures able to extract the characters of interest from the images (points, lines, 2 D and 3 D analysis); the identification of a correct target-oriented-processing-strategy to manipulate and process the previous extracted characters; the synthesis of the results and the definition of one or more correlation functions able to establish a correspondence between digital information, extracted from the images, and bulk materials handling and processing; the definition of suitable control strategies, at a different level of interaction/s with the process/es, to apply specific control action on the process itself.

This paper presents some of the difficulties associated with bubble size measurements that are not often dealt with. Many machine vision systems have been developed on <b>flotation</b> <b>froths</b> which have consistent bubbles that are generally of similar size. Difficulties arise when these systems are applied to froths that have a large range of bubble sizes. Some recent developments (Forbes and de Jager, 2004; Wang et al., 2003) have resulted in algorithms which can successfully segment tiny and large bubbles simultaneously in a single image. This has resulted in accurate bubble size distributions being available for these froths. It has also been noted that many plants have froths which have “dynamic bubble size distributions”. That is, the bubble size distribution of the froth changes rapidly. Two images of the same froth, taken less than a second apart can result in distinctly different bubble size distributions. This has important implications for the number of frames of video that need to be analysed in order to be able to distinguish between two different froth types. ...|$|R
