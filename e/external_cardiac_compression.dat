40|$|Pulseless {{electrical}} activity occurs when organised or semi-organised {{electrical activity}} of the heart persists but the product of systemic vascular resistance {{and the increase in}} systemic arterial flow generated by the ejection of the left venticular stroke volume is not sufficient to produce a clinically detectable pulse. Pulseless electrical activity encompasses a very heterogeneous variety of severe circulatory shock states ranging in severity from pseudo-cardiac arrest to effective cardiac arrest. Outcomes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation for pulseless electrical activity are generally poor. Impairment of cardiac filling is the limiting factor to cardiac output in many scenarios of pulseless electrical activity, including extreme vasodilatory shock states. There is no evidence that <b>external</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> can increase cardiac output when impaired cardiac filling is the limiting factor to cardiac output. If impaired cardiac filling is the limiting factor to cardiac output and the heart is effectively ejecting all the blood returning to it, then <b>external</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> can only increase cardiac output if it increases venous return and cardiac filling. Repeated cardiac compression asynchronous with the patient's cardiac cycle and raised mean intrathoracic pressure due to chest compression can be expected to reduce rather than to increase cardiac filling and therefore to reduce rather than to increase cardiac output in such circumstances. The hypothesis is proposed that the performance of <b>external</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> will have zero or negative effect on cardiac output in pulseless electrical activity when impaired cardiac filling is the limiting factor to cardiac output. <b>External</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> may be both directly and indirectly harmful to significant sub-groups of patients with pulseless electrical activity. We have neither evidence nor theory to provide comfort that <b>external</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> is not harmful in many scenarios of pulseless electrical activity.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate {{the influence of the}} physical fitness of a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) provider on the performance of and physiologic response to CPR. To this end, comparisons were made of sedentary and physically active subjects in terms of CPR performance and physiologic variables. Two study groups were established: group P (n = 14), composed of sedentary, professional CPR rescuers (mean [± SD]; age, 34 ± 6 years; V̇O 2 max, 32. 5 ± 5. 5 mL/kg/min), and group Ex (n = 14), composed of physically active, nonexperienced subjects (age, 34 ± 6 years; V̇O 2 max, 44. 5 ± 8. 5 mL/kg/min). Each subject was required to perform an 18 -min CPR session, which involved manual <b>external</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>compressions</b> (ECCs) on an electronic teaching mannequin following accepted standard CPR guidelines. Subjects' gas exchange parameters and heart rates (HRs) were monitored throughout the trial. Variables indicating the adequacy of the ECCs (ECC depth and the percentage of incorrect compressions and hand placements) also were determined. Overall CPR performance was similar in both groups. The indicators of ECC adequacy fell within accepted limits (ie, an ECC depth between 38 and 51 mm). However, fatigue prevented four subjects from group P from completing the trial. In contrast, the physiologic responses to CPR differed between groups. The indicators of the intensity of effort during the trial, such as HR or percentage of maximum oxygen uptake (V̇O 2 max) were higher in group P subjects than group Ex subjects, respectively (HRs {{at the end of the}} trial, 139 ± 22 vs 115 ± 17 beats/min, p < 0. 01; percentage of V̇O 2 max after 12 min of CPR, 46. 7 ± 9. 7 % vs 37. 2 ± 10. 4 %, p < 0, 05).

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} dynamic <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> on left {{ventricular}} contractile efficiency was assessed {{in terms of}} the pressure-volume relationship and myocardial oxygen consumption. In 11 excised cross-circulated dog hearts, the ventricle was directly compressed during systole (dynamic <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression).</b> Measurements for pressure-volume area (a measure of total mechanical energy), external work, and myocardial oxygen consumption were done before and during dynamic <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression.</b> Dynamic <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> increased pressure-volume area by 28 % ± 17 % (mean plus or minus the standard deviation) and external work by 24 % ± 20 % (p = 0. 0000185 and 0. 0000212, respectively) at given end-diastolic and stroke volumes without affecting myocardial oxygen consumption. As a result, the oxygen cost of pressure-volume area, that is, the slope of the myocardial oxygen consumption–pressure-volume area relationship, significantly decreased by 16 % ± 13 % (p = 0. 0000135) whereas the pressure-volume area–independent myocardial oxygen consumption was unchanged. Then, contractile efficiency, that is, the reciprocal of the slope of the myocardial oxygen consumption–pressure-volume area relationship in joules significantly improved from 45 % ± 8 % to 53 % ± 13 % (p = 0. 0000437). When the native myocardial oxygen consumption–pressure-volume area relationship was assessed by subtracting the dynamic <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> pressure applied to the heart, the slope of the myocardial oxygen consumption–pressure-volume area relationship returned to the control level. This indicates that the contractile efficiency of the native heart was not affected by dynamic <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression.</b> We conclude that dynamic <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> enhances left ventricular pump function by improving the contractile efficiency of the overall heart leaving the energetics of the native heart unchanged.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Direct <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> {{improves}} effective ventricular contractility. However, associated {{reductions in}} filling volumes {{and increases in}} arterial pressure occurring {{at the onset of}} direct <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> limit the degree to which cardiac output is augmented. We tested the hypothesis that active preload and afterload control maximizes the hemodynamic effectiveness of direct <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression.</b> Methods and results: Studies in isolated canine hearts loaded with a computer-controlled volume servo system that mimicked heart failure were used to clearly define the hemodynamic effects of direct <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression.</b> Immediately on initiation of direct <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression,</b> ventricular end-diastolic pressure and volume decreased substantially, arterial pressure increased, but stroke volume did not change significantly. When end-diastolic pressure was restored to about 20 mm Hg, stroke volume doubled; decreasing afterload resistance further increased stroke volume by about 30 %. Such load adjustments were then tested in vivo in a canine model of acute heart failure induced by coronary artery microembolizations titrated to decrease cardiac output to 33 % ± 9 % of control as end-diastolic pressure rose to 20. 6 ± 2. 2 mm Hg. Direct <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> decreased end-diastolic pressure to 11. 4 ± 2. 6 mm Hg while increasing cardiac output from 0. 8 ± 0. 2 to 1. 4 ± 0. 5 L/min (to only ~ 55 % of normal). Restoring end-diastolic pressure to 19. 6 ± 2. 2 mm Hg by infusions of saline solution increased cardiac output to 1. 9 ± 0. 5 L/min. Afterload reduction (nitroprusside), while maintaining end-diastolic pressure at 19. 8 ± 1. 3 mm Hg, increased cardiac output to its baseline, 2. 8 ± 1. 1 L/min. Conclusions: Direct <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> significantly improves ventricular pumping capacity and can restore cardiac output to about 60 % of normal in the setting of acute heart failure.

The Nitinol fibers are woven on a Kevlar mesh surrounding each ventricle. The fibers are electrically driven with a dedicated control unit developed for this purpose.

40|$|Most {{conventional}} cardiac assist devices today employ {{continuous flow}} blood pumps to supplement {{function in the}} dysfunctional heart. Continuous flow pumps are predominantly preferred to the original pulsatile pumps due to the smaller size (greater implantability) and higher efficiency they achieve. However, interest in the impact of vascular pulsatility on human health has arisen from the growing evidence of higher complications with nonpulsatile devices compared to pulsatile devices. Direct cardiac compression (DCC) offers a unique solution to the pulsatility issue {{through the application of}} force directly to the heart 2 ̆ 7 s surface. It is believed that employing the existing pump architecture of the heart better produces natural pulsatility than blood pumps in series with the heart. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if <b>external</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> by direct mechanical ventricular actuation (DMVA), produces arterial pulsatile quality to that of the naturally beating heart. This concept was tested using DMVA, a non-blood contacting DCC device capable of actively augmenting diastole, on an acute fibrillating model in nine large animals (seven canine and two swine). Hearts, being fibrillated in order to eliminate the heart 2 ̆ 7 s natural function to generate pulsatile blood flow, were supported by the DMVA device. Progressive myocardial weakening and acute failure throughout the experiment resulted from repeated cycles of fibrillation and defibrillation. Aortic pressures and flows were recorded periodically in ten second captures. Conventional measures of pulsatility (pulse pressure, energy equivalent pressure, surplus hemodynamic energy, frequency pulsatility index) were computed from these captures for comparison of arterial pulsatility between the naturally beating heart and the fibrillating heart supported by DMVA. Pulsatility in the naturally beating heart was measured from both the healthy normal heart and the weakened heart. Mean aortic flows and pressures were equivalent between DMVA condition and unsupported weakened heart condition. The results suggests pulsatile similarity between DMVA support for the fibrillating heart and the unsupported naturally beating heart. No index of arterial pulsatility was significantly lower from DMVA support heart compared to the unsupported beating heart at the same level of cardiac output (p 3 ̆e 0. 05).

40|$|The {{pathophysiological}} {{mechanisms of}} cardiogenic dyspnoea {{in patients with}} large hiatal hernia (HH) are poorly understood. Data obtained from 163 HH patients (Doppler-echocardiography, cardiac CT, MRI, respiratory function and exercise testing) were analysed. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> in HH patients involves the left atrium (LA), coronary sinus, inferior pulmonary veins and posterobasal left ventricle; and is associated with significant exercise impairment that improves following corrective surgery. LA compression appears to modulate atrial function at rest to preserve left ventricular (LV) filling by increasing passive LA emptying function to compensate for decreased active emptying volume. LA filling is impaired further after a standardised meal and during preload reduction induced by Valsalva manouevre. Baseline exercise capacity is independently predicted by LA compression and right ventricular outflow tract diameter and, moreover, the improvement in exercise capacity post-operatively is independently predicted by the magnitude of increase in LA diameter. While improvements in lung volumes and reduced gas-trapping are also seen following HH surgery, these are relatively modest compared to the significant resolution of <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> and improvement in exercise capacity.

40|$|Benign teratoma, also {{referred}} as dermoid cyst, do {{occur in the}} mediastinum. However, their intrapericardial location has been reported very occasionally. This case of intrapericardial benign solid teratoma is being presented because of its rarity and its unusual presentation as a case of empyema, with features of <b>cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> and pericardial effusion...|$|R
40|$|A 48 {{year old}} man with amoebic {{pericarditis}} did not improve after pericardiocentesis. Facilities for echocardiography and haemodynamic studies were not available. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>compression</b> was suspected and at emergency pericardiectomy subacute effusive constrictive amoebic pericarditis was found. The patient recovered. This {{is believed to be}} the first report of a case of subacute effusive constrictive pericarditis caused by amoebiasis...|$|R
