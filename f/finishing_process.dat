Some processes also use a filter system to allow parts or other materials in the cylinder to be separated.|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing of {{precision}} parts requires final finishing operation, which is critical and labour intensive.

In the present technological world many products require a surface roughness of the- 9 order of nanometer (10 m).

Hand-held cameras have been used. For color management, Prieto employed Gamma & Density Company's 3cP color management and correction software, using the American Society of Cinematographers' Color Decision List to keep color consistent throughout shooting, dailies, post and digital intermediate <b>finishing</b> <b>process.</b> The digital effects were handled by Rhythm and Hues.|$|E
25|$|A robotic CNC router is a {{computer}} controlled robotic arm in which the router or spindle {{is part of a}} head mounted {{to the end of the}} robot arm. The main difference between a CNC router and a robotic router is the ability to router using a 4,5 or 6-axis coordinate system because of the rotation allowed by the joints in the robot arm as well as the rotation of the head that the router spindle is mounted to. CAD/CAM software programming can be used to indicate the part location, which is usually fixed to an immobile table and clamped in place. The robotic router trimming process then follows a programmed path for router cutting to create a part from a blank or more commonly- to trim the flashing from a molded part to complete the <b>finishing</b> <b>process</b> that in the past, was a manual process.|$|E

500|$|Ammonia fuming is a wood <b>finishing</b> <b>process</b> that darkens {{wood and}} {{brings out the}} grain pattern. [...] It {{consists}} of exposing the wood to fumes from a strong aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide which reacts with the tannins in the wood. [...] The process works best on white oak {{because of the high}} tannin content of this wood. [...] Fumed oak is also called smoked oak. [...] Other species may also be fumed but usually will not darken as much as white oak. [...] The introduction of the process is usually associated with the American furniture maker Gustav Stickley {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century, but fuming was certainly known in Europe some time before this.|$|E
2500|$|Ancient guqins {{were made}} of little more than wood and strings of twisted silk. Ornaments {{included}} inlaid dots of mother-of-pearl or other similar materials. Traditionally, the sounding board was made of Chinese parasol wood firmiana simplex, its rounded shape symbolising the heavens. The bottom was made of Chinese Catalpa, catalpa ovata, its flat shape symbolising earth. [...] Modern instruments are most frequently made of Cunninghamia or other similar timbers. The traditional finish is of raw lacquer mixed with powdered deer horn, and the <b>finishing</b> <b>process</b> could take months of curing to complete. The finish develops cracks over time, and these cracks are believed to improve the instrument's sound as the wood and lacquer release tension. An antique guqin’s age can be determined by this snake like crack pattern called [...] "duanwen" [...] (斷紋).|$|E
2500|$|Madison Township {{had many}} mill streams {{that were used}} to {{generate}} water power. [...] The Warne family owned fulling mills in the area.

[...] The mill {{is said to have been}} run behind Old Bridge High School and flows east into the Matawan Creek. [...] The area of Old Bridge was also known for their numerous snuff mills. [...] The Washington Snuff mill (later renamed the Dill Snuff Mill) was established in 1801 and was located on Mount Pleasant and Old Bridge Turnpike (now Route 516). Snuff is a scented tobacco product that was used by men and women during that time period.|$|E

40|$|Selective laser melting (SLM) is a metal {{additive}} manufacturing (AM) process involving the selective layer-wise scanning of a powder bed. It {{is capable of}} producing metal parts for applications including the aerospace and medical industries. However, components made by SLM are currently not always reaching their potential in industry, due to limitations in the process leading to inadequate part quality. One particular example is the attachment of partially melted particles to the surface which can act as crack-initiation sites reducing part fatigue life. It is therefore necessary to find <b>finishing</b> <b>processes</b> for metal AM parts that remove these particles without compromising the advantages of AM. This paper presents the challenges of finishing AM parts, outlines techniques reported in the literature, and proposes an experimental framework for analysing the effectiveness of <b>finishing</b> <b>processes</b> for AM.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The Thomas Kay Woolen Mill {{operated}} between 1890 and 1962. The mill produced predominately woolen {{blankets and}} woolen fabrics for outerwear garments.

Business records of the Thomas Kay Woolen Mill which were found in the museum's archives, newspaper articles, extant mill machinery, old machinery manuals, and woolen process texts provided most of the documentation for this study. Generally, the <b>finishing</b> <b>processes</b> and <b>finishing</b> machinery used by the mill remained the same during its seventy years of operation.

40|$|The use {{of clean}} water in textile {{finishing}} is both common and very expensive. Effluent water subjected to advanced methods of physical, chemical, and biological treatment {{could be used for}} this purpose. However, information obtained from industry and the literature shows that effluent water obtained from different <b>finishing</b> <b>processes</b> may be reused without being totally purified. In this paper, a method is proposed to determine the viability of reusing effluent water obtained from different textile <b>finishing</b> <b>processes</b> of cotton fabrics after just basic treatments. These treatments include; filtering, airing, pH regulating and ion exchange. Effluent water obtained in different textile <b>finishing</b> <b>processes</b> was analysed in terms of pH value, COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), SS (Suspended Solids), colour, hardness and conductivity. Effluent water for treatment and the process where the treated water was reused were determined by means of the proposed method, based on a multiple criteria decision making approach.
