5|$|Based on his {{participation}} in the debate and his reputation, Hoffmann received the commission to design the new building. Without any kind of competitive bidding or restrictions, he was commissioned to design it with space for approximately 1,000 employees. In 1900, the prosperous city decided the building should feature a tower. Hoffmann's design was accepted in 1901, and demolition of the <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> began. The cornerstone was laid in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{points in}} the defence network– bridges, tunnels and other weak spots– were called nodes or points of resistance. These were {{fortified}} with removable road blocks, barbed wire entanglements, and land mines. These passive defences were overlooked by trench works, gun and mortar emplacements, and pillboxes. In places entire villages were fortified using barriers of scaffolding, sandbagged positions and loopholes in <b>existing</b> <b>buildings.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of retrofitting an <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> by connecting the <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> to a new building using connecting dampers. The new building is base-isolated and visco-elastic dampers are assigned as connecting dampers. Scaled models are tested under three different earthquake records using a shaking table. The <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> and the new building are 9 and 8 stories respectively. The <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> model shows more than 3 % increase in damping ratio. The maximum dynamic responses and the root mean square responses of the <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> model to earthquakes are substantially reduced by at least 20 % and 59 % respectively. Further, numerical models are developed by conducting time-history analysis to predict {{the performance of the}} proposed seismic mitigation system. The predictions agree well with the test results. Numerical simulations are carried out to optimize the properties of connecting dampers and base isolators. It is demonstrated that more than 50 % of the peak responses can be reduced by properly adjusting the properties of connecting dampers and base isolators.

In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) {{announced}} {{a campaign to}} redesign the buildings on the island, and six designs were submitted. One of the designs removed the <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> and piers to replace them with walking paths, and added a large curvilinear concrete building to the island. The design called for many windows in the building to create a large panorama of the surrounding seascape. In September 2010 Urban Splash placed the pier up for sale, citing a downfall in business caused by the recession as their reason.|$|E
5|$|The land {{upon which}} the site was {{developed}} was originally owned by Edward Hilliard. It was chosen in March 1915 by Wing Commander T. O.

In 1917, the Ruislip site was revisited, and on 3 July was selected to house a depot for the Royal Flying Corps, under a military acquisition order. The close proximity to the Great Western and Metropolitan Railways made it ideal for the purpose.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} work on Southampton's defences {{resulted in}} considerable improvements: {{by the late}} 14th century, the town was completely encircled by 2km (1.25 miles) of stone walls. Some <b>existing</b> <b>buildings,</b> including a dovecote, were reinforced and pressed into service {{as part of the}} defences. South Gate was built to protect the southern quays, with a wide archway, complete with parapets and machicolations. The building work proved very expensive, however, and despite the mayor and bailiffs enforcing contributions and assistance from the citizens, Parliament had to be asked several times in the 1370s to assist by remitting arrears of taxes owed by Southampton.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{only two}} Catholic churches existed in Moscow: the Saint Louis des Français church for the French {{population}} and the St. Peter and Paul church for the Polish parishioners. As the congregation for the Polish church had increased to around 30,000 members, the <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> were too small. Following the submission of a petition to the Governor-General of Moscow, the local council voted for a new church in 1894. Construction of a new church was permitted with several conditions, including two pertinent to the building site: the structure was to be built away from the old city centre, and was not to be located in the vicinity of any Orthodox sacred sites.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary farm {{buildings}} {{associated with the}} mansion include the original springhouse. To {{the rear of the}} home the oldest section of residence can be seen. The ell consists of four rooms as well as the kitchen and smokehouse. The smokehouse was built as part of the existing structure, and not free standing as is most often seen. The rear ell structure served as the first residence for the family while the primary residence was constructed. To the east of the house is the family burial ground. Behind the house is a flower garden. The slave cemetery lies beyond the flower garden. Documented but no longer <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> include multiple slave houses, a large stable due-west of the mansion, an ash house, and a garden house.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. At present, seismic {{strengthening}} design {{reference period}} of the <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> is usually equal to 50 years in China, sometime this is uneconomic and unreasonable. In this paper, determining principle of seismic strengthening design reference period for the <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> with different importance is presented. The seismic strengthening design level of the <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> is put forward. After the shape factor k of intensity probability distribution function is used to represent the seismic hazard characteristic of different areas, the seismic hazard curve formula of design acceleration maxA and earthquake influence coefficient maxα are deduced according to the seismic hazard curve of intensity. The seismic strengthening design ground motion parameter for the <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> with different importance is researched in detail by use of hazard curve formula of seismic ground motion parameter based on seismic hazard characteristic zone. At last, the method and the calculation step are explained by a calculation example. The result shows that for the <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> with different design reference period, using same design parameter is unreasonable in different seismic hazard characteristic zone, and the method is more scientific than the code method...|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} George Luttrell {{inherited}} the castle in 1571, it was dilapidated, {{with the family}} preferring to live in their house, now known as Court House, at East Quantoxhead. In 1617 George employed the architect William Arnold, {{to create a new}} house in the Lower Ward of the castle. Arnold was an important architect in the south-west of England, and had managed the building of nearby Montacute and Cranborne House. The redesign expanded on some of the <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> and walls to create a 16th-century Jacobean mansion with a symmetrical front and square towers, set within the older castle walls and overlooked by the keep above. The building was decorated in the latest styles, including ornamental plaster ceilings. The project ran almost three times over budget, costing Luttrell more than £1,200.|$|E
5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing <b>existing</b> <b>buildings,</b> causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
5|$|In April 1883, Baith Israel, Beth Elohim, and Temple Israel, Brooklyn's three leading synagogues, {{attempted}} an amalgamation.

Though this attempt also failed, {{in the following year}} the three congregations carried out combined activities, including a picnic and a celebration of the 100th birthday of Moses Montefiore. Membership at that time still hovered around 50.|$|E
40|$|<b>Existing</b> <b>building</b> energy {{retrofit}} {{is one of}} {{the keys}} of building energy efficiency in China. According to experience in developed countries, implementation of energy management contract (EMC) is crucial to promote <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> energy retrofit, which means that the reduction of energy expenditure is used to pay the retrofit cost. The EMC program has a short payback period, high interior return rate and remarkable energy savings. This paper present the specialties and difficulties of <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> energy conservation in China and the development, service items and commercial patterns of EMC. We discuss the main methods and ways that EMC is applied to <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> energy retrofit at the original stage of building energy efficiency by analyzing the difference of EMC and other traditional energy efficiency patterns. Based on the analysis of three commercial patterns of EMC including guaranteed savings contract, shared savings contract and chauffage contract, we propose that the guaranteed savings contract is the main development direction of building energy efficiency service in China. At the same time, new financing methods and energy-saving measurement and verification standards should be established to ensure that EMC {{plays an important role in}} the process of <b>existing</b> <b>building</b> energy retrofit in China...|$|R

5|$|In Scotland {{there was}} {{a revival of the}} castle in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as part of the wider Gothic Revival movement, as new houses were built and <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> remodeled in the Gothic and Scots Baronial styles. Inveraray Castle, {{constructed}} from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets and is among the first houses in the revived style. His son Robert Adam's houses in this style included Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots baronial style.|$|E
5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use. The resulting carbon emissions are substantially {{higher than those of}} the transportation sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day, and millions of today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It’s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and <b>existing</b> <b>buildings</b> {{in order to reduce the}} planet's energy-related carbon footprint. Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building. Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, rock wool, glass wool, cork, plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production of insulation panels.|$|E
