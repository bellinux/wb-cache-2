50|$|European hornets are {{carnivores}} and eat {{many species}} of insects. Many of these insects are considered pests in the garden, which indicates that the hornet provides a benefit to the average garden/farm. However, they are known to eradicate <b>domestic</b> <b>honeybee</b> hives, resulting in fewer honeybees for pollination. They also tend to girdle branches, which results in dead branches.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} associate Varroa destructor (Mesostigmata: Varroidae) parasitism and {{its associated}} pathogens and agricultural pesticides with negative effects on colony health, resulting in sporadic global declines in <b>domestic</b> <b>honeybee</b> (Apis mellifera) populations. These events have motivated efforts to develop research tools that can offer insight into the causes of declining bee health as well as identify biomarkers to guide breeding programs. Here we report {{the development of a}} bee-specific peptide array for characterizing global cellular kinase activity in whole bee extracts. The arrays reveal distinct, developmentally-specific signaling profiles between bees with differential susceptibility to infestation by Varroa mites. Gene ontology analysis of the differentially phosphorylated peptides indicates that the differential susceptibility to Varroa mite infestation does not reflect compromised immunity; rather, there is evidence for mite-mediated immune suppression within the susceptible phenotype that may reduce the ability of these bees to counter secondary viral infections. This hypothesis is supported by the demonstration of more diverse viral infections in mite-infested, susceptible adult bees. The bee-specific peptide arrays are an effective tool for understanding the molecular basis of this complex phenotype {{as well as for the}} discovery and utilization of phosphorylation biomarkers for breeding programs...|$|E
40|$|Pollinating {{insects are}} an {{integral}} part of cities’ natural capital and perform an important ecosystem function with a high degree of relevance to many cultural ecosystem services. Consequently, pollinators serve as a useful proxy for assessing urban biodiversity. Beekeeping has recently emerged as a popular activity in many urban areas and a good deal of the motivation for urban beekeeping for many stems from the cultural and nonconsumptive aspects of beekeeping. Yet the recent increases in <b>domestic</b> <b>honeybee</b> densities in urban landscapes has raised concern regarding the potential threat that honeybees might pose to local populations of threatened bumblebee and solitary bee species. This issue constitutes a trade-off between the cultural ecosystem services associated with urban beekeeping and the regulation and maintenance ecosystem services of maintaining nursery populations of rare and threatened species. Municipal authorities in Oslo, Norway have proposed establishing eight “precautionary zones”, within which placement of honeybee hives could be more strictly regulated. We propose a mapping and assessment approach for informing zoning decisions regarding urban honeybees, utilising a model of an urban landscape’s biophysical capacity to support pollinating insects (ESTIMAP). Together with an additional model describing the approximate distrubtion of honeybees in Oslo, we identify areas in the city where domestic honeybees may be more likely to exhaust floral resources. This case also tests the policy relevance of ecosystem service mapping tools beyond awareness raising, with broader general lessons for ecosystem mapping and assessment.

40|$|In eusocial insect species, {{the nest}} {{represents}} the fundamental {{element of the}} colony. Extranidal activities (foraging, nest maintenance, defence) are fundamental for the development and {{the survival of the}} colony. Therefore, they may represent interesting targets to disrupt to limit their expansion in case of pest species such as Vespa velutina, an alien predator of <b>domestic</b> <b>honeybees</b> in Europe. An accurate knowledge of the pattern of activity of this pest’s colonies is therefore required. Due to the highly defensive nature of this hornet, a video monitoring was realized on two colonies during their growth from August to November. Three major behaviours were monitored: nest maintenance, patrolling on the nest and foraging flights. Although of different size and monitored during different years, the two colonies exhibited similar patterns of daily and seasonal variation. This work is a first step in the study of this pest especially in view of control program...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} if temperature and water conservation/collection {{play a significant}} role in the success of feral honeybees, experiments in foraging behavior, temperature tolerance, water balance, hemolymph osmolality regulation and uric acid concentrations of both feral and domestic bees were conducted. This study shows that feral honeybees collect larger volumes of liquid and have higher critical thermal maxima (CTMs) than <b>domestic</b> <b>honeybees.</b> Feral bees may need more liquid for thermoregulation than do domestic bees. The rate of water loss did not differ significantly between the two types of honeybees. Hemolymph osmolality was slightly significant lower in feral bees. In response to desiccation, both feral and domestic bees showed reduced concentrations of proteins and amino acids in the blood. Therefore both types of honeybees maintained hemolymph osmolality during desiccation. There were no differences in mean concentrations of uric acid in feral vs domestic bees and no difference as a result of desiccation. This indicates that uric acid is regulated but is not an osmoeffector...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the last century, the number of biological invasions has continuously increased worldwide. Due to their environmental and economical consequences, invasive species are now a major concern. Social wasps are particularly efficient invaders because of their distinctive biology and behavior. Among them, the yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, is a keen hunter of <b>domestic</b> <b>honeybees.</b> Its recent introduction to Europe may induce important beekeeping, pollination, and biodiversity problems. Hornets use olfactory cues for the long-range detection of food sources, in this case the location of honeybee colonies, but the exact nature of these cues remains unknown. Here, we studied the orientation behavior of V. velutina workers towards a range of hive products and protein sources, as well as towards prominent chemical substances emitted by these food sources. In a multiple choice test performed under controlled laboratory conditions, we found that hornets are strongly attracted to the odor of some hive products, especially pollen and honey. When testing specific compounds, th...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFollowing {{the recent}} {{introduction}} of Vespa velutina into France, {{an increase in}} predation on <b>domestic</b> <b>honeybees,</b> Apis mellifera, has resulted from the dispersion of this hornet across the country. We aimed at providing its predation pressure dynamics at bee hives in two sites by using food traps {{that could be used}} as a comparison in future years. The number of trapped and chasing hornets in each apiary was correlated. Predation lasted 5  months on our two sites; 916 and 1, 894 hornets were trapped on each site, respectively. Predation at bee hives was found to be affected by wind speed and by the seasonal effect of temperature and humidity. We also show that V. velutina queens and males were present during unusual periods in our traps, which may be significant to understanding their life cycle. These results are discussed with reference to the biology of other Vespine species. This study represents the first monitoring of V. velutina predation pressure dynamics in France. It constitutes an initial database for pest management and suggests ways of protecting bee hives...|$|R
40|$|The Yellow-legged hornet, Vespa velutina, was accidentally {{introduced}} in France in 2004, and then spread rapidly through the French territory {{but also to}} adjacent European countries (Spain, Portugal, and Belgium). During summer and autumn, V. velutina workers hunt <b>domestic</b> <b>honeybees,</b> Apis mellifera, for feeding their larvae. The impact of this alien species is mainly economic, beekeepers experiencing heavy colony losses, but also ecological, V. velutina hunting other pollinators. In their year-round life cycle, nest initiation by single queen during spring is the critical stage. In invaded areas, spring queen trapping using food baits has been promoted by apicultural unions in order to limit V. velutina population expansion. The goals of this work were 1) to evaluate the yield of this method, 2) to identify appropriate sites for trapping, 3) to identify potential optimal climatic windows of capture, and 4) to quantify the impact on local entomofauna. Our results showed that water proximity enhances trapping but not beehives proximity, and that trapping is inefficient if average week temperatures are below 10 °C. Although the trapping effect on biodiversity should be studied more carefully, spring queen trapping is highly questionable unless specific attractants could be proposed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVespa velutina is an {{invasive}} species that was observed {{for the first}} time in France and Europe in 2004, which rapidly threatened <b>domestic</b> <b>honeybees</b> with active predation. For the first time in this study, we analyzed the distribution of V. velutina nests at a local scale to understand the pattern of nesting, and in 8 years of monitoring, a total of 528 nests were surveyed. With the exception of 2 years, the nests of V. velutina were randomly distributed within the monitored area, which suggested that intraspecific competition for nesting sites and/or food was unlikely. When the data for all years were combined, an aggregated distribution of nests at the seafront in the vicinity of the oyster farm and sportfishing activities was observed. This distribution suggested that seafood, attractive to vespids, might provide a valuable alternative food source that favored colony development. We also tested the effect of spring queen trapping of V. velutina on the distribution of nests in 2014, which was the year with the greatest number of colonies within the area; the position of the traps did not influence the distribution of the nests. For the first time, this study showed that (i) intraspecific competition was unlikely to be a mechanism for population regulation, (ii) some areas were more likely favored for hornet nests, and (iii) spring queen wasp trapping was inefficient as a method to limit the distribution of the V. velutina population...|$|R
40|$|The {{sequences}} COI-COII of the mitochondrial DNA {{region in}} honeybee from four geographically distant regions in Serbia (Vršac, Knjaževac, Kraljevo, and Vranje) are analyzed. The {{research was conducted}} on eight different, previously selected honeybee lines preserved (linear selection) in the four reprocenters for queen bees. All four studied honeybee lines differ in morphological and productive traits, each being specific for the corresponding region. In addition to analysis of the mtDNA sequences in Serbian honeybee, a comparative analysis of the phylogenetic group of so far known C 2 haplotypes was also performed. The results revealed two novel polymorphic positions in the COI-COII mtDNA region, viz., h 2 at position 3474 and l 2 at position 3534 (a T nucleotide deletion in both cases) in honeybees from the regions of Vranje and Knjaževac, respectively. Two novel mtDNA haplotypes in the honeybee C 2 phylogenetic group, together with C 2 I (the new polymorphic position l 2 and G-A transition at position 3587) and C 2 J (the new polymorphic position h 2), are described. Also, comparative analysis performed on sequences from GenBank data showed {{a high degree of}} similarity (similarity index = 99. 4 %) between the novel C 2 I mtDNA haplotype and an A. m. cypria haplotype originating from Turkey. Certain <b>domestic</b> Kranjska <b>honeybee</b> populations from Serbia represent an autochthonous gene pool that can be of great importance for further presentation of honeybee biodiversity.
