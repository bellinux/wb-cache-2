5|$|After John's loss of Normandy, Maulay went to England and {{was given}} the manor of Upavon in Wiltshire. His grant of the manor was at the king's pleasure, because the manor, which had been held by a noble who {{forfeited}} his land in England by staying in Normandy after its loss, {{would need to be}} restored to its rightful holder if John recovered Normandy. He served as an envoy to Rome in 1213 and in 1214 was in command of royal forces at La Rochelle in France. In 1214 he married Isabella, the daughter and heiress of Robert of Thornham. Robert had died in 1211, so through his wife, Maulay acquired the Barony of Mulgrave in Yorkshire. Maulay paid the king 7000 marks as a fine <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to marry Isabella, one of the highest fines paid <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to marry under John. According to the medieval chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, Maulay was the murderer of John's nephew Arthur of Brittany.|$|E

5|$|After the Roman Empire {{collapsed}} and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact, {{due to the}} importance of its secondary function, as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its upkeep, in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river, although some of its stones were looted and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, {{were both}} wealthy, and had aggressively {{purchased}} and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 {{to build a}} winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as Prohibition was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.|$|E
5|$|As the 108th Infantry Regiment was {{responsible}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> {{sector of the}} divisional defence, {{this meant that the}} 42nd Infantry Regiment, which was originally responsible only for the left sector, had to extend across the entire divisional frontage. During the night, the commander of the divisional cavalry battalion sent patrols towards the German bridgehead, but local Ustaše sympathisers misled them into believing the Germans were already across the Drava at Barcs in strength. The Germans were subsequently able to consolidate their bridgehead at Barcs overnight.|$|E

In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his trousers.|$|E

5|$|He criticised the {{hypocrisy}} of chastity for women and argued that it should also either belong to men, {{or not at all}} for both individuals. While fighting against this, Periyar advocated {{to get rid of the}} Devadasi system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. As a further liberation of women, Periyar pushed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of women to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.|$|E
