For example, a non-depository mortgage lender may fund their operations with a warehouse line of credit, while a <b>distressed</b> <b>loan</b> workout specialist may obtain a line of credit.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{modifications}} to <b>distressed</b> residential <b>loans</b> following the 2008 financial crisis has been disappointingly {{low compared to}} the number of foreclosures. This raises concerns about the presence of artificial barriers to loan modifications in situations where foreclosure should be avoidable. There are three pressing reasons to care about what the real barriers to foreclosure prevention are. First, foreclosures that could have been avoided inflict enormous, needless losses on borrowers, investors, and society at large. Second, overcoming artificial barriers to foreclosure prevention will result in loan modifications with higher rates of success. Finally, knowing what to fix is necessary to identify the right policy solution. Numerous theories have been advanced for the relatively low level of modifications, including: restrictions on loan modifications in private-label servicing agreements, threats of lawsuits by private-label investors, servicer compensation arrangements, the high cost of loss mitigation, accounting rules, junior liens, and tax considerations. This Article concludes that servicer compensation coupled with the costly nature of loan workouts, accounting standards, and junior liens form the biggest impediments to an efficient level of loan modifications. These factors also tilt the mix of loan modifications toward types of modifications with higher redefault rates. Other explanations, such as servicing agreement restrictions, tax consequences, and the threat of lawsuits, are either not at play or are of second order importance...|$|R

Through predatory lending practices, which target financially <b>distressed</b> individuals, these <b>loans</b> {{may have played a}} role in the increased suicide rate over the last several years. Consequently, the hypothesis of this study is as the prevalence of predatory lending establishments within a community increases, the suicide rate within that neighborhood also increases, as a result. The overall aim of this study is to test a causal model, which might explain if the increased rate of suicide, suicide ideation or attempts during the most recent economic downturn was exacerbated by an increase in fringe bank lending, specifically in neighborhoods in New York City. The model tests the hypothesis that some individuals, due to their community of residence, and exacerbated by their financially precarious situations, are more often exposed to predatory lenders. And as a result of the deceptive loan terms offered by these conveniently located lenders, these individuals may often experience more objective, financial stress, as well as more perceived, subjective stressors, putting them at an increased risk of suicide.
