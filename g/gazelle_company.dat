40|$|The {{concept of}} a {{business}} model has received increasing attention in both the academic world and among companies. A business model is a conceptual tool that shows and explains how a company creates and delivers value to its customers and shows how the company generates revenue. The business model {{has proven to be}} of great importance for a company’s growth and success. Studies have shown that companies can increase their chances of achieving a leading position on the market if an understanding of how the business model works exists within the company. Considering that most markets are highly competitive and rapidly changing there are some companies that stands out from other companies maintaining an exceptionally high growth and success. In Sweden the designated business newspaper Dagens Industri annually awards the fastest growing companies in the country with an award called <b>Gazelle.</b> <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> are a small group of companies that manage to achieve great success by maintaining a considerably high growth and presenting a positive result. The <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> currently represent 0. 5 percent of Swedish companies. The {{purpose of this study is}} to create an understanding of how <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> achieve growth and success. Using a resource-based perspective this study aims to identify and analyze the success factors of gazelle companies’ business models and its components. The purpose is also to develop a model for successful business modeling in <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies.</b> The study is of qualitative nature and to fulfill the purpose of the study eleven <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> were interviewed based on a semi-structured interview technique to create a deeper understanding of <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> and their business models. The results of the study shows that all of the <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> have well thought out and well formulated business models that are valuable, rare and difficult for competitors to imitate and substitute, which the <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> has benefited from in terms of growth and success. The study also shows that gazelle companies’ business models constitute a whole, in which all parts are equally important for the gazelle companies’ growth and success. Furthermore the study also shows that the owner of the <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> own values, passion and ambition clearly have influenced the business models. The fact that the business owners are driven entrepreneurs with high ambitions and strong wills, combined with the fact that they have followed their hearts and run companies that they are passionate about has had a positive effect on the <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> growth and success.

40|$|Title: Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility in Rapidly Growing Firms – As {{a way of}} Strengthening the Corporate Brand Authors: Frida Dahlin and Anna Ledel Supervisor: Thomas Helgesson Examiner: Venilton Reinert Level: Bachelor thesis Keywords: Corporate social responsibility, Corporate brand, <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> Research question: How can <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> develop CSR {{strategies}} to strengthen their corporate brand? Purpose: The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate how Swedish <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> are taking their rapid growth into consideration when working with CSR as a way of strengthening their corporate brand. This paper aims to examine how Swedish <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> are managing their CSR strategies and if {{the fact that they are}} fast growing firms is affecting their strategic work, and in that case how. This paper aims to contribute with a better adjusted model of CSR that is applicable in the context of rapidly growing firms. Methodology: A deductive and qualitative method was chosen for a deeper, more detailed and descriptive explanation of the considered subject. Theoretical frame of references: Theories regarding previous research of corporate brand, CSR, reputation management and rapidly growing firms are brought forward.

40|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) are big contributors to today’s business {{environment and the}} society as a whole, and their contributions are highly valued. <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> {{can be seen as}} the most successful SMEs and hence the interest to analyze them. Far from all companies succeed to maintain a profitable growth and recieve the Gazelle title sequential times. Due to this, this research aims to answer the question what differentiates sequential <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> from one time <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies.</b> In Sweden, the Gazelle title is announced to companies who fulfill certain criteria, meaning that they are homogenous in many ways. However, there must be some differences since some succeed to maintain the title whereas others do not. By the following research question, this research intends to identify some of these differentiating attributes. Is there a difference between sequential <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> and one time <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> regarding the chosen firm attributes? Existing research show that one common factor behind maintained profitable growth is the ability to ask for help in fields where management competence is lacking. It is argued that this help can be in form of external professional business services and hence this research intends to answer this second research question: Do usage of external professional business services contribute to sequential Gazelle title? Since the ability to maintain profitable growth is discussed to depend on internal competence and knowledge, or lack thereof, Resource-Based Theory is found to be an appropriate explanation tool. This theory is supported by the Stages of Growth model to further explain the development of the firms. This research had a quantitative method where a survey was used to collect data. In order to accept/reject the formed hypotheses, the data was imported to SPSS where it was statistically tested in two separate logistic regressions. The results of this research statistically show that the mixture of the included firm attributes do differ between sequential <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> and one time <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies.</b> However, the test proved nonsignificant when examining the usage of external professional services. This means that even though there were indications of high importance, one cannot statistically argue that usage of external professional business services leads to sequential Gazelle title...|$|R

The main factors that explain their success are competitive advantages based on human resources, innovation, internationalization, the excellence in processes and a conservative financial policy. Nevertheless, {{as time goes by}} they can be divided in two groups: a group which continues having growth, but most of them with lower growth rates; and the rest which face great problems or even disappear. The present study identifies several key factors that explain this different evolution. <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies,</b> high-growth companies, financial information, business evolution, financial statements. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{companies}} {{to be able}} to grow they need capital and resources. Financing is today challenging for many small companies, which inhibits their potential growth. Companies that have achieved growth and consequently succeeded with their financing are among others <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies.</b> Since 2000 the newspaper Dagens industri dispense a yearly award to those companies that shows the highest growth in Sweden. An important aspect that can affect companies and their financing strategy is their resource requirement and the resources that the company has at its disposal. The {{purpose of this study is}} from a resource perspective create an understanding of financing strategies in <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies.</b> This by describing financing strategies that <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> can apply and identify underlying factors for chosen financing strategies. To address the purpose of the study a qualitative method was used were twelve semi-structured interviews were carried out on service based <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> throughout Sweden. The results of the study indicate that there are strong connections between companies resources and their financing strategy. The study found support for the pecking order theory, however this study demonstrated that the cost of capital when choosing source of financing was not the determining factor. Instead, the determining factor for choice of financing in this study was found to be the control and ownership of the company. Finally this study displayed that less capital-intensive {{companies to}} a greater extent seem to use bootstrapping methods compared to capital-intensive companies.

40|$|Background: In Sweden, only 652 {{companies}} {{have managed to}} reach the criterions stated by Dagens Industri in their ranking of the Swedish gazelle compa-nies. Rapidly growing companies are {{very important for the}} creation of job opportunities and economic wealth. Growth is associated with significant costs, especially for a manufacturing company, and capital is therefore vital for a company’s prosperity. Capital can be either internally generated or externally provided. Previous research has shown that companies firstly prefer internally generated funds, then debt and last new equity. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to describe, analyze and provide examples on how Swedish <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> have financed their growth, what financing options they have and for what purposes they needed finance. The thesis will also examine the importance of external financer’s contribution with financial and human capital for the growth of the gazelles. Method: A qualitative approach has been used to meet the purpose of the thesis. 12 in-depth, unstructured phone interviews have been conducted with some of the fastest growing <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> in Sweden. Conclusions: A company can finance its growth using owner’s equity, retained earnings, leasing, factoring, public subsidies and loans, bank loans, venture capital and business angels. All these sources of finance are represented in the empirical findings except for factoring. Internally generated capital has mainly been used to cover working capital and to some extent smaller in-vestments. The externally provided capital has mainly been invested in larger investments like machines, property and product development. The financial capital has been the main contribution by external financers except for business angels, where the human capital was most important...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the life cycle stages of the chosen gazelles in Sweden and identify their effectiveness related to the stages. Furthermore, we study whether the given characteristic of the <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> correspond to the suggested characteristics of the given theoretical framework. Gazelles, as the outstanding performers of both financial profits and job creators of our society, they are always struggling to sustain growth and satisfy market needs {{in order to maintain}} their prestigious status. Therefore, it is critical for them to access their abilities as well as constraints of the current organizational structures and we seek the solutions to these problems through the organizational life cycle theory perspective. Our study focuses on the Dagens Industri’s gazelle award winners that are carefully evaluated by the strict criteria it provides. Also, we revisit the various previous studies in the field of the organizational life cycle and effectiveness in order to provide the foundation for our analysis. In order to serve our purpose, we study 26 gazelles from Sweden in dept by reviewing their annual reports and official websites and provide the reader with quantities data research that are self-administrated concerning the different attributes of the life cycle stages and effectiveness. In conclusion, we find {{that the majority of the}} Swedish <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> we have studied correspond to the second stage of the life cycle model which focuses on human relations model as an effectiveness area. However, these firms demonstrate unique effectiveness that genuine SMEs do not have, such as high focus on R&D and harmony between flexibility and control in their organizational structure...|$|R

40|$|Background and Problem: Up to now, {{researchers}} and economists have been focusing on successful entrepreneurship and its success factors {{and not on}} business failure, {{with respect to the}} influence of management accounting. Earlier research has proven management accounting to be of importance, but its connection to, and importance for, entrepreneurship is still not established. Furthermore, with regard to Sweden’s future development and well-being, it is desirable to see increased numbers and efficient growth in small and medium size enterprises. Purpose: The intention {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate possible reasons to why once successful businesses go bankrupt and the role of management accounting in this process. Our focus will be on previously very successful <b>companies,</b> namely <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies,</b> that subsequently been misfortunate and gone bankrupt. Method: An analysis of rapidly growing companies will be conducted, by Dagens Industri called <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies.</b> In our search for companies that have gone bankrupt, we concentrate on <b>companies</b> being <b>gazelles</b> during the years 2001 and 2002, the two “oldest” gazelle lists on DI’s homepage. The study is of a qualitative character based on twelve questionnaire respondents. We believe that an electronic questionnaire method would be the most suitable in this case. Moreover, because of a limited survey group, the outcome can not be statistically secured. Conclusion: In line with our thesis purpose, and our negative assumption/hypothesis that most companies have limited or no knowledge/ability/will to construct and use management accounting information, our findings show that no significant signs can be seen of that management accounting has played a conclusive role for the greater majority of the companies in their business failures. However, the survey shows that the main internal factors of business failure are connected to financial aspects and the external factors show a shortage in company funds. It seems like they can not afford losing customers or handle a recession very well. This strengthens the fact, and also our belief, that management accounting is needed when a company grows. Suggestions for further research: A more detailed examination of the companies’ business strategy, business plan and business concept is also sought. To see if these specific companies have used measurements, budgets and so forth in similar ways and how these tools are created and used would be interesting to read about. Lastly, we sought how management accounting could be of help in foreseeing a bankruptcy, especially in rapidly growing companies such as the gazelles...|$|R

40|$|Though {{considerable}} {{attention in the}} extant literature {{has been devoted to}} growth and performance of firms, there is a dearth of research on rapidly growing and high-performance <b>companies</b> or <b>gazelles,</b> in small to medium sized firms. This paper examines the drivers of rapid growth in manufacturing SMEs. In addition, the paper develops and tests a new approach to multi-variate analysis based on the conditional formatting of spreadsheets and the use of nested logical operators for complex comprehension. When analysing the results of most searches/studies, it is usually quite difficult to fully gain an understanding of the whole picture (i. e. the results in context). Using this new technique, we identify gazelles using a ranked database in a spreadsheet to create complete (non-loss) analysable visual patterns. Firms were ranked in terms of their ‘growth footprint’, using changes in employee numbers, profits, turnover and margin to calculate their individual growth performance/potential. The results of the study indicate that gazelles are less than 15 years old, have a CEO who is less than 50 years of age. They have a good financial performance (measured by gross profit per employee) and are privately owned and managed by their owners. The CEOs of the identified <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> were further interviewed and it was found that self-organization and agility are key drivers of success...|$|R
40|$|Non-selling activities, such {{as sales}} planning, teamwork, sales support, sales tracking, etc., are {{important}} parts of sales activities in any company. Earlier {{research has shown that}} the difference between effective and less-effective organizations {{can be found in the}} performance of the non-selling activities. This thesis continues investigating the non-selling activities by looking into the matter of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. Implementation of a CRM system requires that the people who are in contact with customers carefully log the activities, a task that according to research is considered to be dull by many people. Studies have shown, though, that CRM systems increase company profitability. Therefore allocating time for administrating them is a good investment. Objective: This thesis studies the administrational CRM activities performed by the sales people and sets out to determine if fast growing consultancy firms in Sweden use CRM systems to a greater extent than comparable consultancy firms in the same country. The definition of fast growing firms has been firms that have received the Gazelle award from the newspaper Dagens Industri, the most known financial newspaper in Sweden. The award recognizes companies that have grown very rapidly in the last four fiscal years, mainly in terms of company turnover. Purpose: Most companies strive for growth. Establishing a link between the time factor and company growth will help organizations motivate themselves into increased use of CRM systems. Method: Collection of data for the study has been done by briefly interviewing 54 Swedish consultancy firms via telephone. Out of these 54 companies, 25 had received the Gazelle award, and the remaining 29 were in the same type of business but selected through random methods. The companies were asked about their use of CRM systems, how important they rate it and in their overall attitudes toward such systems. Results: The companies with very high growth, i. e. the <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies,</b> evidently use CRM systems to a higher extent than comparable companies, and the difference between the two groups is statistically significant. The majority of respondents in both groups consider CRM systems as useful or very useful (74 % in the ordinary group, 80 % in Gazelle group) but only 31 % of the <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> and 36 % of the randomly selected companies believe that it is also important for the profitability of the company. Many of the interviewed companies had plans expanding their usage of CRM systems. Although they generally thought positively about CRM systems, due to the fact that some of them did not utilize CRMs at all their profitability cannot be explained by the CRM use only. Denna rapport undersöker ifall det finns skillnader i hur svenska konsultföretag använder CRM-system, dvs. datorstödda kundrelationsprogram, genom att undersöka ifall tiden de lägger på att arbeta med säljrelaterade aktiviteter i CRM-systemet kan länkas till bolagets omsättningsökning.

40|$|Background: Business {{strategies}} {{in order to}} succeed must be adapted to the rapid changes of an industry {{in order to achieve}} sustainable competitive advantages. Gary Hamel, Igor Ansoff and Michael E. Porter present strategic choices for the growth and expansion of a company. Jim Collins is a management educator and has created a concept for how a good company can become great. Research Questions: Our main research question is: Can Gary Hamel’s Business Model provide an explanation for the success of the <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies?</b> Further research questions are: Is it possible to find any common features of the Gazelles that can explain the success based on Gary Hamel’s Business Model? Can Igor Ansoff’s “Product/Market expansion grid” or Michael E. Porter’s “The Five Forces” be complementary in giving a concise picture of the Gazelles’ success? How can Jim Collins Concept for growth bring a new angle to explain the Gazelles’ successful elements? Objective: We have chosen an explanatory objective. The aim of our study is to examine whether we can give an explanation to the success of <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> and to find out whether they have any common features by applying different models to them. Delimitations: In this study we have only included medium-sized enterprises with 50 to 300 employees, from the list of fast growing companies – known as “Gaseller” in the Swedish newspaper “Dagens Industri”. The research site is limited to the region of Gothenburg. The number of companies included in the study is delimited to seven. Methodology: We have chosen to bring out a qualitative investigation {{in the form of a}} case-study and with an abductive approach. The primary sources that we have used consist of seven qualitative interviews. Our secondary sources consist of literature, articles and information from the Internet. In this study we have used a semi-structured interview form. We organized our data arrangement at the same time as the interviews took place, one of us making notes on the computer during the interview. The companies examined are presented anonymously. Results and Conclusions: Our conclusion is that Gary Hamel’s Business Model gives a clear picture for the success of the Gazelles. We have also discovered common features of the Gazelles that can explain their success. Furthermore we have concluded that Michael E. Porter’s “The Five Forces” can be beneficial in giving a concise picture of the Gazelles’ success while Ansoff’s “Product/Market expansion grid” cannot give an explanation to the same extent. Finally we found that Jim Collins’ Concept for growth could give a new angle to explain their success, even though we could not apply all of the selected principals to the examined companies. Suggestions for Further Research: We suggest a similar study in a few years to see if the companies still are successful and have made any changes of their strategies. Another interesting angle for further research is to find out if the Gazelle companies’ success can be explained by other theories, such as, for example, strategic market management or organisational management...|$|R

The housing crisis contributes to lock-in effects and low mobility in the housing market. A balanced housing market {{is a prerequisite for}} a well functioning economy. Gazelles have a large and crucial impact for the addition of new jobs in the Swedish economy and are thus important for Sweden’s growth. Qualified staff is important for the gazelles opportunity to grow. It is important that the housing crisis is not an obstacle for companies to recruit staff with the right competence. We formulated the following problem: How is the recruitment affected by the housing shortage for Swedish <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> in the construction industry in Greater Malmö? The study’s primary purpose has been to explain and describe the eventual recruitment difficulties and competence issues that the housing shortage causing.

The study’s empirical data were collected through interviews with construction companies, Sydsvenska Handelskammaren and Tillväxtverket. The theoretical framework consists of scientific articles and literature that is relevant for the study. The results of the study show that all companies indicate competent staff as the main resource for growth. Thus, would mean that growth will be hampered unless the companies can secure the competence.

40|$|Research on {{economic}} growth and management and accounting control systems are extensive but mainly focus on these areas separately. Research on how these affect each other is deficient. Therefore this study examines how <b>gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> want to achieve {{economic growth and}} how management and accounting control systems affect the different growth factors. The study was conducted by a survey of quantitative character in which 150 companies that received the gazelle award between the years of 2010 - 2014 participated. All of the participating companies are based in Sweden and represented in more than 30 industries. The {{purpose of the study}} was to identify how gazelles aim to achieve future economic growth. The empirical data were analyzed using several statistical tools. To ensure that the variables are of desirable statistical significance a two-sided T-test was performed. Cronbach’s α and Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to ensure the variables reliability and an exploratory factor analysis was used to find multicollinearity. The variables innovation and risk correlated strongly and is merged into the new denomination innovativeness. The empirical results ensure with statistical significance that three different factors affect the gazelle companies’ management to achieve economic growth. The three factors that affect the management to future growth are innovativeness, motivation and munificence. The effects of motivation and innovativeness were with the stepwise regression analysis shown to be enhanced by management control systems. This implies that management control systems should be used to maximize the utility of motivation and innovation activities. Validerat; 20150605 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

40|$|A {{board is}} a group acting as a link between {{management}} and shareholders. The Board’s main task is to govern the firm and protect the interests of shareholders, contribute to the business value creation and ensure the company survives. In recent years have shown that many boards {{around the world and}} in Sweden have overlooked central aspects of governance and control. In several cases, this have led to devastating consequences for its owners and society. The purpose of the study is to explain how different group factors affecting the work of the board in Swedish companies and the impact it will have on firm performance, growth opportunity and frequency of conflict in the board. The study aims to compare whether these factors are differences between the boards of listed companies, unlisted <b>companies</b> and <b>Gazelle.</b> The purpose of the study has been answered using a quantitative research approach in which a theoretical framework is the basis for a theoretical model. Cross-sectional data were collected using a sample survey with responses from 67 listed, 70 Gazelle, 4 listed and Gazelle and 93 unlisted company boards. The results of the cross-sectional survey show that boards with a high effort norm and a good decision-making culture tend to value risk and viable strategic options to a greater extent. In comparison the listed and <b>Gazelle</b> <b>companies</b> manage to greater extent to relate these group factors to company performance and growth opportunity. This means that the firm performance and the identification of potential growth opportunity increases. The results also show that boards who have a degree of frequent conflicts do not try and assess the risk to the same extent as companies with less conflict. A conclusion is therefore that the silent boards more often are in conflict and limit their own strategic work. Validerat; 20160902 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

There are a lot of research about the term innovation and its affects on growth. However, there is no research on how Swedish companies that have had a high and continuous growth and how they have worked with innovation. With this study we want to contribute by showing how Swedish growth companies work with innovation. The concept of innovation has been broken down to several sub-categories such as; marketing innovation, product- and service innovation, process innovation, technological innovation, incremental innovation, radical innovation, network innovation and organizational innovation. We have made a qualitative multi-case study of three companies from Ahrens list. Through semi-structured telephone interviews in which respondents were anonymous, we gathered empirical data on how Swedish growth companies are working with innovation. We have an abductive approach, were we filled in with new theory after the interviews were made. We use a descriptive research design because we want to give the reader the respondents’ report on the company growth. In order to make the material manageable, we divided the innovation concept into subheadings. Three Swedish growth companies have been interviewed about how they have managed a high and long-term growth. Furthermore we have analysed up how they are working with innovation. Swedish growth companies have worked on; Marketing innovation, product- and service innovation, process innovation, incremental innovation, organization innovation, and network innovation. How the companies have worked with these innovation types can be read in our conclusion of this report. ...|$|R

40|$|SMEs play an {{important}} role in the development of regional innovative systems because of their potential to accept new technologies and show fast growing rates. There is an interdependence between emergence of fast growing SMEs (?gazelles?) and innovative development of regions. High level of regional innovative development creates a fertile environment for increasing the number of fast growing companies, while we assume that large number of ?gazelles? creates a favourable environment for the dissemination of innovations in regions via spillover effect (NESTA Business growth and innovation, 2009). Fast-growing companies may contribute more than 50 % to GDP growth (Europe INNOVA Gazelles Innovation Panel, 2008). There are several works, that explain growth of firms as a stochastic phenomenon (Gibrat, 1929), or as a combination of endogenous (Penrose, 1955) and exogenous factors (Delmar, Davidsson, Gartner, 2003). In our work we assume that regional innovation performance (as a share of RnD personnel in employment, share RnD expenditures in gross regional product, etc.) may be a significant factor because of knowledge spillover effects (Audretsch, Feldman, 2004), affecting more competitive firms. There were no works on Russian regional data that could prove it. The article analyses a variety of endogenous (intra-firm) and exogenous (regional) factors, which determine the share of fast-growing firms in Russian regions. The analysed firms were fast-growing manufacturing SMEs during post-crisis period (2009 - 2012), the main focus was on the determinants of the companies? share in total number of manufacturing firms in a region. The dataset was collected from SPARK (Professional market and company analysis system), and consists of information about income, owners, location, industry and several financial indicators. Regional factors, according to Russian Federal State Statistical service, include research and development indicators (such as RnD expenditures, RnD employees, etc.), urbanization rate, human capital, investment climate, etc. There are 419 manufacturing fast-growing <b>companies</b> (?<b>gazelles?)</b> from 9220 <b>companies</b> in database, which is approximately 5 %. Econometric analyses demonstrates a strong correlation between the share of high-growth companies in regions and indicators of regional innovation performance: number of researchers per 10 000 people, the number of PCT applications per economically active population, the share of employees with higher education in the total number of population in economically active age, and the number of applications for inventions submitted to the Russian Patent Bureau by national applicants per the economically active population. Determined factors could be used for elaborating recommendations for implementation of industrial policy in Russia...|$|R

40|$|Fast-growing <b>companies</b> (<b>gazelles)</b> are {{the main}} creators of new jobs, revenue growth and vibrant, {{competitive}} economy. This paper reviews (a) conditions for dynamic entrepreneurship in Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia and (b) recent studies on dynamic enterprises (gazelles) conducted in these countries. However, since the authors {{are in the process}} of launching new research on gazelles (based on the same methodology and selection criteria), which is to be carried out simultaneously in all four countries in 2014, the paper provides (c) discussion on these initiatives and initial results as well. A constant growth of dynamic enterprises and gazelles and their increasing share in the economy presents an invaluable analytical instrument for forecasting overall economic growth in the next period. In order to define favorable, supportive environment for dynamic and sustainable entrepreneurship, the authors addressed the institutional and regulatory environment, level of knowledge of entrepreneurs, access to finance, incentives for introduction of modern technology, innovations, internationalization, etc. The authors also monitored the trends of entrepreneurial development index, entrepreneurial activity index and competitiveness index for each country. Since the integral pilot project was already implemented in Slovenia in 2011, and a number of conclusions were drown, the authors studied the main features of fast-growing companies and differences between the growth factors that affect growing companies in Slovenia, and compared respective results in all four countries. Among factors for growth, the most critical ones in Slovenia were: environmental barriers, management systems, and financing; these factors were further examined in other three countries. In addition, the growth rates of dynamic enterprises were compared with the ones of their European counterparts, and therefore these studies were able to offer an indication of what time is required by the Southeast European gazelles to catch up with their counterparts abroad. The most important findings of this research and its impacts on respective countries, served as a basis for making recommendations for better addressing the phenomenon of dynamic entrepreneurship, sustainable growth and rising competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|In my {{presentation}} I {{would like}} to describe {{the results of a}} RANEPA team research project in which I am participating. The main object of presented research is factors that determine companies' growth. The research area is limited by companies that achieved high-speed growth by improving their competitiveness and not as a result of market extension. There are a vast majority of studies that search for determinants of companies' competitiveness (description is presented in the overview article "P. Mohnen and B. H. Hall. Innovation and Productivity: an Update / Eurasian Business Review, 3 (1), 2013, 47 - 65 "). Most of them indicates that implementation of different types of innovations (product, process, marketing and organizational) are important for firm's growth. I {{would like to}} present the results of econometric and statistical analyses of internal and external factors that influence on company's growth rate. There is strong evidence that emergence of high growth <b>companies</b> (<b>gazelles)</b> is more likely in regions that are famous for their innovativeness. It is an external factor which could be called "appropriate environment for high growth firms". Statistical analyses of regional data demonstrates existence of correlation (coefficient of correlation exceeds 0. 5) between the number of high-growth companies and such indicators as "The number of researchers per 10 000 people" (k = 0. 59), "The ratio of number of PCT applications to the economically active population" (k = 0. 56), "The share of employees with higher education in the total number of population in economically active age" (k = 0. 55) and "The ratio of the number of applications for inventions submitted to the Russian Patent Bureau by national applicants, to the economically active population" (k = 0. 52). The next step of analysis was to examine intramural factors that determine companies' growth rates. We used closed data collected via national survey of high growth innovative companies ("Rating-TechUp" that was completed in 2013 year - [URL] Econometric analysis provided evidence that the mains intramural factor that determine company's growth rates are share of new (innovative) production in the company's overall sales and expenditures on education of company's staff. Determined external and intramural factors could be used for elaborating recommendations for implementation of industrial policy in Russia...|$|R
40|$|This study {{strives to}} {{understand}} how a company, that has shown great ability to translate higher revenue than average; think, consider and act when they involve the customer in product or service development. Allegations indicate that the competitive advantages no longer present in {{the walls of the}} company (Ramaswamy and Gouillart 2010 p. 7), and that it no longer revolves around what resources a company has, but rather what capabilities the company use to utilize their resources (Barney 1997 Cardeal António 2012). Knowledge may be such a capability (Cardeal António 2012), with the customer as a knowledge-based resource (Prahalad and Ramaswamy, 2004). Co-Creation literature, (Norwegian: Samskapnings-litteraturen), argue that companies together with their customer can create higher value through interaction (Galvagno and Dalli, 2015), and be used as a tool to find new sources of sustainable competitive advantage (Prahalad and Ramaswamy, 2004). With this in mind, the study attempts to explain the following approach: How do young fast growing <b>companies</b> (<b>Gazelles)</b> and their customers co-create in development of new products and services? Through a phenomenological approach in an open and exploratory qualitative survey method, unstructured interviews are conducted using a theme based interview guide. Seven owners of seven companies represented at Dagens Næringslivs Gazelle List 2015, were interviewed. Respondents represent an extreme-criteria based selection. The study argues that co-creation based on the framework of Frow et al. (2015) is incredibly dynamic. Young fast growing companies take several actions which results in how they conduct interaction with the customer in practice, and the study argues that it appears more dynamic than what is published in the theoretical framework used in this study. Based on findings, two dynamic models has been developed, that attempts to show the relationship between theory and empiry and the connection between activities and choices that young fast growing companies take. Focus they have in trust and relationship building is based on how co-creation works. This affects client capabilities, expertise and emotions, as well as their co-creation process and the current situation of the customer. The influence can then be transferred to the measures Gazelles conduct that is likely to form and create their competitive advantage...|$|R
