40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the main milling train management tasks necessary for maintaining good extraction performance through a season. The main activities discussed are making week by week decisions about shredder and mill setting adjustments, and selecting preseason mill settings. To maintain satisfactory milling train extraction performance, the main factors affecting extraction should be examined: cane preparation with pol in open cells or shredder torque, delivery nip compaction through the load or torque controller outputs such as roll lift, <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> flap position or pressure feeder to mill speed ratio, and added water rate. To select mill settings {{for the coming}} season, delivery nip compaction and <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> exit compaction can be inferred from the previous seasons...|$|R
50|$|While some coal is {{delivered}} {{directly to the}} <b>hopper</b> <b>feeding</b> the coal conveyor which brings fuel into the plant, Simon also has extensive outdoor storage, both covered and uncovered. Front-end loaders are used {{in this part of}} the operation.|$|R
50|$|The GAU-18/A, is a {{lightweight}} {{variant of the}} M2/M3, and is used on the USAF's MH-53 Pave Low and HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters. These weapons do not use the M2HB barrel, and are typically set up as left-hand feed, right-hand charging weapons, but on the HH-60 Pavehawks that use the EGMS (External Gun Mount System) the gun is isolated from the shooter by a recoil absorbing cradle and all weapons are set up as right hand charge but vary between left and right hand feed depending on what side of the aircraft it is on. A <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> adapter {{is attached to the}} left or right hand feed pawl bracket allowing the weapon to receive ammunition through a <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> system connected to externally mounted ammunition containers holding 600 rounds each.|$|R
50|$|Compounding {{is usually}} done by extrusion. The <b>hopper</b> <b>feeds</b> the begin of the screw which will {{gradually}} transport the resins towards the die. The screw itself is confined {{in a barrel}} that has different zones that can be heated according to the resins properties.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hopper</b> <b>feeds</b> {{the waste}} {{into a single}} {{incineration}} unit where it is burned in excess of 850 °C. A large boiler located above the incineration unit is heated to produce superheated steam at 400 °C. A condensing steam turbine uses this steam to generate electricity for the National Grid and produce hot water for the District Energy network.|$|R
50|$|Economy {{of labor}} was the {{fundamental}} aim of a round barn’s design. <b>Feed</b> <b>chutes</b> connecting {{the upper and}} middle levels allowed for easy distribution of hay, stored in the spacious loft, and silage, stored in the central silo. Farmers could stanchion up to sixty cows around the center silo for feeding and milking and easily remove manure through trap doors that opened to the basement below where it could be collected and removed by horse-drawn wagons.|$|R
50|$|The submachine gun {{could be}} fed from {{standard}} box magazines, {{or from a}} large drum magazine which was not actually connected to the weapon and instead fed the cartridges through a flexible chute.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this quarter of study was to prepare fuel pellets containing PVC, newspaper and plastics to be co-fired with coal in the AFBC combustor. The Western Kentucky University atmospheric fluidized bed combustion system requires the fuel to fall from a bunker into a lock-hopper, and from there into a mixing box where the fuel is auger-fed under pressure {{into the bottom of}} the fluidized bed. The fuel must flow freely out of the bunker and through the lock- <b>hopper</b> for proper <b>feeding</b> into the combustor. In order for the fuel to continuously fall through these units and into the mixing box during combustion, the density of the fuel and the size of the particles must meet certain requirements. The particles must be no larger than 3 / 8 inches in diameter and must have a density approaching that of coal. Loose materials such as sawdust, shredded paper products and most shredded plastics do not feed properly in the WKU AFBC system. Bridging and blockage of <b>feed</b> <b>chutes</b> result, even with constant vibration of parts of the feed mechanism. It is not possible to run the AFBC system powered solely by these loose materials...|$|R
50|$|Gravity feed is the {{simplest}} and cheapest form of <b>hopper</b> available. Gravity <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> consist of a large container and a feed tube molded into the bottom. Paintballs roll down the sloped sides, through the tube and into the marker. These hoppers have a maximum rate of 11.6 balls per second. Gravity <b>feed</b> <b>hoppers</b> are very cheap, since they are made of only a shell and a lid, but can become jammed easily as paintballs accumulate above the tube. Rocking the marker (and hopper) occasionally can prevent the paintballs from jamming in the hopper.|$|R
40|$|Plantains are wasted due to {{deterioration}} when {{dumped in}} villages and towns {{during the peak}} of harvest. Therefore, {{it is necessary that}} plantains are processed into chips for preservation and availability throughout the year. Modern methods of slicing have greatly improved production rate and reduces slicing time. The main objective {{of this study was to}} modify an existing plantain slicing machine so as to optimize its efficiency at low cost, reduce total time of slicing and produce hygienic and quality chips. The improvement on the design of the existing slicing machine was achieved through proper focus on the capacity, materials and other design criteria for various component parts. The slicer consists of cutting disc, cutting chamber, <b>feeding</b> <b>chute,</b> the main frame and power transmitting unit. The result of the improvement on the design of this slicing machine showed that maintenance cost is cheap, slicing time of plantain chips was reduced, operation of the machine does not require special skill, the machine is easy and safe to operate, it is free of noise and vibration,the slicing method is continuous with two slicing blades provided inside the cutting chamber and energy for loading and unloading is reduced since <b>feeding</b> <b>chute</b> and collecting bucket are provided. Slicing of plantain is safe since finger injury is reduced. The efficiency of the modified plantain slicing machine is 95. 79 % with capacity of 50. 49 g/s. The slicer is therefore recommended for commercial use...|$|R
5000|$|During the Vietnam War, the M60 {{received}} the nickname [...] "The Pig" [...] {{due to its}} bulky size. Vietnam's tropical climate harshly affected weapons, and the M60 was no exception. Its light weight made the gun damage easily and critical parts like the bolt and op rod wore out quickly. Even so, soldiers appreciated the gun's handling, mechanical simplicity, and effective operation {{from a variety of}} firing positions. Navy SEALs used M60s with shorter barrels and no front sights to reduce weight further. Some SEALs had <b>feed</b> <b>chutes</b> from backpacks to have a belt of thousands of rounds ready to fire without needing to reload.|$|R
5000|$|Making cold-pressed {{juice is}} a two-step process, {{the first stage}} is to shred the fruits and {{vegetables}} into a pulp. Typically the shredding process uses a steel rotating disc, produce is loaded into a large <b>hopper</b> <b>feeding</b> tube and typically falls into a filter bag. The second process is the hydraulic press, this exposes the shredded produce to extreme pressures between two plates. The pressure causes the juice / water content from the produce to drip into a collection tray (Gastronorm) below, leaving behind the fibre content in the filter bag. The fibre left behind is generally composted, recycled in food products or discarded.|$|R
5000|$|With a single-cylinder {{piston pump}} the medium is [...] "stuffed" [...] {{out of a}} <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> into the {{delivery}} cylinder and by the cylinder into the delivery line on the forward stroke. Depending {{on the level of}} the delivery pressure in the pipe and on the flow properties of the medium, the delivery flange of the pump will be fitted with a flat slide valve or a lamellar non-return valve in order to prevent flowback of the material on the return stroke. Which delivery piston is actually selected will depend on the material which is to be pumped: Free flowing media call for perturbane sealing elements while bulky materials which have to be chopped up during pumping mean that hardened cutting edges are required.|$|R
50|$|The African {{migratory locust}} exists in its solitary form {{in many parts}} of Africa and its {{development}} is then similar to that of other grasshopper species. When the eggs hatch in extremely close proximity to each other, the first instar hoppers become attracted to each other and begin to form bands that move in synchrony. The band moves as a cohesive unit, pausing as the <b>hoppers</b> <b>feed</b> and bask in the sun, and merges with other bands. Bands have been known to travel for 24 km before they fledge into adults. The mutual attraction between the individual hoppers continues into adulthood and the insects continue to act as a cohesive group, a swarm.|$|R
40|$|The present work aims {{to design}} and {{analysis}} of Ball mill inlet chute along with the truck assembly for Roller press circuit UMS (Unidan Mill S) type FLS Ball mill which {{are used in the}} Cement industry for grinding clinker material. The present mill inlet chute can be used for the two compartment ball mills only in which primary and finish grinding both are takes place. It may be a closed or open circuit grinding systems. In recent days, the Ball mill grinding systems are used with the Roller press and it is developing very fastly. The primary grinding is done by the Roller press and finish grinding takes place in Ball mill. Because of this, we can increase the Ball mill capacity as well as the Cement production. Also the feed materials which are coming from roller press to the ball mill are powdery form instead of Clinker material. The <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> for this application requires more area to direct the material and more air allowing area to achieve the required air flow inside the mill to transmit the grounded material. The replacement of the liner plates/mill components and access during maintenance is difficult in the present UMS mills since the mill inlet is fixed with the foundation. This can be avoided by implementing the new designed movable truck assembly at inlet chute. In this design, the Inlet chute will be fixed on the movable truck assembly which can be easily removable along with chute during the maintenance and liner plate replacement. The main objective of this project is to identify and design the suitable inlet chute for the BM+RP mill circuit with <b>feed</b> <b>chute</b> truck assembly.

50|$|Tutin is a {{poisonous}} plant derivative {{found in the}} New Zealand tutu plant (Coriaria arborea, Coriaria genus, several different species). It acts as a potent antagonist of the glycine receptor, and has powerful convulsant effects. It is used in scientific research into the glycine receptor, and is also sometimes associated with outbreaks of toxic honey poisoning when bees feed honeydew exudate from the sap-sucking insect {{commonly known as the}} passion vine hopper, when these vine hoppers (Scolypopa australis) have been feeding on the sap of tutu bushes.

50|$|Gas handgun {{magazines}} usually contain 10 to 30 pellets in {{a standard}} capacity magazine; however, some are high capacity magazines and can hold 50 rounds or more. In the case of AEG rifles, magazines come in either real-capacity (equivalent to the capacity of its real steel counterpart), low-capacity (10-50 rounds), mid-capacity (75-160 rounds), or high-capacity (190+ rounds). These magazines are spring-loaded. The high-cap magazines often have a ratchet wheel that can be wound up periodically to force pellets up from the holding chamber of the magazine to the <b>feeding</b> <b>chute.</b> Due to loose pellets in the reservoir, they often make a rattling noise when running or walking. Some airsoft guns have a battery-powered box or drum magazine that holds thousands of pellets, but these are usually only used and allowed on LMGs (light machine gun)type replicas.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} primary designs for a drum magazine. The most common is the {{cylinder}} type, {{that has a}} spider gear assembly that has an opening in each gear {{for two to three}} rounds of ammunition and can be loaded from the rear, used primarily in the AK-47. Another common design is the double-stack dual-horn drum, which operates like a standard stick magazine, but diverges the ammo into two separate <b>feed</b> <b>chutes</b> that run on a single cog. Rimmed ammunition including shotgun ammunition operated drums primarily run off a cogged (gear shaped) design which feeds each individual round of the ammo from the outermost edge of the drum. Recently a single-stack compact design has been released, which uses most of the interior capacity of the drum. It is driven by a single hub and telescopic shaft.|$|R

50|$|The term feeding in {{the context}} of vacuum fillers refers to {{actively}} moving the filling media {{in the direction of the}} lower part of the hopper to support the vacuum approach within the <b>hopper.</b> <b>Feeding</b> is achieved by using moveable feeding augers with scrapers/rigid counter arms. The feeding auger is driven in synchronisation with the rotation of the rotors. Due to the special geometry of both augers and the parallel rotation movement, the filling product is moved vertically in the direction of the vane cell feed system. The required feed intensity depends on the viscosity of the media to be filled. Less active feed is needed with low-viscosity media than with high-viscosity product. There are therefore a variety of combinations or versions of the parts involved in the feeding process.|$|R

2500|$|The {{armament}} {{was increased}} {{with the addition}} of two more [...] (...) AN/M2 [...] "light-barrel" [...] M2 Browning machine guns, the standard heavy-calibre machine gun used throughout the American air services of World War II, bringing the total to six. The inner pair of machine guns had 400 rpg, and the others had 270 rpg, for a total of 1,880. In previous P-51s, the M2s mounts were axially tilted to allow the guns to have access to the <b>feed</b> <b>chutes</b> from the ammunition trays. This angled mounting had caused problems with the ammunition feed and with spent casings and links failing to clear the gun-chutes, leading to frequent complaints that the guns jammed during combat maneuvers. The new arrangement allowed the M2s to be mounted upright, remedying most of the jamming problems. In addition the weapons were installed along the line of the wing's dihedral, rather than parallel to the ground line as in the earlier Mustangs.|$|R

50|$|Gravity {{delivers}} the apatite ore, carbon (coke) and silica (gravel) to the submerged-arc furnace through <b>feed</b> <b>chutes</b> {{situated in the}} roof of the furnace. This ensures a constant packed bed volume. The gaseous product, a mixture of carbon monoxide and phosphorus gas, leaves the furnace through two symmetrically placed outlet vents situated above the ferrophosphorus tap hole in {{the roof of the}} furnace. The ferrophosphorus is tapped off, usually once per day. Slag, however, is continuously tapped through two alternating, water-cooled tap holes located 400 mm above the furnace floor. The feed material forms the major electrical and flow resistance of the smelting furnace circuit. As the feed materials descend towards the hot zone in the furnace, they start to soften and melt, significantly lowering the electrical resistance. A conductive path is thus provided between the electrodes where the Joule heating is released to attain the high temperatures and energy levels needed to effect the essential endothermic reactions.|$|R
