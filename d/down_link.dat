30|$|Table 8 {{also shows}} that for AT&T, the {{percentage}} of shut <b>down</b> <b>links</b> for the best online approach, Online-MO, is around 97.7 % {{of the percentage of}} shut <b>down</b> <b>links</b> observed for Offline-R. Online-MO selects paths that require the fewest number of new links, which decreases the overall percentage of active links. On the other hand, Online-R-LSP randomly selects paths without considering energy consumption. This results in Online-R-LSP exhibiting the smallest percentage of shut <b>down</b> <b>links</b> among the studied approaches, with only 12.2 % of the recorded percentage of Offline-R. For Abilene, Table 9 indicates that Online-R and Online-R-LSP exhibit the best and worst performance, respectively.

40|$|We propose an {{analytical}} {{model for a}} Wi-Fi network acting as a last-mile Internet access with multiple long-lived TCP connections on both the up and <b>down</b> <b>links.</b> Our model considers the joint impact of buffer losses at the access point, contention at the medium access control layer, and packet losses due to the wireless channel being erroneous. We show that the model accurately quantifies the probability of an arbitrary TCP packet being discarded, and the total throughput obtained on the up and <b>down</b> <b>links.</b> Furthermore, quantitative insights can be gained into the throughput that long-lived TCP flows achieve under the joint impact of all aforementioned types of losses. In particular, {{we find that the}} wireless channel errors and buffer overflows both lead to throughput unfairness, but that they do so in the opposite direction on the up and <b>down</b> <b>links,</b> respectively. We demonstrate that this insight can be exploited so as to significantly mitigate the throughput unfairness without compromising the total obtainable network throughput...|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} an evolved antenna is an X-band antenna evolved for a 2006 NASA mission called Space Technology 5 (ST5). The mission {{consists}} of three satellites that will take measurements in Earth's magnetosphere. Each satellite has two communication antennas to talk to ground stations. The antenna has an unusual structure and was evolved to meet a challenging set of mission requirements, notably the combination of wide beamwidth for a circularly polarized wave and wide impedance bandwidth to cover the up and <b>down</b> <b>link</b> frequencies at X-band. Each spacecraft had two antennas - an evolved unit and a more standard, quadrifilar helix antenna. Both antennas were fabricated by the Physical Science Laboratory at New Mexico State University. Their external appearance was essentially identical in that a foam radome covered the radiating elements. The ST5 mission successfully launched on March 22, 2006 and operated for the mission period before being decommissioned by NASA, and so this evolved antenna represents the world's first artificially-evolved object to fly in space. Other evolved antennas were subsequently used on the LADEE spacecraft.|$|E

50|$|Sergeant J. W. Collins of the Houston Police Department Southwest Patrol Division {{said that}} the factor that aggravated the trade {{was the fact that}} Link Valley was in close {{proximity}} to the 610 Loop. Many drug customers from across Houston traveled to Link Valley to buy drugs. They used the 610 Loop to quickly enter and exit the Link Valley area. A customer would take the Stella Link exit off of 610, then drive <b>down</b> <b>Link</b> Valley Drive and receive his or her drugs. After the drug purchase, the customer would travel to the 610 Loop feeder roads via a side street, and quickly leave Link Valley. Collins said that many of the drug customers were White Americans who were casual drug users, and he recalled that powdered cocaine, rather than crack cocaine, was the main drug purchased at the complex. Collins added that while many White casual drug consumers would feel nervous entering a black neighborhood, where they would more easily stand out and attract attention of law enforcement and violent criminals; in Link Valley they could easily enter and leave the community, so they felt more confident in buying drugs there. Link Valley was so popular that it frequently drew faraway visitors; some patrol officers said that vehicles with Louisiana license plates frequently appeared at Link Valley.|$|E
