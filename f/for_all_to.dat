5|$|Fascism {{has been}} {{prescribed}} dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform {{presented in the}} Fascist manifesto in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary {{groups such as the}} fasci femminilli and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from Prime Minister Benito Mussolini's more conservative coalition partners.|$|E

25|$|Constantine entered Rome on 29 October. He {{staged a}} grand adventus in the city, and {{was met with}} popular jubilation. Maxentius' body was fished out of the Tiber and decapitated.

After the ceremonies, Maxentius' disembodied head was sent to Carthage; at this Carthage would offer no further resistance.|$|E

The center of this activity was the Rue du Croissant, only blocks from the Ecole Turgot.|$|E

This was the birth of the Library Company of Philadelphia: its charter was composed by Franklin in 1731. In 1732, Franklin hired the first American librarian, Louis Timothee.

Lamptey was the beating heart of a very good side. His fast feet, speed of thought, and clever interplay with captain Alex Opoku and fellow midfielders Mohammed Gargo and Emmanuel Duah were on display <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> see. His willingness to get into the box was critical too, and his four goals made him joint top-goalscorer.|$|E

Usually, music is performed and Scripture is read during the receiving of the elements.|$|E

However Azcueta and the entire expedition were lost in a shipwreck between Manila and Macao.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle Ages, the {{majority}} of seals were pendent. They were attached both to legal instruments and to letters patent (i.e. open letters) conferring rights or privileges, which were intended to be available <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> view. In the case of important transactions or agreements, the seals of all parties to the arrangement {{as well as of}} witnesses might be attached to the document, and so once executed it would carry several seals. Most governments still attach pendent seals to letters patent.|$|E

Moreover, this was not a secret ballot. At that time the polling booth was a piece of paper with the names of the candidates shown.

People were disemboweled and torn apart shortly after death and laid out <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> see. It is speculated that this ritual was a form of dedication to the gods. The type of human sacrifice included victims being hacked in pieces, dismembered, exposed to the elements and carnivores before being deposed in trash. Research showed that one man who was sacrificed was not a native to the Titicaca Basin, leaving room to think that sacrifices were most likely of people originally from other societies.|$|E

25|$|Herod the Great built {{a palace}} within the {{fortress}} of Herodium.

Once Herod died and the Great Revolt started, Herodium was abandoned. The Jews eventually had a base at Herodium where they built a synagogue which can still be seen today, unlike much of Herod’s Palace.|$|E
