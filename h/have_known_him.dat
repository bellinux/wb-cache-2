25|$|Pytheas was {{a central}} source of {{information}} on the North Sea and the subarctic regions of western Europe to later periods, and possibly the only source. The only ancient authors we know by name who certainly saw Pytheas' original text were Dicaearchus, Timaeus, Eratosthenes, Crates of Mallus, Hipparchus, Polybius, Artemidorus and Posidonius. Notably the list does not include Strabo or Tacitus, though Strabo discusses him and Tacitus may likely have known about his work. Either of the two could <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> through other writers or have read his work in the original.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} ever since I {{was a child}} Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, and {{the person in the}} world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E

This case was eventually reopened by law enforcement in 2014. The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children was also contacted by the Tooele County police department and created a forensic facial reconstruction of the subject by using mortuary photographs as an influence to create a likeness of his facial features. Subsequently, a poster was developed by the organization that was displayed to the public in hopes that he would be recognized by someone who may <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> in life. The cause of the victim's death was determined to have been two gunshot wounds to the head. This detail was not released to the public until a major break in the case developed.|$|E

500|$|He {{argues that}} the bishop of Bangor in County Down, Dub Innse, {{described}} Israel as a [...] "Roman scholar", and that he therefore {{does not appear to}} have recognised him as a fellow Irishman. Lapidge states that Flodoard was contemporary with Israel and may <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>him,</b> whereas Ruotger wrote after Israel's death and probably did not have first hand knowledge. Giving children Old Testament Hebrew names such as Israel was common in Celtic areas in the tenth century. Lapidge concludes that Brittany is more likely than Wales or Cornwall, as manuscripts associated with him have Breton glosses, and Æthelstan's court was a haven for Breton scholars fleeing Viking occupation of their homeland.|$|E

2500|$|The epistle dedicatory is to Richard Lichfield, a barber-surgeon of Cambridge {{noted for}} his ability to make humorous, mock-academic orations. Nashe, who clearly knows {{something}} of Lichfield but may not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> personally, at first addresses him in hyperbolic terms of exaggerated respect. The language chosen for the dedication is probably in imitation of a verbose and comically pedantic style sometimes used by Lichfield, and certain other barber-surgeons at Cambridge, for entertainment. Throughout the epistle Nashe seems to be appealing to Lichfield to join him in attacking Harvey and his brothers, though the tone is edgy and it is unclear whether Nashe seriously expects a favourable response.|$|E

His face was a familiar one in many a hospital ward.... During the last weeks of his residence in New York, he supported, out of his scanty means, a family of which one of the members had been a victim to opium. This family had no claim upon him whatever excepting that of the sympathy which such misfortunes always excited in him. The medicines and money he furnished this single family in the course of the several weeks that I knew about them, could not have amounted to less than one hundred dollars, and this case was only one of many.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Dolphin {{proved to}} be far too slow, lagging behind {{the rest of the}} pirate ships, so it was burned and the crew joined Every on the Fancy. The Amity and Susanna also {{proved to be}} poor ships: the Amity fell behind and never again rejoined the pirate {{squadron}} (Captain Tew having been killed in a battle with a Mughal ship), while the straggling Susanna eventually rejoined the group. The pirates caught up with the Fateh Muhammed four or five days later. Perhaps intimidated by the Fancy's forty-six guns or weakened by an earlier battle with Tew, the Fateh Muhammed's crew put up little resistance; Every's pirates then sacked the ship, which had belonged to one Abdul Ghaffar, reportedly Surat's wealthiest merchant. In fact, Ghaffar was so powerful and wealthy, one associate described him as follows: [...] "Abdul Ghafur, a Mahometan that I was acquainted with, drove a trade equal to the English East-India Company, for I <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> to fit out in a year, above twenty sail of ships, between 300 and 800 tons." [...] While the Fateh Muhammed's treasure of some £50,000 to £60,000 was enough to buy the Fancy fifty times over, once the treasure was shared out among the pirate fleet Every's crew received only small shares.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his letter}} to Obadiah the Proselyte, Maimonides {{addressed}} whether a convert could recite declarations like that in [...] "A wandering Aramean was my father." [...] Maimonides wrote that converts may say such declarations in the prescribed order and not change them in the least, and may bless and pray {{in the same way}} as every Jew by birth. Maimonides reasoned that Abraham taught the people, brought many under the wings of the Divine Presence, and ordered members of his household after him to keep God's ways forever. As God said of Abraham in [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>him</b> to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice." [...] Ever since then, Maimonides taught, whoever adopts Judaism is counted among the disciples of Abraham. They are Abraham's household, and Abraham converted them to righteousness. In the same way that Abraham converted his contemporaries, he converts future generations through the testament that he left behind him. Thus Abraham is the father of his posterity who keep his ways and of all proselytes who adopt Judaism. Therefore, Maimonides counseled converts to pray, [...] "God of our fathers," [...] because Abraham is their father. They should pray, [...] "You who have taken for his own our fathers," [...] for God gave the land to Abraham when in [...] God said, [...] "Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give to you." [...] Maimonides concluded that there is no difference between converts and born Jews. Both should say the blessing, [...] "Who has chosen us," [...] "Who has given us," [...] "Who have taken us for Your own," [...] and [...] "Who has separated us"; for God has chosen converts and separated them from the nations and given them the Torah. For the Torah has been given to born Jews and proselytes alike, as [...] says, [...] "One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourns with you, an ordinance forever in your generations; as you are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord." [...] Maimonides counseled converts not to consider their origin as inferior. While born Jews descend from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, converts derive from God, through whose word the world was created. As Isaiah said in [...] "One shall say, I am the Lord's, and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara cited [...] to {{show that}} Abraham walked righteously and {{followed}} the commandments. Rabbi Simlai taught that God communicated to Moses a total of 613 commandments — 365 negative commandments, corresponding {{to the number of}} days in the solar year, and 248 positive commandments, corresponding to the number of the parts in the human body. The Gemara taught that David reduced the number of precepts to eleven, as [...] says, [...] "Lord, who shall sojourn in Your Tabernacle? Who shall dwell in Your holy mountain? — He who (1) walks uprightly, and (2) works righteousness, and (3) speaks truth in his heart; who (4) has no slander upon his tongue, (5) nor does evil to his fellow, (6) nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor, (7) in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but (8) he honors them who fear the Lord, (9) he swears to his own hurt and changes not, (10) he puts not out his money on interest, (11) nor takes a bribe against the innocent." [...] Isaiah reduced them to six principles, as [...] says, [...] "He who (1) walks righteously, and (2) speaks uprightly, (3) he who despises the gain of oppressions, (4) who shakes his hand from holding of bribes, (5) who stops his ear from hearing of blood, (6) and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil; he shall dwell on high." [...] The Gemara explained that [...] "he who walks righteously" [...] referred to Abraham, as [...] says, [...] "For I <b>have</b> <b>known</b> <b>him,</b> to the end that he may command his children and his household after him." [...] Micah reduced the commandments to three principles, as [...] says, [...] "It has been told you, o man, what is good, and what the Lord requires of you: only (1) to do justly, and (2) to love mercy, and (3) to walk humbly before your God." [...] Isaiah reduced them to two principles, as [...] says, [...] "Thus says the Lord, (1) Keep justice and (2) do righteousness." [...] Amos reduced them to one principle, as [...] says, [...] "For thus says the Lord to the house of Israel, 'Seek Me and live.'" [...] To this Rav Nahman bar Isaac demurred, saying that this might be taken as: [...] "Seek Me by observing the whole Torah and live." [...] The Gemara concluded that Habakkuk based all the Torah's commandments on one principle, as [...] says, [...] "But the righteous shall live by his faith."–24a5.
