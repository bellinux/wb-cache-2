40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the effect of hot EGR on {{combustion}} characteristic of hydrogen internal combustion engine (HICE), experimental study was taken on a 4 cylinder, 2. 0 L HICE. The speed was 3000 rpm, and the throttle was fully open, the load was adjusted through quality regulation. When the hydrogen flow ratio was 2. 79 kg /h, the ignition advanced angle was optimized as maximum brake torque (MBT) timing, then the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> was opened, and <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> was adjusted to control the flow of exhaust gas that back into the intake manifold. The test results show that: as the EGR ratio changing from 0 (the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> is fully closed) to 43. 8 %(the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> is fully opened), the in-cylinder pressure is decreasing with the EGR ratio increasing; the coefficient of variation in indicated mean effective pressure (imepCOV) is not changing significantly at high load conditions, changing range is less than 1 %; CA 50 is postponed from 11. 8 o CAto 15. ...|$|R
50|$|With OBD II standards, vehicle {{manufacturers}} {{were required to}} test the exhaust gas recirculation (<b>EGR)</b> <b>valve</b> for functionality during driving. Some manufacturers use the MaP sensor to accomplish this. In these vehicles, they have a MAF sensor for their primary load sensor. The MaP sensor is then used for rationality checks and to test the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve.</b> The way they do this is during a deceleration of the vehicle when there is low absolute pressure in the intake manifold (i.e., a high vacuum present in the intake manifold relative to the outside air) the powertrain control module (PCM) will open the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> and then monitor the MaP sensor's values. If the EGR is functioning properly, the manifold absolute pressure will increase as exhaust gases enter.|$|R

40|$|Because of {{environmental}} pollution, forces {{the automotive industry}} constantly reduced emissions requirements legislated by the authorities. Improved techniques for engine control are a must for bringing down emissions. The use of an Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) reduces NOx emissions significantly. Faulty <b>EGR</b> <b>valves</b> affect the emissions negative and therefore needs to be eliminated. It is possible to create malfunctions on the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> by modifying the software of the control unit (ECU), {{but it does not}} create realistic malfunctions. The problem by modifying the software is that flags and various parameters are set to confirm the malfunction of the ECU. To create actual failure of the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> an external tool to modify the control signal is needed. The project's main objective is on a flexible way creating malfunctions on the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> in a truck engine. By investigating engine behavior in a realistic and credible way, one can eliminate malfunctions on the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve.</b> The aim was achieved by a model that has been developed that can, using electronics and a microprocessor read and create a control signal. The electronic circuit is controlled by the microprocessor, which can modify the signal and create malfunctions {{in the form of a}} slow valve "slow-response". A graphical user interface is used to change and influence the error signal. The circuit with the microprocessor is placed safely in a box to both protect and preserve the components. Simulation of Slow response has resulted in an incorrect operated valve being created. Using two different methods a Slow-response can be created. One method is a delay in time, which occurs when the new position is given, the second method is a ramp function when the control signal is gradually increasing. The software can also create an error that mimics a stuck valve of a fixed value. With the above listed methods it is possible in theory to find unknown malfunctions on the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> that influence emissions negatively. ...|$|R
50|$|For 1994, {{in order}} to meet more {{stringent}} emission requirements, a secondary air injection system, and an <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> were added to the C25XE and became the X25XE.|$|R
5000|$|The first EGR {{systems were}} crude; some were {{as simple as}} an orifice jet between the exhaust and intake tracts which {{admitted}} exhaust to the intake tract whenever the engine was running. Difficult starting, rough idling, and reduced performance and fuel economy resulted. By 1973, an <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> controlled by manifold vacuum opened or closed to admit exhaust to the intake tract only under certain conditions. Control systems grew more sophisticated as automakers gained experience; Chrysler's [...] "Coolant Controlled Exhaust Gas Recirculation" [...] system of 1973 exemplified this evolution: a coolant temperature sensor blocked vacuum to the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> until the engine reached normal operating temperature. This prevented driveability problems due to unnecessary exhaust induction; NOx forms under elevated temperature conditions generally not present with a cold engine. Moreover, the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> was controlled, in part, by vacuum drawn from the carburetor's venturi, which allowed more precise constraint of EGR flow to only those engine load conditions under which NOx is likely to form. Later, backpressure transducers {{were added to the}} <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> control to further tailor EGR flow to engine load conditions. Most modern engines now need exhaust gas recirculation to meet emissions standards. However, recent innovations have {{led to the development of}} engines that do not require them. The 3.6 Chrysler Pentastar engine is one example that does not require EGR.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{determine}} the effect of the exhaust temperature on the performance of the diesel engine with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) with respect to engine speed, throttle, biodiesel fuel and diesel fuel. Experiments have been performed for diesel fuel and bio-diesel fuel with 50 % of throttle position for with and without EGR system. Engine brake torque, brake power and the exhaust temperature have been investigated for both fuels. All data were collected using data acquisition system which operates with Dewesoft software. The data were then exported to the Microsoft excel in order to construct graphs for performance analysis for each type of fuel and the engine conditions. From the analysis, {{it was found that the}} existence of <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> were reducing the exhaust temperature. Other than that, the torque produced by the engine with <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> were also lower than the engine without <b>EGR</b> <b>valve.</b> This shows that the exhaust temperature has an effect on the engine performance and allows the reduction of NOx formation...|$|R
50|$|Inspection (and replacement, if necessary) of the MAP sensor, and its {{accompanying}} vacuum hose, {{is often}} a solution to many driveability problems. This sensor largely controls the engine's driveability. Stuck <b>EGR</b> <b>valves</b> are also very common on the Tech IV.|$|R
50|$|Since the EGR system recirculates {{a portion}} of exhaust gases, over time the valve can become clogged with carbon {{deposits}} that prevent it from operating properly. Clogged <b>EGR</b> <b>valves</b> can sometimes be cleaned, but replacement is necessary if the valve is faulty.|$|R
50|$|Fitting a {{catch tank}} (can) {{will reduce the}} amount of oil vapor {{reaching}} the intake tract and combustion chamber. Without the oil vapor the soot from the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> will not congeal so much on the intake which will keep the intake from becoming clogged.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{framework}} for isolating unprecedented faults for an <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> system is presented. Using normal behavior data generated by a high fidelity engine simulation, the recently introduced Growing Structure Multiple Model System (GSMMS) is used to construct models of normal behavior for an <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> system and its various subsystems. Using the GSMMS models as a foundation, anomalous behavior of the entire system is then detected as statistically significant departures {{of the most recent}} modeling residuals from the modeling residuals during normal behavior. By reconnecting anomaly detectors to the constituent subsystems, the anomaly can be isolated without the need for prior training using faulty data. Furthermore, faults that were previously encountered (and modeled) are recognized using the same approach as the anomaly detectors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In diesel engines, {{accurate}} EGR {{control is}} important {{due to its}} effect on nitrogen oxide and particulate matter emissions. Conventional EGR control system comprises a PI feedback controller for tracking target air mass flow and a feedforward controller for fast response. Physically, the EGR flow is affected by <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> lift and thermodynamic properties of the EGR path, such as pressures and temperatures. However, the conventional feedforward control output is indirectly derived from engine operating conditions, such as engine rotational speed and fuel injection quantity. Accordingly, the conventional feedforward control action counteracts the feedback controller in certain operating conditions. In order to improve this disadvantage, in this study, we proposed feedforward EGR control algorithm based on a physical model of the EGR system. The proposed EGR control strategy was validated with a 3. 0 liter common rail direct injection diesel engine equipped with a DC motor type <b>EGR</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|R
5000|$|While {{cylinder}} deactivation {{would make}} a comeback some 20 years later with modern computing power (and using oil pressure to deactivate the valves by collapsing the lifters) Cadillac's 1981 V8-6-4 proved to have insurmountable engineering problems. The main issue was that the Engine Control Module simply lacked the robustness, programming and processing speed to efficiently manage the cylinder-deactivation under all load conditions. In the era before electronically operated <b>EGR</b> <b>valves,</b> the engineers also made an error in using a [...] "back-pressure-type" [...] <b>EGR</b> <b>valve.</b> While this early effort to match the vacuum-controlled EGR volume more accurately to the engine's load made sense in a 'normal' engine, it {{had the effect of}} causing pinging (detonation) problems in the V8-6-4 engine, because 4 cylinders operating under higher load needed more EGR, while they were actually producing less exhaust flow and therefore less back-pressure to operate the valve.|$|R

50|$|Tell-tale {{signs of}} such {{eventual}} related damage are a white foam that {{appears on the}} inside of the oil filler cap and the gradually increasing loss of antifreeze coolant (due to seepage into the intake passages which will lead to engine lock up failure in such cases).

50|$|The {{most common}} use, however, is {{probably}} in vehicles. It {{is used in}} door seals, window seals, trunk seals, and sometimes hood seals. Frequently, these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to movement of the door against the car body and the resulting friction between the EPDM rubber and the mating surface (painted sheet metal or glass). This can be alleviated using specialty coatings that are applied at the time of manufacture of the weather seal. Such coatings can also greatly increase the chemical resistance of EPDM rubber. Some vehicle manufacturers also recommend a light application of silicone dielectric grease to weatherstripping to reduce noise. Other uses in vehicles include cooling system circuit hoses where water pumps, thermostats, <b>EGR</b> <b>valves,</b> <b>EGR</b> coolers, heaters, oil coolers, radiators, and degas bottles are connected with EPDM hoses, as well as charge air tubing on turbocharged engines to connect the cold side of the charge air cooler (intercooler) to the intake manifold.|$|R

The intrinsic model accuracy limit of a commonly used Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) mass flow rate model in diesel engine air path control is discussed in this paper. This EGR mass flow rate model {{is based on the}} flow of a compressible ideal gas with unchanged specific heat ratio through a restriction cross-area within a duct. A practical identification procedure of the model parameters is proposed based on the analysis of the engine data and model structure. This procedure has several advantages which include simplicity, low computation burden and low engine test cost. It is shown that model tuning requires only an <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> sweep test at a few engine steady state operating points. It is also shown that good model accuracy can be achieved when the control variables of other air path devices, e. g. The vane position of a Variable Geometry Turbocharger (VGT) and the torque demand of an Electric Turbo Assist (ETA), are kept constant during the <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> sweep test used to tune the model. Two different diesel engines are used in this work to demonstrate the model tuning procedure and the model validation results. Both engines are equipped with a high pressure external EGR system and a VGT. One of the engines has a relatively new air system device - an ETA. The model validation results of both engines show good model accuracy not only at steady state engine operating points but also during engine transients...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{combustion}} strategies including premixed charge {{compression ignition}} (PCCI) and lifted flame combustion are promising strategies for meeting increasingly stringent emissions regulations and improving fuel efficiency in next generation powertrains. In {{order to promote}} and implement these strategies closed-loop control of the gas exchange process and combustion is critical. Variable valve actuation (VVA) can {{play a key role}} in determining and controlling inputs to the combustion process. Modulation of intake valve closure (IVC) timing dictates the effective compression ratio (ECR) and influences the total amount of charge trapped inside the cylinder, and in doing so allows manipulation of the concentration and temperature history of the reactants prior to and during the combustion process. A validated whole engine model for a 6. 7 liter six cylinder, turbocharged diesel engine with cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) was used to investigate the gas exchange process behavior for steady state engine operation. The interaction between the primary actuators of the air handling system of a conventional modern diesel engine; the variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) and <b>EGR</b> <b>valve,</b> was analyzed at two different operating points using the model. The effect of different actuator positions and their coupled interactions was investigated via generation of charge flow versus EGR fraction diagrams from both simulation predictions and experimental data. The observations showed an increase in charge flow when the VGT position was modulated from open to close for a constant <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> position. There was also a slight increase in EGR fraction due to increase in pressure at turbine and <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> inlet as VGT closed. Similarly, an increase in EGR fraction with <b>EGR</b> <b>valve</b> position modulation was observed along with a slight reduction in charge flow, which was explained by reduction in turbine inlet pressure due to reduced restriction in exhaust path. ^ The effect of intake valve closing (IVC) event timing modulation on effective compression ratio (ECR) and gas exchange process was also investigated. The motivation behind this analysis was to explore the control authority of IVC modulation on the gas exchange process and ECR for implementing advanced combustion strategies including Premixed Charge Compression Ignition (PCCI) and lifted-flame combustion in steady state. A reduction in ECR with IVC modulation was observed. It was also shown that a particular ECR-reduction could be achieved via an early or late IVC timing modulation. The gas exchange process showed a decrease in charge flow with reduction in effective compression ratio. The EGR fraction also reduced accordingly. The trends were confirmed by experimental data from Cummins ISB engine with a VVA system. The electro-hydraulic VVA used is only one of its kind in academia, with control software development and implementation done at Herrick labs, Purdue University. The engine data with VVA for six cylinders showed good agreement with simulation results. The work described in this thesis established steady state control authority of IVC timing, EGR and VGT positions on ECR. It also establishes the effect of ECR modulation on gas exchange process of a modern diesel engine with data validation from a multi-cylinder engine with VVA capability. A method to estimate temperature at top dead center is also described and validated against simulation results. Candidate control structures for both steady state and transient operation are also suggested in this thesis. The work described in this thesis is a first step towards demonstrating PCCI on a multi-cylinder engine with VVA capability for steady state operation, and lays the ground work for model investigation and control development for transient engine operation for promotion of advanced combustion modes. ...|$|R
