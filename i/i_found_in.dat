5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

In the wake of a famous battle, especially one that marked the culmination of a war such as Ulundi on 4 July 1879, every European involved in the battle appeared to want to own an object that could serve as a reminder of the event.|$|E

25|$|I needed good victims. Recent news {{had offered}} an {{excellent}} group, the Baha'is, {{who had been}} horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the more convinced I became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms {{in the defense of}} the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.|$|E
500|$|Warren {{noted that}} Washington, D.C. had many memorials, {{but that this}} area, with the forest as a [...] "living memorial," [...] would have [...] "greatly pleased" [...] Kennedy for two reasons. First, Kennedy himself had spoken of the {{importance}} of planting trees in Israel, when he had addressed a 1958 Jewish National Fund meeting while serving as a junior Senator from Massachusetts, saying, [...] "What work could be more heartwarming or more enduring than the great forest at Jerusalem. Your children and grandchildren when they visit Israel will find your monument". [...] Second, Warren recalled that Kennedy had visited Israel twice, the first time in 1939 when it was still part of the British Mandate, and the second time in 1951. Speaking in 1951 {{of the differences between the}} people he witnessed during those two visits, he said that [...] "Perhaps the greatest change of all <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> the hearts and minds of the people, For unlike the discouraged settlers of 1939 they looked to the future with hope. I found a revival of an ancient spirit". Warren concluded his remarks by saying he would use the same word that President Kennedy would have used: [...] "Shalom." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1953, {{soon after}} his {{appointment}} as United Nations Secretary-General, Hammarskjöld was interviewed on radio by Edward R. Murrow.

2500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Panopticon was generally very warm; some offered extremely high praise, whilst others deemed it average. Although {{it was not}} lambasted by any major publications, several deemed it slightly inferior to Oceanic, released two years previously. As Michael Chamy noted in his review for the Austin Chronicle, it does not “reach the heights or descend to the depths of Oceanic, but it's an amazing journey to a place unlike any other.” A Tiny Mix Tapes review agreed, stating that Panopticon “doesn't outshine Oceanic”. Detailing this further, a Punknews reviewer noted: “the only flaw that <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> this otherwise exemplary recording was the less engrossing overall structure of the record; while Oceanic was [...] novel like in its structure with each chapter forming an overall arc, Panopticon {{is more like a}} series of short stories – disconnected, perhaps – but clearly penned by the same hand.” Others disagreed; Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy held it to be a “stronger record” than Oceanic. Isis' next album, 2006's In the Absence of Truth, was met rather less fondly by both critics and the band themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Freeman Dyson, a British (and later American) {{physicist}} who {{had worked}} as a young man with RAF Bomber Command from July 1943 {{to the end of the}} war, wrote in later years: [...] "For many years I had intended to write a book on the bombing. Now I do not need to write it, because Vonnegut has written it much better than I could. He was in Dresden at the time and saw what happened. His book is not only good literature. It is also truthful. The only inaccuracy that <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> it is that it does not say that the night attack which produced the holocaust was a British affair. The Americans only came the following day to plow over the rubble. Vonnegut, being American, did not want to write his account in such a way that the whole thing could be blamed on the British. Apart from that, everything he says is true." [...] Dyson later goes on to say: [...] "Since the beginning of the war I had been retreating step by step from one moral position to another, until at the end I had no moral position at all".|$|E
