5|$|Candace, back at {{the mall}} (having not further {{attempted}} to bust her brothers since the building implosion from earlier), is downtrodden until her crush, Jeremy, assures her to not let the boys' fun ruin her good time and that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> the chance to sing, she ought to, so she joins with the band singing their hit song in a reunion concert. When she thinks she has finally made it, the band announces they have finished their career and the mall closes, leaving her in the dark.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Florence {{attempted}} to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that watched for sharks and {{were prepared to}} help her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> hurt or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who {{was in one of}} the boats, that she did not think she could make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As she sat in the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E
500|$|Phoebe and Ross {{arrive at}} the airport as Rachel boards the plane again. Ross tells her he loves her, but she is unable {{to deal with his}} {{confession}} and gets on the plane anyway. Ross returns home, dejected, and finds a message from Rachel on the phone. She explains her actions and decides to get off the plane, but the message cuts off. Ross panickingly tries fixing the answering machine, wondering to himself out loud <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> off the plane. From behind him, Rachel says she did. They kiss and get back together for good, both agreeing that this is where they want to be. The following morning, the friends gather in Monica and Chandler's empty apartment. With some time remaining before Monica and Chandler leave for their new house, the six all leave their keys to the apartment on the kitchen counter and decide to go for one last cup of coffee together, to which Chandler sarcastically quips, [...] "Where?". The final scene is a shot of the apartment, panning round slowly from the living space to the front door.|$|E

6000|$|... "She can, too, <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> {{the quality}} we think she has. Chicago society isn't the New York four hundred. We're all workers here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you didn't tell me, and that's why I'm {{so anxious}} to know. <b>If</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> the mumps, and the chilblains, and the ingrowing warts--" ...|$|R
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Diane Ruggiero and {{directed}} by Steve Gomer, marking Ruggiero's fifteenth writing credit, and Gomer's fourth and final directing credit for the series. The episode features a guest appearance by Patty Hearst, a wealthy heiress and famous kidnapping victim. Series creator Rob Thomas {{came up with the}} idea for Hearst's storyline in July 2006, stating, [...] "If we can get Patty Hearst to play a board of trustees member – what <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> kidnapped? That would be a pretty great story to tell. It's not an idea we've broken, but it's up on the wall as a possibility." [...] Hearst had recently appeared on single-episode parts on Boston Common and Son of the Beach. Due to a miscommunication between Thomas, Hearst, and her agent, Hearst was booked for Veronica Mars before she knew about the guest role, with Thomas telling TV Guide that she was playing a character that was similar to herself. Hearst described reacting to the casting news: [...] "I was on the computer one day and read that I was going to be on Veronica Mars. Rob Thomas was giving an interview and happily saying, 'Oh yes, and we’re very excited.' [...] " [...] After hearing this news, Hearst contacted her agent and jokingly asked her when the agent was planning on telling her that she would be appearing on the show.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2010, Gibson {{had been}} {{recorded}} during {{a phone call}} with Oksana Grigorieva suggesting that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> [...] "raped by a pack of niggers," [...] she would be to blame. Gibson was barred from coming near Grigorieva or their daughter due to a domestic violence-related restraining order. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department launched a domestic violence investigation against Gibson, later dropped when Gibson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor battery charge.|$|E

6000|$|... "You're talking rot!" [...] he declared. [...] "Pamela wouldn't {{marry you}} {{if you were the}} last man on earth, and <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> {{anything}} <b>she</b> wants to keep, she'll keep it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aboard of her!" [...] said he. [...] "She's {{been gone}} more 'n half an hour. She don't often stop here more 'n ten minutes, <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> the tide with her, {{which she had}} this mornin', strong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean Cynthy? Well! I {{guess when}} Cynthy can't {{get along with}} the sight of Jeff Durgin, she'll be a {{different}} girl from what she's ever been before. <b>If</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> to see that skunk ag'in, I guess {{this is about the}} best time to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no guards {{have been}} placed there. There are many women in the hut. There was no fear of her escape. Besides, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> out, where could she go to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looks a bit}} doubtful," [...] Grierson objected. [...] "We mightn't be able to {{pull her}} out <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> in very deep. We could dump half the load and come back for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None wotsomever; on'y remember, if it do {{turn out}} to be 'er, you won't betray me. Honour bright! She may be revengeful, you know, an' might 'ave me took up <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> 'old of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all," [...] {{he said to}} Nevitt, as {{they walked}} {{together}} from the club in Piccadilly, [...] "I may as well see what the girl's like, anyhow. <b>If</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> to be my sister-in-law--which seems not unlikely now--I'd better {{have a look at}} her beforehand, so to speak, on approbation." ...|$|R
6000|$|Winterborne laughed coldly. [...] "Won't {{money do}} anything," [...] he said, [...] "if you've {{promising}} material to work upon? Why shouldn't a Hintock girl, taken early from home, and put under proper instruction, become as finished {{as any other}} young lady, <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> brains and good looks to begin with?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't worry yourself," [...] I comforted him. [...] "Of {{course she}} isn't put out. Besides, I don't care <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is. <b>She's</b> <b>got</b> {{to get used}} to being put out; it's part of the lesson of life." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{had some}} mild fun about the {{weakness}} of Cornelia in needing an escort. She found it best to own {{that she did not}} quite know her way home, and was afraid to ask <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> puzzled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope she}} wasn't shut out, {{and that she}} hadn't to walk {{the streets in the}} rain. Do you mind my putting on my {{waterproof}} and going to see <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> in? I've been thinking of her all the morning." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> away, {{all would}} be well. They would doubtless hear by letter from Jim, {{and it would be}} better that he should not return at present to Sidmouth, but should at once take up his {{residence}} in London, and commence his studies there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lottie is all right," [...] {{said her}} mother, in resentment of his preference; {{but she could}} not help smiling at it. [...] "Don't you be foolish about Ellen. I approve of Mr. Breckon as much as you do. But it's her prettiness and {{sweetness}} that's taken his fancy, and not her wisdom, <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do see," [...] said Marks. [...] "Besides, <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> took in, 'tan't no go, neither. Dogs is no 'count {{in these}} yer up states where these critters gets carried; of course, ye can't get on their track. They only does down in plantations, where niggers, when they runs, {{has to do}} their own running, and don't get no help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Son, she's your charge, but I say {{leave her}} hyar, 'specially {{now you can}} be with us. She'd die or go crazy if you sent her. Why, she won't even say <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> a livin' relation. I reckon she hain't. She'd be better hyar. I've come to be fond of Allie. She's strange. She's like a spirit. But she's more human lately." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{but those}} who go through {{too much of it}} never get out again. Where would you be <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> a written promise of {{marriage}} from you?" [...] Poor Johnny did not answer this immediately, for in very truth Amelia Roper had such a document in her possession.|$|E
6000|$|Wiles {{turned his}} wicked eye on him. [...] "Manuel and Miguel, who sold {{out to our}} man, are afraid of her. They were our witnesses. I verily believe they'd take back {{everything}} <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> after them. And as for Pedro, he thinks she holds the power {{of life and death}} over him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, not much. I simply {{told him}} not to lose his nerve; that a woman never meant 'no'; that she often says it only to be made say 'yes.' And I ended up with telling him <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> a little skittish, as thoroughbreds do sometimes, to try a strong arm. That was my way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'An' <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> another garden, an' {{wants it}} dug in, an' things planted, an' fish caught, an' {{any other kind}} of shore work done, why, we're the men for her; an' we'll sign the papers for as long a v'yage as she likes, an' stick by her in fair weather or foul, bein' good for day work an' night work, an' allus ready to fall in when she passes the word.'

60|$|I took {{good care}} {{we were never}} alone, for in that case, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> ever <b>got</b> into my arms again I would find the ground {{slipping}} from under me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} she would have done with the {{instruction}} <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had <b>got</b> it," [...] said the judge, dryly, {{and the young man}} ventured in her behalf: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As they sy in the Bible,' she finished, 'it's enough ter mike one's grey 'airs go dahn {{into the}} ground in sorrer. I can show yer my {{marriage}} certificate. Of course one doesn't like ter say much, because of course she's very bad; but <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> well I should 'ave given 'er a talkin' ter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mrs. Plimmer's {{only got}} one fault,' he ses, shaking his 'cad, 'and that's jealousy. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> {{to know of}} Laura Lamb, {{it would be all}} U.P.

6000|$|... "Bring Little Mother down; {{we want to}} {{show her}} off on Friday. And make her put on {{something}} pretty. Ask her <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> that lilac thing with lace she wore at Cambridge for the May Week the year before last. Tell her not to be silly; it wasn't a bit too young. Nash said she looked like something out of an old picture, and he's going to be an artist. Don't let her dress herself. She doesn't understand it. And will you get me a gun--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, there's one thing, sure. The materializing {{has got to}} {{stop right}} where it is. <b>If</b> <b>she's</b> <b>got</b> to marry a spectre, let her marry a decent {{one out of the}} Middle Ages, like this one--not a cowboy and a thief such as this protoplasmic tadpole's going to turn into if Sellers keeps on fussing at it. It costs five {{thousand}} dollars cash and shuts down on the incorporated company to stop the works at this point, but Sally Sellers's happiness is worth more than that." ...|$|R
