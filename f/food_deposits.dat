40|$|Abstract: Extracellular {{digestion}} is {{a frequent}} mode of dissolution of dispersed organic detritus in marine sediments. Two geometric modes of deploying this digestive attack are extracorporeal: prokaryotic unicells, and intracorporeal: metazoans with flow-through guts. Enclosed digestive geometry gives metazoans greater ability both to retain digestive agents and to obtain digestive products, allowing them to create digestive conditions more intense than are generally found with communities of sedimentary bacteria. Metazoans hence can dissolve food substrate more quickly. Extracellular hydrolytic enzymes are sorptive for bacteria and dissolved for animals, enhancing both speed and net digestive gain for their respective geometries. Experiments showed little evidence for mass loss of digestive agents to sediments transiting deposit feeders. Standing stocks of sedimentary bacteria-ubiquitously {{on the order of}} 10 ° bacteria (cc pore water) - '-set a cap on digestive rates by bacterial inoculations of sediment, and provide metazoans a further kinetic advantage at food concentrations greater than the bacterial biomass. Metazoans therefore have digestive advantage on substrates amenable to concentrated, quick dissolution, suited to their role as high wattage consumers of sedimentary <b>food.</b> <b>Deposit</b> feeding shows strong analogy to laundry technology.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate adhesion of different fouling deposits with different contact surfaces using atomic force microscopy (AFM). In this thesis, AFM has been employed to measure: (i) The adhesive interactions between a colloidal silica microparticle and stainless steel, PTFE-coated stainless steel, glass and ceramic surfaces, {{in the presence of a}} number of solutions and suspensions of ingredients found in commercially available toothpaste. (ii) To compare the measurements from the AFM and micromanipulation to see the differences and similarities. The micromanipulation technique was developed to measure the adhesive strength of different deposits. The method uses a T-shaped probe made of stainless steel chip, dimension 30 x 6 x 1 mm connected to the output aperture of a transducer (Model BG- 1000, Kulite Semiconductor, Leonia, NJ. USA) which was itself mounted on a three dimensional micromanipulator (MicroInstruments, Oxon, UK). The two measurement methods are capable of giving quantitative results for the strength of the forces involved in adhesion; fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) deposits, toothpaste and confectionary stimulant deposits have been studied, and their interactions with stainless steel, glass and PTFE surfaces measured. (iii) Further investigation of AFM adhesion measurements, with caramel, whey protein and sweet condensed milk (SCM) deposits after heating at 30 ºC, 50 ºC, 70 ºC, and 90 ºC. The two selected spherical microparticles used were stainless steel and PTFE, which were attached to the end of an AFM tip. The data shows that, for removal in all cases using micromanipulation, the pulling energy increases with increasing height above the surface and the slope of the lines of pulling energy versus thickness is similar. Stainless steel shows the highest pulling energy with slightly higher energies than glass and PTFE, whilst PTFE show the lowest interaction. For the AFM data, PTFE again gives much lower adhesion forces. This is due to the different molecular interactions between different surfaces and caramel. There is thus partial agreement between the two methods. The micromanipulation method measures a range of parameters – such as the deformation and flow of the deposits, and so it might not be expected that there would be complete agreement. Here stainless steel and glass show very similar behaviour, as opposed to the differences seen using AFM; the different surface roughness of the two materials might also be expected to have an effect. At different temperatures the results from the different contact positions on the deposits; with an approach speed to the deposits for all experiments was 3 μm/s, then a 5 second pause on the deposit and then the rate of retract was 0. 25 μm/s. Significant (more than an order of magnitude) differences are seen between forces for the same and different deposits, and between different surfaces for the same deposits. Lower forces are seen at 90 ºC in all cases; at the higher temperature, the force between surface and deposit is less. To design systems to resist fouling, these results suggest that measurements at different process temperatures are needed; data at room temperature has overpredicted the interactions. The results suggest that the AFM force curve measurement technique could be used to study a variety of <b>food</b> <b>deposits</b> that have undergone different processing conditions. The method can help in optimising removal of <b>food</b> <b>deposits</b> in terms of food cleaning protocols.

However the mechanisms of prion spreading from the periphery to the nervous system are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of dendritic cells (DCs) in the spreading of prion infection to neuronal cells. First, we determined that bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) rapidly uptake PrPSc after exposure to infected brain homogenate. Next, we observed a progressive catabolism of the internalized prion aggregates. Similar experiments performed with BMDCs isolated from knock-out (KO) or mice over-expressing PrP (tga 20) indicate that both PrPSc uptake and catabolism are independent of PrPc expression in these cells. Finally, using co-cultures of prion-loaded BMDCs and cerebellar neurons, we characterized the transfer of the prion protein and the resulting infection of the neuronal cultures. Interestingly, the transfer of PrPSc was triggered by direct cell-to-cell contact. As a consequence, BMDCs kept the prion protein when cultured alone and no transfer to the recipient neurons was observed when a filter separated the two cultures or when neurons were exposed to the BMDCs conditioned media. Additionally, fixed BMDCs also failed to transfer prion infectivity to neurons suggesting an active transport of prion aggregates, in accordance with a role of tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs) observed in the co-cultures...|$|R
