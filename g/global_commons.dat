25|$|The key {{challenge}} of the <b>global</b> <b>commons</b> is the design of governance structures and management systems capable of addressing the complexity of multiple public and private interests, subject to often unpredictable changes, ranging from the local to the global level. As with global public goods, management of the <b>global</b> <b>commons</b> requires pluralistic legal entities, usually international and supranational, public and private, structured to match {{the diversity of interests}} and the type of resource to be managed, and stringent enough with adequate incentives to ensure compliance. Such management systems are necessary to avoid, at the global level, the classic tragedy of the commons, in which common resources become overexploited.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{when the}} {{atmosphere}} is understood as a <b>global</b> <b>commons,</b> it is seen to belong to everybody despite its physical presence at the national, local and regional levels. In this case, overarching rules are needed to prevent this resource from being overused (see “tragedy of the commons”). Other examples include the overfishing of the oceans or the exploitation of wildlife.|$|E
25|$|The work of MCC {{falls into}} two main areas: {{research}} and policy dialogue. The aim is to gain interdisciplinary insights {{and to provide a}} basis for decision-making in politics, industry and civil society. The theme spanning across all the work is the <b>global</b> <b>commons</b> (i.e., natural resources such as the atmosphere, land, oceans and forests) and the premise that international cooperation is indispensable for the sustainable use of the commons.|$|E

40|$|Eradicating {{poverty and}} {{addressing}} inequality {{are key to}} the <b>global</b> <b>common</b> good – the good of each and all persons (Populorum progressio). Each person’s inclusion in social, economic and political life is the ultimate criterion by which to assess how inclusive is the whole system: both micro (personal) responsibility {{for the good of}} one’s neighbour and macro system of rules and institutions are at stake. My reflections will develop three points: 1. Eradicating poverty: human dignity as an intrinsically relational notion; 2. Addressing inequality: power asymmetries and the universal the universal destination of material and non-material goods; 3. <b>Global</b> <b>common</b> good: the primary goal is realizing the good of living-together (the good of the all-of-us, Benedict XVI, CV 7).

2500|$|There {{are several}} key {{differences}} in {{management of resources}} in the <b>global</b> <b>commons</b> {{from those of the}} commons, in general. There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus the global level. [...] Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about resource usage to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools {{are less likely to be}} relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the <b>global</b> <b>commons</b> are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of unintended consequences that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the carbon dioxide emissions that drive climate change continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere and species extinctions last forever. [...] Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests at the global level, there are significant differences in externalities between more local resource uses and uses of global-level resources.|$|E
2500|$|Management {{of outer}} space <b>global</b> <b>commons</b> has been {{contentious}} since the successful {{launch of the}} Sputnik satellite by the former Soviet Union on 4 October 1957. [...] There is no clear boundary between Earth's atmosphere and space, although there are several standard boundary designations: one that deals with orbital velocity (the Kármán line), one {{that depends on the}} velocity of charged particles in space, and some that are determined by human factors such as the height at which human blood begins to boil without a pressurized environment (the Armstrong line).|$|E

It will also discuss concepts considered to be fundamental and their implementation in the modern world, where social inequalities tend to become ingrained due to the social anaesthesia of the most vulnerable groups of society owing to the assumption of a fatalism rooted in ‘producers of consent’.

2500|$|<b>Global</b> <b>commons</b> {{is a term}} {{typically}} used to describe international, supranational, and global resource domains in which common-pool resources are found. [...] In economics, common goods are rivalrous and non-excludable, constituting {{one of the four}} main types of goods. A common-pool resource, also called a common property resource, is a special case of a common good (or public good) whose size or characteristics makes it costly, but not impossible, to exclude potential users. [...] Examples include both natural or human-made resource domains (e.g., a [...] "fishing hole" [...] or an irrigation system). Unlike global public goods, global common-pool resources face problems of congestion, overuse, or degradation because they are subtractable (which makes them rivalrous).|$|E
2500|$|Several {{environmental}} protocols {{have been}} established (see List of international environmental agreements) {{as a type of}} international law, [...] "an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources." [...] International environmental protocols came to feature in environmental governance after trans-boundary environmental problems became widely perceived in the 1960s. [...] Following the Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated. Due to the barriers already discussed, environmental protocols are not a panacea for <b>global</b> <b>commons</b> issues. [...] Often, they are slow to produce the desired effects, tend to the lowest common denominator, and lack monitoring and enforcement. They also take an incremental approach to solutions where sustainable development principles suggest that environmental concerns should be mainstream political issues.|$|E
