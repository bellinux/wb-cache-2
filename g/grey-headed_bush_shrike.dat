50|$|The {{following}} birds {{can be in}} Virginia Bush: the natal robin, bluebilled firefinch, boubou <b>shrike,</b> <b>bush</b> <b>shrike,</b> flycatcher, green twinspot, grey waxbill, purple crested-lourie and the whitebrowed robin.|$|R
50|$|Bushshrikes {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} passerines, with short, rounded wings and strong legs and feet. Plumage is typically black, grey, and brown, with some yellow and green. Some <b>bush</b> <b>shrikes</b> have red undersides or red throat-patches.|$|R
50|$|A strikingly coloured, {{medium sized}} <b>bush</b> <b>shrike</b> {{which in the}} adults is mostly green with a bright red {{forehead}} and throat, a broad black breast band and a bright lemon-yellow belly, the tail is black. Young birds are pale green above with finely barred yellow-green underparts.|$|R
50|$|Bird species include louries, sunbirds, sugarbirds, blue cranes and swallows. Bald ibises nest in colony on cliffs near Malolotja Falls. A {{number of}} bird species are of {{conservation}} importance, because their habitat is limited and threatened outside the park. They are the orange ground-thrush, brown robin, bush blackcap, chorister robin-chat, white-starred robin, grey cuckoo-shrike, olive <b>bush</b> <b>shrike,</b> southern boubou, Narina trogon and Knysna lourie.|$|R
50|$|The thick-billed cuckoo is a {{specialised}} brood parasite of helmetshrikes, being {{known to}} almost exclusive parasitise three {{species in the}} red-billed and chestnut-fronted helmetshrike in its eastern range and the chestnut-bellied helmetshrike in West Africa. In {{the case of the}} well-studied red-billed helmetshrike, the thick-billed cuckoo has caused probably the most dramatic reduction in nesting success by any brood parasitic bird, with one group of helmetshrikes unable to rear any of their own nestlings for five years and ten breeding attempts, with overall between 35 and 55 percent of nests parasitised. It is almost certain that the extinct Malagasy subspecies parasitised vangas, which are related to the helmetshrikes. This speciesâ€™ parasitism of the helmetshrikes may complement the similarly sized black cuckoo which exclusively parasitises <b>bush</b> <b>shrikes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Blyde River Canyon {{supports}} {{large diversity}} of life, including numerous fish and antelope species {{as well as}} hippos and crocodiles, and every primate species that {{may be seen in}} South Africa (including both greater and lesser bushbabies, vervet monkeys and Samango monkeys). The diversity of birdlife is similarly high, including the beautiful and much sought Narina trogon as well as species such as the Cape vulture, black eagle, crowned eagle, African fish eagle, gymnogene, jackal buzzard, white-rumped vulture, bald ibis, African finfoot, Knysna lourie, purple-crested lourie, Gurney's sugarbird, malachite sunbird, cinnamon dove, African emerald cuckoo, red-backed mannikin, golden-tailed woodpecker, olive <b>bush</b> <b>shrike,</b> green twinspot, Taita falcons (very rarely sighted, a breeding pair lives in the nearby Abel Erasmus Pass), Cape eagle owl, white-faced owl, wood owl, peregrine falcon, black-breasted snake eagle, Wahlberg's eagle, long-crested eagle, lanner falcon, red-breasted sparrowhawk, rock kestrel and others.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} a causal relation between sex differences in behavior such as singing and sex differences {{in the size of}} brain areas such as the forebrain song control areas of songbirds. In the present study we show that the size of the forebrain vocal control areas nucleus hyperstriatalis ventrale pars caudale (HVC) and nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA) and its neuron numbers are about twice as large in males as in females of the African dueting <b>bush</b> <b>shrike</b> Laniarius funebris. However, song types are of similar complexity (number of elements per song type, physical properties of elements) in both sexes, and repertoire size does not differ between males and females. Furthermore, in captivity male and female shrikes are able to learn the same song types. This demonstrates for the shrike that sex differences in the size of vocal control areas and in its neuron numbers do not predict the type of sex-typica...|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{biology of}} Laniarius funebris at Baringo (Kenya) was studied in three {{consecutive}} seasons from 1980 - 82. Details are given of the habitat {{of the observed}} population, its territories and aggressive beha viour. Nests were built at an average height of 1, 5 m and 2 - 3 eggs were (aid. Incubation lasted 17 days and was usually shared by both parents. Development of one nestling was recorded in detail. Predation on eggs and young was very high; the behaviour of only one juvenile could be observed after leaving the nest. The {{second part of the}} paper reviews what is known of the other <b>bush</b> <b>shrikes</b> in the genera Laniarius, Malaco notus (including Telophorus) and Tchagra.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades ecology and {{behaviour}} have become of major importance in African ornithology. Not only have more individual species been studied in detail, but behaviour and ecology {{have been used in}} a more general sense in regional works (Benson et al 1971 } and in zoogeographical treatises (Moreau 1966, Hall and Moreau 1970). As part of a world- wide trend, behaviour and ecology have also become important in systematics and taxonomy eg. Hall's 1963 study of francolin, and Benson et al's 1971 erection of the <b>bush</b> <b>shrike</b> family Malaconotidae. This dissertation fits into this trend, beginning with a detailed study of the ecology and behaviour of three species of hornbill of the genus Tockus, and extending the observations in less detail to five other members of the genus. Combined with the literature, these observations allow an analysis of the systematics and evolution of the genus Tokus to be undertaken, as well as supplying descriptive information on Tokus biology.

60|$|The {{few days}} I stayed here {{produced}} me several new insects, but scarcely any birds. Butterflies and birds {{are in fact}} remarkably scarce in these forests. One may walk a whole day and not see {{more than two or}} three species of either. In everything but beetles, these eastern islands are very deficient compared with the western (Java, Borneo, &c.), and much more so if compared with the forests of South America, where twenty or thirty species of butterflies may be caught every day, and on very good days a hundred, a number we can hardly reach here in months of unremitting search. In birds there is the same difference. In most parts of tropical America we may always find some species of woodpecker tanager, <b>bush</b> <b>shrike,</b> chatterer, trogon, toucan, cuckoo, and tyrant-flycatcher; and a few days' active search will produce more variety than can be here met with in as many months. Yet, along with this poverty of individuals and of species, there are in almost every class and order, some one, or two species of such extreme beauty or singularity, as to vie with, or even surpass, anything that even South America can produce.|$|R
500|$|This {{species is}} seen in Egypt, Jordan and Israel much more often in spring than autumn, {{suggesting}} that the southern movement may be concentrated further east. Birds will hold small territories on about [...] on migration, and, unlike other shrikes, may congregate in significant numbers. More than 100 have been seen in one locality in Israel, with five in a single <b>bush.</b> This <b>shrike</b> has occurred as a vagrant in Algeria, Finland, Kenya, Libya, Spain, Sweden, Mauritania and Turkmenistan. At least three individuals have been documented in Great Britain, and two individuals in Armenia.|$|R
6000|$|The {{foregoing}} remarks {{apply to}} the Dendrocolap-tidae throughout the temperate countries of South America--the birds inhabiting extensive grassy plains and marshes, and districts with a scanty or scattered tree and bush vegetation. In the forest areas of the hotter regions it is different; there the birds form large gatherings or [...] "wandering bands," [...] composed of all the different species found in each district, associated with birds of other families--wood-peckers, tyrant-birds, <b>bush</b> <b>shrikes,</b> and many others. These miscellaneous gatherings are not of rare occurrence, but out of the breeding season are formed daily, the birds beginning to assemble at about nine or ten o'clock in the morning, their number increasing through the day until it reaches its maximum between two and four o'clock in the afternoon, after which it begins to diminish, each bird going off to its customary shelter or dwelling-place. Mr. Bates, who first described these wandering bands, says that he could always find the particular band belonging to a district any day he wished, for when he failed to meet with it {{in one part of}} the forest he would try other paths, until he eventually found it. The great Amazonian forests, he tells us, appear strangely silent and devoid of bird life, and it is possible to ramble about for whole days without seeing or hearing birds. But now and then the surrounding trees and bushes appear suddenly swarming with them. [...] "The bustling crowd loses no time, and, always moving in concert, each bird is occupied on its own account in searching bark, or leaf, or twig. In a few moments the host is gone, and the forest path remains deserted and silent as before." [...] Stolzmann, who observed them in Peru, says that the sound caused by the busy crowd searching through the foliage, and the falling of dead leaves and twigs, resembles that produced by a shower of rain. The Indians of the Amazons, Mr. Bates writes, have a curious belief to explain these bird armies; they say that the Papa-uira, supposed to be a small grey bird, fascinates all the others, and leads them on a weary perpetual dance through the forest. It seems very wonderful that birds, at other times solitary, should thus combine daily in large numbers, including in their bands scores of widely different species, and in size ranging from those no larger than a wren to others as big as a magpie. It is certainly very advantageous to them. As Belt remarks, they play into each other's hands; for while the larger creepers explore the trunks of big trees, others run over the branches and cling to the lesser twigs, so that every tree in their route, from its roots to the topmost foliage, is thoroughly examined, and every spider and caterpillar taken, while the winged insects, driven from their lurking-places, are seized where they settle, or caught flying by the tyrant birds.|$|R
40|$|Extract] Research Objectives This {{review of}} {{scientific}} literature was undertaken {{in order to}} identify known effects to wildlife caused by exposure to traffic noise. Such effects include: â€¢ Physiological impacts such as ear trauma and raised hormone levels; and â€¢ Behavioural responses such as elevated stress levels, acoustic adjustment and road avoidance. Due to paucity of data on animal species, the review also includes known noise effects on human subjects. Significant Findings â€¢ Most literature discussed animal avoidance responses to roads, and mostly in the temperate climes of the northern hemisphere. â€¢ Information lost from calls and noise attenuation is determined by the loudness of sound, frequency range, the receiverâ€™s ability to detect the sound and the attenuation characteristics of the habitat â€“ losses in forests are raised by five to ten decibels over areas with no obstruction. Animals adapt their calls to compensate for the type of habitat so that individuals can be recognised and distances estimated. â€¢ Researchers link traffic noise with reduced bird diversity and species abundance adjacent to roads to distances of up to 1, 750 metres from highways through forests and further through other habitats. Edge effects in the absence of noise may contribute to the reduced bird density. Frogs also exhibit reduced populations although it is unclear whether this is due to noise, pollution or mortality from traffic. Avoidance in coniferous forests has been measured and varies between forty and 1, 750 metres depending on species and traffic levels, with even greater distances observed in less dense habitats such as grasslands. â€¢ Traffic noise impedes movement by mammals through culverts under highways constructed in Canada for habitat connectivity and causes deer to flee in other areas. Noise also increases stress hormone levels in mammals. Some mammals also suffer raised stress hormone levels. â€¢ Studies on acoustic responses to noise by fauna (mostly birds) have been predominantly laboratory-based, finding traffic noise to impede the recognition of mating calls in five North American frog and toad species, and to induce raised amplitude levels in songs or calls of tree swallow nestlings, zebra finches, lovebirds, African <b>bush</b> <b>shrikes,</b> nightingales, canaries and budgerigars. â€¢ Field experiments have found some temperate birds overcome traffic noise blanketing by singing louder or by making adjustment to the pitch of their songs. This may impact their general fitness by requiring expenditure of greater amounts of energy. Birds singing songs with higher dominant frequencies appear, in some cases, to be less affected. â€¢ Anthropogenic noise in the range of 65 - 85 dB(A) has caused flight and alert responses in birds and behavioural changes. â€¢ Mating behaviour of North American frog species is altered by playback of traffic noise in the field. Similar responses might be expected in rainforest frogs. â€¢ High traffic noise levels induce a range of severe, often chronic clinical responses in humans, with limited tests on selected fauna indicating similar adverse reactions. â€¢ No studies have examined the effect of traffic noise on tropical rainforest fauna including those communicating by sound such as birds and frogs. Management Implications â€¢ Some species previously considered to comprise viable populations may now be at risk due to increasing traffic noise levels. â€¢ Noise levels previously considered to be safe may negatively affect some fauna. â€¢ Low-frequency sound and vibration from traffic sources may be impacting on some fauna. Recommendations â€¢ Studies should be undertaken on the effect of traffic noise on bird species living in tropical rainforests. â€¢ Existing and future roads (including upgrades) should be designed to minimise the extent of traffic noise propagation into surrounding landscapes. â€¢ Sections of highways generating high noise levels should avoid habitats occupied by rare or threatened fauna. Further Research â€¢ Wildlife populations in areas close to heavy traffic need to be assessed using indicators of highway avoidance, such as species richness and population density surveys combined with noise measurements within the habitat. â€¢ Species which appear to alter vocalisations in order to exist in high traffic noise environments need to be assessed for stress to energy budgets, and ability for individuals to recognise calls from other individuals. â€¢ The sphere of research into traffic noise effects should include more faunal groups including invertebrates and frogs. â€¢ This research should include noise effects from the frequency spectrum edges including infrasound...|$|R
