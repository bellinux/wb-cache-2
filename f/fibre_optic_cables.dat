2500|$|After being awarded her bachelor's {{degree in}} Mathematics in 1984, Hau {{continued}} {{to study at}} the University of Aarhus for her master's degree in Physics which was awarded two years later. For her doctoral studies in quantum theory Hau worked on ideas similar to those involved in <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cables</b> carrying light, but her work involved strings of atoms in a silicon crystal carrying electrons. While working towards her doctorate Hau spent seven months at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva. She received her doctorate from the University of Aarhus in Denmark in 1991, but by this time her research interests had changed direction. In 1991 she joined the Rowland Institute for Science at Cambridge, Massachusetts as a scientific staff member, beginning to explore the possibilities of slow light and cold atoms. In 1999, Hau accepted a two-year appointment as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University. Her formalized training is in theoretical physics but her interest moved to experimental research {{in an effort to}} create a new form of matter known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. [...] "Hau applied to the National Science Foundation for funds to make a batch of this condensate but was rejected on the grounds that she was a theorist for whom such experiments would be too difficult to do." [...] Undeterred, she gained alternative funding, and {{became one of the first}} handful of physicists to create such a condensate. In September 1999 she was appointed the Gordon Mckay Professor of Applied Physics and Professor of Physics at Harvard. She was also awarded tenure in 1999, and is now Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at Harvard. In 2001 she became the first person to stop light completely, using a Bose–Einstein condensate to achieve this. Since then she has produced copious research, and new experimental work, in electromagnetically induced transparency, various areas of quantum physics, photonics and contributed to the development of new quantum devices and novel nanoscale applications.|$|E

50|$|Optical {{attached}} cable (OPAC) {{is a type}} of <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cable</b> that {{is installed}} by being attached to a host conductor along overhead power lines. The attachment system varies and can include wrapping, lashing or clipping the <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cable</b> to the host. Installation is typically performed using a specialised piece of equipment that travels along the host conductor from pole to pole or tower to tower, wrapping, clipping or lashing the <b>fibre</b> <b>optic</b> <b>cable</b> in place. Different manufacturers have different systems and the installation equipment, cable designs and hardware are not interchangeable.Although lashed cable systems and clipped cable systems have been investigated as a means of attaching optical fibre cables to overhead power lines, wrapped cables were the first type to be developed and are the only type in common use today.|$|R
