2500|$|The {{species of}} oak {{typically}} used for American oak production is the Quercus alba {{which is a}} white oak species that is characterized by its relatively fast growth, wider grains and lower wood tannins. It is found {{in most of the}} Eastern United States as well as Missouri, Minnesota and Wisconsin where many wine barrels are from. In Oregon the Quercus garryana white oak has started to gain usage due to its closer similarities to <b>European</b> <b>oak.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{vegetation}} of Pirin is vertically {{divided into}} five distinct elevation zones: Mediterranean, deciduous, coniferous, that combined form {{the tree line}} reaching approximately altitude of 2,000m, shrubs forming the subalpine line up to 2,500m and alpine meadows, {{also known as the}} alpine line above 2,500m. The Mediterranean zone is dominated, among other, by pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens) and Oriental Hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis), the deciduous zone by <b>European</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus robur) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and the coniferous— by Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce), Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The subalpine line is mainly covered with dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo) and common juniper (Juniperus communis). The alpine line is covered with grass, moss, lichen and abundant in bilberries and rare flowers such as the edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum). Pirin is home to Bulgaria's oldest tree, the 1300–year Baikushev's pine— a Bosnian pine that is a contemporary of the foundation of the Bulgarian state in 681 AD.|$|E
2500|$|In 1679 Simon van der Stel was {{appointed}} to succeed van Riebeeck as governor of the Cape Colony. Against Dutch East India Company regulations he orchestrated a deal for a land grant near Table Mountain for a [...] estate – a grant 15 {{times larger than the}} Company's normal provision. He named this estate Constantia. Legend has it he named the estate after his wife, although her name was actually Johanna. Other theories are that the name derives from one of the Dutch East India Company ships or possibly in honor of the virtues of [...] and faithfulness. Van der Stel took a keen interest in the wine production of the Cape and recruited more French winemakers to the colony. Around his estate and vineyards he planted rows of <b>European</b> <b>oak</b> trees that would shield the vines from the strong gale-force winds of the Cape Doctor. Records show that van der Stel imported many grape varieties to his estate, among them Spanish Sherry grape Palomino (known locally as [...] "White French"), Chenin blanc (Known as [...] "Steen") and Semillon (known as [...] "Green Grape"). He also had a variety of Muscat grapes planted, including the Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains (which ranged in color from white to brown), Muscat of Alexandria and a red Muscat variety that was most likely Muscat Hamburg.|$|E

50|$|English oak {{is one of}} {{the most}} common park trees in {{south-eastern}} Australia, noted for its vigorous, luxuriant growth. In Australia, it grows very quickly to a tree of 20 m tall by up to 20 m broad, with a low-branching canopy. Its trunk and secondary branches are very thick and solid and covered with deep-fissured blackish-grey bark.The largest example in Australia is in Donnybrook, Western Australia. Native Australian oaks are quite unrelated to the <b>European</b> <b>oaks.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Though {{dozens of}} species of trees are found, forests, which make [...] % of the reservation, are mainly made of narrow-leafed ash {{and to the}} lesser extent of white poplar, willow or black alder.

5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown that a large event interfering with normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of <b>European</b> <b>oaks</b> in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine frost rings also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating. Procedural changes in how ice cores are interpreted would bring that data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers.|$|R

50|$|In Europe, Ramorum blight {{was first}} {{observed}} on rhododendron and viburnum {{in the early}} 1990s, where it was initially found mainly on container-grown plants in nurseries. The principal symptoms were leaf and twig blight. By 2007, it had spread throughout nurseries and retail centers in 16 European countries, and had been detected in gardens, parks, and woodlands in at least eight countries. It has not caused significant harm to <b>European</b> <b>oak</b> species.|$|E
30|$|The {{values in}} Table  5 {{indicate}} Norway spruce as most prone to drought stress, followed by <b>European</b> beech, <b>oak</b> and Douglas-fir and Scots pine as most resistant.

40|$|Glacial refugia and postglacial {{migration}} {{are major}} factors {{responsible for the}} present patterns of genetic variation we see in natural populations. Traditionally postglacial history has been inferred from fossil data, but new molecular techniques permit historical information to be gleaned from present populations. The chloroplast tRNALeu 1 intron contains regions which have been highly conserved over a billion years of chloroplast evolution. Surprisingly, {{in one of these}} regions which has remained invariant for all photosynthetic organisms so far studied, we have found intraspecific site polymorphism. This polymorphism occurs in two <b>European</b> <b>oaks,</b> Quercus robur and Q. petraea, indicating hybridisation and introgression between them. Two distinct chloroplast types occur and are distributed geographically as eastern and western forms suggesting that these oaks are each derived from at least two separate glacial refugia...|$|R
50|$|The tree is {{employed}} for ornamental and utilitary roadside planting and windbreaks. Its timber, which is rather dense (relative density = 0.76) {{and difficult to}} work, is used for doors and floors, for furniture, for paving blocks, shoe lasts and wine casks (where it replaces the <b>European</b> <b>oak).</b> The wood responds well to drying and is therefore valuable for work that requires stable dimensions regardless of humidity. It is also durable for outdoor use.|$|E

50|$|The design {{they came}} up with was just a single storey, and circled a mature oak tree which had stood on the site for years. Constructed from natural stone, clad with <b>European</b> <b>Oak</b> and topped with a sedum green roof, the aim was to create an {{ecosystem}} around the one central oak. The aim for the building was to create a high quality modern building, without compromising the surrounding countryside. To ensure this the materials used were sustainable sourced and the building was designed with this in mind.|$|E

50|$|Grandinin is an ellagitannin. It can {{be found}} in Melaleuca quinquenervia leaves and in oaks species like the North American white oak (Quercus alba) and <b>European</b> red <b>oak</b> (Quercus robur).

40|$|International audienceA {{total of}} 51 ancient oak wood samples {{originating}} from various European archaeological sites, {{dating from the}} Neolithic period to the 18 th century, were assayed {{for the presence of}} reproducible chloroplast (cp) DNA sequences. Five polymorphic chloroplast fragments were targeted. Only five of the samples could be fully genetically characterised, revealing four different oak cpDNA haplotypes. In all cases, the haplotypes detected on ancient woods and the haplotypes characterised from fresh samples from the same localities matched. Overall, this congruence is consistent with a genetic continuity between ancient and modern <b>European</b> <b>oaks,</b> confirming the hypothesis that the mapped genetic patterns largely reflect the original structure that established during the post-glacial. This stability of the genetic structure implies that, in the future, the technique could be used to infer or confirm the transport of wood by man, providing interesting perspectives for the genetic analysis of ancient woods...|$|R
