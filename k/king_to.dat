5|$|After the Norman Conquest of 1066, {{the manor}} of Clevedon was {{granted by the}} <b>King</b> <b>to</b> Matthew de Mortagne, who in turn granted it to his sub-tenant, Hildebert.

Perhaps because of {{the distance to the}} parish church, the manor house included a chapel dedicated, in the 1320s, to Saint Peter. The house has undergone considerable change since it was built, almost every century seeing structural alterations, but it still retains many features of a mediaeval manor house.|$|E
