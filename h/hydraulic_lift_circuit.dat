A manipulative field experiment was conducted in a semiarid shrub stand to determine if circumvention of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift,</b> by nighttime illumination of the shrub canopy, would result in greater soil nutrient heterogeneity than if the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> process was allowed to operate. Nutrient-enriched patches were superimposed on the existing soil heterogeneity and after 40 days, the patches and interspaces were sampled for ions of different mobility and for root mass. There was no indication under these conditions that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> was contributing to smoothing spatial nutrient heterogeneity...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> was {{studied in}} live and dead Quercus agrifolia (Coastal Live Oak) {{in order to}} test its impact on {{surrounding}} Venegasia carpesioides (Canyon Sunflower). <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> causes soil moisture to rise around the base of deep-rooted plants where neighboring plants can utilize this excess water. We predicted that the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> of the Coastal Live Oak would increase soil moisture, causing higher stomatal conductance and higher water potential in nearby plants. Pvalues of. 5258 and. 6392 indicated {{there were no significant differences}} in soil moisture or in stomatal conductance of the Canyon Sunflowers. A p-value of. 0378 showed a significant difference between the water potentials of the Canyon Sunflowers found around the live trees and dead trees.

40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> was {{investigated}} among native {{plants in the}} Mojave Desert using in situ thermocouple psychrometers. Night lighting and day shading experiments were used to verify the phenomenon. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> was detected for all species examined: five shrub species with different rooting depths and leaf phenologies and one perennial grass species. This study {{was the first to}} document <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> for a CAM species, Yucca schidigera. The pattern of diel flux in soil water potential for the CAM species was temporally opposite to that of C 3 species: for the CAM plant, soil water potential increased in shallow soils during the day when the plant was not transpiring and decreased at night when transpiration began. Because CAM plants transport water to shallow soils during the day when surrounding C 3 and C 4 plants transpire, CAM species that hydraulically lift water may influence water relations of surrounding species {{to a greater extent than}} hydraulically lifting C 3 or C 4 species. A strong, negative relationship between the percent sand in the study site soils at the 0. 35 m soil depth and the frequency that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> was observed at that depth suggests that the occurrence of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> is negatively influenced by coarse-textured soils, perhaps due to less rootâ€“soil contact in sandy soils relative to finer-textured soils. Differences in soil texture among study sites may explain, in part, differences in the frequency that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> was detected among these species. Further investigations are needed to elucidate species versus soil texture effects on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> is {{a passive}} {{process in which}} a plant will bring water from subsoil to topsoil levels through its roots. In this experiment, we {{compared}} the soil moisture levels in the area surrounding two different chaparral species C. megacarpus, a shallow rooted nonsprouter, and M. laurina, a deep-rooted obligate sprouter, {{in order to determine}} the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> patterns of chaparral as they regrow after fire. Furthermore, the C. Megacarpus had died due to the Malibu fire, while the M. Laurina was resprouting. Therefore, using a Hydrosense Soil Water Measurement System, we measured soil moisture percentages, and the results showed there was no significant difference in soil moisture levels between C. megacarpus and M. laurina despite obtaining a p-value of. 0721. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the two plants and their controls implying that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> was not taking place.

40|$|Abstract. The role of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> in {{nutrient}} uptake from dry topsoil is unclear. Vertically-split root {{systems were}} used to measure <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> and phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) uptake at the rosette and flowering stages of two canola (Brassica napus L.) cultivars (Trigold and Boomer with small and large root systems, respectively) grown in soil low in P and K. Rubidium (Rb) {{was used as a}} tracer to examine K uptake from K fertiliser banded in dry topsoil. During vegetative growth, statistically significant <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> was measured, irrespective of cultivar root size or a specific nutrient (P or K) placed in the topsoil. The Rb tracer revealed significant amounts of K were absorbed from the dry soil, but at rates five-fold lower than from the moist soil. The water lifted could not prevent cessation of P uptake by Boomer and a reduction in P uptake by Trigold. During mid to late flowering, ion uptake from the dry topsoil was impeded despite the continuation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> up to 28 days after the topsoil was dried. Minimal fine root growth following topsoil drying (and reduction in fine root biomass in some treatments) appeared to be the primary cause of impeded nutrient uptake...|$|R
40|$|Under large East African Acacia trees, {{which were}} known to show <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift,</b> we {{experimentally}} tested whether tree roots facilitate grass production or compete with grasses for below-ground resources. Prevention of tree-grass interactions through root trenching led to increased soil water content indicating that trees took up more water from the topsoil than they exuded via <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift.</b> Biomass was higher in trenched plots compared to controls probably because of reduced competition for water. Stable isotope analyses of plant and source water showed that grasses which competed with trees used {{a greater proportion of}} deep water compared with grasses in trenched plots. Grasses therefore used hydraulically lifted water provided by trees, or took up deep soil water directly by growing deeper roots when competition with trees occurred. We conclude that any facilitative effect of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> for neighbouring species may easily be overwhelmed by water competition in (semi-) arid regions...|$|R

The recent trends in industry are towards adopting the hydraulic techniques, because it save time generates accuracy and it is having some flexibility. Hydraulic Fixture is major application {{in the field of}} designing, where in several softwareâ€™s are available for the purpose of design. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> housing is engine part of an agricultural tractor which {{plays an important role in}} application of lifting trolley of tractor and machining of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>lift</b> housing is a important task.
