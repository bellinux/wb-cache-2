40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new evidence}} on the long-run relationship between economic growth and labor’s share in national income, based on a comprehensive panel data set for 123 countries from 1950 to 2004. Xie’s primary finding is that labor’s share follows a cubic relationship with real GDP per capita over the long process of development. At {{the beginning of the}} modern economic growth process, the share of labor in national income first decreases until an initial threshold is reached. After that, labor’s share keeps increasing until the country’s GDP per capita reaches a second threshold before falling again. Xie argues that these dynamics apply not only to the less developed countries in the postwar years, but also to the advanced countries like the United States and the United Kingdom during their early <b>economic</b> <b>take-offs,</b> starting in the late 18 th and 19 th century, respectively.

A rich and prolifi c literature featured some of the most infl uential and well-known contributions in the history of economics.

On the third stage, we carry out an analysis of power take-off system with step up DC-DC converter working. Results. In this paper, we carry out the analysis of working efficiency for photovoltaic facility power take-off system with step-up boost converter. The result of such analysis show that the efficiency of such system {{in a wide range of}} photovoltaic energy module illumination power is at 0. 92, whereas the efficiency of classic power take-off systems does not exceed 0. 70.

30|$|However, it is {{noteworthy}} that Singapore’s profitability has also recently been downgraded. Thus third quarter 2016 profitability of Singapore’s big three banks declined in asset quality because of their exposures to loans and investment in the oil and gas service companies. This goes against Rodrik’s (1995) revisionist but plausible explanation for the <b>economic</b> <b>take-off</b> of Singapore and Taiwan, which was the sharp increase in investment demand {{that took place in the}} early 1960 s. The reason for this investment boom – unlike the accounts of such agencies as the IMF and World Bank that stress export orientation - is the efforts of the respective governments massively to enhance government co-ordination and fashioning of innovative measures to promote profitability. Profitability from export growth at the time was modest by comparison. A much more plausible explanation for the <b>economic</b> <b>take-off</b> is thus the sharp increase in investment demand that took place in the early 1960 s.
