As the addition of Mg-Al-C <b>grain</b> <b>refiner</b> reaches 1. 2 %(wt), {{which is the most}} proper in ratio, the average grain size of the alloy is reduced from the maximum 162 μm with no addition of <b>grain</b> <b>refiner</b> to the minimum 57 μm, and the alloy can offer the best comprehensive mechanical properties. At the same strain amplitudes, the low cycle fatigue life of the magnesium alloy is proportional to the <b>grain</b> degree <b>refined.</b> When total strain amplitude, Δɛt/ 2 is 0. 2 %, the fatigue life of AZ 91 D + 1. 2 %Mg-Al-C alloy can reach 13615 cycles, compared with 7694 cycles of AZ 91 D with no refiner added; when Δɛt/ 2 reaches to 1. 2 %, the fatigue life of AZ 91 D alloy is improved from 21 cycles up to 113 cycles after adding 1. 2 %(wt) Mg-Al-C.

In this study, intensive melt shearing was achieved in a twin-screw mechanism to investigate its <b>grain</b> <b>refining</b> effect on AZ 91 D magnesium alloy. The refinement mechanism was discussed and the persistence of grain refinement after remelting and isothermal holding was also studied. A Zeiss imaging system with polarized light was used for quantitative measurement of grain size.

With the application of intensive melt shearing, the grain size of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy can be reduced from 530 μm (for a typical as-cast microstructure) to 170 μm, which is about 70 % size reduction. The grain refinement achieved by the intensive melt shearing can be partially kept after isothermal holding and remelting. It is believed that the refinement effect was mainly due to the finer and well dispersed oxide particles formed by high intensive shearing. The smaller size of oxide particles and their slow motion velocity in the sheared melt could make important contributions to the remained grain refinement...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to study the {{separate}} effects of <b>grain</b> <b>refiner</b> and modifier on the metallurgical properties of LM 6 sand castings. The research aims to determine how <b>grain</b> <b>refiner</b> and modifier will influence the microstructure of LM 6 sand casting and the associated mechanical properties of hardness, ultimate tensile strength and engineering strain. Design/methodology/approach: A <b>grain</b> <b>refiner</b> consists of 0. 5 wt% Al- 5 Ti- 1 B and a modifier consists of 0. 5 wt% Al- 10 Sr have been introduced separately into the melt of hypoeutectic LM 6 Al-Si alloy to produce slab castings by CO 2 sand casting process. The geometry of the slab casting is designed to have different section moduli to induce directional solidification. Temperature profile of cooling process is taken to correlate between the section modulus and cooling rate. This enables the effect of cooling rate on microstructure and mechanical properties to be studied for <b>grain</b> <b>refined</b> and modified LM 6 sand castings. Findings: The significant finding is that a nearly full eutectic solidification at 540 °C is achieved in the Sr-modified casting with faster cooling rates than those of solely grain-refined and original LM 6. The hardness and ultimate tensile strength can be improved respectively between 20 ~ 40 % and 11 ~ 18 % by Al- 10 Sr modifier. It is observed that the Al- 5 Ti- 1 B <b>grain</b> <b>refiner</b> and Al- 10 Sr modifier increase the strain at UTS by 11 % and 22 % respectively. The metallographic observations show that the eutectic phase is finer and in fibrous form in the Sr-modified LM 6. Research limitations/implications: Further research can study a wider range of inoculant percentage. Practical implications: This eutectic solidification at 540 °C achieved in Sr-modified LM 6 is lower than the solidus temperature of LM 6 to reduce superheat and save electrical energy consumption while ensuring complete liquid mould filling.
