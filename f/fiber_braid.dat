40|$|Our lab has {{developed}} a way to measure the contraction of Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs) using the reinforcing fibers themselves as sensing elements. We achieve this by using electrically-conductive wire to form the <b>fiber</b> <b>braid.</b> The inductance of this “Smart Braid” increases as the actuator contracts. We are interested in using these sensors for the feedback control of fluid systems that rely on PAM actuators. Toward that end, we have begun to explore highly portable inductance measurement techniques. Here, we demonstrate the force-compensated tracking of a rotary joint angle at 1 kHz. This {{is an important step}} towards the utilization of these sensors in feedback control systems...|$|E
40|$|In the {{chemical}} vapor infiltration (CVI) process for fabricating ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), transport of gas phase reactant into the fiber preform {{is a critical}} step. The transport can be driven by pressure or by concentration. This report describes methods for measuring this for CVI preforms and partially infiltrated composites. Results are presented for Nicalon fiber cloth layup preforms and composites, Nextel <b>fiber</b> <b>braid</b> preforms and composites, and a Nicalon fiber 3 -D weave composite.

Failure modes were identified for aluminum plates and for composites plates and half-rings made from triaxial carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>braid</b> having a 0 /+/- 60 deg architecture. For aluminum plates, a large hole formed {{as a result of}} crack propagation from the initiation site {{at the center of the}} plate. For composite plates, fiber tensile failure occurred in the back ply at the center of the plate. Cracks then propagated from this site along the +/- 60 deg fiber directions until triangular flaps opened to form a hole. For composite half-rings fabricated with 0 deg fibers aligned circumferentially, fiber tensile failure also occurred in the back ply. Cracks first propagated from this site perpendicular the 0 deg fibers. The cracks then turned to follow the +/- 60 deg fibers and 0 deg fibers until rectangular flaps opened to form a hole. Damage in the composites was localized near the impact site, while cracks in the aluminum extended to the boundaries...|$|E

40|$|Background and aims. The {{mechanical}} properties of fiber-reinforced composite fixed partial dentures (FPDs) {{are affected by}} fiber impregnation. The aim of this in vitro study was to compare the fracture resistance of composite fixed partial dentures reinforced with pre-impregnated and non-impregnated fibers. Materials and methods. Groups (n= 5) of three-unit fiber-reinforced composite FPDs (23 mm in length) from maxillary second premolar to maxillary second molar were fabricated on two abutments with pontic width of 12 mm. One group was fabricated as the control group with composite (Gradia) {{and the other two}} groups were fabricated with composite (Gradia) reinforced with pre-impregnated fiber (Fibrex ribbon) and non-impregnated fiber (<b>Fiber</b> <b>braid),</b> respectively. The specimens were stored in distilled water for one week at 37 °C and then tested in a universal testing machine by means of a three-point bending test. Statistical analysis consisted of one-way ANOVA and a post hoc Scheffé’s test for the test groups (α= 0. 05). Results. Fracture resistance (N) differed significantly between the control group and the other two groups (P< 0. 001), but there were no statistically significant differences between the pre-impregnated and non-impregnated groups (P= 0. 565). The degree of deflection measured (mm) did not differ significantly between the three groups (P= 0. 397), yet the mean deflection measured in pre-impregnated group was twice as that in the other two groups. Conclusion. Reinforcement of composite with fiber might considerably increase the fracture resistance of FPDs; however, the type of the fiber used resulted in no significant difference in fracture resistance of FPD specimens...|$|E

40|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most commonly injured intra-articular ligament of the knee. The insufficient vascularization of this tissue prevents it from healing completely after extreme tearing or rupture, creating a need for ACL grafts for reconstruction. The limitations of existing grafts have motivated the investigation of tissue engineered ACL grafts. A successful tissue engineered graft must possess mechanical properties similar to the ACL; to date no commercially available synthetic graft has achieved this. To accomplish this goal we have combined the techniques of polymer <b>fiber</b> <b>braiding</b> and twisting to design a novel poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) braid-twist scaffold for ACL tissue engineering. The scaffold is designed to accurately mimic the biomechanical profile and mechanical properties of the ACL. In this study, braid-twist scaffolds were constructed and compared to braided scaffolds and twisted fiber scaffolds. The addition of fiber twisting to the braided scaffold resulted in {{a significant increase in}} the ultimate tensile strength, an increase in ultimate strain, and an increase in the length of the toe region in these constructs over scaffolds that were braided. Based on the findings of this study, the braid-twist scaffold studied was found to be a promising construct for tissue engineering of the {{anterior cruciate}} ligament...|$|R

Comparing the two methods in terms of the torque forces and strain angles, the shafts producing entirely carbon fiber show the highest torque capacities; however, considering the cost and performance criteria, the hybrid shaft made up of carbon and glass fibers is the optimum solution for average demanded properties.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} program were to reduce the manufacturing costs of variable stator vane bushings by 1) eliminating the expensive carbon <b>fiber</b> <b>braiding</b> operation, 2) replacing the batch mode impregnation, B-stage, and cutting operations with a continuous process, and 3) reducing the molding cycle and machining operations with injection molding to achieve near-net shapes. Braided bushings were successfully fabricated with both AMB- 17 XLD and AMB-TPD resin systems. The composite bushings achieved high glass transition temperature after post-cure (+ 300 C) and comparable weight loss to the PNM- 15 bushings. ANM- 17 XLD bushings made with "batch-mode" molding compound (at 0. 5 in. fiber length) achieved a + 300 lb-force flange break strength which was superior to the continuous braided-fiber reinforced bushing. The non-MDA resin technology developed in this contract appears attractive for bushing applications that do not exceed a 300 C use temperature. Two thermoplastic polyimide resins were synthesized in order to generate injection molding compound powders. Excellent processing results were obtained at injection temperatures in excess of 300 C. Micro-tensile specimens were produced from each resin type and the Tg measurements (by TMA) for these samples were equivalent to AURUM(R).
