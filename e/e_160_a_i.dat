40|$|The {{nef gene}} {{contributes}} to the replication of primate lentiviruses by altering the trafficking of cellular proteins involved in adaptive immunity (class I and II major histocompatibility complex [MHC]) and viral transmission (CD 4 and DC-SIGN). A conserved acidic leucine-based sequence (<b>E</b> <b>160</b> xxxLL) within human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Nef binds to the cellular adaptor protein (AP) complexes, which mediate protein sorting into endosomal vesicles. The leucine residues in this motif are required for the down-regulation of CD 4 and for the up-regulation of DC-SIGN and the invariant chain of MHC class II, but {{the role of the}} acidic residue is unclear. Here, substitution of <b>E</b> <b>160</b> with uncharged residues impaired the ability of Nef to up-regulate the expression of the invariant chain and DC-SIGN at the cell surface, whereas substitution with a basic residue was required for a similar effect on the down-regulation of CD 4. All substitutions of <b>E</b> <b>160</b> relieved the Nef-mediated block to transferrin uptake. <b>E</b> <b>160</b> was required for the efficient interaction of Nef with AP- 1 and AP- 3 and for the stabilization of these complexes on endosomal membranes in living cells. Systematic mutation of the ExxxLL sequence together with correlation of binding and functional data leads to the hypotheses that AP- 1 and AP- 3 are major cofactors for the effect of Nef on the trafficking of transferrin, are less important but contribute to the modulation of the invariant chain and DC-SIGN, and are least critical for the modulation of CD 4. The data suggest that the <b>E</b> <b>160</b> residue plays <b>a</b> differential role in the modulation of leucine-dependent Nef-targets and support a model in which distinct AP complexes are used by Nef to modulate different cellular proteins...|$|R
40|$|Degradation of the {{insecticide}} chlorpynfos (<b>160</b> <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> mg kg- 1) using a biomix of a biobed system biostimulated with inorganic fertilizer (NPK) was investigated. Three {{concentrations of}} the fertilizer (0. 1 %, 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % ww- 1) were evaluated on chlorpynfos degradation, TCP (3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyrinidol) accumulation and biological {{activity of the}} biomix. The chlorpynfos was dissipated efficiently (> 75 %) after 40 days of incubation and no additional dissipation was obtained with increasing concentration of NPK after 20 days of incubation. TCP accumulation occuned in all evaluated NPK concentrations and its concentration increased with the increment of NPK addition raising the probability of leaching of this compound. Biological activity (FDA and ligninolytic enzyme activity) in the biomix increased by the NPK presence in all evaluated concentrations. The DGGE analyses showed that combined treatments with lower amounts of NPK (0 % and 0. 1 %) and chlorpynfos showed no significant modifications in the microbial community in the biomix. However, combined overdoses of NPK (0. 5 and 1. 0 %) and chlorpynfos caused significant modifications in the bacterial communities that could be associated with TCP degradation reduction in the biomix. In conclusion, the obtained results demonstrated that the biomix prepared with Andisol and biostimulated with NPK nutrient can be recommended in biobeds as a viable alternative of chlorpyrifos dissipation avoiding soil and water contamination probability...|$|R

Several substitutions resulted in no major change in MICs. E 167 A and F 171 A resulted in derivatives that lost the ability to confer resistance to KAN and AMK. P 155 A, P 157 A, N 159 <b>A,</b> L <b>160</b> <b>A,</b> <b>I</b> 163 <b>A,</b> K 168 A, and G 170 A conferred intermediate levels of resistance. Y 166 A resulted in an enzyme derivative with a modified specificity; it conferred a high level of resistance to KAN but lost the ability to confer resistance to AMK. Although not as pronounced, the resistance profiles conferred by substitutions N 159 A and G 170 A were related to that conferred by Y 166 A. These phenotypes, taken together with previous results indicating that mutant F 171 L could not catalyze acetylation of AMK when the assays were carried out at 42 °C (D. Panaite and M. Tolmasky, Plasmid 39 : 123 – 133, 1998), suggest that some motif B amino acids play a direct or indirect role in acceptor substrate specificity. MICs of AMK and KAN for cells harboring the substitution C 165 A were high, suggesting that the active form of the enzyme may not be a dimer formed through a disulfide bond. Furthermore, this result indicated that the acetylation reaction occurs through a direct mechanism rather than a ping-pong mechanism that includes a transient transfer of the acetyl group to a cysteine residue.

40|$|AbstractAbnormalities of cardiomyocyte Ca 2 + {{homeostasis}} and excitation–contraction (E–C) coupling are early {{events in}} the pathogenesis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and concomitant determinants of the diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias typical of the disease. T-tubule remodelling {{has been reported to}} occur in HCM but little is known about its role in the E–C coupling alterations of HCM. Here, the role of T-tubule remodelling in the electro-mechanical dysfunction associated to HCM is investigated in the Δ <b>160</b> <b>E</b> cTnT mouse model that expresses a clinically-relevant HCM mutation. Contractile function of intact ventricular trabeculae is assessed in Δ <b>160</b> <b>E</b> mice and wild-type siblings. As compared with wild-type, Δ <b>160</b> <b>E</b> trabeculae show prolonged kinetics of force development and relaxation, blunted force-frequency response with reduced active tension at high stimulation frequency, and increased occurrence of spontaneous contractions. Consistently, prolonged Ca 2 + transient in terms of rise and duration are also observed in Δ <b>160</b> <b>E</b> trabeculae and isolated cardiomyocytes. Confocal imaging in cells isolated from Δ <b>160</b> <b>E</b> mice reveals significant, though modest, remodelling of T-tubular architecture.

The model is improved slightly if the time trend in sea surface temperature (SST) near the east-ern edge of the western Pacic warm pool is included in the linear combination. Physically this trend is related to zonal equatorial ocean flow which advects the warm pool.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{observation in}} sporadic cancers {{is that not}} all individuals are equally prone to developing cancer following exposure to a given environmental carcinogen. Epidemiological {{studies have suggested that}} the difference in the timing of cancer onset in response to exogenous DNA damage is likely attributable to genetic variations, such as those associated with base excision repair genes. To test this long-standing hypothesis and elucidate how a genetic variation in the base excision repair gene flap endonuclease 1 (FEN 1) results in susceptibility to environment insults and causes cancer, we established a mutant mouse model carrying <b>a</b> point mutation (<b>E</b> <b>160</b> D) in Fen 1. We demonstrate that the <b>E</b> <b>160</b> D mutation impairs the ability of FEN 1 to process DNA intermediate structures in long-patch base excision repair using nuclear extracts or reconstituted purified base excision repair proteins. <b>E</b> <b>160</b> D cells were more sensitive to the base damaging agents methylnitrosourea and hydrogen peroxide, leading to DNA strand breaks, chromosomal breakage, and chromosome instabilities in response these DNA insults. We further show that <b>E</b> <b>160</b> D mice are significantly more susceptible to exposure to methylnitrosourea and develop lung adenocarcinoma. Thus, our current study demonstrates that a subtle genetic variation (<b>E</b> <b>160</b> D) in base excision repair genes (FEN 1) may cause a functional deficiency in repairing base damage, such that individuals carrying the mutation or similar mutations are predisposed to chemical-induced cancer development...|$|R
40|$|The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI 3 K) pathway is {{the most}} {{frequently}} activated pathway across multiple tumor lineages {{and this is a}} potential therapeutic target. As a critical step to accelerate therapeutic development in endometrial cancer, we performed a comprehensive analysis of mutation and function of PI 3 K pathway members in a set of 243 highly characterized endometrial tumors. Whole gene resequencing revealed the highest frequencies of mutation in the PI 3 K pathway of any tumor lineage including PTEN (44 %), PIK 3 CA (40 %; encoding the p 110 α catalytic subunit of PI 3 K) and PIK 3 R 1 (20 %; encoding the p 85 a regulatory subunit). Indeed, when complete protein loss is considered, almost 80 % of endometrioid endometrial cancers demonstrate an aberration in the PI 3 K pathway. Remarkably, mutations in the PI 3 K pathway were not mutually exclusive and indeed co-existence of PIK 3 CA or PIK 3 R 1 mutation with heterozygous PTEN mutation occurred at frequencies higher than predicted by the frequency of each lesion alone. High-throughput reverse-phase protein array suggested that the dominant signaling effects occurred with PTEN protein loss and that PIK 3 CA or PIK 3 R 1 mutation functionally mimic PTEN protein loss as indicated by protein markers including phosphorylated Akt and stathmin. Thus it appears likely that co-mutations in the PI 3 K pathway are selected to compensate haploinsufficiency of PTEN due to PTEN heterozygous mutation. To determine the functional consequences of mutations in PIK 3 R 1, we demonstrated that several somatic PIK 3 R 1 mutations tested conferred cytokine-independent growth on interleukin- 3 -dependent Ba/F 3 cells and induced Akt phosphorylation in endometrial cancer cell lines indicating that they were gain of function mutations likely acting as oncogenes. Strikingly two of the gain of function mutations (<b>E</b> <b>160</b> * and R 348 *) lacked the ability to bind to the p 110 catalytic subunit and <b>E</b> <b>160</b> * failed to bind to both p 110 and PTEN. We demonstrate that <b>E</b> <b>160</b> * disrupts <b>a</b> novel mechanism of pathway regulation wherein p 85 binds and stabilizes PTEN. Together, the data indicate that the PI 3 K pathway is targeted {{in the vast majority of}} endometrioid endometrial cancers representing a novel opportunity for implementation of targeted therapy...|$|R
40|$|KATP {{channels}} are a functional complex of sulphonylurea receptor (SUR 1, SUR 2) and inward rectifier K+ (Kir 6. 1, Kir 6. 2) channel subunits. We {{have studied the}} role of the putative pore forming subunit (Kir 6. 2) in regulation of rectification and gating of KATP channels generated by transfection of SUR 1 and Kir 6. 2 cDNAs in COSm 6 cells. In the absence of internal polyvalent cations, the current-voltage relationship is sigmoidal. Mg 2 + or spermine 4 + (spm) each induces a mild inward rectification. Mutation of the asparagine at position 160 in Kir 6. 2 to aspartate (N 160 D) or glutamate (N <b>160</b> <b>E)</b> increases the degree of rectification induced by Mg 2 + or spermine 4 +, whereas wild-type rectification is still observed after mutation to other neutral residues (alanine–N <b>160</b> <b>A,</b> glutamine–N <b>160</b> Q). These results are consistent with this residue lining the pore of the channel and contributing to the binding of these cations, as demonstrated for the equivalent site in homomeric ROMK 1 (Kir 1. 1) channels. Since Kir 6. 2 contains no consensus ATP binding site, whereas SUR 1 does, inhibition by ATP has been assumed to depend on interactions with SUR 1. However, we found that the [ATP] causing half-maximal inhibition of current (Ki) was affected by mutation of N 160. Channels formed from N 160 D or N 160 Q mutant subunits had lower apparent sensitivity to ATP (Ki,N 160 D = 46. 1 μM; Ki,N 160 Q = 62. 9 μM) than wild-type, N <b>160</b> <b>E,</b> or N <b>160</b> <b>A</b> channels (Ki = 10. 4, 17. 7, 6. 4 μM, respectively). This might suggest that ATP binding to the channel complex was altered, although examination of channel open probabilities indicates instead that the residue at position 160 alters the ATP-independent open probability, i. e., it controls the free energy of the open state, thereby affecting the “coupling” of ATP binding to channel inhibition. The results can be interpreted in terms of a kinetic scheme whereby the residue at Kir 6. 2 position 160 controls the rate constants governing transitions to and from the open state, without directly affecting ATP binding or unbinding transitions...|$|R

At pH 2, the myristic acid acted as an enteric coating, protecting the antigen {{from a variety}} of proteases. The antigen adsorbed onto silica particles, coated in myristic acid had a conserved secondary structure (measured by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy) following its pH-triggered release.

The principle colouring components of annatto is the oil-soluble diapo carotenoid bixin, which is the methyl ester of the dicarboxylic acid norbixin, which is soluble in aqueous alkali. Bixin and norbixin therefore exhibit not only physicochemical properties normally associated with carotenoids but also certain anomalous properties that have an impact on the stability, food colouring applications and importantly the analysis of annatto. This review summarizes the key aspects of the structural determination of bixin (and norbixin) with special attention to cis-trans isomerization and how this links with its chemical structure, spectroscopic properties and stability. The oxidative, thermal and photo stability of annatto and the subsequent implications for its use in the colouring of foods, food processing, and the analysis of foods and beverages are discussed along with important mechanistic, thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. The main analytical techniques used for the chemical characterization of annatto i. e. spectrophotometry, NMR, chromatography (particularly HPLC) and mass spectrometry are reviewed in detail and other methods discussed. This links in with a review of the methods available for the detection and measurement of annatto in colour formulations and foods and beverages, which highlights the importance of the need for a good understanding and knowledge of the chemistry of bixin and norbixin in order to meet new analytical challenges...|$|R

The treatments in the experiment 1 were: 1) control; 2) methomyl (151 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 3) lambdacyhalothrin (7. 5 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 4) thiodicarb (<b>160</b> g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 5) lufenuron (7. 5 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 6) triflumuron (38. 4 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 7) alphacypermethrin + teflubenzuron (12. 7 + 12. 7 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1) and 8) spinosad (24 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1). In the experiment 2, the following treatments were used: 1) control; 2) methomyl (151 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 3) lambdacyhalothrin (7. 5 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 4) chlorpyrifos (384 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 5) spinosad (24 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 6) triflumurom (28. 8 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 7) lufenuron (15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1) and 8) thiodicarb (240 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1). The treatments in the experiment 3, in the first and second application were respectively: 1) control; 2) thiodicarb and triflumurom (240 and 28. 8 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 3) lambdacyhalothrin and lufenuron (7. 5 and 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 4) alphacypermethrin and teflubenzuron (15 and 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 5) metomil and novaluron (151 and 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 6) alphacypermethrin + teflubenzuron (12. 7 + 12. 7 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1) and 7) profenofos + lufenuron (150 + 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1). The chemical groups Benzoylureas and Carbamates are more used in region, acting respectively, 34 and 31 % in the harvest 2004 / 2005 and 30 and 46 % in the harvest 2005 / 2006. In the results of the experiments with insecticides, it was observed that the use of Benzoylureas (triflumuron and lufenuron) presents efficiency only starting from the seventh day after the application. The Carbamates (thiodicarb and metomil) present efficiency of 90 % in the third day after the application. The insecticides alphacypermethrin + teflubenzuron and spinosad, in the tested dosages present efficiency of 80 and 84 % respectively in the third day after the application...|$|R
40|$|For polyomaviruses, calcium ions {{are known}} to be {{essential}} for virion integrity and for the assembly of capsid structures. To define the role of calcium ions in the life cycle of the virus, we analyzed simian virus 40 (SV 40) mutants in which structurally deduced calcium-binding amino acids of Vp 1 were mutated singly and in combination. Our study provides evidence that calcium ions mediate not only virion assembly but also the initial infection processes of cell entry and nuclear entry. Mutations at Glu 48, Glu 157, Glu 160, Glu 216, and/or Glu 330 are correlated with different extents of packaging defects. The low packaging ability of mutant E 216 R suggests the need to position the Glu 216 side chain for proper virion formation. All other mutants selected for further analysis produced virus-like particles (VLPs) but were poorly infectious. The VLPs of mutant E 330 K could not attach to or enter the cell, and mutant <b>E</b> 157 A-E <b>160</b> <b>A</b> and <b>E</b> 216 K VLPs entered the cell but failed to enter the nucleus, apparently as a result of premature VLP dissociation. Our results show that five of the seven acidic side chains at the two calcium-binding sites—Glu 48 and Glu 330 (site 1), Glu 157 and Glu 160 (site 2), and Glu 216 (both sites) —are important for SV 40 infection. We propose that calcium coordination imparts not only stability but also structural flexibility to the virion, allowing the acquisition or loss of the ion at the two sites to control virion formation in the nucleus, as well as virion structural alterations at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm early during infection...|$|R
40|$|Fumarate is a {{well-known}} biomass building block compound. However, the poor catalytic efficiency of fumarase {{is one of the}} major factors preventing its widespread production. To address this issue, we selected residues 159 HPND 162 of fumarase from Rhizopus oryzae as targets for site-directed mutagenesis based on molecular docking analysis. Twelve mutants were generated and characterized in detail. Kinetic studies showed that the Km values of the P <b>160</b> <b>A,</b> P <b>160</b> T, P 160 H, N 161 E, and D 162 W mutants were decreased, whereas Km values of H 159 Y, H 159 V, H 159 S, N 161 R, N 161 F, D 162 K, and D 162 M mutants were increased. In addition, all mutants displayed decreased catalytic efficiency except for the P <b>160</b> <b>A</b> mutant, whose kcat/Km was increased by 33. 2 %. Moreover, by overexpressing the P <b>160</b> <b>A</b> mutant, the engineered strain T. G-PMS-P <b>160</b> <b>A</b> was able to produce 5. 2 g/L fumarate. To further enhance fumarate production, the acid tolerance of T. G-PMS-P <b>160</b> <b>A</b> was improved by deleting ade 12, a component of the purine nucleotide cycle, and the resulting strain T. G(△ade 12) -PMS-P <b>160</b> <b>A</b> produced 9. 2 g/L fumarate. The strategy generated in this study opens up new avenues for pathway optimization and efficient production of natural products...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{possibility}} of measuring the single spin asymmetry (SSA) in open charm production by linearly polarized photons in the planned <b>E</b> <b>160</b> /E 161 experiments at SLAC using the inclusive spectra of secondary (decay) leptons. In leading order pQCD, the SSA in the azimuthal distribution of the charged decay lepton is predicted to be about 0. 2 for SLAC kinematics. Our calculations show that the SSA in the decay lepton distribution is well defined in pQCD: it is stable both perturbatively and parametrically, and practically insensitive to theoretical uncertainties in the charm semileptonic decays. Nonperturbative contributions to the leptonic SSA due to the gluon transverse motion in the target, heavy quark fragmentation and Fermi motion of the $c$-quark inside the $D$-meson are predicted to be about 10 %. We conclude that measurements of the azimuthal asymmetry in the secondary lepton distribution would provide a good test of the applicability of pQCD to open charm production at energies of fixed target experiments. Our analysis of the SLAC experimental conditions shows that this SSA {{can be measured in}} <b>E</b> <b>160</b> /E 161 with an accuracy of about ten percent.

40|$|A single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism, 160 C/A, {{has been identified}} in the promoter region of the E-cadherin gene and {{has been shown to}} alter its transcriptional activity. To assess susceptibility of <b>160</b> <b>A</b> allele carriers to seven types of cancers, the authors conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis, up to November 2006, of 26 case-control studies comprising 7, 042 cases and 7, 011 controls. Pooled odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated by using the random-effects model. Publication bias, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses were also performed, which showed that <b>160</b> <b>A</b> allele carriers, compared with noncarriers, had about a 17 – 19 % increased risk of several invasive/ metastatic tumors. Analyses of various types of cancers revealed that, in Europeans, the 160 AA homozygote was associated with an increased risk of urothelial cancer, carriers of <b>160</b> <b>A</b> were at increased risk of lung and prostate cancers, and carriers of <b>160</b> <b>A</b> with gastric cancer were found to suffer a significantly increased risk, whereas their Asian counterparts seemed to be tolerant. No evidence was found that the <b>160</b> <b>A</b> allele predisposed its carriers to breast, colorectal, or esophageal cancers.
