SU(3) flavor symmetry is used to relate both the t- and the u- channel exchanges that drive the meson-baryon interaction in the different channels. Angular distributions, polarizations, and spin-rotation parameters are compared with available experimental data. Partial-wave amplitudes are determined and the resonance content is extracted from the analytic continuation, including resonance positions and branching ratios, and possible sources of uncertainties are discussed.

40|$|A {{standard}} {{stiffness matrix}} procedure which permits {{any combination of}} rigid, <b>elastic,</b> <b>pinned</b> or sliding connections of the degrees of freedom {{at the ends of}} a member to the nodes of its parent structure is described, in order to show how easily it can be extended to allow an existing algorithm to be used to ensure that no eigenvalues of the parent structure can be missed even when 'exact' member theory is used. The eigenvalues are the natural frequencies of undamped free vibration analyses or the critical load factors of buckling problems. The method preserves the exactness of the member theory and an efficient method for computer application is indicated. The theory also permits any combination of rigid, <b>elastic,</b> <b>pinned</b> or sliding connections between the freedoms of a substructure and those of its parent structure...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the interplay of}} the <b>elastic</b> <b>pinning</b> and the Anderson localization in the transport properties of a charge-density wave in one dimension, {{within the framework of}} the Luttinger model in the limit of strong repulsion. We address a conceptually important issue of which of the two disorder-induced phenomena limits the mobility more effectively. We argue that the interplay of the classical and quantum effects in transport of a very rigid charge-density wave is quite nontrivial: the quantum localization sets in at a temperature much smaller than the pinning temperature, whereas the quantum localization length is much smaller than the pinning length.

30|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} of osteosynthesis of proximal humeral fractures using Kirschner wires, assembled in an elastic manner. We report 29 patients (mean age, 68 years) with types II, III and V fractures, according to Neer's classification, treated with closed or open (seldom) reduction and percutaneous pinning. The pin placement was antegrade: the wires {{started on the}} epiphysis and aimed at the diaphysis, with the proximal ends fixed with an external clamp and the distal ends crossed and laying on the endosteal surface. Patients were evaluated with the Constant-Murley scale {{at the end of}} treatment. Radiological and clinical outcome was satisfactory in all but one patient, in whom the closed reduction was insufficient. Percutaneous <b>elastic</b> <b>pinning</b> is an effective treatment of proximal humeral fractures. If necessary, it should be associated with open reduction.|$|R

40|$|Conventional von-Neumann {{computing}} {{models have}} achieved remarkable feats {{for the past}} few decades. However, they fail to deliver the required efficiency for certain basic tasks like image and speech recognition when compared to biological systems. As such, taking cues from biological systems, novel computing paradigms are being explored for efficient hardware implementations of recognition/classification tasks. The basic building blocks of such neuromorphic systems are neurons and synapses. Towards that end, we propose a leaky-integrate-fire (LIF) neuron and a programmable non-volatile synapse using domain wall motion induced by magneto-electric effect. Due to a strong <b>elastic</b> <b>pinning</b> between the ferro-magnetic domain wall (FM-DW) and the underlying ferro-electric domain wall (FE-DW), the FM-DW gets dragged by the FE-DW on application of a voltage pulse. The fact that FE materials are insulators allows for pure voltage-driven FM-DW motion, which in turn can be used to mimic the behaviors of biological spiking neurons and synapses. The voltage driven nature of the proposed devices allows energy-efficient operation. A detailed device to system level simulation framework based on micromagnetic simulations has been developed to analyze the feasibility of the proposed neuro-synaptic devices. We also demonstrate that the energy-efficient voltage-controlled behavior of the proposed devices make them suitable for dynamic on-line and lifelong learning in spiking neural networks (SNNs) ...|$|R

The conductivity and compressibility are computed. The latter is found to cross over from its dynamic to static value on a scale set by the waiting time after a quench, an effect which can be probed in experiments in, e. g., Wigner glasses...|$|R

40|$|Based on an {{extension}} of the fiber bundle model we investigate numerically the motion of the crack front through a weak plane separating a soft and an infinitely stiff block. We find that there are two regimes. At large scales the motion is consistent with the <b>pinned</b> <b>elastic</b> line model and we find a roughness exponent equal to 0. 39 +/- 0. 04 characterizing it. At smaller scales, coalescence of holes dominates the motion rather than pinning of the crack front. We find a roughness exponent consistent with 2 / 3, which is the gradient percolation value. The length of the crack front is fractal on these smaller scales. We determine its fractal dimension to be 1. 77 +/- 0. 02, consistent with the hull of percolation clusters, 7 / 4. This suggests that the crack front is described by two universality classes: on large scales, the <b>pinned</b> <b>elastic</b> line one and on small scales, the percolation universality class.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{of cells}} is mediated by membrane receptors that bind to complementary ligands in apposing cell membranes. It is generally {{assumed that the}} lateral diffusion of mobile receptor-ligand bonds in membrane-membrane adhesion zones is slower than the diffusion of unbound receptors and ligands. We find that this slowing down is not only caused by the larger size of the bound receptor-ligand complexes, but also by thermal fluctuations of the membrane shape. We model two adhering membranes as <b>elastic</b> sheets <b>pinned</b> together by receptor-ligand bonds and study the diffusion of the bonds using Monte Carlo simulations. In our model, the fluctuations reduce the bond diffusion constant in planar membranes by a factor close to 2 in the biologically relevant regime of small bond concentrations.

Short scale decorrelation depend on a non trivial boundary layer regime with (possibly multiple) chaos exponents. Large scale mutual displacement correlation behave as |x-x'|^ 2 ζ - μ, the decorrelation exponent μ proportional {{to the difference between}} Flory (or mean field) and exact roughness exponent ζ. For short range disorder μ > 0 but small, e. g. for random bond interfaces μ = 5 ζ - ϵ, ϵ= 4 -d, and μ = ϵ ((2 π) ^ 2 / 36 - 1) for the one component Bragg glass.

Only for special orientations DWs are free of vortices. In this article we calculate their <b>elastic</b> and <b>pinning</b> properties, using the pitch angle θ as a small parameter. In particular we show that vortex free DWs exhibit long range elasticity which makes them very stiff and suppresses their pinning by impurities. Their roughening transition temperature is {{of the order of}} the Néel temperature. DWs including vortices (either by orientation or due to step formation above their roughening transition) show short range elasticity and strong pinning by impurities. These results apply both to centro-symmetric as well as to non-centrosymmetric systems. The application to chiral liquid crystals is briefly discussed...|$|R

This method allows a nonperturbative treatment of a problem with many nonlinear degrees of freedom and quenched disorder. In this way it is possible to characterize the pinned configurations and to compute the threshold field {{as a function of the}} coupling constant of the model.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{examine the impact of}} {{anisotropy}} in creep deformation of the zirconium alloy clad in pressurised water reactors (PWR), finite element analysis was used through the Abaqus CAE v 11. 2 software. A qualitative link between the deformation of a single hexagonal-closed-packed zirconium crystal (c/a < 1. 63) under uniaxial loading and Hill’s anisotropic criterion was devised, which allowed for the additions of anisotropic creep strain on the zirconium clad. A 21 / 2 -D axisymmetric (r, z) test element was used to examine the application of anisotropic creep strain using the Hill potential via the CREEP subroutine and the *POTENTIAL command, and comparisons with analytical solutions were drawn. This lead to the development of an axisymmetric 21 / 2 -D <b>elastic</b> fuel <b>pin</b> model. The material properties for the uranium dioxide pellet and zirconium alloy clad used were of empirical nature. An empirical gap conductance model, consisting of an open and closed gap conductance component, was used via the GAPCON subroutine and a smooth gap closure was achieved during a highly non-linear coupled temperature-displacement analysis. The thermal profile of a PWR fuel pin under nominal operating conditions was produced and comparisons with the analytical solutions, where possible, were made. An empirical anisotropic creep strain model, consisting of thermal and irradiation induced creep components, was lastly implemented in the thermo-mechanical <b>elastic</b> fuel <b>pin</b> model. An isotropic case and two differing textures were examined. These were a high preferential basal pole alignment in the radial and axial direction. The differing textures resulted in profound differences in the stress distribution on the metallic clad and consequently the final creep strain deformation varied. It was found that the radially aligned texture resulted in high axial elongation and the axially aligned texture resulted in a bigger diametric increase of the tube. The investigation concluded that texture plays a crucial role on the stress distribution and hence the creep strain deformation of the zirconium alloy tube, influencing both the mechanics and chemistry of pellet-cladding interactions, and hence needs to be investigated further in the future.
