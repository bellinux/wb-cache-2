5|$|Given Huskisson's importance, and the {{potential}} impact {{on the future of}} Liverpool and Manchester's industries and on the embryonic railway industry of any findings of liability {{on the part of the}} railway, a swift determination of the causes of the accident was considered essential. By 9.00am on the morning after the accident, a hastily convened coroner's jury was assembled in the Grapes public house in Eccles. The coroner himself, MrMilne, arrived at 10.00am and was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> proceed as he had another inquest scheduled that afternoon, but proceedings were unable to begin as Lord Wilton, the only sworn witness scheduled to attend the inquest, could not be found. In the meantime, Milne sent the jury to the vicarage to view Huskisson's body.|$|E
5|$|The three Nasser brothers, William, Elias and George, {{specifically}} requested Pflueger in 1920 {{after they}} received financing {{for a grand}} movie palace on Castro Street. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> see the 2,000-seat project completed, the Nasser Brothers gave Pflueger a free hand in its design. The Castro Theatre was finished in June 1922 for $300,000 ($ in today's dollars) in a largely Spanish Baroque style which evoked cathedrals in Spain and Mexico. Churrigueresque elements were used sparingly on the facade, and ornate tile detailing was employed in the vestibule, ticket booth and the lobby. A canopy modeled after ancient Roman silk brocade shelters was fashioned of steel lath and plaster and painted with Asian and Buddha figures to overhang the main theater seating area. The whole was an eclectic assemblage of styles.|$|E

25|$|He bowls {{fast and}} {{obviously}} scorns to conserve his strength. He is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> {{be at the}} batsman. He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at a great pace, throws up his arm high, and then makes a terrifying leap into the air—a leap which one feels should {{be accompanied by a}} yell. At the end of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes it hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. With it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E
25|$|The {{spring of}} 1870 saw Fort Edmonton {{come under the}} threat of {{violence}} due to a war between the Blackfoot and Cree, resulting from the slaying of Cree Chief Maskipiton. The Blackfoot were unable to ford the North Saskatchewan due to the high spring waters, but they encamped across from Fort Edmonton and harassed it with their muskets nonetheless. Some wagons full of goods had to be abandoned by traders <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> reach safety inside of the fort, and their contents were spoiled by the Blackfoot. Though the fort itself was not invaded, the men within were armed and ready to fight. Chief Factor William J. Christie chose to withstand the Blackfoot and not attack them, fearing that to do so would only invite further violence against the Hudson's Bay Company.|$|E
25|$|The Republicans were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> {{force the}} city to {{surrender}} as the rainy weather of autumn would prevent any further military action to be taken. Upon his arrival Díaz proclaimed that his intents were to arrest General Márquez, Tomás O'Horán and the former Minister of State. He also stated that he would execute all the Austrian auxiliaries if they were captured. The lives of the Francofon soldiers would be spared since 60% of his own cavalry consisted of French deserters. On 20 April Agnes Salm-Salm, a Prussian princess in Imperial service, appeared at the camp of Díaz and offered the disbandment of the European troops {{in exchange for the}} guarantee of their and Maximilian's lives and free passage back to Europe. Although her offer was not accepted she tried to further convince Díaz by sending word that the Austro-Hungarian troops were put on hold and under the temporary protection of the neutral Prussian flag as of 26th inst.|$|E

25|$|Deepak {{was born}} on 1 April 1984, {{in the city of}} Belgaum, Karnataka. During his early years, he was {{interested}} in playing table tennis, football and cricket. He even won several table tennis tournaments and played at the Karnataka State Level TT Championship. He initially started playing cricket as a bowler. He decided to shift to batting because of a chance knock that he played for his team at Belgaum. He was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> catch a bus to participate in a table tennis tournament in Bangalore but his side was about to start batting. Seeing his urgency, the coach Mr. Feroz Shaikh asked him to open the innings. Deepak went on to score a big knock and helped his side to win the game. This convinced Deepak that he had more potential to play as a batsman than as a bowler and he also decided to shun table tennis in favour of cricket.|$|E
25|$|Al-Tabari {{reports that}} al-Mahdi {{was just about}} to promote Harun as heir {{apparent}} ahead of Musa when he died, and adds by way of corroboration another report that al-Mahdi set off for Masabadhan in a great hurry. However, it may be doubted that al-Mahdi at the time shared the reporter's subsequent knowledge of his imminent demise there, and none of the other reported circumstances of his death suggest that he was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> go anywhere. On the contrary, the sources in general make it clear that he had gone to Masabadhan for recreation, and they occasionally say so explicitly. Al-Tabari does say explicitly that envoys were sent to the provinces, where they obtained the oath of allegiance not only to al-Hadi as caliph but also to Harun as heir apparent (wali l-'ahd) (38). This was probably the first occasion on which Harun was so acknowledged. Harun himself, with the advice of al-Rabi', sent out these envoys, and all of this must have been presented to his brother on his return as a fait accompli.|$|E

Balchen chafed at being forced to remain ashore and was not pleased when he was forcibly retired in April 1744, aged 74. [...] Two months later, however, Balchen was recalled up to the Admiralty. A fleet of 25 British and Dutch ships had been raised <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> rescue a British squadron and convoy under Sir Charles Hardy, which had been trapped in the Tagus by a French Brest squadron. Due to a shortage of officers of sufficient experience and seniority to command a fleet of this kind, Balchen was called up at short notice and rewarded with a knighthood.|$|E

A month later, the battle on the peninsula had bogged down and the success of the German submarine [...] in sinking two British predreadnoughts forced Ark Royal to move to a safer anchorage at Imbros at the end of May. There she became a depot ship for all the seaplanes in the area, while her own aircraft continued to support operations at Gallipoli. On occasion, aircraft were loaned out to other ships for reconnaissance or observation missions.|$|E
500|$|University {{lecturer}} Zaini Ujang viewed Yesterday and Todays comparisons as {{criticisms of}} society, putting forth {{the question of}} whether people should accept [...] "development" [...] to simply mean discarding the old for the new without regards to its value. [...] Professor Fuziah of the National University of Malaysia interpreted the book's ending as a wakeup call to parents, questioning them if they should deny their children a more relaxed childhood. [...] Lent agreed, saying that Lat had asserted the theme from the start, showing him and his childhood friends [...] "not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> grow up". [...] Redza hinted that Lat's other goal was to point out the [...] "dehumanising environment" [...] that Malaysian urban children are growing up in.

500|$|Broadwater noted, [...] "given the {{difficulty}} of the task he had set for himself, his stubborn independence, and his lack, by 1787, of any concern for his own political future, {{it is not surprising that}} he left Philadelphia at odds with the great majority of his fellow delegates". Madison recorded that Mason, believing that the convention had given his proposals short shrift <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> complete its work, began his journey back to Virginia [...] "in an exceeding ill humor". Mason biographer Helen Hill Miller noted that before Mason returned to Gunston Hall, he was injured in body as well as spirit, due to an accident on the road. Word of Mason's opposition stance had reached Fairfax County even before the convention ended; most local sentiment was in favor of the document. Washington made a statement urging ratification, but otherwise remained silent, knowing he would almost certainly be the first president. Mason sent Washington a copy of his objections, but the general believed that the only choice was ratification or disaster.|$|E
500|$|Diefenbaker won Prince Albert in 1953, {{even as the}} Tories {{suffered}} a second consecutive disastrous defeat under Drew. Speculation arose in the press that the leader might be pressured to step aside. Drew was determined to remain, however, and Diefenbaker was careful to avoid any action that {{might be seen as}} disloyal. However, Diefenbaker was never a member of the [...] "Five O'clock Club" [...] of Drew intimates who met the leader in his office for a drink and gossip each day. By 1955, there was a widespread feeling among Tories that Drew was not capable of leading the party to a victory. At the same time, the Liberals were in flux as the aging St. Laurent tired of politics. Drew was able to damage the government in a weeks-long battle over the TransCanada pipeline in 1956—the so-called Pipeline Debate—in which the government, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> obtain financing for the pipeline, imposed closure before the debate even began. The Tories and the CCF combined to obstruct business in the House for weeks before the Liberals were finally able to pass the measure. Diefenbaker played a relatively minor role in the Pipeline Debate, speaking only once.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opened to}} mixed feedback, and aired {{back-to-back}} with [...] "Good Mourning", as a two-hour season premiere special. Alan Sepinwall of NJ.com {{commented on the}} two episodes being conjoined into one week: [...] "I keep {{going back and forth}} on whether {{it was a good idea}} to do that, or if we'd have been better off spacing out the tearful speeches over two weeks. That isn't to say that there shouldn't have been tears, or speeches. George's death, no matter how marginal he had become last season, is and should be a huge event in the lives of these characters. Had the show raced through Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's famous five stages of grief, it would have rang false, as if everyone making the show was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> <b>to</b> move past the events of the wildly uneven fifth season. My problem is, when you put two episodes back-to-back, those rhythms - the pace at which the acts build to emotional crescendos and then briefly recede - start to become too predictable, and it sucks some of the life and emotion away." [...] Sepinwall also praised Wilson's, Ramirez's, and Chamber's performances.|$|E
