50|$|Flange mounts—Very {{strong and}} rigid, but have little {{tolerance}} for misalignment. Experts recommend cap end mounts for thrust loads and rod end mounts where major loading puts the piston rod in tension. Three types are head rectangular flange, head square flange or rectangular head. <b>Flange</b> <b>mounts</b> function optimally when the mounting face attaches to a machine support member.|$|R

50|$|A full-diameter non-fast-opening {{rear door}} costs little, all things considered. On larger machines, {{it can be}} mounted on a hinge, davit, or dolly {{assembly}} (see photo above) that allows it to be swung or {{moved away from the}} autoclave once its bolted <b>flange</b> <b>mounting</b> has been separated. This provides the best possible access to the works inside. It also means that critical components are never buried deep inside the machine where they are hard to get at and thus very likely to be ignored until they cause problems. One mid-sized autoclave built for a southern aircraft repair shop to be as cheap as humanly possible lacked easy access to the circulation fan, and, when last observed by one of the manufacturer's service engineers, was making the most alarming dry-bearing noises whenever it ran.|$|R

50|$|Rotating paddle level sensors are a {{very old}} and {{established}} technique for bulk solid point level indication. The technique uses a low-speed gear motor that rotates a paddle wheel. When the paddle is stalled by solid materials, the motor is rotated on its shaft by its own torque until a <b>flange</b> <b>mounted</b> on the motor contacts a mechanical switch. The paddle can be constructed {{from a variety of}} materials, but tacky material must not be allowed to build up on the paddle. Build-up may occur if the process material becomes tacky because of high moisture levels or high ambient humidity in the hopper. For materials with very low weight per unit volume such as Pearlite, Bentonite or fly ash, special paddle designs and low-torque motors are used. Fine particles or dust must be prevented from penetrating the shaft bearings and motor by proper placement of the paddle in the hopper or bin and using appropriate seals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{audio tape}} recorder was a non-magnetic, non-electric version invented by Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory and patented in 1886 (...) [...] It employed a 3/16 in strip of wax-covered paper that was coated by dipping it {{in a solution}} of beeswax and paraffin and then had one side scraped clean, with the other side allowed to harden. The machine was of sturdy wood and metal construction, and hand-powered {{by means of a}} knob fastened to the flywheel. The wax strip passed from one eight-inch reel around the periphery of a pulley (with guide <b>flanges)</b> <b>mounted</b> above the V-pulleys on the main vertical shaft, where it came in contact with either its recording or playback stylus. The tape was then taken up on the other reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a vibrating mica diaphragm, cut the wax from the strip. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus, attached to a rubber diaphragm, carried the reproduced sounds through an ear tube to its listener.|$|R

40|$|An {{extractor}} type ionization gauge {{has been}} developed for <b>flange</b> <b>mounting</b> in a 15. 7 mm diam. aperture. The gauge electrodes are aligned by ceramic plates. A cylindrical anode grid of 9 mm diam. and 12. 5 mm length is formed of photo-etched W-sheet.

The height of the electrodes {{from the top of}} the anode grid to the base of the hemispherical collector is 18. 9 mm. The gauge design is a compromise between obtaining a low X-ray or pressure limit, high sensitivity and high electron emission current. The foregoing, given in the same order, were respectively 5 * 10 /sup - 12 / torr; 5 torr/sup - 1 / for N/sub 2 / at 10 mA emission current and 6 torr/sup - 1 / at below 5 mA; and an emission current of between 5 - 10 mA which gave the high anode current density required to maintain a clean grid.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a new miniature cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) are presented. The CMA comprises outer and inner cylinders, an integral on-axis electron gun, and a detector system consisting of ring aperture and channeltron, all mounted on a single 2. 75 in. (70 mm o. d.) Conflat flange. Entrance angle, sample-to-detector distance, and polar cone angle were chosen, in consideration of second order focusing effects, which optimized analyzer transparency and resolution. Fringe field correction {{at the ends of}} the CMA is made by means of six rings precisely separated by sapphire insulators. The electron gun is a one-lens electrostatic system equipped with an x-y deflector for beam adjustment and scanning. A CeB 6 low temperature cathode operating at up to - 3. 0 keV delivers emission current up to 100 muA. The energy range of analyzed electrons can be varied between 0 eV and 3. 0 keV. The <b>flange</b> <b>mounting</b> also incorporates a high precision z-motion drive for optimization of the working distance. The control electronics and software permit operation of the instrument in pulse and analog phase sensitive detection modes. Results obtained with this new mini CMA for a W(100) surface demonstrate an energy resolution (DeltaE/E) of 0. 9 %, which is comparable to larger 6 in. (152 mm) flange-mounted instruments. The very small size of the mini CMA permits its use in small or crowded ultrahigh vacuum chambers or where only 2. 75 in. ports are available, thereby increasing flexibility in surface analysis.

40|$|Recently, FEP {{developed}} a new family of <b>flange</b> <b>mounted</b> magnetron sources together with pulsed powering and process control. This system can be applied either as single magnetrons powered in unipolar pulse mode, e. g. with a pulsed dc voltage, or can be applied {{as a pair of}} magnetrons powered in bipolar mode, e. g. with an alternating pulsed voltage between both magnetrons that act alternately as the anode and cathode of the discharge. The pulse unit can be switched between the two pulse modes. This allows to investigate directly the influence of the pulse mode and pulse parameters using the same magnetron configuration and the same type of pulse power supply. Experimental results of the reactive deposition of SiO 2, Si 3 N 4 and TiO 2 demonstrate the specifics of both process modes. There are effects of the pulse mode observed for all this materials that are independent on the target material. Furthermore we observed effects of the duty cycle, i. e. the ratio of the pulse-on-time to the cycle time of the rectangular current or voltage pulses. The deposition rate and thermal substrate load exhibit a pronounced dependence on the pulse parameters. The values of film properties like refractive index and internal stress will be discussed for the materials SiO 2, Si 3 N 4 and TiO 2. The flexibility of the pulse sputtering system with free choice of pulse mode allows the universal use either for basic research or in production. The investigations made with this system demonstrate the new possibility to use the pulse parameters to influence film properties...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to provide design and {{operational}} information for the conversion of small turboprop engines into land-based shaft power drives. These can provide economical solutions to individual power requirements such as standby electrical generators, {{combined heat and power}} units, fan drives or centrifugal compressor drives. Considerable numbers of ex-military engines are currently becoming available at economical prices. One such engine is the Rolls-Royce Dart turboprop gas turbine which, although there are over 2000 still in civil and military service worldwide, is now being phased out of Royal Air Force operation. This paper describes the modification of a Dart RDa 12 engine to drive a centrifugal compressor from a smaller RDa 7, Mk 552, engine for a compressed air facility on a university campus. The modified engine has a power of over 2400 hp (1790 kW) at 15000 r/min and the compressor was driven directly from the engine output shaft supplying 10. 5 kg/s of air at a pressure ration of 3. 3 : 1. To achieve this, the turboprop's main reduction gearbox was removed, the teeth on the engine drive pinion ground down and a flexible coupling fitted to it to drive the RDa 7 compressor which was <b>flange</b> <b>mounted</b> on the engine gearbox-air intake casing. The removal of the main gearbox removed the drives to the lubricating oil pumps the fuel pump and the engine control system. The manner in which these problems were overcome and the method of operating the system are described. One of the most important considerations in starting such a direct drive system is the complete closing off of the air intake to the driven compressor and the design of an annular valve to perform this duty is described. The operating parameters including the flow, pressure ratio and engine turbine entry temperatures for this system are given...|$|R
