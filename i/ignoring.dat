5|$|Even {{accounting}} measures {{intended to}} recognize gender disparities are criticized for <b>ignoring</b> unpaid work. Two such examples are the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), {{neither of which}} include much unpaid work. So feminist economics calls for a more comprehensive index which includes participation in unpaid work.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the Finnish {{government}} was criticised for <b>ignoring</b> other options and buying only Vanajas, which {{were said to}} be overpriced. The state had ordered 650 vehicles, spread over several years, and this tied the state's hands in equipment buying for a long period.|$|E

50|$|Finally, Pressman {{has argued}} that Robert Nozick's {{position}} on the justice of government redistribution programs, which is put into concrete terms with his famous Wilt Chamberlain example, is badly flawed for four reasons - it <b>ignores</b> actual history, yet purports to be a historical theory of justice, it <b>ignores</b> empirical evidence on justice, it <b>ignores</b> the social nature of production and it <b>ignores</b> the future.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} on being <b>ignored</b> by peers, 934 twelfth-grade {{students}} reported on their experiences of being <b>ignored,</b> victimized, and socially withdrawn, and completed measures {{of friendship and}} psychological adjustment (depression, self-esteem, and global satisfaction). Peer nominations of being <b>ignored,</b> victimized, and accepted by peers were also collected. Self-reports and peer reports of being <b>ignored</b> {{were associated with the}} psychological outcomes, after accounting for other peer experiences and social withdrawal. The associations between the <b>ignore</b> variables and certain outcomes were weaker for adolescents who were highly accepted, made many friendship nominations, and received many friendship nominations. Results suggest that being <b>ignored</b> by schoolmates may represent a specific understudied negative group-level peer difficulty that poses significant and unique psychological risk during late adolescence...|$|R

5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by <b>ignoring</b> that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It is for this reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E

Unaware of Spider-Man's true identity, he also {{sees himself as a}} father figure for Peter, <b>ignoring</b> his own son, Harry. Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta turned down the role. Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character's necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took half an hour to put on.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a {{negligible}} set {{is a set}} that is small enough {{that it can be}} <b>ignored</b> for some purpose.As common examples, finite sets can be <b>ignored</b> when studying the limit of a sequence, and null sets can be <b>ignored</b> when studying the integral of a measurable function.|$|R

5|$|At this point, {{there is}} a {{divergence}} in the classical sources as to the course of events which cannot be reconciled until the entry of Marcus Licinius Crassus into the war. The two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by Appian and Plutarch detail very different events. However, neither account directly contradicts the other, but simply reports different events, <b>ignoring</b> some events in the other account, and reporting events that are unique to that account.|$|E
5|$|Because Republicans {{controlled}} neither {{house of}} Congress, nor the Supreme Court, Breckinridge {{did not believe}} Lincoln's election was a mandate for secession. <b>Ignoring</b> James Murray Mason's contention that no Southerner should serve in Lincoln's cabinet, Breckinridge supported the appointment of Virginian Montgomery Blair as Postmaster General. He also voted against a resolution to remove {{the names of the}} senators from seceded states from the Senate roll.|$|E

A park ranger discusses that case with him, telling Black that the body was found by an unidentified rambler. Black believes this man was the murderer. Elsewhere, Dion returns home, where he is belittled and emasculated by his overbearing mother, Marie (Linda Sorensen).|$|E
5|$|But large {{bands of}} Alamanni, <b>ignoring</b> {{the threat posed}} by the Roman manoeuvre, invaded and ravaged the rich Rhone valley, even trying to take the major city of Lugdunum (Lyon) by assault. The attack was repulsed as the walls of the city proved too strong and the garrison, presumably limitanei troops, too valorous. Nevertheless, the Germans had devastated a large area and taken vast amounts of booty.|$|E
5|$|By 07:30, Davout {{had gained}} control of the three flèches. Prince Bagration quickly led a counterattack that threw the French out of the positions, only to have Marshal Michel Ney lead a charge by the 24thRegiment that retook them. Although not enamoured of Barclay, Bagration turned to him for aid, <b>ignoring</b> Kutuzov altogether; Barclay, to his credit, responded quickly, sending three guard regiments, eight {{grenadier}} battalions, and twenty-four 12-pounder cannon at their best pace to bolster Semyаnovskaya. Colonel Toll and Kutuzov moved the Guard Reserve units forward as early as 09:00 hours.|$|E
