5|$|Deciduous {{trees and}} {{plants have been}} {{promoted}} {{as a means of}} controlling solar heating and cooling. When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter. Since bare, leafless trees shade 1/3 to 1/2 of <b>incident</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> there is a balance between the benefits of summer shading and the corresponding loss of winter heating. In climates with significant heating loads, deciduous trees should not be planted on the Equator-facing side of a building because they will interfere with winter solar availability. They can, however, be used on the east and west sides to provide a degree of summer shading without appreciably affecting winter solar gain.|$|E
25|$|The surface {{reflectance}} {{of incoming}} solar radiation {{is important for}} the surface energy balance (SEB). It is the ratio of reflected to <b>incident</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> commonly referred to as albedo. Climatologists are primarily interested in albedo integrated over the shortwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (~300 to 3500nm), which coincides with the main solar energy input. Typically, albedo values for non-melting snow-covered surfaces are high (~80-90%) except in the case of forests. The higher albedos for snow and ice cause rapid shifts in surface reflectivity in autumn and spring in high latitudes, but the overall climatic significance of this increase is spatially and temporally modulated by cloud cover. (Planetary albedo is determined principally by cloud cover, and by the small amount of total solar radiation received in high latitudes during winter months.) Summer and autumn are times of high-average cloudiness over the Arctic Ocean so the albedo feedback associated with the large seasonal changes in sea-ice extent is greatly reduced. Groisman et al. (1994a) observed that snow cover exhibited the greatest influence on the Earth radiative balance in the spring (April to May) period when incoming solar radiation was greatest over snow-covered areas.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{concentrator}} photovoltaic (CPV) system with improved irradiation uniformity and system efficiency. CPV technology is very promising its for highly efficient solar energy conversion. A conventional CPV system usually uses only one optical component, {{such as a}} refractive Fresnel lens or a reflective parabolic dish, to collect and concentrate <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> on the <b>solar</b> cell surface. Such a system creates strongly non-uniform irradiation distribution on the solar cell, which tends to cause hot spots, current mismatch, and degrades the overall efficiency of the system. Additionally, a high-concentration CPV system is unable to collect diffuse <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel CPV system with improved irradiation uniformity and collection of diffuse <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> The proposed system uses a Fresnel lens as a primary optical element (POE) to concentrate and focus the sunlight and a plano-concave lens as a secondary optical element (SOE) to uniformly distribute the sunlight {{over the surface of}} multi-junction (MJ) solar cells. By using the SOE, the irradiance uniformity is significantly improved in the system. Additionally, the proposed system also captures diffuse <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> by using an additional low-cost solar cell surrounding MJ cells. In our system, <b>incident</b> direct <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> is captured by MJ <b>solar</b> cells, whereas <b>incident</b> diffuse <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> is captured by the low-cost solar cell. Simulation models were developed using a commercial optical simulation tool (LightTools™). The irradiance uniformity and efficiency of the proposed CPV system were analyzed, evaluated, and compared with those of conventional CPV systems. The analyzed and simulated results show that the CPV system significantly improves the irradiance uniformity as well as the system efficiency compared to the conventional CPV systems. Numerically, for our simulation models, the designed CPV with the SOE and low-cost cell provided an optical power ratio increase of about 17. 12 % compared to the conventional CPV without the low-cost cell, and about 10. 26 % compared to the conventional CPV without using both the SOE and additional low-cost cell...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study investigating the energy performance of electrochromic windows in a prototypical residential building under a variety of state switching control strategies. We used the DOE- 2. 1 E energy simulation program to analyze the annual cooling energy and peak demand as a function of glazing type, size, and electrochromic control strategy. A single-story ranch-style home located in the cooling-dominated locations of Miami, FL and Phoenix, AZ was simulated. Electrochromic control strategies analyzed were based on <b>incident</b> total <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> space cooling load, and outside air temperature. Our results show that an electrochromic material with a high reflectance in the colored state provides the best performance for all control strategies. On the other hand, electrochromic switching using space cooling load provides the best performance for all the electrochromic materials. The performance of the <b>incident</b> total <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> control strategy varies {{as a function of the}} values of <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> which trigger the bleached and colored states of the electrochromic (setpoint range); i. e., required cooling decreases as the setpoint range decreases; also, performance differences among electrochromics increases. The setpoint range of outside air temperature control of electrochromics must relate to the ambient weather conditions prevalent in a particular location. If the setpoint range is too large, electrochromic cooling performance is very poor. Electrochromics compare favorably to conventional low-E clear glazings that have high solar heat gain coefficients that are used with overhangs. However, low-E tinted glazings with low solar heat gain coefficients can outperform certain electrochromics. Overhangs should be considered as a design option for electrochromics whose state properties do not change significantly between bleached and colored states...|$|R

The possibility of using high-reflectance technology on building façades was evaluated by using a two-dimensional simple building façade model. The effectiveness of applying retroreflective materials to building façades was also evaluated in regards to avoiding adverse effects on pedestrians. The ratio of diffusely-reflected <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> to a pedestrian from a given floor is proportional to the ratio of the angle of the reflective arc reaching a pedestrian from that floor to the angle of the reflective arc from the entire building. Specular reflection of <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> from the building façade is calculated by ray-tracing method corresponding to solar angle θ. In Japanese cities that are located at mid-latitudes, applying high-reflectance technology to a building façade at the fourth floor and above produces reflection of <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> that does not have adverse effects on pedestrians. High-reflectance technology is applicable on building façades above the fourth floor at any latitude, if we ignore a negative effect, since <b>incident</b> direct <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> to the building façade around noon is small at low latitude.

Energy harvested from the sun is a necessarily a valuable source but still most it part goes unutilised in Indian subcontinent although being a tropical region.
