Max believed that <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E

25|$|His uncle soon {{discovered}} that Hamilton had a remarkable ability to learn languages, and from a young age, had displayed {{an uncanny ability to}} acquire them (although this is disputed by some historians, who claim he had only a very basic understanding of them). At the age of seven he had already made very considerable progress in Hebrew, and before he was thirteen he had acquired, under the care of his uncle (a linguist), almost as many languages as he had years of age. These included the classical and modern European languages, and Persian, Arabic, Hindustani, Sanskrit, and even Marathi and Malay. He retained much of his <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> {{to the end of his}} life, often reading Persian and Arabic in his spare time, although he had long since stopped studying languages, and used them just for relaxation.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Campbell denounced Nazi Germany and returned to Britain. He did duty as an Air Raid Precautions warden in London. During this period he met and befriended Dylan Thomas, a fellow alcoholic, with whom he once ate a vase of daffodils in celebration of St. David's Day. Although he was over draft age and in bad physical shape, as well as having a bad hip, Campbell finally managed to get enlisted in the British Army. He was accepted by the Intelligence Corps because of his <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> and began training as a private with the Royal Welch Fusiliers on 1 April 1942. Having completed basic training, Campbell was transferred in July to the I.C. Depot near Winchester, where he was trained in motorcycles. In February 1943 he was promoted to sergeant, and in March he was posted to British East Africa. On 5 May, he arrived in Nairobi and was attached to the King's African Rifles, serving in a camp two miles outside the city. After having worked as a military censor he was transferred in June to the 12th Observation Unit of the commando force being trained for jungle warfare against the Japanese. However, any hope of seeing real action in the Far East was thwarted when Campbell during training in late July suffered a new injury to his damaged hip in a fall from a motorcycle. He was sent back to hospital in Nairobi, where the doctors examined an X-ray of his hips and declared him unfit for active duty.|$|E
40|$|Different {{people use}} {{language}} in different ways. We capture this through making language competence – {{the set of}} messages an agent can use and understand – private information. Our primary focus is on common-interest games. Communication generally remains possible; it may be severely impaired even with common knowledge that language competence is adequate; and, indeterminacy of meaning, the confounding of payoff-relevant information with information about language competence, is optimal. This indeterminacy persists with higher-order failure <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> competence. When both senders and receivers move at the action stage and payoffs violate a self-signaling condition, lack <b>of</b> common <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> competence may lead to complete communication failure for any finite-order <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> competence...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} how people derive relational/grammatical <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> from experience <b>of</b> <b>language</b> instances. The argument of the paper is framed through discussion of Hume’s theory of human understanding. Hume classified human knowledge into two kinds: relations of ideas and matters of fact, and the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> is also viewed from this theoretical perspective. Chomsky’s theory of linguistic competence is nothing but the <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the relations of ideas intended to express in the process of communication through conventional language forms. The relations of ideas are verbalized and conventionalized in a particular language as the grammar or language structures. The native speaker’s <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> these relations of ideas derives from his experience <b>of</b> instances <b>of</b> <b>language</b> in use. The mechanisms of the mental operation <b>of</b> transformation from <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> instances to <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> grammatical conventions reflecting the relations of ideas in communication are cause and effect, and similarity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNo {{matter where}} you teach, you are duty-bound to expand your <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> to meet the diverse <b>language</b> needs <b>of</b> {{students}}. Junior high school students demonstrate deficits in different domains <b>of</b> foreign <b>language</b> learning, most <b>of</b> which {{are the result of}} teachers’ lack <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> and skills. A bulk of studies has dealt with different skills and <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> teachers. However, existing studies have rarely made any comparisons between school and language institute teachers. Therefore, in this study, using Brown's (2001) checklist <b>of</b> good <b>language</b> teaching characteristics, and the teacher self-observation form (Christison & Bassano, 1984), teachers’ skills and <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> in these contexts were evaluated. Language institute teachers were found to have higher levels <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> and skills as compared to school teachers. The findings have implications for language teachers, syllabus and curriculum designers, and in-service teacher training programs...|$|R

In a coded letter that was smuggled to Gerald O'Reilly, a member of Clan na Gael in the Bronx, New York, in May 1941, the writer (which O'Reilly understood was Ryan) explained the situation: despite their differences over the previous six years, he had been happy to meet Sean Russell; before his death, Russell had entrusted him with important papers that should be returned to the IRA; that he had a [...] "free hand and was fully trusted"; that success (for the IRA) would depend on the left wing of the IRA working with the leadership, and that if this happened the IRA would emerge stronger after the war. A few weeks later O'Reilly was arrested by the FBI (they were looking for Sean Russell, who had skipped bail) who obtained the letter. They said they were aware of Ryan's [...] "anti-Fascist credentials" [...] and although due to his contacts and <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>languages</b> would be useful to [...] "the enemy" [...] (the US was not yet in the war), they did not yet believe he would work for Fascism.

50|$|Part of the {{motivation}} for the distinction between performance and competence comes from speech errors: despite having a perfect understanding of the correct forms, a speaker <b>of</b> a <b>language</b> may unintentionally produce incorrect forms. This is because performance occurs in real situations, and so is subject to many non-linguistic influences. For example, distractions or memory limitations can affect lexical retrieval (Chomsky 1965:3), and give rise to errors in both production and perception or distractions. Such non-linguistic factors are completely independent <b>of</b> the actual <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>language,</b> and establish that speakers' <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>language</b> (their competence) is distinct from their actual use <b>of</b> <b>language</b> (their performance).|$|R
