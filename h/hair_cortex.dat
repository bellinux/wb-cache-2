50|$|Trichorrhexis invaginata, or bamboo hair, is a {{hair shaft}} {{abnormality}} that occurs {{as a result}} of an intermittent keratinizing defect of the <b>hair</b> <b>cortex.</b> Incomplete conversion of the sulfhydryl -SH group onto S-S disulfide bonds in the protein of the cortical fibers leads to cortical softness and subsequent invagination of the fully keratinized distal hair shaft into the softer, abnormally keratinized proximal hair shaft. Intussusception of the distal hair shaft into the proximal hair shaft results in a distinctive ball-and-socket hair shaft deformity. The affected hairs are brittle and breakage is common, resulting in short hairs.|$|E
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a member}} of the keratin gene family. As a type II hair keratin, it is a basic protein which heterodimerizes with type I keratins to form hair and nails. The type II hair keratins are {{clustered}} in a region of chromosome 12q13 and are grouped into two distinct subfamilies based on structure similarity. One subfamily, consisting of KRTHB1 (KRT81), KRTHB3 (KRT83, this protein), and KRTHB6 (KRT86), is highly related. The other less-related subfamily includes KRTHB2 (KRT82), KRTHB4 (KRT84), and KRTHB5 (KRT85). All hair keratins are expressed in the hair follicle; this hair keratin, as well as KRTHB1 and KRTHB6, is found primarily in the <b>hair</b> <b>cortex.</b>|$|E

Approximately 100 KRTAP genes have been identified in humans to date, with each of the genes classified into a number of families based on their sequence homology {{and the nature of the}} repeat structures. The biophysical features of KRTAPs, however, have remained largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of the human KRTAP 2 family members at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels. We initially found that these genes had various size polymorphisms that were mainly due to differences in the length of the 3 ′-noncoding sequences. Reverse transcriptase–PCR experiments further detected the presence of KRTAP 2 transcripts in plucked human hairs. Using indirect immunofluorescence with an anti-KRTAP 2 antibody, we found that there was a predominant expression of the KRTAP 2 proteins in the keratinizing zone of the human <b>hair</b> shaft <b>cortex.</b> In addition, we showed that the KRTAP 2 proteins interacted with each other and preferentially bound to hair keratins, but not to epithelial keratins.

Our results further enhance the crucial roles of KRTAPs in hair shaft keratinization in humans...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCharacterization of the {{molecular}} pathways controlling differentiation and proliferation in mammalian hair follicles {{is central to}} our understanding of the regulation of normal hair growth, the basis of hereditary hair loss diseases, and the origin of follicle-based tumors. We demonstrate that the proto-oncogeneWnt 3,which encodes a secreted paracrine signaling molecule, is expressed in developing and mature hair follicles and that its overexpression in transgenic mouse skin causes a short-hair phenotype due to altered differentiation of hair shaft precursor cells, and cyclical balding resulting from hair shaft structural defects and associated with an abnormal profile of protein expression in the hair shaft. A putative effector molecule for WNT 3 signaling, the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled 2 (DVL 2), is normally present at high levels in a subset of cells in the outer root sheath and in precursor cells of the <b>hair</b> shaft <b>cortex</b> and cuticle which lie immediately adjacent toWnt 3 -expressing cells. Overexpression ofDvl 2 in the outer root sheath mimics the short-hair phenotype produced by overexpression ofWnt 3,supporting the hypothesis thatWnt 3 andDvl 2 have the potential to act in the same pathway in the regulation of hair growth. These experiments demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for WNT signaling in the control of hair growth and structure, as well as presenting the first example of a mammalian phenotype resulting from overexpression of aDvlgene and providing an accessiblein vivosystem for analysis of mammalian WNT signaling pathways...|$|R

Hence, the morphological structure of rabbit hair was investigated again in this study, using optical microscopy and the scanning electron microscopy. The basic shape of the <b>hair</b> scale, the <b>cortex</b> distribution and the medulla of different fineness were studied. It was founded that no medulla existed when the diameter was less than 10 um. When the fiber diameter was between 10 um and 20 um, there was normally one medulla layer.

40|$|During hair growth, {{cortical}} cells {{emerging from}} the proliferative follicle bulb rapidly undergo a differentiation program and synthesise large amounts of hair keratin proteins. To identify some of the controls that specify expression of hair genes we have defined the minimal promoter of the wool keratin intermediate filament gene K 2. 10. The region of this gene spanning nucleotides - 350 to + 53 was sufficient to direct expression of the lacZ gene to the follicle cortex of transgenic mice but deletion of nucleotides - 350 to - 150 led to a complete loss of promoter activity. When a four base substitution mutation was introduced into the minimal functional promoter at the binding site for lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF- 1), promoter activity in transgenic mice was decreased but specificity was not affected. To investigate the interaction of trans-acting factors within the minimal K 2. 10 promoter we performed DNase I footprinting analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In addition to LEF- 1, Sp 1, AP 2 -like and NF 1 -like proteins bound to the promoter. The Sp 1 and AP 2 -like proteins bound sequences flanking the LEF- 1 binding site whereas the NF 1 -like proteins bound closer to the transcription start site. We conclude that the LEF- 1 binding site is an enhancer element of the K 2. 10 promoter in the <b>hair</b> follicle <b>cortex</b> and that factors other than LEF- 1 regulate promoter tissue- and differentiation-specificity.

The change of morphological characteristic was observed through scanning electron microscope(SEM). The observation of the fine structure on hair surface by SEM showed the bleached hair had much damaged to hair cuticle, and some of cuticle surface were worn away. To investigate the chemical structural changes in hair keratin, the cross-sections of hair samples were directly analysed using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy(FT-IRM). The results showed the cysteic acid S=O band intensity was distinctively increased by performing the bleaching treatment. The cleavage of cystine was appeared to proceed primarily through the sulfur-sulfur (-S-S-) fission whereby cysteic acid was formed as a principal oxidation products.

Once the cuticle cells begin to differentiate they accumulate cysteine-rich granules in their cytoplasm but the identity of their constituent proteins has remained largely an enigma. In this report we show differential expression of a family of genes encoding cysteine-rich, glycine-rich keratins in the cuticle. Two clones of the sheep KAP 5 gene family were isolated: the KAP 5. 4 cDNA encodes a protein of 190 amino acids (Mr = 16, 936) containing 32 mol% cysteine, 26 mol% glycine and the partial KAP 5. 5 cDNA encodes a protein of at least 197 amino acids (Mr ≥ 17, 474) containing 29 mol% cysteine, 28 mol% glycine. The predicted amino acid sequences of the KAP 5 family show extensive sequence conservation and all the proteins are composed almost entirely of cysteine-rich and glycine-rich repeats. Each KAP 5 gene produces an ∼ 1. 5 - kb mRNA species but the KAP 5. 4 and KAP 5. 5 mRNA levels appear to be severalfold greater than the KAP 5. 1 mRNA. Comparative tissue in situ hybridizations reveal a positive correlation between the onset of expression and follicle depth.

40|$|The {{size of a}} hair {{follicle}} {{is thought to be}} determined by the volume of its dermal papilla. The volume of the dermal papilla depends on the number of cells it contains and on the volume of the extracellular matrix. To establish which of these two variables is related to differences in {{hair follicle}} size we performed a stereologic study on 235 hair follicles from different sites, including male facial skin (beard), female facial skin, and scalp. In facial follicles there was a strong correlation between the area of the <b>hair</b> <b>cortex</b> and the volume of the dermal papilla. The area of the <b>hair</b> <b>cortex</b> also correlated with the number of cells in the dermal papilla and with the volume of dermal papilla per cell. In scalp hair follicles, where there was a smaller range of sizes, the correlations between these variables were weaker. In large male facial follicles the mean total dermal papilla volume was almost 40 -fold higher than in vellus follicles from female facial skin. This difference was associated with a mean 17 -fold greater number of cells in the dermal papilla and a 2. 4 -fold greater volume associated with each cell. Intermediate results were obtained in scalp follicles. In many regions of the skin hair follicles enlarge in response to androgens during adult life hair. Our results imply that the increase in the volume of the dermal papilla in these follicles is due to {{an increase in the number}} of cells, either through proliferation or through the migration of cells from the follicular dermal sheath, and to an increase in the amount of extracellular matrix per cell. As androgens are thought to act primarily on the dermal papilla, these changes may have a direct bearing on the mechanism of androgen-mediated alterations in hair follicle size...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} a better method to image hair as the current methods involve {{embedding}} the hair in resin, which may produce artefacts, or using dyes which are limited in their depth of penetration into the hair. The research performed in this thesis endeavours to characterise the cellular structure of human hair with label-free imaging using autofluorescence and fluorescence lifetime imaging. Wavelengths were shown to selectively excite the <b>hair</b> cuticle, <b>cortex</b> and medulla, and subcellular compartments. Development of an optical transverse imaging method enabled discoveries including different fluorescence lifetimes across the cuticle cell layers and suggests the cuticle layers possess differing chemical environments. A new method was developed to distinguish between eumelanin and pheomelanin using 405 nm and 633 nm wavelengths. The newly developed methods were additionally used in the characterisation of an unidentified hair and skin disorder, which found poorly differentiated cuticle cells and showed differences in the fluorescence lifetimes of the hair compared to control hairs. The hair care industry needs more efficacious chemical depilatories and information into their action. This was elucidated using the developed methods and a new dynamic imaging method. Potassium thioglycolate was shown to cause drastic expansion of the hair which was amplified by the addition of guanidine carbonate, creating fissures through the cuticle and into the cortex. Other experimental depilatory formulations were tested and were found to have varying effects upon the structure of the hair. New chemical depilatories require development because existing depilatories can cause irritation in the skin. Potassium thioglycolate and guanidine carbonate were tested on HaCaT cells, isolated cornified envelopes, and HEKn cells in a 3 D epidermal model. An investigation into the differentiation, proliferation and acute stress response of the cells showed that the treatments had no significant effect on these markers. However, the chemicals negatively affected HaCaT cell viability and damaged the cornified envelopes.

5000|$|Hot roots is a {{term used}} by hair stylists to explain the {{condition}} brought about by applying an artificial pigment to the hair, whereby the roots (the sections of the hair follicles closest to the scalp) are noticeably warmer in color (more red/orange) than {{the ends of the}} hair. This can happen for a few reasons, but the two most likely causes are explained below.It is helpful to understand the general nature of the lightening, or [...] "lifting", of natural hair color. The color of natural hair is determined by the melanin present. Generally, the more melanin, the darker the hair. In order for the color of hair to be lightened, a chemical must penetrate the cuticle of the <b>hair,</b> enter the <b>cortex</b> and destroy the melanin. Permanent hair color, bleach and other decolorants can do this to varying degrees.Permanent hair color, unlike bleach and other decolorants, leaves behind an artificial pigment while destroying the natural pigment. This pigment is a mix of the primary colors: blue, red and yellow. The chemical reaction that occurs within the hair follicle during a color-lightening process, in essence, destroys the natural melanin as well as the blue, red and yellow hues, respectively, one at a time. The extent to which this occurs can be affected by the proportion of chemicals present, especially hydrogen peroxide, {{as well as by the}} temperature at which the hair is kept during the process. Artificial hair pigment, unlike natural hair pigment, cannot be lightened to a noticeable extent by other artificial hair color.|$|R

This imbalance disrupts the normal ordered array of these proteins in the cells of the <b>hair</b> <b>cortex</b> and leads to weakened fibres which are prematurely lost...|$|E
40|$|The role of liquid-crystalline (mesophase) {{structures}} in extra-cellular morphogenesis is widely recognized. This paper summarizes {{a model for}} the more unusual case of intra-cellular mesophases. In the nascent mammalian <b>hair</b> <b>cortex,</b> cell differentiation is correlated with different mesophase textures within tactoids that are composed of intermediate filaments (IFs), and which form by a concerted process of unit-length-filament (ULF) polymerization and phase separation. Nematic and double-twist textures arise from differences in mesogen orientation and length in apposed tactoids. The model explains features of mature structures such as the fibril-matrix ratios in different cell types. The rapidity of IF formation suggests that a sudden-transition equilibrium polymerization, involving a high-energy initiating species, obeying the same statistical model as several other biological transitions, may be involved. This leads to an appealing symmetry, with the key factor in both polymerization and mesophase stability being the retention of protein head-group entropy...|$|E
