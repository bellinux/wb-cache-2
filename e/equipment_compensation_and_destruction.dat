40|$|The direct {{connection}} to the network of thyristor rectifiers having cyclic pulsed loads can call for the installation of <b>equipment</b> for the <b>compensation</b> of the reactive power. Recently, the range of static <b>compensation</b> <b>equipment</b> offered by ACEC was considerably extended. For each specific application, there exists an optimal solution which depends on {{a certain number of}} criteria such as the load cycle, the short-circuit power level of the network, operating and maintenance requirements, etc. This article deals with the particular application to the CERNs proton synchrotron booster accelerator, for which a 6 MVA thyristor compensator was commissioned in June, 1979. After a general description of the particle accelerator and the required voltage characteristics, and after a discussion of the selection of the technical solution adopted, there follows a description of the <b>compensation</b> <b>equipment</b> installed <b>and</b> the results obtained.

40|$|In {{order to}} solve the {{optimization}} of distribution reactive <b>compensation</b> point <b>and</b> capacity, a double optimized model is proposed, which is suitable for reactive compensation optimization with random load distribution or random network structure. For the <b>compensation</b> position <b>and</b> capacity decision variables, the optimized model is described as two layers of optimization with constraint. The outer one is the capacity optimization at determined location, and the inlayer is the location optimization. By introducing Lagrange multiplier, the mixed integer nonlinear optimization is deduced to a linear {{one that can be}} easily solved by Gaussian elimination method. For illustration, an application of ten 10 kV rural feeders is utilized to show the feasibility of the double optimized model in solving the optimization of distribution reactive <b>compensation</b> point <b>and</b> capacity. Empirical results show that the model can give the optimized result for different number of capacitor installation, and the result with highest line loss decrement will be used as the final decision.

30|$|It {{would be}} fair to say that many of the ideas upon which the {{foundations}} of the Flexible Alternating Current Transmission Systems (FACTS) rest, evolved over a period of several decades, building on the experience gained in the areas of High Voltage Direct Transmission (HVDC) <b>and</b> reactive power <b>compensation</b> <b>equipment,</b> methods <b>and</b> operational control. Nonetheless, FACTS, as an integrated philosophy, was a concept brought to fruition at EPRI in the 1980 ’s [1, 2]. Since that time, many great breakthroughs have taken place in the area of power electronics encompassing new valves, control methods and converter topologies [3, 4]. The new developments have been incorporated into the fields of FACTS and HVDC, giving rise to a new generation of power transmission equipment in either AC or DC form, with unrivalled operational flexibility [5].|$|R
40|$|CHDS State/LocalCurrent {{estimates}} {{predict that}} 30 - 40 {{percent of the}} population will be infected with the flu virus during a pandemic. Fire departments should anticipate a higher attack rate for their personnel because of increased exposure risk. Additionally, many variables will negatively influence fire fighter participation rates over and above these attack rates. This thesis analyzes fire fighters' ability and willingness to participate in a pandemic through a comprehensive survey of fire fighters within the twelve National Capital Region fire departments. Issues that may influence fire fighters' ability and willingness to work include childcare, concern of family, adequate personal protective <b>equipment,</b> worker's <b>compensation</b> coverage, <b>and</b> availability of vaccines and antivirals. Collectively, these variables determine a workforce participation percentage (WPP) - the share of fire fighters who will be able and willing to participate in a response during a pandemic. Results indicate that between 30 - 70 percent of the fire fighters will not be able or willing to work during a pandemic. Although a fire fighter's participation is situationally dependent, fire departments should take urgent steps to address five core areas. These are included in a set of recommendations. Ultimately, the priority recommendation is for fire officials and regional public policymakers to rise to the challenge of the complexity of these issues. Leadership {{in the face of this}} recognized pandemic threat, however, remains an elusive solution. Arlington County (VA) Fire Department author (civilian) ...|$|R

Then the arc suppression coil inductance values are modulated to make the zero-sequence current of fault line changed, at the same time, the zero-sequence current value is detected and its change will be captured to select the fault line.
