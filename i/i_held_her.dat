One of my knees, I think the left went into the water. This pissed me {{off a little bit}} and I opened my knife, it was in my left hand and I stabbed Lauren in {{the left side of the}} neck. I said in my interview that it was the right side of the neck with my right hand but I am been thinking since. It wasn't my right thumb which was cut but my left. After a couple of seconds after I stabbed her she stopped moving." ...|$|E
2500|$|Escaping to Parma, Casanova {{entered into}} a three-month affair with a Frenchwoman he named [...] "Henriette", perhaps the deepest love he ever experienced—a woman who {{combined}} beauty, intelligence, and culture. In his words, [...] "They who believe that a woman is incapable of making a man equally happy all the twenty-four {{hours of the day}} have never known an Henriette. The joy which flooded my soul was far greater when I conversed with her during the day than when <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> in my arms at night. Having read a great deal and having natural taste, Henriette judged rightly of everything." [...] She also judged Casanova astutely. As noted Casanovist J. Rives Childs wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know her}} every {{weakness}}, and, weakness and strength and all, I love her as madly as I loved {{her at the}} first, in those mad moments when <b>I</b> first <b>held</b> <b>her</b> in my arms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{your wife}} is very good. I knew her before you did, Mr. Cawood; <b>I</b> have <b>held</b> <b>her</b> in my arms {{when she was a}} baby, and have known her well up till now when she is having babies of her own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She wants Flora." [...] Mrs. Grose might, as I {{gave it to}} her, fairly {{have fallen}} away from me had I not been prepared. <b>I</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> there, to show I was. [...] "As I've told you, however, it doesn't matter." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{stood up}} too and faced me. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} {{and looked into}} her eyes.|$|E
60|$|She seemed shy, at once {{very near}} and very remote. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hand awkwardly until the {{carriage}} stopped.|$|E
60|$|We {{exchanged}} no greetings. She slid {{from her}} saddle into my arms, {{and for one}} instant <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{will grant}} Gallipolis as to her costume, but firmly to Seville or Valladolid <b>I</b> am <b>held</b> by <b>her</b> eyes; castanets, balconies, mantillas, serenades, ambuscades, escapades--all these their dark depths guaranteed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush," [...] <b>I</b> answered, and <b>held</b> <b>her,</b> fearing <b>I</b> {{knew not}} what, [...] "you have not lacked courage. It {{is not so}} bad as you believe. I will devise a plan and help you. Have you money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was not my}} {{experience}} of her at school," [...] Emily rejoined. [...] "At the same time I don't know what may have happened since those days. I may perhaps have lost the place <b>I</b> once <b>held</b> in <b>her</b> regard." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> {{tightly in}} my arms. The {{memory of that}} moment might have to last me all my life.|$|E
60|$|Now but for {{the respect}} in which <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her,</b> I could have taken the pretty Duchesse {{in my arms and}} kissed her.|$|E
60|$|I {{opened my}} arms, {{and she fell}} into them, and <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> close to my heart, and I covered her with kisses.... I covered her mouth and eyes and neck with kisses.|$|E
50|$|After her husband's {{death on}} 2 January 1861, Elisabeth lived quietly at her seats at Sanssouci, Charlottenburg, and Stolzenfels and {{dedicated}} herself to charity work {{in memory of}} her late husband. Her brother-in-law, Emperor Wilhelm <b>I</b> of Germany, <b>held</b> <b>her</b> in high regard as a true friend.|$|R
6000|$|An {{hour or more}} {{must have}} passed, when, putting the glass over her lips again, I saw no mark on it. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> it closer and closer. I dulled it accidentally with my own breath, and cleaned it. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> it over <b>her</b> again. Oh, Mary, Mary, the doctor was right! I ought to have only thought of you in heaven! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{drive it}} is." [...] Captain Davenport {{evidenced}} his intention of descending to the deck. [...] "We've missed Mangareva. God {{knows where the}} next land is. <b>I</b> wish I'd <b>held</b> <b>her</b> up that other half-point," [...] he confessed a moment later. [...] "This cursed current plays the devil with a navigator." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hands. [...] "It is Father Adrian who {{is sending}} you away," [...] I cried passionately. [...] "He is my enemy. I hate him! Why should you obey him? Stay with me! Do, do stay!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Swift I {{sprang from}} my hiding-place [...] And held the fairest fast; [...] <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> fast, the sweet, strange thing: [...] Her comrades skirled, {{but they all}} took wing, [...] And smote me as they passed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> tighter. [...] "You {{like them}} with the spirit to be naughty?" [...] Then, keeping pace with her answer, [...] "So do I!" [...] I eagerly brought out. [...] "But not to the degree to contaminate--" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{there was}} one wildly sweet moment in which I had the blissful {{certainty}} that she kissed me of her own accord. She was abashed, yet yielding; she let herself go, yet seemed not utterly unstrung. Perhaps <b>I</b> was rough, <b>held</b> <b>her</b> too hard, for she cried out a little.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned to}} the drawer in which I had espied the rough monks' habits, and pulling one out <b>I</b> <b>held</b> it for <b>her</b> to don. She sat there now, in that garment of coarse black cloth, the cowl flung back upon her shoulder, the fairest {{postulate}} that ever entered upon a novitiate.|$|R
500|$|There {{was this}} one time where I {{had to take a}} blind lady across the street and I’d never done that before. I took her hand which is so {{obviously}} wrong! You don’t take a stranger’s hand! Like a 45-year-old woman! But once you take someone’s hand you can’t just let go because then you’re admitting your own awkwardness. <b>I</b> just <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hand {{and in the middle of}} the street she turns around and is like, ‘Do you mind if we don’t hold hands.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> arm. I didn't {{know then}} she was as strong as I was. [...] "Don't go," [...] I said imploringly. [...] "They will {{certainly}} kill you. It {{would be impossible to}} stem a mob like this one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confusion to him!" [...] I broke out, driving one heel {{deep into}} the fir needles; and when Grace checked me, laying both hands on her shoulders, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> fast as I asked, [...] "And what did you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{there was}} no sign of Queen Tera! I took Margaret by the hand and led her over. She reluctantly left her father to whom she was administering, but she came docilely enough. I whispered to her as <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hand: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{left the}} logger's camp voluntarily, {{of her own}} free will, and doubtless for some reason that seemed {{sufficient}} to her. She abandoned me--if I may so express myself--left my care, relieved me of the responsibility <b>I</b> <b>held</b> towards <b>her</b> relatives"--he continued, with the first suggestion of personal apology in his tones--"without a word of previous intimation. Possibly she might have got tired of waiting for me. I was absent two weeks. It was the tenth day after my departure that she left the logger's hut." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, I looked {{round and}} saw the {{disturbed}} beetles and spiders running away over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door. <b>I</b> still <b>held</b> <b>her</b> forcibly down with all my strength, like a prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or why we had struggled, or {{that she had been}} in flames, or that the flames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I {{should have}} had to support her," [...] he said, as he walked towards Briarmains, [...] "and it is she who has made me strong. That look of pity, that gentle touch! No down was ever softer, no elixir more potent! It lay like a snowflake; it thrilled like lightning. A {{thousand}} times I have longed to possess that hand--to have it in mine. I have possessed it; for five minutes <b>I</b> <b>held</b> it. <b>Her</b> fingers and mine can never be strangers more. Having met once they must meet again." ...|$|R
60|$|With cautious, loving fingers I undid its folds. Under {{cover of}} the {{darkness}} the sweet and modest creature, released of her bonds, turned for an instant to me, and for a few, very few, happy seconds <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> in my arms.|$|E
60|$|And so, {{sitting there}} hand in hand, {{we waited for}} the dawn, {{speaking}} many sad and tender words to one another; and at last, when we parted, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> once more unresisting to my breast, thinking, as she did, that our separation would be an eternal one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I declare," [...] said I, [...] "I {{never saw}} such a wife. I don't think she loves {{her husband at}} all. Here, Richard, take my child, for goodness' sake." [...] But <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> tight all the while, and could have wept over her I don't know how long.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hate you!" [...] cries <b>I,</b> and <b>held</b> <b>her</b> firm. [...] "You blind lass, {{can you not}} see {{a little}} in my wretched heart? Do you think when I set there, reading in that fool-book that I have just burned and be damned to it, I take ever the least thought of any {{stricken}} thing but just yourself? Night after night I could have grat to see you sitting there your lone. And what was I to do? You are here under my honour; would you punish me for that? Is it for that that you would spurn a loving servant?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Hatfield House is {{the seat}} of the Cecil family, the Marquesses of Salisbury. Elizabeth Tudor was {{confined}} there for three years in what is now known as [...] "The Old Palace" [...] in Hatfield Park. Legend has it that it was here in 1558, while sitting under an oak tree in the Park, that she learned that she had become Queen following the death of her half-sister, Queen Mary <b>I.</b> She <b>held</b> <b>her</b> first Council in the Great Hall (The Old Palace) of Hatfield. In 1851, the route of the Great North Road (now the A1000) was altered to avoid cutting through the grounds of Hatfield House.|$|R
6000|$|... "So! But {{on other}} {{moonlight}} nights, when the sadness {{and the silence}} have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could--I have imagined her as coming {{to me in my}} cell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that <b>I</b> never <b>held</b> <b>her</b> in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door. But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?" ...|$|R
