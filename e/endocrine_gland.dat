5|$|The thyroid gland, {{or simply}} the thyroid, is an <b>endocrine</b> <b>gland</b> in the neck, {{consisting}} of two lobes connected by an isthmus. It is found {{at the front of}} the neck, below the Adam's apple. The thyroid gland secretes thyroid hormones, which primarily influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis. The hormones also have many other effects including those on development. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are created from iodine and tyrosine. The thyroid also produces the hormone calcitonin, which plays a role in calcium homeostasis.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} twenty-two, on {{graduating from}} Cambridge, Hutchinson {{traveled}} to Italy on a Rockefeller Higher Education Fellowship {{to work at the}} Stazione Zoologica. He was interested in doing research on the branchial gland of the octopus. He wanted to establish endocrine function in higher invertebrates. He thought that the branchial gland was the <b>endocrine</b> <b>gland</b> in the octopus, but an octopus shortage put an end to his research. He returned to Italy many times for Italian art, folklore, and to study his Italian ancestry.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines cause a {{decrease}} in norepinephrine (noradrenaline), serotonin, acetylcholine, and dopamine. These neurotransmitters are needed for normal memory, mood, muscle tone and coordination, emotional responses, <b>endocrine</b> <b>gland</b> secretions, heart rate, and blood pressure control. With chronic benzodiazepine use, tolerance develops rapidly to most of its effects, so that, when benzodiazepines are withdrawn, various neurotransmitter systems go into overdrive {{due to the lack}} of inhibitory GABA-ergic activity. Withdrawal symptoms then emerge as a result, and persist until the nervous system physically reverses the adaptions (physical dependence) that have occurred in the CNS.|$|E
40|$|Since it {{has been}} {{established}} that the <b>endocrine</b> <b>glands</b> are essential for growth, {{an understanding of the}} morphological and physiological activities of these glands during the process of development of the embryo becomes important. The <b>endocrine</b> <b>glands</b> compose a system which functions as a regulator in maintaining a balance of the physiological processes of living protoplasm. At present there is little information regarding the exact time in embryological development when the hormones of the various <b>endocrine</b> <b>glands</b> become available for use by the organism. Therefore, it is {{the purpose of this paper}} to correlate the morphological and known physiological activities of some of the developing <b>endocrine</b> <b>glands</b> of the chick embryo...|$|R

25|$|The catecholamines {{comprise}} the endogenous substances dopamine, noradrenaline (norepinephrine) and adrenaline (epinephrine) {{as well as}} numerous artificially synthesized compounds such as isoprenaline. Their investigation constitutes a prominent chapter {{in the history of}} physiology, biochemistry and pharmacology. Adrenaline was the first hormone extracted from its <b>endocrine</b> <b>gland</b> and obtained in pure form, before the word hormone was coined. It was also the first hormone the structure and biosynthesis of which were clarified. Apart from acetylcholine, adrenaline and noradrenaline were the first neurotransmitters to be discovered and the first intercellular biochemical signals to be found in intracellular vesicles. The β-adrenoceptor was the first G protein-coupled receptor the gene of which was cloned.|$|E

A 1901 episode {{kept him in}} Boston City Hospital for a week, and Southard said {{he was diagnosed with}} [...] "acute brain tire". A similar event several years later was diagnosed as vascular neurosis. According to Gay, a physical examination several months before Southard's death may have indicated an <b>endocrine</b> <b>gland</b> problem, but no specific condition was diagnosed.|$|E

2500|$|René Descartes {{believed}} the pineal gland {{to be the}} [...] "principal seat of the soul".

2500|$|The pineal gland, {{also known}} as the conarium or {{epiphysis}} cerebri, is a small <b>endocrine</b> <b>gland</b> in the vertebrate brain. The pineal gland produces melatonin, a serotonin derived hormone which modulates sleep patterns in both circadian and seasonal cycles.The shape of the gland resembles a pine cone, hence its name. [...] The pineal gland is located in the epithalamus, {{near the center of the}} brain, between the two hemispheres, tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pancreas}} [...] is a glandular organ in {{the digestive}} system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, {{it is located}} in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. [...] It is an <b>endocrine</b> <b>gland</b> producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide, all of which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing bicarbonate to neutralize acidity of chyme moving in from the stomach, as well as digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is known as a mixed gland.|$|E
