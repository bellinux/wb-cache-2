40|$|The {{winemaking}} process generates many by-products besides wastewater, mainly <b>grape</b> <b>marcs,</b> <b>grape</b> stalks, {{and wine}} lees. Anaerobic digestion is particularly suitable to treat winery waste {{because of its}} high content of nutrient-rich organic matter and for its noticeable energetic potential. To date, only results from mesophilic tests have been extensively reported. In this study, potential methane production and kinetic constants were determined by batch trials under thermophilic conditions and compared with mesophilic values already reported in literature. <b>Grape</b> <b>marcs</b> and wine lees {{appeared to be the}} most promising substrates with an estimated potential of 0. 34 and 0. 37 Nm 3 CH 4 /kgVSfed, respectively, while grape stalks generated only 0. 13 Nm 3 CH 4 /kgVSfed. In order to assess the feasibility of a continuous anaerobic digestion process, a lab-scale semi-continuous reactor was constructed. Because of the consumption of buffer capacity, the biological process was difﬁcult to control. On the other hand, biogas was produced when working with a hydraulic retention time of 40 d and with previously fermented grape marcs; a speciﬁc biogas production of 0. 29 Nm 3 /kgVSfed was observed. The results of the continuous tests were used to calculate the potential energy recovery from <b>grape</b> <b>marcs</b> produced in Italy (808 thousands of tons per year) in terms of heat and electricity; about 245 GWh of heat and 201 GWh of electricity per annum could be generated in Italian scenario...|$|R
40|$|<b>Grape</b> <b>marcs</b> are a {{by-product}} of winemaking {{that can be used}} for production of Grappa, a traditional Italian spirit. This plant material needs to undergo a fermentation process before distillation to allow production of ethanol from residual sugar and volatile aromatic compounds. To study the possible effect of selected yeast inocula on the fermentation process and subsequent quality of the distillate, a laboratory-scale fermentation of <b>grape</b> <b>marcs</b> was performed. The inoculated yeasts proved to be good colonizers of grape pomace and contributed markedly to rapid sugar consumption, which was completed within 5 days.

One hundred and eighty non-Saccharomyces yeasts and two hundred and twenty Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were screened for the production of extracellular amylases, cellulases, lipases, pectinases, proteases and xylanases. Two non-Saccharomyces strains were found effective for the hydrolysis of cellulose and starch while eleven S. cerevisiae isolates were described as proficient pectinase producers. For the first time, thirteen S. cerevisiae strains, potentially able to use starch as the sole carbon source, were reported and their potential amylolytic phenotype was found to be related to a non extracellular alphaamylase.

40|$|The wine {{industry}} {{represents one of}} the most important agro-industrial activities in Mediterranean area. Particularly, in Italy, every year, about 40 millions hectolitre of wine is produced, generating a big yield of organic residual as <b>grape</b> <b>marcs</b> and stalks. Today only the <b>grape</b> <b>marcs</b> are valorised in the distillery for alcohol extraction, but the winery’s remuneration for this product is relatively low in respect of transportation’s costs. Furthermore, not valorised winery waste are spread on the land or land filled, generating a strong environmental impact and representing cost for the company. In order to reduce both the effects, an energy valorisation of winery organic residual has been investigated. Experiments have been carried out to evaluate bio-methane potential of white and red <b>grape</b> <b>marcs</b> and stalks produce in a winery in Latium (Italy). Preliminary tests carried out to evaluate a possible valorisation of the winery organic wastes for biogas production demonstrated as the utilization of <b>grape</b> <b>marcs</b> for bio-methane production is feasible. Starting from this experience a laboratory scale batch system, constituted by 8 reactors, was specifically set up in order to perform an in depth analyses of grape-waste-performance in respect of their possible utilisation as energy production (bio-gas) source. A continuous and systematic monitoring of gas production and digestate product characteristics, adopting specialised control hardware and software architectures, was developed in order to perform a continuous monitoring of the process parameters through the utilisation of specific sensors and dedicated logging software tools. The study of the correlations existing between chemical and physical index values (e. g. pH, COD, Ammonia) affecting the evolution of biological processes and biogas production, as well as the occurrence of possible inhibition phenomena, was also carried out. The results of this study have been finalised to build a “full controlled” pilot-scale unit, optimised in terms of digestion unit architecture, sensing probes characteristics, detected parameters collection and data acquisition sequence, to be systematically utilised to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach when applied to different grape marks coming from different “not pre-treated” species of vitis vinifera wastes.

Trace metals analysis was performed by derivative stripping chronopotentiometry which allowed to detect concentrations lower than 1 ngg- 1. The obtained data gave evidence that the levels of Mn and Zn in wines from plots treated with zoxamide-mancozeb were about 3 -fold higher than those observed in the control. Wines treated with Cu oxychloride presented a significant increase of Cu (II) concentrations with respect to the control; in particular samples from 2004 showed a Cu amount increased by 50 %. Furthermore, as shown in a previous paper, the studied fungicides treatments lead to a moderate increase in Pb (II) and Cd (II) levels in treated samples with respect to the control. Wines from 2004 presented higher Cu and Pb amounts than wines from 2003; the concentration of all the other metals is similar. The statistical elaboration of the obtained data by LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) and Kruskal-Wallis test has confirmed that both zoxamide-mancozeb treatments and copper oxychloride treatments exerted a significant influence on Mn (II), Zn (II) Cu (II), Pb (II) and Cd (II) concentrations in wines, <b>grapes,</b> <b>marcs</b> and <b>grape</b> stalks samples from both the studied vintages...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{increasing}} {{attention has been}} devoted to the production of bioethanol from lignocellulose, as cheap and abundant feedstock. The process requires a pretreatment of biomass, which may involve the formation of inhibitory compounds. Many works report on ethanol production from biomass hydrolysates, but only few focus on the selection of yeasts able to both tolerate inhibitors and ferment with high yield. In this work an isolation program from oenological environments (<b>grape</b> <b>marcs)</b> started in order to select new yeasts for the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Marcs were incubated with or without a cocktail of inhibitors at 30 and 40 °C. At regular intervals marcs were collected and, after appropriate decimal dilutions, plated on agar dishes with and without inhibitors. More than 500 strains were isolated and genetically identified by ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) sequencing. Much effort was spent to identify yeasts belonging to Saccharomyces cerevisae, the most promising candidate for bioethanol production. S. cerevisiae strains were screened for their ability to grow in industrial medium containing increasing inhibitors concentrations and few isolates showed high tolerance to organic acids and furans.

40|$|Lignocellulosic biomass, {{abundant}} and low-cost material, has the great {{potential to be}} exploited for ethanol production. However, lignocellulose pre-treatments are needed to provide simple sugars to fermenting microorganism. Some of the pre-treatments result in by-products inhibiting the following fermentation step; additionally, during the process, the fermenting microbes could be subjected to other stresses, such as high ethanol concentrations, pH and temperature fluctuations. As a result, robust yeasts showing tolerance to inhibitors and high temperature, are desirable. This study focused on the isolation and selection of Issatchenkia orientalis strains exhibiting these traits. One hundred and fifty I. orientalis yeasts were isolated from <b>grape</b> <b>marcs</b> incubated at 40 °C {{in the presence of}} high levels of weak acids and furans.

The most promising yeasts have been studied for their fermentative abilities in minimal medium supplemented with glucose (200 g/L) and an inhibitors cocktail.

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} has been recently devoted {{to the production of}} bioethanol from lignocellulosic biomass. However, lignocellulose is expensive to process because of the need for costly pre-treatments and large dosages of commercial enzymes. Moreover, lignocellulose pre-treatment results in the formation of inhibitors affecting the following fermentation phase. Although ethanol production from pretreated lignocellulose has been widely described (Hamelinck et al., 2005), only limited efforts have been spent on selecting yeasts able to both tolerate inhibitors and ferment sugars (Lindén et al., 1991; Favaro et al., 2012). This study aimed at the isolation, characterization and selection of robust yeasts suitable for the lignocellulose-to-bioethanol route. While the majority of related researches has focused on isolating yeasts from first generation bioethanol and/or wine industrial plants, this work specifically targets to yeasts capable of exhibiting their dominance once challenged by multiple environmental stress all at once. To this purpose, <b>grape</b> <b>marcs</b> were selected as extreme environment because of its limited nutrients, exposure to solar radiation, temperature fluctuations and ethanol (Favaro et al., 2013 a). <b>Grape</b> <b>marcs,</b> collected, immediately after crushing, from a winery, were left at 30 and 40 °C for seven days, afterwards samples have been incubated at both temperatures in fermenting bottles containing 100 mL YNB (Yeast Nitrogen Base) broth supplemented with 100 g/L glucose, 50 g/L xylose and a cocktail of inhibitors (aliphatic acids, furans and aldehydes). Microbial biomass fluctuations together with ethanol and by-products concentrations have been monitored by means of microbiological techniques and HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) analysis. As soon as ethanol productions and biomass concentrations reached reasonable levels, samples of each fermenting bottles were aseptically transferred in fresh YNB formulated with the same sugars composition but with higher levels of inhibitors. After three month experimental activities, the evolved yeast populations were able to grow quite fast in the presence of elevated inhibitors concentrations exhibiting promising ethanol yields. Moreover, microbiological quantitative and qualitative analyses, performed {{at the beginning of the}} experiment and periodically throughout all the transfers, gave a fascinating picture of population dynamics as well as of yeast species dominance in such hostile environment. At 30 °C, the majority of the isolates capable of withstanding osmotic, ethanol and inhibitors stress belonged to Saccharomyces cerevisiae while, at 40 °C, the dominant species revealed to be Issatchenkia orientalis. On the other hand, when higher inhibitor levels were added, lower consistency of I. orientalis was detected in favour of S. cerevisiae. The isolated yeasts were then screened for their fermentative abilities in minimal medium as well as for their inhibitors tolerance as described by Favaro et al. (2013 b). Interestingly, many S. cerevisiae strains exhibited very high ethanol yields also at 40 °C and displayed strong abilities to tolerate weak acids, furans and aldehydes. The preliminary results of this study indicate that the obtained microbial collection is a promising platform towards the development of robust and efficiently fermenting microbes suitable for the industrial processing of lignocellulosic biomass into ethanol...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the composition and dynamics of <b>grape</b> <b>marc</b> bacterial populations during the long-period storage by microbiological analyses of acidified and untreated marcs. Eight bacterial species were identified by ARDRA — 16 s rRNA sequencing at the beginning of the fermentation. Among them the bacterial species of Tatumella terrea, Acetobacter ghanensis and Tatumella ptyseos were identified for the first time in a wine environment. In later stages Oenococcus oeni and members of the Lactobacillus plantarum group became dominant in acidified and non-acidified <b>grape</b> <b>marc,</b> respectively. Further molecular typing of L. plantarum isolates yielded 39 strains. To explain the prevalence of L. plantarum in untreated samples, all strains were tested for potential antimicrobial activity and for biofilm formation ability. Although no antimicrobial activity was found, many strains exhibited the ability to form a biofilm, which may confer an ecological advantage to these strains and their dominance during marc storage...|$|E

40|$|Aims: Grappa is {{a typical}} Italian product {{obtained}} from the distillation of <b>grape</b> <b>marcs,</b> the main by-product of grape crushing. One technological treatment frequently performed on marcs is their acidification, in order to contrast the development of unwanted spoilage bacteria during the storage period needed for alcoholic fermentation. A pilot-scale experiment was set-up to study the dynamics of yeast populations during a 30 -day fermentation of acidified and nonacidified Prosecco grape pomace. Methods and Results: Saccharomyces cerevisiae population, examined after 4 and 15 days of storage by mitochondrial DNA-RFLP analysis, resulted considerably different at strain level upon acidification. In particular, {{although the number of}} different strains rescued appeared particularly high in both kind of marcs compared with what happens in must fermentation, in the acidified material such number tends to moderately decrease during storage. Conclusions: Results obtained evidence that the acidification treatment did not influence yeast population neither in terms of number of cells nor in terms of biodiversity at species level. Therefore, such treatment can be used in distillery without negatively influencing ethanol production. Significance and Impact of Study: Even though some data are available on the effects of technological treatments on the chemical composition of the distillate, no microbiological studies have been published so far on the consequence of these practices on composition, biodiversity and evolution of yeast population. © 2011 The Authors.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{anaerobic}} treatment of <b>grape</b> <b>marcs.</b> In this work we tested two varieties of wine. Veltlínské zelené and Zweigletrebe. Tests were {{carried out in the}} Republic reference laboratory at Mendel University in Brno under mesophilic anaerobic conditions for 24 days in 0. 003 m 3 reactors and for 26 day in 0. 120 m 3 reactors. Biogas production and methane content were monitored daily during the test. The measurement results of testing variety Veltlínské zelené were: Substance loads ratio 0. 496 kg. kg- 1 - specific production of biogas 0. 415 m 3. kg- 1, specific production of methane 0. 246 m 3. kg- 1 and average concentration of methane in biogas was 59. 3 %. Substance loads ratio 0. 099 kg. kg- 1 - specific production of biogas 0. 656 m 3. kg- 1, specific production of methane 0. 262 m 3. kg- 1 and average concentration of methane in biogas was 39. 8 %.

40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} {{the need for a}} {{low-cost}} ethanol production has stimulated the research on the one-step microbial conversion of agronomic wastes in biofuel. Yeast strain possessing the combination of polysaccharides utilisation and ethanol production properties could be very promising. Objectives: 1. Investigation of the extracellular enzymatic activity (EEA) profile of yeast strains previously selected for their optimal fermentative performance. 2. Selection of strains with the most interesting enzymatic profile to be used for further studies on bioethanol production from biomass. Methods: 220 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and 180 non-Saccharomyces strains were isolated from <b>grape</b> <b>marcs</b> {{on the basis of their}} fermentative vigour. Strains were screened for their activity on cellulose, hemicellulose, starch, pectin and protein. Results: Few strains showed activity on cellulose, pectin, starch and protein, while no xylanolytic strains were observed. Thirteen strains of S. cerevisiae, potentially able to use starch as the sole carbon source, were selected. Their weak growth on starch minimal agar plates was unexpected and suggests an extensive biochemical, physiological and genetic study on their amylolytic enzyme(s). Two non-Saccharomyces strains were selected for the production of cellulase and starchdegrading enzymes. Their enzymatic activity was monitored in liquid assays. Conclusions: The preliminary results encourages further studies on the EEA screening of oenological yeasts. Few strains, selected for their optimal fermentative ability, showed an improvable hydrolytic activity on complex polysaccharides (cellulose, starch, pectin), main components of low-cost agricultural residues. This approach represents a first step towards an interesting ethanol-production strategy through the development of a wild-type yeast, or a good starting base for the construction of recombinant strains, for the microbial conversion of biomass in biofuel...|$|R
