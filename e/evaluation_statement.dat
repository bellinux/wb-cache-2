Methods Ninety male youth players training in a professional club in Brazil were submitted to a soccer video test which consists in making tactical decisions when the image freezes. These participants were divided in five groups with 18 players in each of following age levels: Under- 11, Under- 13, Under- 15, Under- 17 and Under- 20. The dominant statements of verbal reports were distributed in categories that reflect key mechanisms. The frequency of correct tactical answers was calculated for each statement types and Standard Residuals (e) were calculated to verify the influence of the mechanisms on the quality of tactical decision for each age level. Results Results revealed that <b>evaluation</b> <b>statement</b> was related to accurate tactical decisions from Under- 15 age level. Conclusion In conclusion, evaluation of perceived information makes better decision makers...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} was to explore how {{principles}} of estimating validity and reliability of research instruments, as described in respected methodology textbooks, are satisfied. The initial parts of the paper delineate the theoretical framework and describe the concepts of validity and reliability. The following sections of the paper explain the process of analysis and its findings. The Journal of Educational Research {{was chosen as the}} research focus. A sample of 56 randomly selected articles from it has been inspected. The analysis revealed that a large majority (91 %) of research instruments used in these articles was scales and tests, the rest were questionnaires, observation schemes and interviews. Surprisingly, validity was calculated only with 26 of instruments; the rest of instruments were standardized tests or they were face-validated. As far as scales are concerned, construct validity was documented by means of factor analyses. Content validity and face validity were used in tests, questionnaires and interviews. We consider the infrequent use of combination of two sources ofvalidity (e. g., construct and concurrent or discriminant) to bea weak element in the validation processes in the sample of studies. Reliability was documented with 80 % of research instruments. The most frequent method of calculation was Cronbach’s alpha. Inter-rater reliability was used in observations and tests; test-retest reliability was used to control the stability of the pretest-posttest measuring instrument. The size of reliability coefβicients in most of studies exceeded 0. 80. Throughout the analysis it was corroborated that when judging validity and reliability one has tocritically consider the speciβic conditions of each research study before expressing an <b>evaluation</b> <b>statement...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{listening}} test {{which is}} applied to the national examination is designed similar to TOElC (Test of English for International Communication). It consists of four sections: <b>evaluation</b> <b>statement,</b> evaluation response, comprehension questions on dialogue and comprehensions on mini talks. Based on the students' tries-out are usually conducted in the writer's school before the national examination, she found that her students' scores are low in listening test. The students made mistakes in the listening section. Realizing the weaknesses of the students in comprehending the listening text, the writer argued to provide lessons which did not only improve students' listening comprehension but also increased listening scores. The writer proposed teaching listening using three stages of activities: pre-listening, while-listening and post-listening activities in which each stage provided listening strategies and skills. In pre-listening stage, the teacher started the lesson by brainstorming, discussing the listening-text which they listened to and asked questions related to the text. In the while-listening activities, the teacher gave a chance for students to do intensive listening and in the post-listening activities, the teachers helped students practice other language skills (speaking, reading and writing) by using the same topic. The objectives of the research were to know whether the three stage activities improve the students listening comprehension and to apply classroom action research as the design of the research. In conducting her study, the researcher took 30 students as the subjects of this study. Three instruments were used in this study: (1) teacher's observations given to her colleague to evaluate her teaching process, (2) students' questionnaires related to their problems in listening and (3) listening taken from part 4 of TOEIC. The observation was given to her colleagues before the teaching process; meanwhile, the two instruments were given to the students after the implementation of teaching listening through three stages. The result of this study showed that the three stage activities in teaching listening improved listening comprehension score of SMKN 8 students. However, the researcher realized that this technique is not the best one, she hopes that in the future there will be researches into teaching listening...|$|E

Nuclear Engineering Department during Spring Term 1988. Principal features of the resulting conceptual design include - use of unit trains (including piggyback cars for truck cask transporters where required) for periodic (once every ten years at each reactor) removal of old (cooled > 10 yrs.) spent fuel from at-reactor storage facilities - buffer storage at the repository site using dual purpose transportation/storage casks of the CASTOR V/ 21 type - repackaging of the spent fuel from the dual purpose transportation/storage casks directly into special-alloy disposal canisters as intact fuel assemblies, without rod consolidation - emplacement into a repository of modular design having a maximum total capacity of 150, 000 MT and an annual handling capability of 4000 MT/yr - use of excavation techniques that minimize disturbance, both mechanical and chemical,to the geologic environment - Incoloy 825 waste canisters arrayed to provide 57 kW/acre thermal loading optimized to the projected inventories - include a unit rail mounted vehicle for both the transportation and emplacement of the canister from the surface facilities to the underground repository - cost-effectiveness of the Yucca Mountain Site Criteria was studied via: a computer model, "WADCOM-II - Waste Disposal Cost Model II"; and an independent cost evaluation by the members of the design team. The total system cost (in constant 1988 dollars) was 1. 9 billion dollars by WADCOM-II, and 5. 3 billion dollars from the independent cost evaluation, resulting in a levelized disposal cost of 0. 2 mills/kW-hr by WADCOM-II and 0. 55 mills/kW-hr by the independent cost <b>evaluation.</b> <b>Statement</b> of responsibility on title-page reads: Report prepared by the following students enrolled in the combined graduate/undergraduate design subjects: 22. 033, Nuclear Systems Design 22. 33,- Nuclear Engineering Design for Spring Term 1988 : Julio L.

This article begins a discussion of roles, composition, and <b>evaluation</b> of <b>statements</b> of teaching philosophy. Teaching is a scholarly activity when it is purposeful, reflective, documented, and shared in an evaluative forum (Menges & Weimer, 1996). Articulating an individual teaching philosophy provides the foundation by which to clarify goals, to guide behavior, to seed scholarly dialogue on teaching, and to organize <b>evaluation.</b> <b>Statements</b> of teaching philosophy function both personally and publicly. A professor who writes a teaching philosophy wants to document beliefs, values, and approaches. It may be written to clarify or reflect on practice, to receive feedback from colleagues, or to articulate a view of teaching for administrative decision-making (Murray, 1995). Regardless of the purpose, the activity demonstrates a deep commitment to teaching and also to growing personally and professionally. An administration that asks its professors to record formally their teaching philosophies expresses a value for scholarly approaches to teaching and for working toward clearly articulated educational goals. Often professors present their teaching scholarship in a teaching portfolio (Hutchings, 1996; Murray, 1995; Lyons...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to present the {{differences}} between the opinions of prospective teachers and experienced, certified teachers concerning the relationship of the cognitive and affective dimensions to teacher evaluation. Comparisons were made with the total prospective-teacher responses and total established-teacher responses; elementary prospectiveteacher responses and elementary established-teacher responses; secondary prospective-teacher responses and secondary established-teacher responses; male prospective-teacher responses and male established-teacher responses; female prospective-teacher responses and female established-teacher responses; total male responses and total female responses; total prospective-teacher responses and responses of established teachers with three to nine years of experience; total prospective-teacher responses and responses of established teachers with ten or more years of experience. The study was limited to the prospective teachers enrolled in student teaching during the spring quarter, 1971, at Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana. It was further limitedin that only those experienced and certified educators teaching in schools which held membership in the Upper Wabash Valley School Study Council in Indiana were utilized. The population for the study was composed of 187 randomly-selected elementary and secondary student teachers from Ball State University and 200 randomly-selected elementary and secondary established teachers teaching in schools within the Upper Wabash Valley School Study Council. The instrument for the study was developed, based upon the review of literature, the opinions of selected established teachers, as well as the judgments from faculty in the Teachers College, Ball State University. An opinionnaire-questionnaire composed of predominantly cognitive and affective statements was then constructed. Sixteen null hypotheses were developed. Two-by-two contingency tables were constructed to enumerate the "yes"-"no" responses of the two groups to the affective and cognitive statements. Chi square was then applied to test the degree of significance between the responses of the prospective-teacher group and the established-teacher group.

Moreover, it eases {{the assessment of the}} systemâs reaction by providing customizable <b>evaluation</b> <b>statements</b> and functions. TTCN- 3, the Testing and Test Control Notation, already provides universal and powerful concepts to describe tests for discrete, message-based systems. However, software-based control systems that are used to control physical processes often show continuous quantities that can be only poorly stimulated and assessed by means of the currently available language constructs in TTCN- 3. In this article, we show how this problem can be solved by extending the TTCN- 3 language. We introduce an extension of TTCN- 3, namely TTCN- 3 embedded, that provides concepts and constructs that directly address the specification of tests for continuous and hybrid real time systems. The extension includes the notion of streams {{that can be used to}} represent continuous quantities over time. In addition, TTCN- 3 has been extended with the concepts of stream-based ports, sampling, equation systems, and with additional control flow structures. The concepts are integrated with standard TTCN- 3 and allow for defining test cases that handle continuous quantities, as well as discrete state changes and the exchange of messages within the same concept space.
