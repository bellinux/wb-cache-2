5|$|While the Crusades had causes <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> {{the social}} and {{political}} situations of 11th-century Europe, the event actually triggering the First Crusade was a request for assistance from Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Alexios was worried about the advances of the Seljuqs, who had reached as far west as Nicaea, not far from Constantinople. In March 1095, Alexios sent envoys to the Council of Piacenza to ask Pope Urban II for aid against the Turks.|$|E

As time passed, he began to emulate jazz and big band musicians Gene Krupa and Buddy Rich. In 1994, Peart became a friend and pupil of jazz instructor Freddie Gruber. It was during this time that Peart decided to revamp his playing style by incorporating jazz and swing components. Gruber was also responsible for introducing him to the products of Drum Workshop, the company whose products Peart currently endorses.|$|E

This is sanctioned by law, which {{automatically}} permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. Female genital mutilation is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and <b>deeply</b> <b>rooted</b> <b>in</b> tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among Arabs, Hadjarai, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the Sara (38%) and the Toubou (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, {{making it difficult for}} them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.|$|E

In  accordance with the evolution of information technology, a full of  metaphoric phenomena and codes within Feng-shui and postmodern  architecture is able to visualize by means of computational knowledge.   This gives a flexible knowledge-based system to trigger captivating  concepts, which are seeds of creative thought. ...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary proliferating Green {{movements}} <b>deeply</b> <b>roots</b> <b>in</b> {{the process}} of globalization and neoliberal politics. With the facilitation of new technology, Green movements seem to become the novel vehicle to transcend the national, class, gender and racial borders. Meanwhile, ecofeminism raises the debates on woman nature nexus and posits woman {{at the forefront of}} fighting environmental crisis. This thesis parallels the two trajectories in the temporal and spatial contexts of cyborg space, ???global city??? and international environmental governance. This thesis unfolds the inherent connections, as well as contradictions in these spaces. Through scrutinizing the techniques of subjectivity in Green movements and ecofeminism, it examines the female subjects that are maneuvered, mobilized and displaced in the intersectional power dynamics of gender, class, race, sexuality and nationality of the neoliberal politics. Integrating transnational feminism, queer studies and ecofeminism, this thesis endeavors to pave new spaces for rethinking possible grounds for alliances in the neoliberal era...|$|R
