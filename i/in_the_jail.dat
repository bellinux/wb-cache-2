Throughout the film, Presley mimed the songs, which had been previously recorded in the studio and were added to the finished scenes.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} {{reached a}} crisis on May 7, 1963. Breakfast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> took {{four hours to}} distribute to all the prisoners. Seventy members of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce pleaded with the protest organizers to stop the actions. The NAACP asked for sympathizers to picket in unity in 100 American cities. Nineteen rabbis from New York flew to Birmingham, equating silence about segregation to the atrocities of the Holocaust. Local rabbis disagreed {{and asked them to}} go home. The editor of The Birmingham News wired President Kennedy and pleaded with him to end the protests.|$|E
5|$|In a {{checkout}} line, Veronica and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{discuss her}} relationship with Piz and what her FBI internship will mean for them. They then see someone getting arrested by the campus police for a fake debit card. Weevil injures himself, but finds himself unable to receive adequate benefits. Veronica gets Piz to accept her leaving for the internship. At the Sheriff’s station, Weevil is called out by several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. Weevil is put <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the criminology class. She investigates several of {{the owners of the}} student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing Weevil. Weevil gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID printing machine was found in the locker next to Weevil’s. Veronica and Wallace speak to a mechanical engineering professor, who says that it would be impossible for Weevil to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil’s fingerprints were found all over the investigation.|$|E
5|$|While {{driving through}} {{a rural area}} in Georgia, Peter and his group are pulled over by the local sheriff, and Peter makes every effort to talk as annoyingly and rudely to him as possible. But the Sheriff is more {{offended}} by Cleveland's attempt to calmingly explain themselves, punching out one of their headlights and then planting a bag of marijuana in their trunk. The group are then sent to a county work camp where {{they are forced to}} perform various tasks, including ditch digging and rock crushing. As their stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> supposedly comes to an end, the warden then approaches them and tells them that their stay has been extended an additional thirty days. Learning from another prisoner that they might be locked up forever, the group decides {{to break out of the}} prison when the prison guards's eyes are diverted. Successful in their attempt, they soon come across a house where they discover a set of handcuff and shackle keys.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} these controversies, Hennessey {{remained}} popular with San Francisco’s voters and was regularly returned to office every election. [...] He rarely faced serious opposition, twice running unopposed. [...] His popularity is largely attributed to his progressive leadership in introducing innovative rehabilitation programs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jails,</b> aggressive hiring within San Francisco’s minority communities, and improving the professionalism of the Department.|$|R

50|$|After final {{judgement}} of court, {{the group}} photograph was taken {{and all the}} accused were sent to <b>the</b> different <b>jails</b> of United Province. They were asked to put off their clothes and wear <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> dress like other prisoners. All the accused protested this jail order and started hunger strikes on the first day. Their plea was quite genuine. They argued that since the all have been charged to overturn the British rule and have been punished under section 120(B) and 121(A) hence they {{should be treated as}} political prisoners and provided <b>the</b> same facilities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jails.</b>|$|R
25|$|Some Canadian jails—such {{as those}} in Toronto and Ottawa, Ontario; Headingley, Manitoba; and Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta—had {{permanent}} indoor execution facilities, but more typically offenders were hanged on a scaffold built for the occasion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> yard.|$|E

25|$|In June 1844, {{with the}} {{publication}} of the Nauvoo Expositor by disaffected former church members, the press was destroyed by the town marshal on orders from the town council (of which Joseph was a member), which set into motion the events that ultimately led to his arrest and incarceration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> in Carthage, Illinois. While he was there, a mob of about 200 armed men stormed the jail in the late afternoon of June 27, 1844, and both Joseph and his brother, Hyrum, were killed.|$|E

As a result, the outlaws were never prosecuted and they were later released from jail.|$|E
25|$|Oklahoma's Sheriffs, {{whose primary}} role is {{as an officer}} of the court, provide full services, that is, {{providing}} traditional law-enforcement functions such as countywide patrol and investigations.

The Sheriff's office also provides security for judges and courthouses. The Sheriffs are in charge of and have custody over the jail of their county, and all the prisoners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> are under the Sheriff's supervision, with the Sheriff serving as the county's jailer.|$|E

2500|$|Hennessey {{also was}} an early proponent of a new {{technique}} for jail management, called Direct Supervision. [...] This method of creating a dialogue with prisoners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jails</b> was also accompanied by the construction of two new San Francisco jails that were designed to maximize visual supervision and to eliminate “blind spots” from staff observation. [...] The result has been safer jails almost completely eliminating escapes, sexual assaults and other inmate misconduct.|$|R

The sheriff permitted both fighters to go home at night so long as they agreed to spar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> cell. Large crowds gathered to watch the sessions. After 23 days in jail, their bail was reduced to an affordable level and a grand jury refused to indict either man. However, Johnson later stated that he learned his boxing skills during that jail time. The two would remain friends.|$|E
25|$|The Lord Advocate {{also decided}} that because Forrest was absent, the trial against McNab and Mitchel who had merely been acting as agents was halted pro loco et tempore.

They were freed from jail, however this incensed the local populace who formed an angry mob and started to riot in the streets. The 77th Regiment were brought down from the Castle to disperse the rioters who fired on the mob in Spittal Street, but no-one was injured, the soldiers intentionally firing over the people's heads. For their own safety McNab and Mitchel had to take refuge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>jail</b> they had just been released from.|$|E
