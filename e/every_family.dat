5|$|Numbered Treaties {{were signed}} {{in the late}} 19th century with the chiefs of various First Nations that lived in the area. These {{treaties}} made specific promises of land for <b>every</b> <b>family.</b> As a result, a reserve system was established {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Federal Government. The prescribed amount of land promised to the native peoples was not always given; this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal land claims, many of which are still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages, the Anuradhapura Kingdom {{did not have}} a strong regular army except for a small body of soldiers. These were {{assigned}} for guarding the capital and the royal palace. The King had the right to demand an able bodied son for military service from <b>every</b> <b>family</b> in his kingdom. In times of war, a larger army was formed using this method. An army consisted of four main divisions; an elephant corps, cavalry, chariots and infantry. This combination was called Chaturangani Sena (fourfold army). However, the majority of the army was infantry composed of swordsmen, spearmen and archers.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi era {{continues}} to inform how Germans view {{themselves and their}} country. Virtually <b>every</b> <b>family</b> suffered losses during the war or has a story to tell, though Germans kept quiet about their experiences and {{felt a sense of}} communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes. Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s, as people began researching the experiences of their family members. Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has {{led to the development of}} a strong democracy in today's Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and neo-Nazi thought.|$|E

5|$|On June 7, 1855, the 183-ft. vessel Benjamin Franklin {{put into}} Hampton Roads for repairs. She had just sailed from the West Indies where {{there had been}} an {{outbreak}} of yellow fever. The port health officer ordered the ship quarantined. After eleven days, a second inspection found no issues, so she was allowed to dock. A few days later, the first cases of yellow fever were discovered in Norfolk, and a machinist died from the disease on July 8. By August, several people were dying per day, and a third of the city's population had fled in the hopes of escaping the epidemic. No one understood how the disease was transmitted. With both Norfolk and Portsmouth being infected, New York banned all traffic from those sites. Neighboring cities also banned residents from Norfolk. The epidemic spread through the city via mosquitoes and poor sanitation, affecting <b>every</b> <b>family</b> and causing widespread panic. The number of infected reached 5,000 in September, and by the second week, 1,500 had died in Norfolk and Portsmouth. As the weather cooled, the outbreak began to wane, leaving a final tally of about 3,200 dead. It took the city some time to recover.|$|E
5|$|The World Bank {{considered}} the cyclone {{as having a}} significant effect on Andhra Pradesh's economy. Andhra Pradesh's chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu estimated that the state would take as long as 30years to recover from the storm. The government provided RS$1,500 (US$420) to <b>every</b> <b>family</b> whose hut collapsed during the storm, and RS$100,000 (US$2,857) to the family of every person killed by the storm. However, there were also reports of people stealing bodies to receive the payment. The federal government provided about US$12million to the state, as well as tax deductions for monetary donations. Former Union Minister Rangaiah Naidu opined that the state government overinflated the damage estimates to qualify for additional aid, in part due to the government spending annual disaster subsidies for salaries. The World Bank credited the government's experience with disasters as saving lives, although the response to the disaster was largely in repairing damage, rather than mitigating against future storms. The storm also demonstrated the region's outdated infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|The Soviet goal of {{providing}} housing for <b>every</b> <b>family,</b> and {{the rapid growth}} of Moscow's population, led to the construction of large, monotonous housing blocks.
