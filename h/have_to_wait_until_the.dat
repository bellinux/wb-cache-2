5|$|Resident Evil 5 is {{the first}} game in the Resident Evil series {{designed}} for two-player cooperative gameplay. The first player controls Redfield, {{a former member of}} the fictional Special Tactics and Rescue Service (STARS) and current member of the BSAA, and a second player can control Alomar, who is introduced in this game. If a person plays alone, Alomar is controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Alomar the primary character. Two-player mode is available online or split-screen with a second player using the same console. A second player joining a split-screen game in progress will make the game reload the last checkpoint (the point at which the game was last saved); the second player joining an online game will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> first player reaches the next checkpoint, or restarts the previous one, to play. In split-screen mode, one player's viewpoint is presented in the top half of the screen, and the other in the bottom half, but each viewpoint is presented in widescreen format, rather than using the full width of the screen, resulting in unused space to the left and right of the two windows. If one player has critical health, only their partner can resuscitate them, and they will die if their partner cannot reach them. At certain points, players are deliberately separated. Players can trade items during gameplay, although weapons cannot be traded with online players. The game's story-line is linear, and interaction with other characters is mostly limited to cut-scenes.|$|E

25|$|Speed {{remained}} with Moore for the 1994 season starting off with finishes of sixth at Atlanta, fifth at Darlington and third at Bristol, {{moving up to}} fifth place in the points. Two races later, Speed finished seventh at Talladega. It was during this time that Speed {{was inducted into the}} karting hall of fame. Speed would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> July Daytona race to get another top ten finish, a tenth. Speed and the team ran good through the summer stretch, often starting near the rear of the field but moving to the front. Unfortunately, Speed did not manage a top ten finish until Dover where he finished ninth. In the final four races, Speed had three great runs. A fifth at Charlotte, a tenth at Rockingham and a fourth at Atlanta where he led twenty laps. It wasn't enough for Speed to finish in the top ten in points. He finished eleventh behind Bill Elliott.|$|E

25|$|A {{lack of a}} drive {{had left}} Alboreto in a {{difficult}} situation and he later admitted he contemplated retirement – an option of which his family were very much in favour. Soon enough, however, he was offered a drive at his former employer Tyrrell, which he accepted. Thanks to Alboreto's Marlboro backing, the team managed to fund his wages. The relationship between Alboreto and team boss, Ken Tyrrell, soon turned sour. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Alboreto was told to drive the 1988 model Tyrrell 017, due to the newer 018 model not being completed. Team-mate Jonathan Palmer was chosen to drive the new monoshock 018. Meanwhile, the Italian would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> following day for the 018 and so {{he decided not to}} accept this. The result was Alboreto boycotting the Thursday practice session. This lack of professional behaviour did not impress the team, and finishing in fifth position during the race did not help the 32-year-old's cause. He also finished 3rd at the next race in Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The 19th century, conservative, post-Revolution France was inhospitable for feminist ideas, as {{expressed}} in the counter-revolutionary writings {{on the role of}} women by Joseph de Maistre and Viscount Louis de Bonald. Advancement came mid-century under the 1848 revolution and the proclamation of the Second Republic, which introduced male suffrage amid hopes that similar benefits would apply to women. Although the Utopian Charles Fourier is considered a feminist writer of this period, his influence was minimal at the time. With the fall of the conservative Louis-Philippe in 1848, feminist hopes were raised, as in 1790. Movement newspapers and organizations appeared, such as Eugénie Niboyet's La Voix des Femmes (The Women's Voice), the first feminist daily newspaper in France. Niboyet was a Protestant who had adopted Saint-Simonianism, and La Voix attracted other women from that movement, including the seamstress Jeanne Deroin and the primary schoolteacher Pauline Roland. Unsuccessful attempts were also made to recruit George Sand. Feminism was treated as a threat due to its ties with socialism, which was scrutinized since the Revolution. Deroin and Roland were both arrested, tried, and imprisoned in 1849. With the emergence of a new, more conservative government in 1852, feminism would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> Third French Republic.|$|E

[...] Van Zandt predicted that they would play most of Working on a Dream during {{the initial stages of}} the tour, but {{what the rest of the}} show would be was uncertain. If the full album idea did go forward, he thought 1980's double album The River combined with outtakes from those sessions would make a full show on its own. [...] Nothing came of the full album notion right away; it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> tour's U.S. third leg to materialize.|$|E
500|$|After {{attending}} a night-time match in Belgium in 1930 {{with his friend}} Hugo Meisl, Chapman became an early advocate of floodlights. He had lights installed in Highbury's new West Stand when it was constructed in 1932; however they were only used for training and Arsenal would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 1950s for their officially-sanctioned use in matches. Chapman oversaw much {{of the development of}} Highbury in the early 1930s, including the building of the West Stand and the addition of a clock which was eventually placed by the south terrace, giving it the name of the [...] "Clock End". He is also credited with being behind the renaming of London Underground's Gillespie Road station to Arsenal. He even designed the scoreboard and turnstiles at the stadium.|$|E
500|$|The {{people of}} Market Deeping, Deeping Gate and Deeping St James, {{together}} with other villages along the river presented a petition to Elizabeth I, requesting that the fens should be drained, as {{the banks of the}} river and of the neighbouring Glen were in a poor state of repair. They suggested that Thomas Lovell should undertake the work, which he did, at a cost of £12,000, for which he received [...] of the land which was reclaimed {{as a result of the}} work. Unrest in the early 1600s resulted in most of the works being destroyed, but in 1632 a group of adventurers led by the Earl of Bedford were granted permission to drain Deeping Fen, South Fen and Crowland. The work included making the Welland deeper and wider from Deeping St James to its outfall beyond Spalding, and the construction of side drains. These included a drain running from Pode Hole to below Spalding, which is still known as Vernatt's Drain, after one of the adventurers called Sir Philibert Vernatti. Although declared completed in 1637, efficient drainage would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> construction of Pode Hole pumping station in 1827.|$|E

[...] "The problems we are dealing with are national problems so they have to be addressed nationally and not as problems of one part of the country", he said. Nkunda also contested the president's election, saying that [...] "Legitimacy is not elections and elections are not a blank cheque for a government to do whatever it wants."

2500|$|While Meyerbeer's {{popularity}} has faded, {{the fortunes of}} another French composer of the era have risen steeply {{over the past few}} decades. Yet the operas of Hector Berlioz were failures in their day. Berlioz was a unique mixture of an innovative modernist and a backward-looking conservative. His taste in opera had been formed in the 1820s, when the works of Gluck and his followers were being pushed aside in favour of Rossinian bel canto. Though Berlioz grudgingly admired some works by Rossini, he despised what he saw as the showy effects of the Italian style and longed to return opera to the dramatic truth of Gluck. He was also a fully-fledged Romantic, keen to find new ways of musical expression. His first and only work for the Paris Opéra, Benvenuto Cellini (1838), was a notorious failure. Audiences could not understand the opera's originality and musicians found its unconventional rhythms impossible to play. Twenty years later, Berlioz began writing his operatic masterpiece Les Troyens with himself rather than audiences of the day in mind. Les Troyens was to be the culmination of the French Classical tradition of Gluck and Spontini. Predictably, it failed to make the stage, at least in its complete, four-hour form. For that, it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> second half of the twentieth century, fulfilling the composer's prophecy, [...] "If only I could live till I am a hundred and forty, my life would become decidedly interesting". Berlioz's third and final opera, the Shakespearean comedy Béatrice et Bénédict (1862), was written for a theatre in Germany, where audiences were far more appreciative of his musical innovation.|$|E
2500|$|The Communion {{service of}} 1549 {{maintained}} {{the format of}} distinct rites of consecration and communion, that had been introduced the previous year; but with the Latin rite of the Mass (chiefly following the familiar structure in the Use of Sarum), translated into English. By outwardly maintaining familiar forms, Cranmer hoped to establish the practice of weekly congregational communion, and included exhortations to encourage this; and instructions that communion should never be received by the priest alone. This represented a radical change from late medieval practice—whereby {{the primary focus of}} congregational worship was taken to be attendance at the consecration, and adoration of the elevated consecrated host. In late medieval England, congregations regularly received communion only at Easter; and otherwise individual lay people might expect to receive communion only when gravely ill, or {{in the form of a}} Nuptial Mass on being married. Doctrinally and most importantly Cranmer deleted any reference that the Eucharist is the Church's offering and an objective and material sacrifice by the Church to God in union with Christ was omitted from the Prayer of Consecration as had been the belief since the mid-second century as stated in the Consecration Prayers. Although fully aware of this Cranmer demonstrated his opposition to ancient practice (The Study of Liturgy, Editors, Jones, Wainwright, Yarnold SJ and Bradshaw, Revised Ediition 1992, p. 101-105) by omitting oblationary language in the prayer as it continued immediately after the Words of the Institution, [...] "wherefore O Lord and Heavenly Father, according to the institution of thy dearly beloved Son our Saviour Jesus Christ, we, thy humble servants, do celebrate and make here [...] thy Divine Majesty, with these they holy gifts, the memorial thy Son has willeth to make." [...] Absent is an oblation of the gifts signified by language such as [...] "which we present unto thee," [...] or [...] "bring before thee" [...] or [...] "offer unto thee." [...] He made sure in the Second Prayer Book Rite that no possible association could be made: the Prayer of Consecration ended with the Words of Institution. He also omitted the Epiclesis from the Second Book. The recovery of oblation and the epiclesis would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> Scottish Non-Jurors in the 18th century did so, [...] "which we now offer unto thee," [...] placed after [...] "holy gifts." [...] The Episcopal Church USA adopted the formula in 1789: six words added to a modified version of the 1549 Prayer in effect repudiated Cranmer's theology of sacrifice which restricted to the communicants' offering themselves in an optional thanksgiving prayer. As for his theology of Christ's Presence it was Calvinistic Virtualism: Christ is present by the power of the Holy Spirit. However the 1549 Rite is ambiguous about this referring to the Eucharist as spiritual food but in to the Real Presence in the Words of Administration, [...] "The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ," [...] "The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ." [...] The Non-Juror Rite asserted a kind of Virtualism while making the Eucharist a proper sacrifice, op. cit. p. 108, while the Elizabethan Settlement in one of the first moves to undo Cranmer left open the question of the Real Presence because the Queen insisted that the Words of Administration be from the 1549 Book where the doctrine was implicit and include also the words from the 1552 Book which are Receptionism. The 1559 Book retained the truncated Prayer of Consecration which omitted any notion of objective sacrifice. It would be a long road back for the Church of England with no clear indication that it would retreat from the 1559 Settlement except for minor official changes. However, from the 17th century some prominent Anglican theologians tried [...] to cast a more traditional interpretation onto it though the words of the rite might not carry. It not be until the Oxford Movement of the 19th century and 20th century revisions that the Church of England would attempt to deal with the Eucharisitic doctrines of Cranmer - focused on Receiving Christ, Virtiual Presence, Receptionism, and the eucharistic sacrifice confined to an optional Thanksgiving Prayer said by the communicants empowered to do so by having received - by bringing the Church back to [...] "pre-Reformation doctrine," [...] ibid. p. 108, which among other matters sees the congregation first offering itself through the Consecrated Elements, the Gifts of God, before receiving the same.|$|E
