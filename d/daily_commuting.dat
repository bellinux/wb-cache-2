40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate the control measures used by public transport commuters and their health (physical and psychological) effects due to exposure to air pollution during their <b>daily</b> <b>commute</b> and during haze days. From June to October 2016, 800 public transport commuters in urban cities {{in the heart of}} Selangor, Malaysia were interviewed. Of these, 25. 4 % reported sometimes/often wearing surgical masks during their <b>daily</b> <b>commute,</b> while 92. 1 % reported such use during haze days. The total control measure score against air pollutants during the <b>daily</b> <b>commute</b> was low; on a control measure scale of 0 – 18, the median rating during the <b>daily</b> <b>commute</b> was 8 (interquartile range (IQR) 6 – 10). During haze days, control measures improved slightly (median 14, IQR 12 – 16). Evidence of adverse health effects was present. During the <b>daily</b> <b>commute</b> under normal conditions, the three highest adverse health experiences were fatigue and weakness (35. 5 %), coughing (23. 6 %), and dizziness (18. 2 %). During haze days, the three highest adverse health experiences were headache (85 %), coughing (84. 8 %), and breathing difficulties (84. 5 %). On a possible total adverse health (physical and psychological) experience scale of 0 – 22, the median rating during the <b>daily</b> <b>commute</b> was 1 (IQR 0 – 3). The median rating during haze days was intensified (median 11, IQR 9 – 13). Public transportation commuters should be encouraged to enhance various control measures against particulate air pollutants during their <b>daily</b> <b>commute,</b> particularly during haze days, to minimize the adverse health risks associated with air pollutants...|$|R
25|$|The primary {{modes of}} intra-city public {{transport}} are city buses and auto rickshaws. Apart from these, {{other means of}} transport are motorcycles, cycle rickshaws and bicycles.

The Pandit Nehru bus station is the administrative headquarters of APSRTC, which is ranked as the fourth largest and busiest bus terminals in the country. The Vijayawada City Division of APSRTC operates close to 450 buses for an average of 300,000 <b>daily</b> <b>commuting</b> passengers and is supported by BRTS corridors. Vijayawada railway station is classified as an A1 category station {{and is one of the}} busiest of Indian Railways. Suburban rail services are operated from the railway station to the nearby cities of Guntur and Tenali, Gudivada, machlipatnam, Bhimavaram, Narasapuram.

2500|$|For individuals, {{telecommuting}} provides {{alternatives to}} <b>daily</b> <b>commuting</b> and long-distance air travel for business. Technologies for telecommuting, such as videoconferencing, e-mail, and corporate wikis, continue to improve, {{in keeping with}} the overall improvement in information technologies ascribed to Moore's law. As the cost of moving human workers continues to rise, while the cost of moving information electronically continues to fall, presumably market forces should cause more people to substitute virtual travel for physical travel. Matthew Simmons explicitly calls for [...] "liberating the workforce" [...] by changing the corporate mindset from paying people to show up physically to work every day, to paying them instead for the work they do, from any location. This would allow many more information workers to work from home either part-time or full-time, or from satellite offices or Internet cafes near to where they live, freeing them from long daily commutes to central offices. However, even full adoption of telecommuting by all eligible workers might only decrease energy consumption by about 1% (with present energy savings estimated at 0.01–0.04%). By comparison, a 20% increase in automobile fuel economy would save 5.4%.|$|E
