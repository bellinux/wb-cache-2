30|$|The k-Handover scheme {{extends the}} Greedy scheme by adding an {{additional}} constraint that specifies that at maximum k <b>handovers</b> {{can be performed}} using one slot.

30|$|If we rank those {{neighbour}} relations (NRs) {{according to}} the occurrence of <b>handovers</b> and if we then calculate for each NR how many <b>handovers</b> {{are not covered by}} the NRs with a lower rank (i.e. with a lower relevance), we get a negative exponential complementary distribution function. As a rule of thumb, we can say that one third of the detected NRs carry 99 % of the <b>handovers</b> and two third of the detected NRs carry around 99.99 % of the <b>handovers,</b> i.e. the remaining third only carries 0.01 % of <b>handovers</b> (which corresponds to 10 HO per day in a cell with 100, 000 <b>handovers</b> per day) and the ANR function needs to take this relatively rare occurrence of <b>handovers</b> into account when deciding about set-up or removal of X 2 links for such neighbour relations.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this Master s thesis is to define, explicate and investigate the heretofore-underexplored phenomenon of innovation <b>handovers.</b> Given the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of many innovation projects, we believe that researching how innovation projects are handed over between various organizational units, will contribute {{to a better understanding}} of why and how innovation activities fail. Based on literature on <b>handovers</b> in other industries, along with innovation and organizational literature, we have developed a conceptual framework. This framework has structured the empirical investigation in this thesis, where we have performed a qualitative cross-case study on how innovation <b>handovers</b> are carried out in practice, as a part of companies innovation processes. Here, employees from four Norwegian companies, across industries, have been interviewed. Our findings indicate that innovation <b>handovers</b> have prevalence, and give insight into how innovation <b>handovers</b> are carried out in practice. Despite the case companies differences in business models, practices, and innovation work, all case companies have innovation <b>handovers,</b> where a transfer of information, responsibility and/or control for an innovation project occurs between organizational units. We have found that innovation <b>handovers</b> are not straightforward, linear or easy, and should rather be described as an iterative process. Innovation <b>handovers</b> are found to occur both within companies, and with external actors. Further, the execution of innovation <b>handovers</b> varies, and is tightly linked to how the companies structure their innovation work. Here, we have identified tradeoffs between the extent of integration and the number of <b>handovers,</b> and between formalization and flexibility. Also, we found that innovation <b>handovers</b> are highly influenced by factors in the organizational context in which they occur. In our study, we have identified several challenges that companies face in innovation handovers: different motives, goals, and ways of thinking; ambiguity; lack of psychological ownership and commitment; poor communication; inadequacies in management and leadership; an unsupportive cultures and climates. If these challenges are not overcome, the innovation project can be developed in wrong directions, die out or be terminated. Our study shows that the case companies overcome these challenges through employee involvement, key employees, and goal alignment. As an exploratory case study, the findings in our thesis prepare the ground for further research. We suggest further research to determine our findings applicability beyond the limitations of our sample. Also, we suggest further research to improve our understanding of innovation <b>handovers,</b> and their relationship to the contexts in which they occur...|$|R

30|$|The {{performance}} of the Greedy and the k-Handover scheme is identical. We found that the k-Handover scheme does not really avoid <b>handovers,</b> it just delays them to the next time slot (if there are already k <b>handovers</b> in the current time slot).|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, Fig.  7 b {{presents}} the UHR indicator.

Scanning for new APs is not explicitly addressed in this study. CloudMAC [9] is a recent proposal to distribute the MAC processing in WLANs using SDNs. CloudMAC also allows implementing fast <b>handovers</b> between APs, but is mainly targeting network initiated <b>handovers,</b> while this article uses client initiated <b>handovers.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 27 August 1997, a {{delegation}} of Noongars consisting of Ken Colbung, Robert Bropho, Richard Wilkes and Mingli Wanjurri-Nungala arrived in the UK to collect Yagan's head. The delegation {{was to have been}} larger, but Commonwealth funding was withdrawn at the last minute. The <b>handover</b> of Yagan's skull was further delayed, however, when a Noongar named Corrie Bodney applied to the Supreme Court of Western Australia for an injunction against the <b>handover.</b> Claiming that his family group has sole responsibility for Yagan's remains, Bodney declared the exhumation illegal and denied the existence of any tradition or belief necessitating the head's exhumation and removal to Australia. On 29 August, Justice Henry Wallwork rejected the injunction application, on the grounds that Bodney had previously agreed to the current arrangements, and on the evidence of another Noongar elder (Albert Corunna, who claimed to be a closer relation of Yagan) and anthropologist Pat Baines, both of whom refuted Bodney's claim to sole responsibility.|$|E

30|$|With no STA mobility, the {{gap between}} the {{heuristics}} and the optimum is caused by two effects: first, even in absence of mobility, <b>handovers</b> might be required when STAs join or leave the network. The heuristics do not find the best points in time for those <b>handovers.</b> Second, the heuristics maximize the fair throughput in each time slot. In order to maximize the long term average fair throughput, the dynamic model allows temporary unfairness. As mobility increases the timing of <b>handovers</b> gets more important and hence the performance of the heuristics drops.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Header Compression is {{a useful}} {{technique}} for reducing the load on bandwidthscarce wireless links. Header Compression depends on the establishment and synchronization of context at the compressor and the decompressor. In mobile wireless networks, it is desirable to transfer this context between access routers to avoid the expensive process of context re-establishment when <b>handovers</b> are required. In this chapter we propose a method for avoiding the need for context re-establishment when packets are lost during <b>handovers,</b> {{as well as a}} mean for efficiently transferring the context to new access routers (by piggybacking the context information on Mobile IP signaling messages). The analysis of our scheme shows that it can reduce signaling load during <b>handovers,</b> which is beneficial in mobile networks with frequent <b>handovers</b> (e. g. wireless LAN hot spots) ...|$|R
50|$|While {{theoretically}} speaking soft <b>handovers</b> {{are possible}} in any technology, analog or digital, {{the cost of}} implementing them for analog technologies is prohibitively high {{and none of the}} technologies that were commercially successful in the past (e.g. AMPS, TACS, NMT, etc.) had this feature. Of the digital technologies, those based on FDMA also face a higher cost for the phones (due to the need to have multiple parallel radio-frequency modules) and those based on TDMA or a combination of TDMA/FDMA, in principle, allow not so expensive implementation of soft <b>handovers.</b> However, none of the 2G (second-generation) technologies have this feature (e.g. GSM, D-AMPS/IS-136, etc.). On the other hand, all CDMA based technologies, 2G and 3G (third-generation), have soft <b>handovers.</b> On one hand, this is facilitated by the possibility to design not so expensive phone hardware supporting soft <b>handovers</b> for CDMA and on the other hand, this is necessitated by the fact that without soft <b>handovers</b> CDMA networks may suffer from substantial interference arising due to the so-called near-far effect..|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{formally}} verified protocol to securely manage vertical <b>handovers</b> heterogeneous networks (HetNets), even when different cryptographic algorithms {{are used in}} the infrastructure. The protocol presentation goes with a review of the current propositions of security mechanisms and procedures dedicated to manage vertical <b>handovers.</b> From a critical analysis, the HetNets are positioned in the context of wireless security to describe the possible attacks that afflict this new kind of infrastructure. From this analysis, it is revealed that the different entities involved in the management of <b>handovers</b> are surrounded by new security challenges. This challenges and the positioning of HetNets helps to deliver a new suited protection.
