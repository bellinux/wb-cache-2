Descriptive cross sectional study. Moshi Rural district. It {{was found that the}} staffing gap were 42. 3 %, 38. 2 % and 46. 2 % in the hospitals, health centres and dispensaries respectively. Comparison was made between the public, private and religious <b>health</b> <b>facilities.</b> It was found that 21. 2 %, 62. 5 % and 95. 8 % of health workers from public, private and religious <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> respectively reported of presence of enough working equipment in their <b>health</b> <b>facilities.</b> In addition 36. 1 %, 54. 3 % and 81. 6 % of health workers from public, private and religious <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> were being promoted when deserving. From the information above it is evident that health workers from religious <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> have the highest level of motivation, those from the private <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> are moderately motivated while those from public <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> are poorly motivated. Motivation of health workers and availability of working equipments in Moshi rural is highest in religious <b>health</b> <b>facilities,</b> moderate in private <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> and lowest in public <b>health</b> <b>facilities.</b> Efforts should be made to find affordable means of motivating the rural health workers so as to improve their performance and ultimately the health status of Tanzanians...|$|R

5|$|Surjik {{personally}} {{asked if}} he could direct the episode because he was a fan of the series; this was his only credit for the series.

Other issues arose because of technical reasons; one scene required flooding a hallway with 3,300 gallons of water.

5|$|The HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} in Malawi {{has been characterized}} by drastic declines {{in the number of}} health workers available to provide treatment and care and increasing strain on health services: {{more than half of all}} hospital admissions in Malawi are related to HIV/AIDS.

40|$|The {{vision of}} Nigeria’s {{immunization}} {{program is to}} reach and sustain routine immunization coverage of greater than 90 % for all vaccines by 2020. In order to achieve this, Abia state embarked on a unique private-public partnership (PPP) between private <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> and the Abia state ministry of health. The aim of this partnership was to collaborate with private <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> to provide free childhood immunization services in the state - {{the first of its}} kind in Nigeria.

50|$|In 2010, {{there were}} eight (8) <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> {{providing}} <b>health</b> care to inhabitants of the Municipality.

These <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> occasionally referred cases to the Sunyani Regional Hospital. In 2010, the problem with <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> in the Municipality was that only two hospitals in the municipality were privately owned and this made {{the cost of health}} delivery very high.

40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> on {{patients}} {{has been extensively}} researched. Yet, {{while there is a}} growing recognition of the need for healthy working environments, little is known about how <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> affect the staff working in them. This paper explores how the design of <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> impacts on the well-being and performance of healthcare workers. The article is based on a review of published literature, identified through PubMed and Google, as well as through searches of websites of relevant organizations. Many traditionally designed <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> seem to impact negatively on the well-being of healthcare workers, as well as on staff recruitment, retention and performance. Better-designed <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> can improve working conditions and staff safety, and enable staff to do their job more efficiently. The needs of healthcare workers should be taken into account at the initial design stage of <b>health</b> <b>facilities,</b> ideally though direct involvement or meaningful consultation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the challenges facing elderly people in accessing health services in public <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> a case study of Moshi Municipality. Within Moshi Municipality eighteen <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> were selected. The target population was elderly people, health practitioners and people working with Non Government Organizations. The researcher employed mixed methods of research designs which were Quantitative and qualitative. The main methods employed by a researcher were questionnaires and semi structured interview. Findings for current study indicate that 85 % of the elderly people involved in the study fail to access important medications in <b>health</b> <b>facilities.</b> And 80 % of the elderly people also need to have their own window for their health services which will reduce wastage of time in <b>health</b> <b>facilities.</b> They would like to be involved in every stage of provision of knowledge on free medical treatments in <b>health</b> <b>facilities.</b> Also the findings indicate that elderly people take a long time waiting for health services including procedures of getting patient files. Also health practitioners explained that many elders arrive to the <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> very late due to unavailability of transport. The researcher recommends that, the government should establish specific windows for health services to the elderly people so as to reduce time wastage in <b>health</b> <b>facilities,</b> social worker should provide knowledge to elders on free medical treatment, moreover Public <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> all over the country should possess enough important medication for elderly people so as to help them access easily, private <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> owners should accept health services exemptions and elders health insurance funds, Social worker should cooperate with other stakeholders like doctors and nurses to advocate for the elders rights such as health services...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the spatial {{pattern of the}} provision of private <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> and what the pattern portends for health needs {{in an era of}} global warming using the 33 Local Government Areas of Oyo State as spatial units of analysis.

Gini Coefficient and the associated Lorenz Curve confirm that there is generally an unequal distribution of private <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> in the study area. The curve suggests that the most vulnerable segment of the population to the health consequences of global warming are precluded from utilizing private <b>health</b> <b>facilities.</b> Oyo state’s experience thus shows that there is need for policy measures that will ensure unrestricted access to <b>health</b> <b>facilities</b> in an era of global warming...|$|R
