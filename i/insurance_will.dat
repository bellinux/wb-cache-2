5|$|Meanwhile, Susan is dismayed {{to learn}} that Karl has moved in with Edie. She begins dating her doctor, Ron McCready (Jay Harrington), who informs her {{that she has a}} {{wandering}} spleen and will need a splenectomy. When Susan learns that her health <b>insurance</b> <b>will</b> not cover the operation, Karl offers to remarry her for his medical benefits. They agree to keep their sham marriage a secret from Edie and Ron. While under anesthesia before her operation, Susan professes her love for Mike to Ron, which prompts Ron to break up with her. Soon after, Karl leaves Edie, as his love for Susan has resurfaced. Upon learning that Susan is the other woman, Edie intentionally sets Susan's house on fire. In this time of need, both Mike and Karl vie for Susan's affections. She chooses to rekindle her relationship with Mike and Karl signs the divorce papers. Susan and Mike then make plans to meet for dinner at nearby Torch Lake, where Mike plans to propose. On his way to dinner, Mike is a victim of a hit-and-run at the hands of Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), a dentist whom Susan had recently befriended.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009 a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the U.S. Senate, 565 and in the House, H.R. 1458 that will extend Medicare coverage of the drugs {{for as long as the}} patient has a functioning transplant. This means that patients who have lost their jobs and <b>insurance</b> <b>will</b> not also lose their kidney and be forced back on dialysis. Dialysis is currently using up $17 billion yearly of Medicare funds and total care of these patients amounts to over 10% of the entire Medicare budget.|$|E

That he has not really {{attracted}} the admiration and popularity at which he has aimed is evident, however, in the weariness that belabors him {{from the beginning of the}} play. Nearing retirement he suffers a drastic decrease in sales work, a dissatisfying marriage, and a turbulent relationship with his sons which inexorably leads to his suicide with the justification that the <b>insurance</b> <b>will</b> finally provide for his family.|$|E

25|$|With the {{implementation}} of PPACA in 2014, those citizens acquiring insurance through currently available Massachusetts Health Connector plans, will need to re-enroll or select a new plan, given the new guidelines stipulated by PPACA. Approximately 100,000 Massachusetts residents who received free or highly subsidized CommonWealth Care <b>insurance,</b> <b>will</b> be moved to Medicaid. The number of available plans under the Affordable Care Act that will offer service beginning on January 1, 2014, rose to more than 100 from just under 100 in 2013. The open enrollment period of the insurance marketplace, during which citizens may re-enroll or purchase, lasted from 1 October 2013 to 31 March 2014, but {{those who did not}} re-enroll by December 15, were to have no insurance coverage in January 2014 (unless they were among the 100,000 moved to Medicaid).|$|E

Meanwhile, Marge accidentally severs Homer's thumb {{as she is}} cutting brownies. They drive to the hospital, but Dr. Hibbert claims that the <b>insurance</b> <b>will</b> not cover the cost, so they instead drive off for Dr. Nick's clinic. Since Homer's thumb is {{starting}} to shrivel up, he stops by at Moe's, where he gets a pickle brine solution. He gets distracted when Moe offers him a beer. Homer rushes {{out the door and}} sees Marge is gone. He hitchhikes with Cletus who drives him to Dr. Nick's, but they discover the clinic is on fire. Homer asks Cletus to drive him to Shelbyville Hospital, but his truck gets stolen and Homer leaves for the hospital on foot. His thumb is almost completely shrivelled up now, and he is just about to throw it away when an explosion sends Linguo's severed head flying up into the air and it lands next to him.|$|E
50|$|Another common {{obstacle}} to pre-conception counseling and assessment {{may be the}} lack of health insurance. However, most <b>insurances</b> <b>will</b> cover this as a screening visit. Also, many physicians will do the pre-conception screening during a regular office visit or gynecological visit if the woman just informs the doctor of her desire to become pregnant.

500|$|The CBO {{estimated}} that the ACA would slightly {{reduce the size of}} the labor force and number of hours worked, as some would no longer be tethered to employers for their insurance. Cohn, citing CBO's projections, claimed that ACA's primary employment effect was to alleviate job lock: [...] "People who are only working because they desperately need employer-sponsored health <b>insurance</b> <b>will</b> no longer do so." [...] He concluded that the [...] "reform's only significant employment impact was a reduction in the labor force, primarily because people holding onto jobs just to keep insurance could finally retire", because they have health insurance outside of their jobs.|$|E
2500|$|Title {{insurance}} {{is a form}} of indemnity insurance predominantly found in the United States which insures against financial loss from defects in title to real property and from the invalidity or unenforceability of mortgage loans. The vast majority of title insurance policies are written on land within the United States. Unlike some land registration systems in countries outside the US, the US states' recorder of deeds generally do not guarantee indefeasible title to those recorded titles. [...] Title <b>insurance</b> <b>will</b> defend against a lawsuit attacking the title, or reimburse the insured for the actual monetary loss incurred up to the dollar amount of insurance provided by the policy.|$|E
2500|$|Affordable premium: If the {{likelihood}} of an insured event is so high, or {{the cost of the}} event so large, that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered, then it is not likely that the <b>insurance</b> <b>will</b> be purchased, even if on offer. Furthermore, as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards, the premium cannot be so large {{that there is not a}} reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer. If there is no such chance of loss, then the transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the substance (see the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board pronouncement number 113: [...] "Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts").|$|E

2500|$|In the past, California has {{struggled}} to maintain healthcare effectiveness, {{due in part to}} its unstable budget and complex regulations. The state has a policy in place known as the Gann Limit, otherwise entitled proposition 98, which ensures that a portion of state funds are directed towards the education system. This limit would be exceeded if California raises taxes to fund the new system which would require $100 billion in tax revenue. In order to avoid legal dispute, voters would be required to amend proposition 98 and exempt healthcare funding from required educational contributions.

Your {{compassion}} has reached beyond our family, beyond our community, and is changing our world, and for this we sincerely thank you." [...] The Amish do not normally accept charity, but because of the extreme nature of the tragedy, donations were accepted. Richie Lauer, director of the Anabaptist Foundation, said the Amish community, whose religious beliefs prohibit them from having health <b>insurance,</b> <b>will</b> likely use the donations to help pay the medical costs of the hospitalized children.|$|E

60|$|But our {{proposals}} {{go farther}} than that. The State assistance to unemployment <b>insurance</b> <b>will</b> {{not be limited}} to those trades in which it is compulsory. Side by side with the compulsory system we shall offer facilities to voluntary insurance schemes in other trades, managed by trade unions or by societies or groups of workmen. Moreover, we contemplate that the State insurance office should undertake, if desired, the insurance against unemployment of any individual workman in any trade outside of those for which compulsory powers are required, and should afford to these individuals an equivalent support to that which is given in the trades which are subject to the compulsory system.|$|E

6000|$|II. The {{principal}} {{causes of}} the inequality that unfortunately exists among {{the people of the}} same community are three in number:--inequality in wealth; inequality of condition between the man whose means of subsistence are both assured and transmissible, and him for whom these means depend upon the duration of his working life; thirdly, inequality of instruction. How are we to establish a continual tendency in these three sources of inequality to diminish in activity and power? To lessen, though not to demolish, inequalities in wealth, it will be necessary for all artificial restrictions and exclusive advantages to be removed from fiscal or other legal arrangements, by which property is either acquired or accumulated: and among social changes tending in this direction will be the banishment by public opinion of an avaricious or mercenary spirit from marriage. Again, inequality between permanent and precarious incomes will be radically modified by the development of the application of the calculation of probabilities to life. The extension of annuities and <b>insurance</b> <b>will</b> not only benefit many individuals, but will benefit society at large by putting an end to that periodical ruin {{of a large number of}} families, which is such an ever-renewing source of misery and degradation. Another means to the same end will be found in discovering, by the same doctrine of probabilities, some other equally solid base for credit instead of a large capital, and for rendering the progress of industry and the activity of commerce more independent of the existence of great capitalists. Something approaching to equality of instruction, even for those who can only spare a few of their early years for study, and in after times only a few hours of leisure, will become more attainable by improved selection of subjects, and improved methods of teaching them. The dwellers in one country will cease to be distinguished by the use of a rude or of a refined dialect; and this, it may be said in passing, has actually been the result of the school system in the United States. One portion of them will no longer be dependent upon any other for guidance in the smallest affairs. We cannot obliterate nor ignore natural differences of capacity, but after public instruction has been properly developed, 'the difference will be between men of superior enlightenment, and men of an upright character who feel the value of light without being dazzled by it; between talent or genius, and that good sense which knows how to appreciate and to enjoy both. Even if this difference were greater than has been said, if we compare the force and extent of faculty, it would become none the less insensible, if we compare their respective effects upon the relations of men among themselves, upon all that affects their independence and their happiness.'[76] ...|$|E
