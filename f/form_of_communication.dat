Through {{technological}} innovations and alliances with governments and corporations, he transformed a minor studio in a marginal <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> into a multinational leisure industry giant. Despite his critics, his vision of a modern, corporate utopia as an extension of traditional American values has possibly gained greater currency in the years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two halves of its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the impact of augmentative and alternate <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> such as Picture Exchange Communication Services (PECS), assistive technology and Sign Language have on students with complex communication needs. Data collection consisted of observations, interviews, analysis of past speech and language reports on an individual student. Findings were the following: positive impacts of augmentative and alternate <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication,</b> negative impacts and consistency among adults with expectations for students. The results indicated that augmentative and alternate <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> allow students the ability to communicate by giving them a tool to express themselves. It is extremely important to incorporate a variety <b>of</b> alternative <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> when teaching students with complex communication needs...|$|R

40|$|This article {{suggests}} the systems theoretical distinction of form/medium {{as a useful}} tool for distinguishing social phenomena that might look as if they stem from the same process. This is shown to be the case for the tattoo and tattooing. The tattoo is conceived as a medium <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> through which different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> emerge. Tattooing is one <b>of</b> these <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> that shapes the medium in a particular way. The current article sheds a special light on its intricate, communicational constellation, for which the concept of parallax is suggested. Law, medicine and cosmetics as other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> use the medium of tattoo in their own way as well. The form/medium distinction allows us to grasp these different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication,</b> while it shows that they share the tattoo as medium.

5|$|The calls made by caecilians and {{salamanders}} {{are limited}} to occasional soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> Most salamanders are considered voiceless, but the California giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus) has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound. Some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.|$|E
5|$|In February 1858, Ives {{returned}} to the area in a paddle steamer named Explorer. He was leading an expedition up the Colorado from the south, and he wanted Irataba to guide them. The Mohave gave permission to navigate the river, and Cairook, Irataba, and a 16-year-old Mohave boy named Nahvahroopa joined them. Möllhausen again accompanied the expedition, and {{was impressed with the}} Mohave guides, later noting Irataba's enthusiastic handshake and lamenting that their only <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> was sign language. He also noted that Irataba and the Mohave readily began wearing European clothes given to them by members of the expedition, and showed great interest in smoking tobacco. Aside from the friendship shown to him by Irataba and Cairook, Ives noted that the Mohave appeared less friendly than on earlier occasions, a change that he attributed to their contact with Mormons, who were in conflict with the US and had succeeded in converting some Mohave.|$|E
5|$|The {{etymology}} of the term, “gandingan,” {{is unknown}} {{but it appears}} in many Maguindanao folk tales and epics. For instance, one folk tale states the Malailai Gandingan is a place known for a powerful sultan and his beautiful daughter while in another epic, Raja sa Madaya, Gandingan is the proper name of a place where hostile datus (who attempted to abduct a princess from the prince of Madaya) live. Perhaps the most significant mention of the gandingan in an epic tale is in the Maguindanao epic Diwatakasalipan, where word “gandingan” actually refers to the instrument itself. In the epic, a young princess, Tintingan na Bulawan, uses the gandingan to inform her sister, Initulon na Gambal, about a hero prince, Diwatakasalipan, who {{was looking for a}} wife. Thanks to that message, Initulon na Gambal was able to entertain the hero prince using a kulintang into her heart. This use of the gandingan in this epic exemplifies that its use as a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> was pre-Islamic in origin.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project {{is aimed at}} answering the question: What <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> did a music therapy student use in her work with {{high school students who}} have special needs, and why? As <b>communication</b> is one <b>of</b> the primary goals for children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and other learning difficulties, (Gadberry 2011) I, as the music therapy student and researcher explored different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> used in my practice and the reasoning behind them using Secondary Analysis of Data and Thematic Analysis. <b>Forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> discussed include musical communication, social communication, direct instruction, gestures, key signs from New Zealand Sign Language, verbal communication, visual communication, technology and Augmentative and Alternative Communication systems, and combinations of each. The wide variety of reasons for my use <b>of</b> these <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> include, but are not limited to: supporting engagement, encouraging communication, promoting self-regulation, encouraging choice-making and turn-taking, supporting socialization and interaction and reinforcing behavioural messages. The research was informed by my clinical work on placement at a learning support centre for children with special needs at a high school. The concepts of music as therapy and music in therapy are explored in relation to music therapy work involving different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication.</b> My conclusions support the use <b>of</b> various <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> in music therapy in special needs education settings when aligned with a focus on music, improvisation and the individual participant...|$|R

5|$|Touching is an {{important}} <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching {{is especially important for}} mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.|$|E
5|$|Vocalizations made {{by right}} whales are not {{elaborate}} {{compared to those}} made by other whale species. The whales make groans, pops and belches typically at frequencies around 500Hz. The purpose of the sounds is not known but may be a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> between whales within the same group. Northern right whales responded to sounds similar to police sirens—sounds of much higher frequency than their own. On hearing the sounds, they moved rapidly to the surface. The research was of particular interest because northern rights ignore most sounds, including those of approaching boats. Researchers speculate this information {{may be useful in}} attempts {{to reduce the number of}} ship-whale collisions or to encourage the whales to surface for ease of harvesting.|$|E
5|$|Journey is an indie {{video game}} {{developed}} by thatgamecompany {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. It was released on March 13, 2012, via the PlayStation Network. In Journey, the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other's names until after the game's credits. The only <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> {{between the two is}} a musical chime. This chime also transforms dull, stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air. The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player's actions, building a single theme to represent the game's emotional arc throughout the story.|$|E

5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E
