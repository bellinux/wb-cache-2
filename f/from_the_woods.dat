5|$|Evidence of Bronze Age {{settlements}} {{has been}} found within the woods during archaeological excavations.

5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England in 1066, Ernulf de Hesdin {{was given the}} manor of Ruislip, which {{included}} the woods, in recognition of his service to William the Conqueror. In 1087, Ernulf de Hesdin passed the manor to the Bec Abbey. During the Abbey's ownership, timber <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> {{was used in the}} construction of the Tower of London in 1339, Windsor Castle in 1344, the Palace of Westminster in 1346 and the manor of the Black Prince in Kennington. Locally, the Great Barn on the Manor Farm site was constructed of oak <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> King's College, Cambridge became lords of the manor in 1451.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at 8:00 am., some of Frederick's army emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> {{with most}} of Generalleutnant Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz's cavalry {{and the rest of}} his artillery; a short time later, the rest of the Prussians emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> and the Russians {{realized}} it was not a scouting party, but the main army. The Prussians stood ranked for battle, which now began in earnest. Finck's artillery park had been in place since dawn and, at 11:30 am, Moller initiated bombardment of the Russian position from the northern and northeastern ends of the Russian line (now the Russian left). In error, the Russian artillery had faced their batteries to the meadows beyond the Mühlberge, not the ravine, and had to be reset. For 30 minutes, the two sides bombarded each other.|$|E

Jasper proposes getting Syd, a camp guard to whom he frequently sells drugs, to smuggle them into Bexhill masquerading as refugees. The Fishes discover Jasper's house, and the group flees while Jasper stays behind to stall the Fishes. Luke brutally murders Jasper as Theo watches <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under the {{ownership}} of the Bec Abbey, timber <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> around Ruislip – Park Wood, Mad Bess Wood and Copse Wood – {{was used in the}} construction of the Tower of London in 1339, Windsor Castle in 1344, the Palace of Westminster in 1346 and the manor of the Black Prince in Kennington. The woods were coppiced on rotation throughout the years with the timber sold to local tanneries. By the time King's College took ownership of the manor, the woods were let for sport, with pheasants kept for shooting.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the shark kills {{a young boy}} named Alex Kintner and an old man {{not far from the}} shore. A local fisherman, Ben Gardner, is sent by Amity's {{authorities}} to kill the shark but disappears on the water. Brody and deputy Leonard Hendricks find Gardner's boat anchored off-shore, empty, and covered with large bite holes, one of which has a massive shark tooth stuck in it. Blaming himself for these deaths, Brody again tries to close the beaches, while Meadows investigates the Mayor's business contacts to determine why he wants to keep the beaches open. Meadows uncovers links to the Mafia, who pressure Vaughn to keep the beaches open {{in order to protect the}} value of Amity's real estate, in which the Mafia invested a great deal of money. Meadows also recruits marine biologist Matt Hooper <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Woods</b> Hole Institute to advise them on how to deal with the shark.|$|E

40|$|An {{automated}} wood species recognition {{system is}} designed to perform wood inspection at custom checkpoints {{in order to avoid}} illegal logging. The system that includes image acquisition, feature extraction and classification is able to classify <b>the</b> 52 <b>wood</b> species. There are 100 images taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> each <b>wood</b> species is then divided into training and testing samples for classification. In order to differentiate <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> species precisely, an effective feature extractor is necessary to extract the most distinguished features <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> surface. In this research, an Improved Basic Grey Level Aura Matrix (I-BGLAM) technique is proposed to extract 136 features <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> image. <b>The</b> technique has smaller feature dimension and is rotational invariant due to the considered significant feature extract <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> image. Support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> species. <b>The</b> proposed system shows good classification accuracy compared to previous works...|$|R

5|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of French intervention, the British sought to concentrate their land and naval forces in one location, New York City. In May 1778, the British began to evacuate Philadelphia. On 18 May, Washington dispatched Lafayette with a 2,200-man force to reconnoiter near Barren Hill, Pennsylvania. The next day, the British heard that Lafayette had made camp nearby and sent 5,000men to trap and capture him. On 20 May, General Howe led a further 6,000soldiers and ordered an attack on his left flank. The flank scattered, and Lafayette organized a retreat while the British remained indecisive. To feign numerical superiority, Lafayette ordered men to appear <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> on an outcropping (now Lafayette Hill) and to fire upon the British periodically. Lafayette's troops simultaneously escaped via a sunken road, and he was then able to cross Matson's Ford with the remainder of his force.|$|E
5|$|MD 404 enters Caroline County upon {{crossing}} the Tuckahoe Creek, where it becomes Shore Highway. It widens into a four-lane divided highway and emerges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> into agricultural areas, intersecting MD 480 (Ridgely Road) near Hillsboro. Past that intersection, the route heads through {{a mix of}} woods and residences, narrowing back into a two-lane undivided road, before intersecting MD 404 Alt. (Hillsboro Road), where MD 404 heads into a mix of farms and woodland. Unsigned MD 485 (Saathoff Road) loops {{to the south of}} MD 404, returning to the route before the intersection with the southern terminus of MD 312 (Downes Station Road). The route continues to the southeast through farms, heading toward Denton. As the road approaches Denton, it widens into a four-lane divided highway that heads through rural areas with some residences and businesses. MD 404 Bus. (Meeting House Road) splits from MD 404 to head through the center of Denton while MD 404 continues east to bypass Denton to the north.|$|E
5|$|Raya, a young Ukrainian woman, and {{her friend}} Luba are sold to a Bosnian sex-trafficking ring by a relative. Raya escapes with Irka, another girl forced into prostitution, and they are sent to a women's shelter for victims of human trafficking. While {{investigating}} their case, Kathryn uncovers a large-scale sexual slavery ring utilized by international personnel (including Americans). She persuades Raya and Irka to testify against their traffickers in court, guaranteeing their safety; however, an indifferent UN official drops Irka at the border between Bosnia and Serbia when she cannot produce a passport. A corrupt peacekeeper tips off the traffickers, and Raya is recaptured and tortured. Although rescued <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> by Kathryn, Irka is too afraid {{to proceed with the}} trial.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{began on}} 23 June as the English army {{attempted}} to force {{its way across}} the high ground of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir Henry de Bohun, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> of New Park. Edward appears not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − {{at the back of his}} army, rather than the front. His cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.|$|E
5|$|Preceding {{attacks by}} Lee's army had done barely {{anything}} to accomplish Confederate objectives, {{but this did}} not deter Magruder, who rode {{back and forth across}} the battlefield, calling for reinforcements and personally launching unit after unit into a charge of the Union line. At this point, men who had always been directly under Magruder's command began to join the battle. Magruder first encountered some units of Brig. Gen. Robert Toombs. With Toombs's brigade widely dispersed, the individual units Magruder found were not with Toombs himself. Magruder personally led the men in a short-lived charge, followed by a disordered retreat. Other units nominally under Toombs's command appeared, charged and retreated at various times throughout the next few hours, with little or no organization. The brigades of Col. George T. Anderson and Col. William Barksdale emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> to the right of Toombs, but as they did so, Anderson's men also became separated, as the left side outpaced the right. This created an advance with two of Anderson's regiments on the far Confederate left next to Toombs, Barksdale's men in the middle, and three more Anderson regiments on the far right, near the remnants of Wright and Mahone. Anderson's right flank charged, but made it no farther than the foot of the hill before breaking and retreating under a hail of antipersonnel artillery. Anderson's left flank never charged. Barksdale's brigade charged at roughly the same time, and made it considerably farther up the hill, engaging the Union infantry of Brig. Gen. Daniel Butterfield in a firefight that lasted more than an hour.|$|E
25|$|As {{a second}} brigade {{followed}} Hood on his left, the Union troops retreated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> to the plain before the landing, seeking cover {{from the fire}} of Federal gunboats. Whiting employed artillery fire against the gunboats, but his guns had insufficient range, so he disengaged around 2 p.m. Union troops moved back into the woods after the Confederates left, but made no further attempt to advance.|$|E

Continuous fire from the Americans quickly overwhelmed the communists. The company never reported seeing more than a platoon of Viet Cong in the clearing, although many more communists fired <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b>|$|E
25|$|After an {{exchange}} of fire, Gage's advance group fell back. In the narrow confines of the road, they collided with {{the main body of}} Braddock's force, which had advanced rapidly when the shots were heard. The entire column dissolved in disorder as the Canadian militamen and Indians enveloped them and continued to snipe at the British flanks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> {{on the sides of the}} road. At this time, the French regulars began advancing from the road and began to push the British back.|$|E

Although the action was tactically inconclusive, Franklin missed an opportunity to intercept the Confederate retreat from Williamsburg, allowing it to pass unmolested.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{having seen}} the {{movement}} of Ayres's and Crawford's brigades toward the Confederate line, Johnson allowed Hunton's and Stansel's brigades to advance to meet the Union formations even though McGowan's brigade {{on the far right}} was not ready. The Confederates were able to approach the Union force while screened by woods north of White Oak Road. As Ayres's division, led by Winthrop's brigade, advanced across a field toward White Oak Road with the intention of seizing advanced Confederate rifle pits, the Confederates began to fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> {{out of sight of the}} Union force.|$|E
25|$|By 1991, the Zabok {{police had}} set up a team {{dedicated}} to locating and capturing Pintarić. Over time, they learned more about his habits. He was getting increasingly careless, partly due to alcohol abuse. In May 1991 they received an information that Pintarić was visiting his lover Ankica Buhiniček and decided to set up a stakeout on her house near Veliko Trgovišće. On the third night, the policemen saw a man coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and approaching the house. After they radioed for backup, they were joined by a special forces team from Kumrovec, and the compound was quickly surrounded.|$|E

A few minutes before the Confederates appeared <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> at their front, Gregg's brigade moved to the right of Pennington's brigade, in advance of the main Union line and Gibbs's brigade was sent to reunite with Devin's division camped in the rear at Crump's farm.
