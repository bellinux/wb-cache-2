His wife, Pat, was a [...] "computer banging away on a Marchant calculator" [...] at Lincoln Laboratory before it officially took over the Whirlwind computer. Her group used the Servomechanisms Labs analog {{correlation}} computer, built by Norbert Wiener. It had ball-and-disk integrators and arms used to hand trace strip chart curves of radar noise data. When the machine was in use, variables in equations were represented by rotations in its shafts. These were connected with mechanical pens which plot an accurate curve worked out by the shafts continuous movement. Interpreted correctly, this curve gave a <b>graphic</b> <b>solution</b> to the problem. This initiated Ross's entry to the Servo Lab with a summer job in June 1952 in the field of airborne fire control system evaluation and power density spectra analyses.|$|E

Introduction [...] An increasing awareness of the importance of water to local and national welfare has prompted numerous small watershed studies of the relationship between streamflow and forest cover.

The criterion items also included manipulative content, emphasizing the <b>graphic</b> <b>solution</b> of kinematics problems. Relevant technical literature was reviewed, and technical experts consulted.

40|$|There {{are lots}} of surimposed informations on risk maps. Thus, risk data are {{difficult}} to portray. Colour is generally used thanks to its selective, symbolic and aesthetic qualities. We believe that a best use of colour to risk maps could clarify their legibility. Therefore, we propose a model to automatically improve colour contrasts. Our model is based on Itten colour contrasts theory, a German painter of the Bauhaus of the twentieth century. In our model, each graphic sign analyses colour contrasts with its neighbours. Then, this analysis is validated at a more global level. If systematisms are detected, another <b>graphic</b> <b>solution</b> is proposed.

Items were generated based on existing applicant reaction models and interviews held with 250 applicants. Fifty-three Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) sorted and labeled the resulting items. Classical multidimensional scaling and additive tree modeling revealed two-dimensional (CO and PInP) and three-dimensional configurations (CRS), comprising specific regions for each of them.
