2500|$|Cars {{can build}} up static charge by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire {{compounds}} contain enough carbon black {{to provide an}} electrical ground which prevents charge build-up. Newer [...] "high mileage" [...] tires use more silica and can increase the buildup of static. A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a conductive part of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put {{into contact with the}} metallic filler neck of the vehicle. Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this <b>filling</b> <b>operation</b> are below the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the static discharge causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gas cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the loose fit between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich vapor concentration in the ullage (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the nozzle, hose, swivels and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point. The Petroleum Equipment Institute has recorded incidents of static-related ignition at refueling sites since early 2000.|$|E
2500|$|The beach project {{involved}} {{filling in}} approximately [...] of LeRoy's and Pelham Bays with landfill, {{followed by a}} total of [...] of sand brought by barge from Sandy Hook, New Jersey, and the Rockaways in Queens. Moses had originally wanted to use sand for the new land, but thought that waste from the New York City Department of Sanitation would be cheaper to use, so the material of choise was switched to landfill. Work on placing the fill began in early 1935, but officials opposed the use of garbage to fill in the land. The landfill was placed among Rodman's Neck, Twin Island, and Hunter Island. After the garbage began washing onto the beach through the as-yet-incomplete seawall, work on the <b>filling</b> <b>operation</b> was halted. The board allocated $500,000 (...) for [...] of sand, {{and the rest of the}} land reclamation project was done using sand from Sandy Hook and the Rockaways. The sand-filling operations officially began in April 1936. Two seawalls were built: one made of boulders on the east side of the fill facing Pelham Bay, and a smaller wall on the west side facing LeRoy's Bay, now a lagoon. The fill was then landscaped with flowers, shrubs, and various genera of trees, while the naturally planted chestnut, oak, hickory, black locust, and black cherry trees on either side of the fill were kept as is.|$|E

5000|$|In 1998, the Altran Foundation prize {{was awarded}} to the Toulouse-Rangueil University laboratory, and to the Kappa Biotech company [...] for their pain-treatment project based on cell {{micro-encapsulation}}. The micro-encapsulation process stops the organism from rejecting these cells by protecting them in a sphere, thus preventing the immune system from recognizing them. The process involves creating biocompatible micro-membranes which are implanted using in-vitro fertilization technology. Until recently, the implantation posed a number of productivity problems, as it was taking 15 minutes for one micro-membrane to be implanted. Altran teams stepped in to help solve this problem. Their studies demonstrated that the automated implantation option, using a laser optical guidance system, was the most promising approach. With the cooperation of Tarbes E.N.I. students, Altran consultants developed a robot to automate the microcapsule <b>filling</b> <b>operation</b> using a dual-needle system.

5000|$|The flowing {{movement}} of finely powdered substances or low conductivity fluids in pipes or through mechanical agitation can build up static electricity.The flow of granules of material like sand down a plastic chute can transfer charge, {{which can be}} easily measured using a multimeter connected to metal foil lining the chute at intervals, and can be roughly proportional to particulate flow. [...] Dust clouds of finely powdered substances can become combustible or explosive. When there is a static discharge in a dust or vapor cloud, explosions have occurred. Among the major industrial incidents that have occurred are: a grain silo in southwest France, a paint plant in Thailand, a factory making fiberglass moldings in Canada, a storage tank explosion inGlenpool, Oklahoma in 2003, and a portable tank <b>filling</b> <b>operation</b> and a tank farm in Des Moines, Iowa and Valley Center, Kansas in 2007.|$|E

40|$|Issue: Material {{handling}} and compaction procedures usually represent a greater cost in a construction <b>fill</b> <b>operation</b> than the <b>fill</b> material itself. Engineers, permitting authorities, and contractors must {{be familiar with}} proper handling methods and compaction characteristics of fill material so that practical specifications can be written, permits can be issued, costs can be estimated, and the <b>fill</b> <b>operation</b> can be performed. Because recycled glass {{is a relatively new}} fill material for construction applications, it is especially important to understand its handling characteristics. Best Practice: A typical <b>fill</b> <b>operation</b> begins with the preparation of the subgrade on which the fill will be placed and compacted. The subgrade must be firm and dry so that the risk of subgrade settlement is minimal and the fill can absorb the compaction energy. The glass fill may consist of 100 % glass cullet, or a cullet-soil or cullet-gravel mixture. For 100 % cullet, the apparent cohesion, which results from the surface tension of moisture, is low. This means that the material flows relatively freely. Therefore, using hoppers for directing flow {{has been found to be}} efficient and successful. However, some cullet particles are sharp so inflated rubber tires can be punctured and damaged. Experience has indicated that solid rubber tires are a better alternative. The dumped or transported material should be leveled into a horizontal lift 4 to 12 inches thick. Generally...|$|R

According to the simulation results, predicted flow field has a great influence to the silo height and distance to the silo wall due to gravitational force and movement of fugitive dust and re-circulation of air. The results showed that the predicted data were in very good agreement with experimental data obtained from the literature. The maximum error was around 10 %.
