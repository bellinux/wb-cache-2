25|$|Anticipating {{growing demand}} for an {{antivirus}} for a smart TV, some security software companies are already working with partners in digital TV field on the solution. At this moment <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> is only one antivirus for smart TVs available. Ocean Blue Software partnered with Sophos and developed first cloud based antimalware system “Neptune”. Also antivirus company Avira has joined forces with digital TV testing company Labwise {{to work on the}} software that would protect against potential attacks. The privacy policy for Samsung's Smart TVs has been called Orwellian (a reference to George Orwell and the dystopian world of constant surveillance he depicted in 1984), and compared to Telescreens because of eavesdropping concerns.|$|E
500|$|To {{continue}} the tradition, the organization produces 20,500 white towels with the Canucks logo for each playoff game. [...] Following his first playoff game in 2007 Vancouver forward Alex Burrows stated [...] "It {{looks like the}} fans are really into {{the game and the}} atmosphere out there is something else, people are really passionate instead of just sitting and no one moving or anything like some places. It just creates movement and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> is more enthusiasm and intensity in the building." [...] As part of their 40th season celebration the Canucks organization commissioned a permanent statue of Nielson. Standing over 11 feet tall and weighing over 800 pounds the bronze statue depicts Nielson's mock surrender which started towel power.|$|E
500|$|Piccard was {{the mother}} of a house full of boys. Robert R. Gilruth, one of her {{students}} and collaborators, said later in his oral history that he remembered a breakfast he had with the Piccards in a St. Cloud, Minnesota hotel before a balloon launching, [...] "I don't know how many there were. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> was a dozen.... I remember the youngest one took the corn flake box and dumped it on his father's head. Of course, Piccard just brushed it off his head and said, 'No, no.'" [...] "He was very gentle. He loved his boys, and he thought boys would be boys, I guess." [...] The Piccards had three sons of their own, John, Paul, and Donald (who would become a famous balloonist and ballooning innovator in his own right), as well as foster children. The Piccard family archive in the Library of Congress mentions correspondence from foster children whom the Piccards took in, although nothing else seems to be known about them.|$|E

50|$|The {{official}} video {{released by}} Capitol Records for Don't Ask Me, the band's second single, features the band performing {{in a black}} and white room with a backup dancer. The video was edited to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> were multiple backup dancers.|$|R

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may have given us a bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, as it looks like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm curious to see what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home now? <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> should be more to this that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how so much of this story tied back to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want it to end. Sometimes I realize that even an episode I have lots of complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E

50|$|Although {{the episode}} made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> was more debate after Brian {{requested}} his termination, Donald Trump said {{at that point}} that Brian was finished. He then questioned the other team members about issues and problems not related to Brian (mostly Kristen's disrespectful behavior towards the other team members, and Chris's lackluster contribution to the task), before picking up the thread and telling Brian to get lost.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the close}} {{relationship}} between economics, biology and psychology since {{the late nineteenth century}} –the main economic categories have clear psychological connotations– the so called “mainstream” economics has not studied these links systematically. An illustrative account of these interactions between economic theory psychology and biology is presented. In general, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there’s</b> return to the hedonistic logic and a recovery of the utilitarian vision.

5000|$|An {{example of}} false balance is the [...] "debate" [...] on global warming; {{although}} {{the scientific community}} almost unanimously attributes global warming {{to the effects of}} the industrial revolution, there is a very small number, a few dozen scientists out {{of tens of thousands of}} scientists, who dispute the conclusion.

Visions have helped several characters achieve certain tasks. Many spirits have appeared on and off the Island, such as Michael Dawson, Jacob, Emily Linus, Claudia, Ana Lucia, Charlie Pace. Some spirits communicate with the living in their dreams, such as Horace Goodspeed and Boone Carlyle, who each appear to John Locke on separate occasions.|$|E
50|$|This union premium {{wage gap}} can be {{interpreted}} as the adaptations to globalization, technological, and demographic changes. Another argument for this gap between union and non-union wages is the competition between the wages including a foreign competitor, different workplace improvements to enhance productivity, safety in the workplace, and other interests of the workers. Thus higher wages paid in the union sector makes <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>like</b> <b>there</b> is a rationing of union jobs and that the average worker would rather work a union job than a non-union job.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike most {{video game}} websites, Giant Bomb does not heavily cover {{industry}} news {{from a business}} perspective.

[...] "We want {{to get out there and}} talk about games, because we <b>like</b> games…and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>there's</b> an audience out <b>there,</b> and they <b>like</b> games... and their needs aren't being met by what's out there right now." ...|$|R

5000|$|On 4 October, New York University {{professor}} of history Greg Grandin stated that [...] "it's still early to tell exactly what happened" [...] and in his initial analysis said, [...] "the government has made a lot of, I think, accurate accusations {{that it was not}} just a spontaneous social protest against austerity. It was too coordinated. It happened simultaneously in a number of cities, a number of barracks.

Around the same time Dimarzio also sent him several pickup prototypes, of which one design was selected and dubbed [...] "Evolution". Vai then named his favourite of the guitars [...] "Evo" [...] (after the pickups installed in it) so that he could easily distinguish between his aesthetically identical guitars. Vai has played Evo since before the recording of Sex & Religion in 1993.|$|E
