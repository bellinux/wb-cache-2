40|$|Almost nonexistent in {{the early}} 90 s, {{bilateral}} development assistance disbursed through earmarked funds co-managed by multilateral donors is playing an increasing role in the aid landscape. While the importance and popularity of these new instruments among traditional donors have increased, their management, their objectives and their implementation remain largely under-documented. Furthermore, {{the question of the}} geographical allocation of earmarked funds {{is becoming more and more}} important for many stakeholders. We look at the geographic allocation of earmarked multilateral ODA with regard to “performance”, the traditional criterion for aid allocation in most Multilateral Development Banks. Our results show that the multiplication of trust funds tend to undermine the role of performance as a core allocation criterion. We also present evidence that recipient <b>executed</b> <b>trust</b> funds at the World Bank over the period 2009 - 2013 have favored low income and fragile countries despite their low performance. For some countries the share of total aid received from the World Bank beyond the performance based allocation (PBA) is far from negligible. earmarked funds, multilateral assistance, geographical allocatio...|$|E

However, TinyOS, the dominant sensor net OS, lacks basic {{building blocks for}} reliable software systems: memory protection, isolation, and safe termination. These features are typically found in general-purpose operating systems but {{are believed to be}} too expensive for tiny embedded systems with a few kilobytes of RAM. We dispel this notion and show that CCured, a safe dialect of C, can be leveraged to provide memory safety for largely unmodified TinyOS applications. We build upon safety to implement two very different environments for TinyOS applications. The first, Safe TinyOS, provides a minimal kernel for safely <b>executing</b> <b>trusted</b> applications. Safe execution traps and identifies bugs that would otherwise have silently corrupted RAM. The second environment, UTOS, implements a user-kernel boundary that supports isolation and safe termination of untrusted code. Existing TinyOS components can often be ported to UTOS with little effort. To create our environments, we substantially augmented the CCured toolchain to emit code that is safe under interrupt-driven concurrency, to reduce storage requirements by compressing error messages, to refactor direct hardware access into calls to trusted helper functions, and to make safe programs more efficient using whole-program optimization. A surprising result of our work is that a safe, optimized TinyOS program can be faster than the original unsafe, unoptimized application. Memory Safety and Untrusted Extensions for TinyO...|$|R

5000|$|Due to {{the time}} and {{expenses}} associated with the traditional probate process, modern estate planners frequently counsel clients to enact probate avoidance strategies. Some common probate-avoidance strategies include: (1) revocable living trusts, (2) joint ownership of assets and naming death beneficiaries, (3) making lifetime gifts, and (4) purchasing life insurance. If a revocable living trust {{is used as a}} part of an estate plan, the key to probate avoidance is ensuring that the living trust is [...] "funded" [...] during the lifetime of the person establishing the <b>trust.</b> After <b>executing</b> a <b>trust</b> agreement, the settlor should ensure that all assets are properly re-registered {{in the name of the}} living trust.
