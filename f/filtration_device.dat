50|$|Because {{of their}} {{electrostatic}} charge, radon progenies adhere to surfaces or dust particles, whereas gaseous radon does not. Attachment removes {{them from the}} air, usually causing the equilibrium factor in the atmosphere {{to be less than}} one. The equilibrium factor is also lowered by air circulation or air <b>filtration</b> <b>devices,</b> and is increased by airborne dust particles, including cigarette smoke. In high concentrations, airborne radon isotopes contribute significantly to human health risk. The equilibrium factor found in epidemiological studies is 0.4.|$|R
5000|$|The Cold Filter Plugging Point (CFPP) {{is based}} on a {{standardized}} test that indicates the rate at which diesel fuel will flow through a standardized <b>filtration</b> <b>device</b> in a specified length of time when cooled under certain conditions. Similarly the [...] "Low Temperature Flow Test" [...] (ASTM D4539) indicates the winter performance of diesel with improver additives. Note that both the CFPP and LTFT temperature is some degrees above the Pour Point temperature at which diesel fuel loses its fluid character and that pumps would stop operating.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} point-of-care work {{involving}} a capillary pressure-related design component is {{the separation of}} plasma from whole blood by filtration through porous membrane. Efficient and high-volume separation of plasma from whole blood is often necessary for infectious disease diagnostics, like the HIV viral load test. However, this task is often performed through centrifugation, which is limited to clinical laboratory settings. An example of this point-of-care <b>filtration</b> <b>device</b> is a packed-bed filter, which has demonstrated the ability to separate plasma and whole blood by utilizing asymmetric capillary forces within the membrane pores.|$|E
50|$|Another {{part of this}} {{initiative}} is to effectively utilize wastewater for energy and nutrients. A Philadelphia-based company called NovaThermal Energy partnered with Philadelphia Water on a project that warms a building with heat derived from sewage. This building is the Southeast Water Pollution Control Facility in Philadelphia. A sewage channel adjacent to the building transfers heat into a 1 million BTU/hour unit located in the building's basement. This geothermal system utilizes a {{water source heat pump}} complete with a <b>filtration</b> <b>device</b> to transfer heat energy from the sewage channels that are already in the ground, unlike costly geothermal wells which must be dug for a similar heating process.|$|E

50|$|Water <b>filtration</b> <b>devices</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly common in households. Most of these devices do not distill water, though there {{continues to be an}} increase in consumer-oriented water distillers and reverse osmosis machines being sold and used. Municipal water supplies often add or have trace impurities at levels that are regulated to be safe for consumption. Much of these additional impurities, such as volatile organic compounds, fluoride, and an estimated 75,000+ other chemical compounds are not removed through conventional filtration; however, distillation and reverse osmosis eliminate nearly all of these impurities.|$|R

Vestergaard also initiates programs to enhance delivery of its products: the company bundles LifeStraw and PermaNet together into a CarePack of preventive health tools {{to encourage people to}} get tested for HIV; LifeStraw has been distributed as part of the LifeStraw Carbon for Water program, where nearly 900,000 water purifiers were distributed in Kenya through funding provided by carbon offsets.|$|E
50|$|In the {{biomedical}} sciences, PVDF {{is used in}} immunoblotting as {{an artificial}} membrane (usually with 0.22 or 0.45 micrometre pore sizes), on which proteins are transferred using electricity (see western blotting). PVDF is resistant to solvents and, therefore, these membranes can be easily stripped and reused {{to look at other}} proteins. PVDF membranes may be used in other biomedical applications as part of a membrane <b>filtration</b> <b>device,</b> often {{in the form of a}} syringe filter or wheel filter. The various properties of this material, such as heat resistance, resistance to chemical corrosion, and low protein binding properties, make this material valuable in the biomedical sciences for preparation of medications as a sterilizing filter, and as a filter to prepare samples for analytical techniques such as HPLC, where small amounts of particulate matter can damage sensitive and expensive equipment.|$|E
50|$|Pinhole leaks with pitting {{initiating}} on {{the exterior}} surface of the pipe, can occur if copper piping is improperly grounded or bonded. The phenomenon is known technically as stray current corrosion or electrolytic pitting. Pin-holing due to poor grounding or poor bonding occurs typically in homes where the original plumbing has been modified; homeowners may find that a new plastic water <b>filtration</b> <b>device</b> or plastic repair union has interrupted the water pipe's electrical continuity to ground, when they start seeing pinhole water leaks after a recent install. Damage occurs rapidly, usually becoming obvious about {{six months after the}} ground interruption. Correctly installed plumbing appliances will have a copper bonding jumper cable connecting the interrupted pipe sections. Pinhole leaks from stray current corrosion can result in thousands of dollars in plumbing bills, and sometimes require the replacement of the entire affected water line. The cause is fundamentally an electrical defect, not a plumbing defect; once the plumbing damage is repaired, an electrician should promptly be consulted to evaluate the grounding and bonding of the entire plumbing and electrical systems.|$|E

Unlike most studies at mesoscopic level, this theory focuses on the macroscopic group behavior of DNA transportation. It is therefore easier to conduct validation analysis through comparison with experimental results. It is also promising in design and optimization of DNA <b>filtration</b> <b>devices</b> through computer simulation...|$|R
5000|$|Often {{the reason}} for having a pond in a garden is to keep fish, often koi, though many people keep goldfish. Both are hardy, {{colorful}} fish which require no special heating, provided the pond is located in an area which does not have extremes of temperature that would affect the fish. If fish are kept, pumps and <b>filtration</b> <b>devices</b> are usually {{needed in order to}} keep enough oxygen in the water to support them.

40|$|In a {{companion}} paper, {{we used a}} simulation model to explore secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposures for typical conditions in residences. In the current paper, we extend this analysis {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of physical mitigation approaches in reducing nonsmokers' exposure to airborne SHS particulate matter in a hypothetical 6 -zone house. Measures investigated included closing doors or opening windows in response to smoking activity, modifying location patterns to segregate the nonsmoker and the active smoker, and operating particle <b>filtration</b> <b>devices.</b> We first performed 24 scripted simulation trials using hypothetical patterns of occupant location. We then performed cohort simulation trials across 25 mitigation scenarios using over 1, 000 pairs of nonsmoker and smoker time-location patterns that were selected from a survey of human activity patterns in US homes. We limited cohort pairs to cases where more than 10 cigarettes were smoked indoors at home each day and the nonsmoker was at home for more than two thirds of the day. We evaluated the effectiveness of each mitigation approach by examining its impact on the simulated frequency distribution of residential SHS particle exposure. The two most effective strategies were the isolation of the smoker in a closed room with an open window, and a ban on smoking whenever the nonsmoker was at home. The use of open windows to supply local or cross ventilation, or the operation of portable <b>filtration</b> <b>devices</b> in smoking rooms, provided moderate exposure reductions. Closed doors, by themselves, were not effective...|$|R
