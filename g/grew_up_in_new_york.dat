2500|$|... itself. More {{than half}} of all Dominican Americans live in New York City, with the largest {{concentration}} in the neighborhood of Washington Heights in northern Manhattan. Over the past decade, the Dominican Republic has become the largest source of immigration to New York City, and today the metropolitan area of New York has a larger Dominican population than any city except Santo Domingo. Dominican communities have also developed in New Jersey (particularly Paterson), Miami, Boston, Philadelphia, Providence, Rhode Island, and Lawrence, Massachusetts. In addition, tens of thousands of Dominicans and their descendants live in Puerto Rico. Many Dominicans arrive in Puerto Rico illegally by sea across the Mona Passage, some staying and some moving on to the mainland U.S. (See Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico.) Dominicans living abroad sent an estimated $3 billion in remittances to relatives at home, in 2006. In 1997, a new law took effect, allowing Dominicans living abroad to retain their citizenship and vote in presidential elections. President Fernández, who <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> was the principal beneficiary of this law.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was born}} Max Harrison, the {{youngest}} child and only son of Benjamin Harrison (February 1868 – 1933) and Pauline Harrison (July 1870–?), Jewish immigrants from Lithuania (then the Russian Empire). Max <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City, first in lower Manhattan {{and later the}} Bronx, with three sisters, who doted on “the baby” of the family. As a young child Max decided to replace his birth name with [...] "Robert." [...] Early on Robert appeared magnanimous, if only due to a tendency to quickly forget slights as he could be not bothered {{to focus on the}} negative. In school he did poorly at math but well at English. He wanted to write for a living. At the age of 12 he authored and published a travel guide to roadside inns, Harrison's Weekend Guide. After the printer refused to give Harrison his share of the profits, Harrison formed a belief that one could only trust family members, whom he would later employ in various publishing projects. But years later, his generous nature would lead him to make an exception {{at the height of his}} success with an ex-McCarthyite editor with deadly repercussions.|$|E
