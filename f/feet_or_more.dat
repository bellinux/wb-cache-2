5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> {{by the end of this}} century.|$|E

The Central and Eastern {{portions}} of Rapid City lie in the wide valley of Rapid Creek outside the Hogback, which includes a number of mesas rising a hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> above the floodplain.|$|E
25|$|The 1993 Superstorm brought {{blizzard}} {{conditions to}} the panhandle, while heavy rain and tornadoes beset the peninsula. The storm {{is believed to}} have been similar in composition to a hurricane, some Gulf coast regions even seeing storm surges of six <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> More recently, traces of snow and sleet fell across central and southern Florida during a hard freeze event in January, 2010. There was some slight accumulation north of the I-4 corridor, mostly in the form of sleet.|$|E

25|$|Saltwater {{fishing boats}} vary widely {{in size and}} can be {{specialized}} for certain species of fish. Flounder boats, for example, have flat bottoms for a shallow draft and are used in protected, shallow waters. Sport fishing boats range from 25 to 80 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> and can be powered by large outboard engines or inboard diesels. Boats used for fishing in cold climates may have space dedicated to a cuddy cabin or enclosed wheelhouse, while boats in warmer climates {{are more likely to}} be open.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the Second World War, {{more than}} 8,000 aircrew and 5,000 civilians had been rescued, and the MCS had some 300 HSLs and over a {{thousand}} other vessels, located not just in the waters around the United Kingdom, but everywhere around the world. The largest fleet of such rescue craft in the world. This fleet and the RAF sailors that crewed it would contract as Britain entered peacetime, however it continued be found everywhere that the RAF flew over water. On 11 December 1947 the MCS was granted full branch status and on 25 June 1948 the largest of its vessels, of 68 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> were, granted the ship prefix His Majesty's Air Force Vessel (HMAFV).|$|E
25|$|The {{meanings}} of the designs on totem poles are {{as varied as the}} cultures that make them. Some poles celebrate cultural beliefs that may recount familiar legends, clan lineages, or notable events, while others are mostly artistic. Animals and other characters carved on the pole are typically used as symbols to represent characters or events in a story; however, some may reference the moiety of the pole’s owner, or simply fill up empty space on the pole. The carved figures interlock, one above the other, to create the overall design, which may rise to a height of sixty <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> Smaller carvings may be positioned in vacant spaces, or they may be tucked inside the ears or hang out of the mouths of the pole’s larger figures.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) {{conducted}} {{a series of}} extensive field tests of roads and bridges to determine how traffic contributed to the deterioration of pavement materials. In 1964, the AASHTO recommended to Congress that a bridge formula table be used instead of a single gross weight limit for trucks. The Federal-Aid Highway Act Amendments of 1974 established the bridge formula as law, along with the gross weight limit of [...] [...] Current applications of the formula allow for up to 7 axles and 86 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> length between axle sets, and a maximum load of 105,500lbs.|$|E
500|$|There {{are five}} stages to the {{waterspout}} life cycle. [...] Initially, a prominent circular, light-colored disk {{appears on the}} surface of the water, surrounded by a larger dark area of indeterminate shape. After the formation of these colored disks on the water, a pattern of light and dark-colored spiral bands develop from the dark spot on the water surface. [...] Then, a dense [...] of sea spray, called a cascade, appears around the dark spot with what appears to be an eye. [...] Eventually, the waterspout becomes a visible funnel from the water surface to the overhead cloud. [...] The spray vortex can rise to a height of several hundred <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> and often creates a visible wake and an associated wave train as it moves. [...] Eventually, the funnel and spray vortex begin to dissipate as the inflow of warm air into the vortex weakens, ending the waterspout's life cycle.|$|E

2500|$|The {{distance}} between the bases is 60 feet and {{the distance from the}} pitcher's mound to home plate is 46 feet. [...] Outfield fences must be at least 165 feet from home plate, but are usually 200 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> (the fields at the Williamsport complex have fences 225 feet away). [...] The bases and pitching rubber are also slightly smaller than in standard baseball.

2500|$|A major asset of the Canadian River Valley was {{the large}} {{deposits}} of colorful Alibates flint {{that could be}} chipped into tools and weapons and traded to other cultures. [...] The present day Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument preserves more than 700 quarries where the Indians dug out the flint. [...] Most of the quarries are holes six <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> in diameter and four to eight feet deep.

[...] Alibates flint tools have been found up to one thousand miles away.|$|E
2500|$|A sea cave, {{also known}} as a {{littoral}} cave, is a type of cave formed primarily by the wave action of the sea. The primary process involved is erosion. [...] Sea caves are found throughout the world, actively forming along present coastlines and as relict sea caves on former coastlines. Some of the largest wave-cut caves in the world are found on the coast of Norway, but are now 100 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> above present sea level. These would still be classified as littoral caves. By contrast, in places like Thailand's Phang Nga Bay, solutionally formed caves in limestone have been flooded by the rising sea and are now subject to littoral erosion, representing a new phase of their enlargement.|$|E
50|$|The key to {{stopping}} or rescuing a broach is to depower {{the sails}} {{at the first}} opportunity. This may be done by releasing the main or jib sheet by a <b>foot</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>or</b> by releasing the boom vang (kicking strap) which will spill wind {{out of the top}} of the mainsail. The main means of preventing a broach is to ensure that the amount of sail set is reduced to suit the sailing conditions.|$|R

2500|$|Coastal {{areas may}} be flooded by storm events at sea, {{resulting}} in waves over-topping defenses or in severe cases by tsunami or tropical cyclones. A storm surge, from either a tropical cyclone or an extratropical cyclone, falls within this category. Research from the NHC (National Hurricane Center) explains: [...] "Storm surge is an abnormal rise of water {{generated by a}} storm, {{over and above the}} predicted astronomical tides. Storm surge {{should not be confused with}} storm tide, which is defined as the water level rise due to the combination of storm surge and the astronomical tide. This rise in water level can cause extreme flooding in coastal areas particularly when storm surge coincides with normal high tide, resulting in storm tides reaching up to 20 <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> in some cases." ...|$|E
2500|$|Only the Goal Attack and Goal Shooter {{are able}} to score goals directly, and this may only be done {{from the inside of}} the semicircle. The job of the Goal Defence and Goal Keeper is to block the Goal Attack and Goal Shooter from shooting; however, they must be three <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> away from the landing foot of the shooter, {{otherwise}} it is called an obstruction. In this penalty situation, the Goal Keeper or Goal Defence must stand by the shooter's side for a penalty pass or shot, and must remain out of play until the ball is thrown. A ball that passes through the hoop, but has been thrown either from outside the circle or by a player other than the two shooters, is deemed a [...] "no goal". Furthermore, a shooter (GA or GS) may not shoot for a goal if a [...] "free pass" [...] has been awarded for an infringement such as stepping, offside, or using the post.|$|E
2500|$|On March 1, 2009 it was {{reported}} that free agent defensive end Corey Smith (who played for the Lions from 2006–2008) boarded a fishing boat off the Gulf Coast of Florida with former teammate Marquis Cooper (most recently of the Oakland Raiders) and former University of South Florida players Nick Schuyler and William Blakely on February 28. Smith and Cooper played together on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2004. They did not return as expected and the men and their boat were searched for by the U.S. Coast Guard for three days. The National Weather Service said waves were about two to four feet Saturday morning and increased to between three and five feet in the afternoon. Late Saturday night, a small craft advisory was issued, when winds were around twenty knots and waves were up to seven <b>feet</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> On March 2, at approximately 1:30pm, Coast Guard Petty Official James Harless reported that Schuyler had been found alive [...] "clinging to an overturned vessel". He was later diagnosed with hypothermia and dehydration.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2008, the area, once again, {{became the}} victim of massive flooding, as a {{spillway}} off the river, known as Flint Creek, {{as well as a}} small pool area, known as Dumbbell Lake, jumped their banks, after a week of hard rain, caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ike. Tama Road was severely damaged due to the raging flood waters, and was caught {{on both sides of the}} road. The flood was so severe, that the earthen embankments eroded, and the concrete road bed fractured, and crumbled, causing widespread damage over the two mile length of the road. As of December 2008, the road remains closed due to massive damage. In several areas along County Highway 99, the flood waters came against the high embankments, making the fields on the east side of the road appear to be nothing more than a large lake area for an estimated five miles, the flooding could also be seen along certain areas of U.S. Highway 61, at the north end of town. Although neither highway was flooded out, or closed, the damage was noticeable, especially where County Highway 99 was at its most vulnerable, two of the four piers constructed for a new bridge near the northern county line were knocked over by the water, and had to be rebuilt. As of December, 2009, Tama Road still remains unpaved, with gravel filling in the areas where the old concrete road bed had given out. In the areas where the road had been destroyed, a difference in road height of three <b>feet,</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> is instantly noticeable. Continuing arguments between the Burlington City Council, and the Des Moines County Board of Supervisors over responsibility of the road prevents any repairs from taking place (in the mid-1970s, the city had paved the road in concrete, taking responsibility from the county, the city's argument is that the road sits outside of the city limits, and therefore, the county is responsible). Finally, in [...] early 2010, after a final winter thaw eroded the roadbed even further, completely destroying what was left of the road, the state stepped in, and took over the reconstruction, billing the city for their services. The road was opened later that same year, completely repaved, and set with a new waterproof concrete roadbed, and several new drainage culverts.|$|E
