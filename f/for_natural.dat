25|$|The {{method of}} {{infinite}} descent {{was one of}} Pierre de Fermat's favorites. This method of proof can assume several slightly different forms. For example, it might begin by showing that if a statement is true <b>for</b> a <b>natural</b> number n {{it must also be}} true <b>for</b> some smaller <b>natural</b> number m (m < n). Using mathematical induction (implicitly) with the inductive hypothesis being that the statement is false <b>for</b> all <b>natural</b> numbers {{less than or equal to}} m, one may conclude that the statement cannot be true <b>for</b> any <b>natural</b> number n.|$|R

5|$|A population's genetic {{variation}} can be greatly reduced by a bottleneck, and even beneficial adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss of variation leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or {{shift in the}} available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient {{genetic variation}} in the population <b>for</b> <b>natural</b> selection to take place.|$|E

5|$|A second auction was held, with bids <b>for</b> <b>natural</b> gas given equal {{weight to}} those wishing to {{transfer}} crude oil, although any natural gas bidder would {{be obliged to}} maintain the oil pumping stations {{for use in a}} national emergency. Ten bids were received and on February 8, 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation (TETCO) was declared successful. Its bid of $143,127,000 would make the disposal the largest sale of war-surplus property to the private sector following World War II.|$|E
5|$|After the earthquake, several {{websites}} speculated {{about whether}} hydraulic fracturing (fracking) <b>for</b> <b>natural</b> gas production {{could have caused}} or contributed to the quake. There were not any fracking operations in Virginia {{at the time of}} the quake. The nearest fracking was occurring in the Marcellus shale in West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants are {{frequently}} added to industrial products.

5|$|Both {{families}} were largely Unitarian, though the Wedgwoods were adopting Anglicanism. Robert Darwin, himself quietly a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles {{already had a}} taste <b>for</b> <b>natural</b> history and collecting {{when he joined the}} day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{of animals}} and plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available <b>for</b> <b>natural</b> selection.|$|E

The gabled roof design is intended to fit in with the other buildings in Sullivans Cove including PW1, Elizabeth Street Pier and the Mac02 Cruise Terminal– which themselves are based on the historic use of the area as a freight port.|$|E
