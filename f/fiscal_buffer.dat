40|$|At {{moderate}} levels, debt improves {{welfare and}} enhances growth. But high levels can be damaging. When does debt go from good to bad? We address this question {{using a new}} dataset that includes the level of government, non-financial corporate and household debt in 18 OECD countries from 1980 to 2010. Our results support the view that, beyond a certain level, debt is a drag on growth. For government debt, the threshold is around 85 % of GDP. The immediate implication is that countries with high debt must act quickly and decisively to address their fiscal problems. The longer-term lesson is that, to build the <b>fiscal</b> <b>buffer</b> required to address extraordinary events, governments should keep debt well below the estimated thresholds. Our examination {{of other types of}} debt yields similar conclusions. When corporate debt goes beyond 90 % of GDP, it becomes a drag on growth. And for household debt, we report a threshold around 85 % of GDP, although the impact is very imprecisely estimated. * Cecchetti is Economic Adviser at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and Head of its Monetary an...|$|E
40|$|Discusses {{the outlook}} for and drivers of Australian Government {{spending}} to help inform discussion about the sustainability of spending over the medium term. Overview Comprehensive information on trends in and key drivers of government spending is important for {{an understanding of the}} level of sustainability of government spending and the future direction of fiscal policy. This is the second PBO report on Australian Government spending. The first report examined historical trends in government spending over the decade 2002 - 03 to 2012 - 13. The real growth in Australian Government spending over the past decade (annual average 3. 6 per cent) was significantly greater than real economic growth (annual average 3. 0 per cent). The strong growth in Australia’s national income (and nominal GDP, a key driver of revenue growth) from the historic surge in Australia’s terms of trade broadly offset this spending growth, with the ratio of Australian Government spending to nominal GDP being about the same in 2012 - 13 as it was in 2002 - 03. This report discusses {{the outlook for}} and drivers of Australian Government spending over the medium term – the period 2012 - 13 to 2024 - 25. The projected continuing decline in the terms of trade from its historical highs, and the depressing impact this will have on nominal GDP, mean that if government spending as a share of the economy is not to rise over the medium term, it will require real growth in spending to be significantly slower than growth in real GDP. The Australian Government’s medium term projections are for a substantial slowing in the real growth in Australian Government spending compared with the past decade, with real spending growth (annual average growth 2. 6 per cent) significantly lower than real economic growth (annual average 3. 2 per cent) over the medium term. Even with this reduction in the pace of spending growth, the projected ratio of Australian Government spending to nominal GDP over the medium term is, on average, about the same as in the past decade. This report analyses what is driving the reduction in growth in Australian Government spending over the medium term by a detailed assessment of twenty-one programs that account for around three-quarters of projected government spending and nearly all (95 per cent) of the growth in total spending over the medium term. Sheer arithmetic dictates that {{it is very difficult to}} reduce overall growth in Australian Government spending without reducing the pace of spending in these programs. Based on current policy settings, the PBO’s medium term projections show that growth in spending on ten programs that grew rapidly over the past decade will be constrained to less than real GDP growth over the next decade. These programs are Family Tax Benefit, higher education, Medicare, public hospitals, Age Pension, Private Health Insurance Rebate, Disability Support Pension, government superannuation, public debt interest and Official Development Assistance. However, there are a number of challenges to achieving these lower growth spending outcomes. The sustained period of strong growth in Australian Government spending over the past decade can reasonably be expected to have lifted the Australian community’s expectations of continuing higher levels of government services and benefits over the medium term. Realising the projected slowing in the pace of growth of Australian Government spending implies successfully adjusting these expectations. The PBO’s projections are based on current government policy and assume no new policy decisions in the future to expand or enhance Australian Government payments. However, this runs counter to experience over the past decade where there were significant discretionary increases in spending on a range of programs, including Age Pension, Family Tax Benefit, Disability Support Pension, carer income support, child care, Medicare and higher education. Additionally, the projected slower spending growth over the medium term is dependent on 2014 - 15 Budget savings measures, most of which are yet to be legislated. Nearly all of the programs that are projected to grow at a slower pace over the medium term assume the implementation of savings measures that are yet to be legislated. Savings measures in these programs are projected to reduce spending over the medium term, with an impact of $ 19 billion or 0. 7 per cent of GDP in 2024 - 25. The slower growth in Australian Government spending over the medium term also reflects significantly reduced growth in Commonwealth funding for schools and hospitals from 2017 - 18. In practice, this may result in a shift in the funding responsibility for these programs from the Commonwealth to the States rather than an overall reduction in the growth of government spending in these areas. In particular, the expected growth in demand for hospital services over the medium term is likely to place increasing pressure on State budgets. Programs projected to grow faster over the medium term than over the past decade include defence, GST transfers to States, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the expanded Paid Parental Leave scheme. However, reducing spending in some of these programs would not result in a net saving to the budget, due to related, broadly offsetting revenue items and/or other spending offsets. In particular, the largest contribution to Australian Government spending over the medium term is GST transfers to the States, which in effect mirrors GST collections. While the National Disability Insurance Scheme and expanded Paid Parental Leave scheme are significant contributors to spending growth over the medium term, together accounting for 19 per cent of the growth in total spending, the net impact of this spending on the budget is reduced by levies, contributions from State and Territory Governments, and reductions in other Australian Government programs. The above challenges to achieving lower spending growth mean that actual spending outcomes could exceed the projections contained in this report which, given current revenue projections, could place fiscal sustainability at risk. To the extent that the projected reduction in Australian Government spending growth is not achieved over the medium term, an even greater share of the burden of fiscal consolidation would need to fall on the revenue side of the budget. That said, the Australian Government’s medium term budget projections already assume a significant increase in revenue with tax receipts projected to rise from 21. 4 per cent of GDP in 2012 - 13 to 23. 9 per cent of GDP in 2019 - 20, and remaining at that level over the medium term. Moreover, there are risks to the economic outlook over the medium term due to uncertainties in the international outlook and as the Australian economy transitions out of the resources investment boom to broader based growth in the non-resources sectors. These risks reinforce the need for fiscal consolidation in order to establish a <b>fiscal</b> <b>buffer</b> against the possibility of adverse economic shocks...|$|E

40|$|Natural {{resource}} {{revenues are}} {{an increasingly important}} financing source for public investment in many developing economies. Investing volatile resource revenues, however, may subject an economy to macroeconomic instability. This paper applies to Angola the fiscal framework developed in Berg et al. (forthcoming) that incorporates investment inefficiency and absorptive capacity constraints, often encountered in developing countries. The sustainable investing approach, which combines a stable fiscal regime with external savings, can convert resource wealth to development gains while maintaining economic stability. Stochastic simulations demonstrate how the framework {{can be used to}} inform allocations between capital spending and external savings when facing uncertain oil revenues. An overly aggressive investment scaling-up path could result in insufficient <b>fiscal</b> <b>buffers</b> when faced with negative oil price shocks. Consequently, investment progress can be interrupted, driving up the capital depreciation rate, undermining economic stability, and lowering the growth benefits of public investment...|$|R
40|$|The {{euro area}} {{sovereign}} debt crisis has highlighted {{the importance of}} reducing public debt levels and building up sufficient <b>fiscal</b> <b>buffers</b> during normal and good times. It has also reaffirmed {{the need for a}} thorough debt sustainability analysis (DSA) to act as a warning system for national policies. This paper introduces a comprehensive DSA framework for euro area sovereigns {{that could be used for}} analysis of fiscal risks and vulnerabilities. Specifically, this framework consists of three main building blocks: (i) a deterministic DSA, which embeds debt simulations under a benchmark and various narrative shock scenarios; (ii) a stochastic DSA, providing for a probabilistic approach to debt sustainability; and (iii) other relevant indicators capturing liquidity and solvency risks. The information embedded in the three main DSA blocks can be summarised in a heat map, which can provide guidance on the overall assessment of risks to debt sustainability. This method reflects the need to have a broad-based assessment, cross-checking information and perspectives from various sources with a view to deriving a robust debt sustainability assessment...|$|R

A Statement by the Executive Director for Australia. Key issues Context. With GDP growth below trend and the investment phase of the mining boom having passed its peak and beginning to decline, a key issue is how Australia can manage the mining-production/export phase and encourage broader-based growth. The main external risks include a slowdown in China over the medium term and surges in global financial market volatility. The pickup in housing market activity, though welcome to date, could pose a future risk if prices accelerate and lead to overshooting. Near-term macroeconomic policy mix. With the exchange rate still moderately overvalued and weighing on non-mining activity, accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate. Monetary policy should remain the primary macroeconomic tool for managing aggregate demand, although there is fiscal policy space to respond {{in the event of a}} deterioration in the outlook. Medium-term fiscal policy. The government’s aim to return the budget to surplus over the medium term would help rebuild <b>fiscal</b> <b>buffers.</b> Staff’s analysis shows that without increases in revenue this would require sizeable cuts in projected spending. Financial stability. The financial sector is resilient and has strengthened in recent years, although banks’ reliance on offshore funding will continue. The emphasis on tight lending standards and intensive supervision should help limit financial sector risks. Transition to broader-based growth. Higher resource exports will make the economy more sensitive to terms of trade shocks, and the floating exchange rate will be an essential buffer. Robust income growth over the past decade was supported by the sharp increase in the terms of trade. As this effect unwinds, a significant pickup in productivity will be needed to maintain growth in living standards...|$|R
30|$|These four {{previous}} economic explanations {{explore the}} resource curse {{from a similar}} viewpoint by investigating how resource exports influence the domestic economic structure. They all {{assume the role of}} government as a constant, that is, governments have neither willingness nor capacity to mitigate those adverse effects brought by natural resources. This assumption runs counter to the reality that most resource-rich governments actually have a large say in their resource sector and have the policy tools to intervene. For instance, governments can use their natural windfalls to invest in and promote manufacturing and agricultural sectors, they can increase foreign currency reserves to prevent their real exchange rates from appreciating, and they could set up stabilization funds and use careful <b>fiscal</b> policies to <b>buffer</b> against the vicissitudes of international commodity markets (Ross 1999).|$|R
40|$|Since the EMU {{members have}} {{abandoned}} their national monetary policies and their exchange rate such as adjustment mechanisms, they search {{a solution to}} protect them from shocks, and especially from country-specific shocks. This implies a limited role to asymmetric shocks regulation as monetary policy is common. Moreover, European labour markets are sufficiently rigid that stabilization is an useful intervention. Regions suffering therefore from asymmetric shocks might need to turn more to <b>fiscal</b> stabilization to <b>buffer</b> shocks. In fact, the need for stabilization is only based on cyclical asymmetric shocks, called asymmetric hazards too. Under these conditions, we propose an automatic mechanism that implies fiscal flows according to asymmetric hazards. There are transfers between countries which positive hazards and the one which have negative hazards. The proposed mechanism respects european financial constraints since it is include in European budget at constant size. It is shown in this paper that effective stabilization can be achieved indeed with an estimated annual cost of only 0, 14 % of European GDP. Moreover, this mechanism has no redistributive effect and no moral hazard. fiscal stabilization, asymmetric shocks, EMU, mechanism...|$|R
