Brazilian Formula One driver Felipe Massa had a black stripe {{on top of his}} helmet during the 2007 European Grand Prix, to commemorate the victims. Rubens Barrichello also had stripes on his <b>helmet,</b> <b>and</b> the two Red Bull Racing drivers David Coulthard and Mark Webber had small Brazilian flags on their helmets {{referring}} to the accident.|$|E
5|$|Deep sea diving is {{underwater}} diving, {{usually with}} surface supplied equipment, and often {{refers to the}} use of standard diving dress with the traditional copper helmet. Hard hat diving is any form of diving with a helmet, including the standard copper <b>helmet,</b> <b>and</b> other forms of free-flow and lightweight demand helmets.|$|E
50|$|Before the season, {{the team}} changed from white <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> powder blue jerseys—which it had had since its {{inception}} in 1960—to royal blue <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> jerseys. Players' uniform numbers were also removed from the helmets. The royal blue would remain through 1984, when the <b>helmets</b> <b>and</b> jerseys became a darker shade of blue; that blue became even darker in 1988. The Chargers switched back permanently to modified white helmets in 2007.|$|R

In the attack on Gravenstafel Spur on 4October 1917 Gallaher was wounded by a piece of shrapnel that penetrated through his <b>helmet,</b> <b>and</b> he died later that day at the 3rd Australian Casualty Clearing Station, Gravenstafel Spur.

Jones was pronounced dead at the scene. He was wearing a <b>helmet,</b> <b>and</b> alcohol was not a factor. The accident is still under investigation.|$|E

5|$|A mentally {{unbalanced}} Ricky Williams (David Baxt) {{is driven}} to re-enter the caves when {{a sample of}} crystals pulsates and the chemical intelligence exerts its influence through a mark on his arm. Thrown into a grille in a compromised environmental suit, Gail (Rosalind Lloyd) removes her <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> freezes {{to death in the}} toxic atmosphere while trying to amputate her trapped foot with a chainsaw. Documentation officer Kate Frost (Stephanie Beacham) shoots Ricky with a harpoon gun before he opens both the inner and outer airlock doors and renders the air inside the base unbreathable.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the revolutionary}} {{features}} of the Apache was its helmet mounted display, the Integrated <b>Helmet</b> <b>and</b> Display Sighting System (IHADSS); among its capabilities, either the pilot or gunner can slave the helicopter's 30mm automatic M230 Chain Gun to their helmet, making the gun track head movements to point where they look. The M230E1 can be alternatively fixed to a locked forward firing position, or controlled via the Target Acquisition and Designation System (TADS). On more modern AH-64s, the TADS/PNVS {{has been replaced by}} Lockheed Martin's Arrowhead (MTADS) targeting system.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{includes}} a depiction of the city wall, and two silver strips representing the River Avon and the hot springs. The sword of St. Paul is a link to Bath Abbey. The supporters, a lion and a bear, stand {{on a bed of}} acorns, a link to Bladud, the subject of the Legend of Bath. The knight's helmet indicates a municipality and the crown is that of King Edgar (referencing his coronation at the Abbey). A mural crown, indicating a city, is alternatively used instead of the <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> Edgar's crown.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{head-up display}} simulates {{the inside of}} Samus's <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> {{features}} a radar, map, missile ammunition meter and health meter. Several visors are available, and each performs a different function. One, also seen in the previous game, is a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses, interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators and retrieves text entries from certain sources. The others reveal and highlight interdimensional objects or cloaked enemies, and create a visual representation of sound.|$|E

5|$|Three {{distinct}} {{types of}} archers are shown on Trajan's Column: (a) with scalar cuirass, conical steel <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> cloak; (b) without armour, with cloth conical cap and long tunic; or (c) equipped {{in the same}} way as general auxiliary foot-soldiers (apart from carrying bows instead of javelins). The first type were probably Syrian or Anatolian units; the third type probably Thracian. The standard bow used by Roman auxilia was the recurved composite bow, a sophisticated, compact and powerful weapon.|$|E
5|$|After a short halt {{to leave}} their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army quickly {{advanced}} on the Byzantines, shooting arrows as they approached. The Byzantines responded in kind and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy. On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw {{what had happened and}} reacted quickly. He gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself. The ruse worked: the men recognized the <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> returned to order just in time to stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} five, Thrud is sent to Crom the Destroyer Orthodox Pagan Infants School, {{where he}} towers above the {{teachers}} and his fellow students. When {{one of the children}} shoots him with a pea shooter, Thrud's reaction is to kill and maim twenty-seven pupils and three teachers, leading to his expulsion from the school. Choosing to return to the wilderness rather than his adoptive parents, Thrud lives alone until, one day, he stumbles across a hidden burial chamber. Finding a small <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> a large axe, Thrud arms himself. Finding gold and gems, he decides to return to civilisation with his newfound wealth, quickly establishing himself a reputation as a violent warrior.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Results May Vary track listing, Page Hamilton of <b>Helmet</b> <b>and</b> Rivers Cuomo of Weezer recorded songs with Limp Bizkit for the album; Al Jourgensen of Ministry also joined the band in the studio. Jourgensen claims that he convinced Fred Durst to strip naked and wear a cowboy hat while singing. The contributions of all three were omitted from the finished album. Bubba Sparxxx joined Durst in a Los Angeles studio, but his contributions also {{did not make the}} album. Durst wrote over 30 songs with Limp Bizkit drummer John Otto and the band's bassist, Sam Rivers. During production of Results May Vary, Durst listened to the Cure, Patsy Cline, Mazzy Star and classical music.|$|E
5|$|Off-Road Velociraptor Safari {{is a free}} {{downloadable}} vehicle combat {{video game}} released on January 29, 2008 by Flashbang Studios. The game requires the Unity plug-in to run, and can be downloaded from the developers' website. Players {{assume the role of}} a Velociraptor wearing a pith <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> monocle, driving a jeep with a spiked flail attached, and must accrue as many points as possible in a four-minute period by performing stunts and running down other Velociraptor. Each time a Velociraptor is struck, the game's speed is reduced to slow motion and its catapulted body becomes the focus of the in-game camera. The game operates a global highscore, after each game the player is given a rank for that day and a separate rank compared to the highest ever scores, along with a breakdown of the bonuses they were awarded during play.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine cavalry {{was armed}} with a long sword, known as the spathion. They would also have had a light wooden lance, known as a kontarion and a bow (toxarion) with forty arrows in a quiver, hung from a saddle or from the belt. Heavy infantry, known as skoutatoi, had a short sword and a short spear. The lightly armed Byzantine troops and the archers carried a small shield, a bow hung from the {{shoulder}} across the back and a quiver of arrows. Cavalry armor consisted of a hauberk with a mail coif and a helmet with a pendant, i.e. a throat-guard lined with fabric and having a fringe and cheek piece. Infantry was similarly equipped with a hauberk, a <b>helmet</b> <b>and</b> leg armor. Light lamellar and scale armor was also used.|$|E
