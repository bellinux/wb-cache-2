500|$|The Eurovision Song Contest 2014 was the 59th {{edition of}} the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, {{following}} Emmelie de Forest's win at the [...] contest in Malmö, Sweden with the song [...] "Only Teardrops". This was the third time that [...] hosted the contest, the most recent previous occasion being in [...] The two semi-finals took place on 6 and 8 May 2014, and the final on 10 May 2014. The shows were presented by Lise Rønne, Nikolaj <b>Koppel</b> <b>and</b> Pilou Asbæk.|$|E
500|$|A {{media circus}} ensued, with Smith being interviewed by Ted <b>Koppel</b> <b>and</b> Johnny Carson, among others, and with nightly reports {{by the major}} American networks. On July 7, 1983, she flew to Moscow with her parents, and spent two weeks as Andropov's guest. During the trip she visited Moscow and Leningrad and spent time in Artek, the main Soviet pioneer camp, {{in the town of}} Gurzuf on the Crimean Peninsula. Smith wrote in her book that in Leningrad she and her parents were amazed by the {{friendliness}} of the people and by the presents many people made for them. Speaking at a Moscow press conference, she declared that the Russians were [...] "just like us". In Artek, Smith chose to stay with the Soviet children rather than accept the privileged accommodations offered to her. For ease of communication, teachers and children who spoke fluent English were chosen to stay in the building where she was lodged. Smith shared a dormitory with nine other girls, and spent her time there swimming, talking and learning Russian songs and dances. While there, she made many friends, including Natasha Kashirina from Leningrad, a fluent English speaker.|$|E
2500|$|The {{announcement}} {{came one}} day after a Democratic presidential debate hosted by ABC News' Ted Koppel, in which Koppel asked whether the candidacies of Kucinich, Moseley Braun and Sharpton were merely [...] "vanity campaigns", and <b>Koppel</b> <b>and</b> Kucinich exchanged uncomfortable dialogue.|$|E

2500|$|ABC News {{responded that}} they had [...] "agreed to pay Nate Thayer the sizable sum of $350,000 {{for the rights to}} use his footage of former Cambodian {{dictator}} Pol Pot. Despite the fact that ABC provided prominent and repeated credit and generous remuneration for his work, Mr. Thayer initiated a five-year barrage of complaints coupled with repeated demands for more money." [...] In 2002 Thayer sued <b>Koppel</b> <b>and</b> ABC News for $30 million in punitive damages and unspecified compensatory damages.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "next time" [...] {{was when}} the first winter cold was setting in. A party of reitern came to harry an {{outlying}} field, where Ulrich had raised a scanty crop of rye. Tidings reached the castle in such good time that the two brothers, with Heinz, the two Ulm grooms, <b>Koppel,</b> <b>and</b> a troop of serfs, fell on the marauders before they had effected much damage, and while some remained to trample out the fire, the rest pursued the enemy even {{to the village of}} Schlangenwald.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes! We {{have been}} there, craving your pardon, Herr Graf," [...] said Ebbo, [...] "after a dead chamois that rolled into a cleft, {{but it is}} the worst crag on all the hill, and the frost will make it slippery. Sire, if you do venture it, I conjure you to take <b>Koppel,</b> <b>and</b> climb by the rocks from the left, not the right, which looks easiest. The yellow rock, with a face like a man's, is the safer; but ach, it is fearful for one who knows not the rocks." ...|$|E
60|$|Ebbo stormed, {{not merely}} with words, but blows, became ashamed of his violence, tried {{to atone for}} it by gifts and kind words, and in return was sulkily told that he would bring more good to the village by rolling the fiery wheel {{straight}} down hill at the wake, than by all his new-fangled ways. Had not <b>Koppel</b> <b>and</b> a few younger men been more open to influence, his agricultural schemes could hardly have begun; but Friedel's persuasions were not absolutely without success, and every rood that was dug was achieved by his patience and perseverance.|$|E
