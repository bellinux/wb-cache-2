Magnetization of the iron-milled ferrite diminishes monotonically with temperature and vanishes above the relatively high Curie temperature T-C of 900 K.

5|$|Volcanic ash {{consists}} of particles (pyroclasts) with diameters <2 mm (particles >2 mm {{are classified as}} lapilli), and can be as fine as 1 μm. The overall <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> distribution of ash can vary greatly with different magma compositions. Few {{attempts have been made}} to correlate the <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> characteristics of a deposit with those of the event which produced it, though some predictions can be made. Rhyolitic magmas generally produce finer grained material compared to basaltic magmas, due to the higher viscosity and therefore explosivity. The proportions of fine ash are higher for silicic explosive eruptions, probably because vesicle size in the pre-eruptive magma is smaller than those in mafic magmas. There is good evidence that pyroclastic flows produce high proportions of fine ash by communition and it is likely that this process also occurs inside volcanic conduits and would be most efficient when the magma fragmentation surface is well below the summit crater.|$|E
40|$|Nanocrystalline diamond {{films with}} {{different}} <b>grain</b> <b>sizes</b> were synthesized on Si substrate by the hot cathode direct current plasma {{chemical vapor deposition}} method with different compositions of CH 4 /Ar/H 2 gas mixture. The morphology and microstructure of the obtained products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. The {{results showed that the}} composition of the CH 4 /Ar/H 2 gas mixture affected greatly the <b>grain</b> <b>sizes,</b> surface smoothness, and crystal quality of the nanocrystalline diamond films. With the increase of CH 4 concentration, the <b>grain</b> <b>sizes</b> got smaller and the surface of the films got smoother. However, the <b>grain</b> <b>sizes</b> got smaller and the crystal quality was weakened with the increase of Ar concentration. In the process of deposition, SiC was formed at the substrate before the growth of nanocrystalline diamond films, which increased the secondary nucleation of nanocrystalline diamonds. To obtain the nanocrystalline diamond films with uniform small <b>grain</b> <b>sizes,</b> good surface smoothness, and little non-diamond phase, the optimal composition of the CH 4 /Ar/H 2 gas mixture is 6 / 70 / 30 and 7 / 70 / 30...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Mechanical {{properties}} of materials such as strength, elonga-tion and toughness highly depend upon their <b>grain</b> <b>sizes,</b> which are almost deter-mined in a solidification process.

In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones and olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble thallium salts are added to gold plating baths {{to increase the speed}} of plating and to reduce <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> within the gold layer.|$|E
5|$|Ash fallout occurs {{immediately}} after the eruption and is controlled by particle density. Initially, coarse particles fall out close to source. This is followed by fallout of accretionary lapilli, {{which is the result}} of particle agglomeration within the column. Ash fallout is less concentrated during the final stages as the column moves downwind. This results in an ash fall deposit which generally decreases in thickness and <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano. Fine ash particles may remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high-altitude winds. These particles can impact on the aviation industry (refer to impacts section) and, combined with gas particles, can affect global climate.|$|E
5|$|Pyroclastic density {{currents}} can also produce ash particles. These are typically produced by lava dome collapse or {{collapse of the}} eruption column. Within pyroclastic {{density currents}} particle abrasion occurs as particles {{interact with each other}} resulting in a reduction in <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and production of fine grained ash particles. In addition, ash can be produced during secondary fragmentation of pumice fragments, due to the conservation of heat within the flow. These processes produce large quantities of very fine grained ash which is removed from pyroclastic density currents in co-ignimbrite ash plumes.|$|E

30|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{evidence}} favors magnetites with low internal stress and <b>grain</b> <b>sizes</b> >[*] 15  µm as the typical natural candidates for remanence rebound just below TV. Thus, stress, which favors stronger DW pinning, inhibits the phenomenon, while <b>grain</b> <b>sizes</b> above the nominal pseudo-single-domain (PSD)-multidomain (MD) boundary promote it, presumably for the same reason: larger numbers of more mobile DWs. Smirnov (2006) and Roberts et al. (2017) argue that the PSD state is a physically distinct magnetic state and not a mix of single-domain (SD) and MD states as modeled by Dunlop (2002). In either case, most of the <b>grain</b> <b>sizes</b> typically displaying dip and recovery are large enough to contain {{at least a few}} well-developed DWs.|$|R

5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} is physically, socially, and {{economically}} disruptive. Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas {{many hundreds of}} kilometres from the source, and causes disruptions and losses {{in a wide variety}} of different infrastructure sectors. Impacts are dependent on: ash fall thickness; the duration of the ash fall; the <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and chemistry of the ash; whether the ash is wet or dry; and any preparedness, management and prevention (mitigation) measures employed to reduce effects from the ash fall. Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in different ways and are vulnerable to a range of impacts or consequences. These are discussed in the following sections.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered to pose a significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the <b>grain</b> <b>size,</b> mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E
5|$|It {{also has}} a more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, <b>grain</b> <b>size</b> and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E

A series of laboratory desorption/diffusion experiments were conducted to help elucidate the characteristics of sediments on 224 Ra and 226 Ra desorption and diffusion, which included 1) 224 Ra and 226 Ra desorption from sediments in water of different salinities, 2) 224 Ra and 226 Ra desorption from sediments of different <b>grain</b> <b>sizes</b> in water of the same salinity, 3) 224 Ra and 226 Ra diffusive fluxes by observing Ra enrichment with time in the overlying water of incubated sediments. The experimental results show that there is an increase in the amount of 224 Ra and 226 Ra with the increase of salinity from 5 to 30, and Ra desorption is strongest at the salinity of 25. Under the same salt water condition, 224 Ra and 226 Ra desorption activities of the four <b>grain</b> <b>sizes</b> (2000 ~ 1000 μm, 1000 ~ 500 μm, 500 ~ 250 μm and 250 ~ 125 μm) of sediments are very close to each other.
