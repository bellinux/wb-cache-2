5|$|The Dodgers {{traded for}} Jones {{in part to}} replace Glenn Dobbs – a star {{tailback}} in Brooklyn's single-wing offense – because Dobbs was suffering from injuries.

5|$|Philip {{began the}} siege, but was {{frustrated}} {{in his attempt}} to take it, and the siege dragged on for nearly a year. During this time, there were two failed Athenian attempts to relieve the city. Philip was to lose an eye during the siege when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> an arrow. Despite the injury inflicted on him by the defenders, he eventually agreed terms with the citizens of Methone, allowing them all to depart with one garment each. Buckler suggests that this lenient settlement may have been the result of the Thessalian request to intervene in the Sacred War (see below); anxious not to miss this opportunity, Philip sought to end the siege as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{began its}} drive with an {{incomplete}} pass, which {{was followed by}} a short run. On third down, Vick prepared to throw the ball, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> Clemson defender Keith Adams and fumbled the ball. Fellow Clemson defender Terry Jolly recovered the loose football and returned it to the Tech 14-yard line before he was tackled.

A report by Dan Tolkovsky, the Israeli Air Force operations officer at the time, stated that Cohen likely attempted to land at the Hatzor Airbase instead of Ekron, where eyewitnesses saw a burning plane crashing in the distance. He was the first Israeli Air Force KIA, and was buried in Tel Aviv (Nahalat Yitzhak) after his remains were found at the end of 1949.|$|E

5|$|In {{the space}} of six days, Galland's friend, Steinhoff was badly burned in a crash on 18 April, and then, on 24 April, his friend Lützow was posted missing. On 21 April, Galland was {{credited}} with his 100th aerial victory. He was the 103rd and last Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark. On 26 April, Galland claimed his 103rd and 104th aerial victories against B-26s, escorted by the 27th Fighter Group and 50th Fighter Group. Galland again made a mistake; he stopped {{to make sure his}} second victory was going to crash and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a USAAF P-47 Thunderbolt piloted by James Finnegan. Galland nursed his crippled Me 262 to the airfield, only to find it was under attack by more P-47s. Galland landed under fire and abandoned his jet on the runway.

In return two Me 262s were shot down: the other pilot surviving.|$|E
5|$|The paratroopers' first {{assault on}} the palace met with {{surprising}} resistance. The Presidential Guardsmen who stood between the rebels and Diệm were estimated at between 30 and 60, but they managed to repel the initial thrust and kill seven rebels who attempted to scale the palace walls and run across the grass. The rebels cordoned off the palace and held fire. They trucked in reinforcements and the attack restarted at 7:30, but the Presidential Guard continued to resist. Half an hour later, the rebels brought in five armored vehicles and circumnavigated the palace. They fired at the perimeter posts, and mortared the palace grounds. However, the exchange had petered out by 10:30. In the meantime, the rebels had captured the national police offices, Radio Saigon and the barracks of the Presidential Guard. They had also put most of the Saigon-based generals under house arrest, meaning that Diệm's saviours {{would have to come}} from outside Saigon. However, the rebels also suffered a setback when Hong was killed during the battle for the police headquarters.

5|$|A maximum {{wind gust}} of 158km/h (98mph) was {{recorded}} on Cairn Gorm, Scotland as Katia impacted the region, with a peak gust of 130km/h (81mph) observed at a non-mountain station in Capel Curig, Wales; these observations marked the strongest impact from a tropical cyclone since Hurricane Lili in 1996. Waves up to 15meters (49ft) battered the western coastline of Ireland, and fallen power lines temporarily disrupted DART services. Approximately 4,000 households were left without power across the country. A catering marquee was blown {{into the air}} on a set for the television series Game of Thrones, causing one injury. In County Durham, United Kingdom, a man was killed after a tree fell on the minivan he was driving; the passenger sustained non-life-threatening injuries. A second driver was indirectly killed on the M54 motorway after hazardous weather caused a multi-car accident. Farther south in Bradford, an 11-year-old boy was injured after <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> {{a portion of a}} roof blown off a garage. Downed power poles set several fields on fire. The second stage of the Tour of Britain was forcefully canceled after strong winds littered the cycle route with debris. Following the storm, damage estimates in the United Kingdom alone topped £100m ($157 million 2011 USD). The remnants of Katia produced damage as far east as Russia. In St. Petersburg, wind gusts up to 45mph (75km/h) damaged buildings and left roughly 1,500 residents without power. In Estonia, the storm cut off power to approximately 940 households, particularly affecting the island of Hiiumaa and Harju County, with strong winds in coastal areas gusting up to 90km/h (55mph).|$|E
5|$|Cain was the Giants' {{number three}} starter in 2009. He threw six shutout innings {{and had an}} RBI single against Mike Pelfrey on May 17 in a 20 victory over the Mets.

On June 4, {{in the second game}} of a doubleheader, he threw a five-inning complete game, allowing one run in a 41 victory over the Nationals. He allowed one run in a complete game against Oakland on June 14, striking out nine as the Giants won 71. From May 7 through June 14, Cain won seven straight decisions. On July 5, Cain was announced as an All-Star {{for the first time in}} his young career. On Cain's final start before the All-Star Game, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a line drive right below his elbow and was forced to miss pitching for the NL All-Star Team, although he did still attend and was announced as an All-Star.

On September 25, Cain was awarded the Willie Mac Award.|$|E
5|$|During the 1959-60 season, Plante wore a goaltender mask for {{the first}} time in a regular season game. Although Plante had used his mask in {{practice}} since 1956 after missing 13 games because of a sinusitis operation, head coach Toe Blake was afraid it would impair his vision and would not permit him to wear it during regulation play. However, on November 1, 1959, Plante's nose was broken when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> <b>by</b> a shot fired by Andy Bathgate three minutes into a game against the New York Rangers, and he was taken to the dressing room for stitches. When he returned, he was wearing the crude home-made goaltender mask that he had been using in practices. Blake was livid, but he had no other goaltender to call upon and Plante refused to return to the goal unless he wore the mask. Blake agreed on the condition that Plante discard the mask when the cut healed. The Canadiens won the game 3–1. During the following days Plante refused to discard the mask, and as the Canadiens continued to win, Blake was less vocal about it. The unbeaten streak stretched to 18 games. Plante did not wear the mask, at Blake's request, against Detroit on March 8, 1960; the Canadiens lost 3–0, and the mask returned for good the next night. That year the Canadiens won their fifth straight Stanley Cup, which was Plante's last.|$|E
