5|$|After {{the stellar}} {{parameters}} were established, the Kepler science team ran models and fits {{to ensure that}} Kepler-5's transit event was not a false positive, such as an eclipsing binary star. Once the planetary nature of Kepler-5b was established, the Kepler team searched for the planet's occultation behind its star, hoping to find the temperature on its day side. They found both, {{and were able to}} set the equilibrium temperature of the planet. The use of speckle imaging using adaptive optics at the WIYN Observatory <b>in</b> <b>Arizona</b> <b>and</b> the Palomar Observatory in California isolated the starlight of Kepler-5 from background stars.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, {{approximately}} 12.7million {{people lived}} in the Colorado River basin. Phoenix <b>in</b> <b>Arizona</b> <b>and</b> Las Vegas in Nevada are the largest metropolitan areas in the watershed. Population densities are also high along the lower Colorado River below Davis Dam, which includes Bullhead City, Lake Havasu City, and Yuma. Other significant population centers in the basin include Tucson, Arizona; St. George, Utah; and Grand Junction, Colorado. Colorado River basin states are among the fastest-growing in the U.S.; the population of Nevada alone increased by about 66percent between 1990 and 2000 as Arizona grew by some 40percent.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, US163 was {{designated}} along SR464 <b>in</b> <b>Arizona</b> <b>and</b> SR47 in Utah {{as part of}} a re-alignment of U.S. highways in the Four Corners region. With the re-alignment, US160 was re-routed into Arizona instead of Utah. US163 also absorbed the former route of US160 to its former terminus at Interstate 70 at Crescent Junction. In 1981, AASHTO approved a new iteration of U.S. Route 191 that absorbed much of the alignment of US163. Utah truncated US163 at Bluff. The truncation was made without approval from AASHTO, as the AASHTO logs placed the northern terminus of US163 at I-70 at Crescent Junction.|$|E

5|$|In August 1918 Rogan and {{the rest}} of the 25th Infantry were moved to Camp Stephen D. Little in Nogales, Arizona. Researchers John Holway and James Riley report that in 1919, Casey Stengel played against Rogan <b>in</b> <b>Arizona,</b> <b>and</b> {{subsequently}} recommended him to Wilkinson for his new Negro National League team, the Kansas City Monarchs. However, Rogan had already played in the California Winter League and for Wilkinson's All-Nations team in 1917, and had already been noted by Negro sports reporters as early as 1916.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with church requirements and tradition, the Kimballs immediately began {{the transition from}} Arizona to Salt Lake City upon Kimball's call to be an apostle. Kimball sold his share in the KimballGreenhalgh Agency for $65,000 and sold their home and all their other property in Arizona. Kimball was particularly saddened to leave his local Rotary Club chapter and his other professional associations; Camilla worried about leaving her elderly parents <b>in</b> <b>Arizona</b> <b>and</b> relocating their second son, Andrew, {{who had just been}} elected senior class president at Safford High School.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Christensen got {{in contact with}} Valgard Murray and Elton Hall, Heathens {{operating}} a kindred <b>in</b> <b>Arizona,</b> <b>and</b> in 1976 their group {{would be the first}} to be certified by the Odinist Fellowship. During the early 1980s she established a prison-outreach program in the hope of attracting incarcerated individuals to Odinism, in doing so getting Odinism legal recognition as a religion from the state of Florida. In the prisons, the Odinist Fellowship organised four seasonal festivals a year that were marked with sumbel as well as commemorating Hitler's birthday.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} season, Lysacek dealt with several injuries, {{including}} broken ribs, {{which resulted in}} lost training time. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States Figure Skating Association cancelled the 2001–2002 ISU Junior Grand Prix event to be held <b>in</b> <b>Arizona</b> <b>and</b> did not allow its junior skaters to compete on the Junior Grand Prix circuit {{for the rest of}} that season. At the 2002 U.S. Championships, Lysacek repeated his 12th-place finish from the previous year and was not selected for the team to the 2002 World Junior Championships. He was sent to the 2002 Triglav Trophy in April, where he won the gold medal on the junior level.|$|E

Post-production was completed four days before its screening on nine screens at the Sundance Film Festival, where it had its premiere.

5|$|The Mesa Verdeans survived using a {{combination}} of hunting, gathering, and subsistence farming of crops such as corn, beans, and squash. They built the mesa's first pueblos sometime after 650, {{and by the end of}} the 12th century, they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known. By 1285, following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts, they abandoned the area and moved south to locations <b>in</b> <b>Arizona</b> <b>and</b> New Mexico, including Rio Chama, Pajarito Plateau, and Santa Fe.|$|E
5|$|As {{recently}} as the Cretaceous period 100million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon Plate with the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50million {{years ago in a}} mountain-building episode known as the Laramide orogeny. The Colorado first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up, which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains <b>in</b> <b>Arizona</b> <b>and</b> deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene, between about 55 and 34million years ago, but did not attain its present height until about 5million years ago, about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.|$|E
