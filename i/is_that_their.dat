5|$|Chiropterans most {{distinguishing}} feature <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> forelimbs are developed as wings, making them the only mammals {{in the world}} naturally capable of flight. Bat species account for about 20% of all mammals.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{properties}} of carbon nanotubes derive from electronic transitions within one-dimensional {{density of states}} (DOS). A typical feature of one-dimensional crystals <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> DOS is not a continuous function of energy, but it descends gradually and then increases in a discontinuous spike. In contrast, three-dimensional materials have continuous DOS. The sharp peaks found in one-dimensional materials are called Van Hove singularities.|$|E

25|$|A {{differential}} equation is linear if the unknown function and its derivatives have degree 1 (products {{of the unknown}} function and its derivatives are not allowed) and nonlinear otherwise. The characteristic property of linear equations <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> solutions form an affine subspace of an appropriate function space, which results in much more developed theory of linear {{differential equation}}s.|$|E
25|$|Protein–protein docking is {{ultimately}} envisaged to address all these issues. Furthermore, since docking methods can {{be based on}} purely physical principles, even proteins of unknown function (or which have been studied relatively little) may be docked. The only prerequisite <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> molecular structure has been either determined experimentally, or can be estimated by a protein structure prediction technique.|$|E
25|$|All that is {{demanded of}} private schools <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> {{teaching}} equal {{that of the}} municipal schools. The Ministry of Education confers on private schools {{the right to use}} the final examinations of the folkeskole, thereby exercising a certain extent of quality control. In principle, however, it is not up to any government authority but to the parents of each private school to check that its performance measures up to the demands set for the municipal schools.|$|E

25|$|Minimal transvalvular {{pressure}} gradient – Whenever a fluid flows through a restriction, {{such as a}} valve, a {{pressure gradient}} arises over the restriction. This pressure gradient {{is a result of}} the increased resistance to flow through the restriction. Natural heart valves have a low transvalvular pressure gradient as they present little obstruction to the flow through themselves, normally less than 16 mmHg. A desirable characteristic of heart valve prostheses <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> transvalvular pressure gradient is as small as possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{incredible}} {{popularity of}} Satsuma ware and the eagerness of collectors to find pre-Meiji pieces led some manufacturers and dealers to deliberately misrepresent items' age and origins. Some sold {{other types of}} ceramics such as Awata or Seto ware as Satsuma. Some falsely used the names of famous artists or studios to mark pieces. Early Japanese ceramics rarely had stamps or signatures, which can make dating some Satsuma ware difficult. One characteristic of earlier pieces, however, is a high-quality glaze and finish, as later mass production led to dramatically inferior works. Another telling feature of genuine pieces <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> bodies do not ring when tapped.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} forms of well temperament, but the {{characteristic}} they all share <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> semitones are of an uneven size. Every semitone in a well temperament has its own interval (usually close to the equal-tempered version of 100 cents), {{and there is no}} clear distinction between a diatonic and chromatic semitone in the tuning. Well temperament was constructed so that enharmonic equivalence could be assumed between all of these semitones, and whether they were written as a minor second or augmented unison did not effect a different sound. Instead, in these systems, each key had a slightly different sonic color or character, beyond the limitations of conventional notation.|$|E

25|$|Snake vision varies greatly, {{from only}} {{being able to}} {{distinguish}} light from dark to keen eyesight, but the main trend <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> vision is adequate although not sharp, and allows them to track movements. Generally, vision is best in arboreal snakes and weakest in burrowing snakes. Some snakes, such as the Asian vine snake (genus Ahaetulla), have binocular vision, with both eyes capable of focusing on the same point. Most snakes focus by moving the lens {{back and forth in}} relation to the retina, while in the other amniote groups, the lens is stretched. Many nocturnal snakes have slit pupils while diurnal snakes have round pupils.|$|E
25|$|Ottawa’s three Talent {{units were}} built by Bombardier Transportation {{as part of}} a larger order for Deutsche Bahn’s {{regional}} network. The only significant difference between them and the German units <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> on-board toilets have been decommissioned. As well, the luggage racks have been blocked, although this seemed not to be a problem with the train's operation in Germany. Deutsche Bahn’s red-and-white colour scheme was similar enough to OC Transpo’s livery that the trains did not need to be repainted. The trains were purchased under an agreement under which they could be sold back to Bombardier if they were replaced or retired, but the agreement has since expired.|$|E
25|$|Bourdieu himself {{believes}} class distinction {{and preferences}} are “most marked {{in the ordinary}} choices of everyday existence, such as furniture, clothing, or cooking, which are particularly revealing of deep-rooted and long-standing dispositions because, lying {{outside the scope of}} the educational system, they have to be confronted, as it were, by naked taste.” Indeed, Bourdieu believes that “the strongest and most indelible mark of infant learning” would probably be in the tastes of food. Bourdieu thinks that meals served on special occasions are “an interesting indicator of the mode of self-presentation adopted in ‘showing off’ a life-style (in which furniture also plays a part).” The idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> likes and dislikes should mirror those of their associated class fractions.|$|E

25|$|Deep neural {{networks}} can be potentially improved by deepening and parameter reduction, while maintaining trainability. While training extremely deep (e.g., 1 million layers) {{neural networks}} {{might not be}} practical, CPU-like architectures such as pointer networks and neural random-access machines overcome this limitation by using external random-access memory and other components that typically belong to a computer architecture such as registers, ALU and pointers. Such systems operate on probability distribution vectors stored in memory cells and registers. Thus, the model is fully differentiable and trains end-to-end. The key characteristic of these models <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> depth, {{the size of their}} short-term memory, and the number of parameters can be altered independently — unlike models like LSTM, whose number of parameters grows quadratically with memory size.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} dinophyte {{chloroplast}} is the peridinin-type chloroplast, {{characterized by the}} carotenoid pigment peridinin in their chloroplasts, along with chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c2. Peridinin is not found in any other group of chloroplasts. The peridinin chloroplast is bounded by three membranes (occasionally two), having lost the red algal endosymbiont's original cell membrane. The outermost membrane is not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum. They contain a pyrenoid, and have triplet-stacked thylakoids. Starch is found outside the chloroplast. An important feature of these chloroplasts <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> chloroplast DNA is highly reduced and fragmented into many small circles. Most of the genome has migrated to the nucleus, and only critical photosynthesis-related genes remain in the chloroplast.|$|E
25|$|The tallit gadol is {{typically}} either all white, white with black stripes, white with blue stripes, or white with twelve-colored stripes. The all-white and black-and-white varieties {{have traditionally been}} the most common, with the blue-and-white variety, in the past {{said to be in}} remembrance of the blue thread or tekhelet, becoming increasingly prevalent in recent years among non-Orthodox Jews on account of the association of blue and white with the State of Israel. The all-white variety is customary among Sepharadic communities, whereas among Ashkenazic communities the tendency is toward white tallitot with black stripes. One explanation for the significance of the black stripes <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> black color symbolizes the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the exile of the Jews from the land of Israel.|$|E
