5000|$|Each {{tracheal}} tube develops as an invagination of the ectoderm during embryonic development. To prevent its collapse under pressure, a thin, reinforcing [...] "wire" [...] of cuticle (the taenidia) winds spirally through the membranous wall. This design (similar in structure to a <b>heater</b> <b>hose</b> on an automobile or an exhaust duct on a clothes dryer) gives {{tracheal tube}}s {{the ability to}} flex and stretch without developing kinks that might restrict air flow.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inventor}} is not known, though Bart Hopkin {{credits the}} late Frank Crawford of the UC Berkeley Department of Physics with, [...] "developing {{the idea and}} researching the underlying acoustics," [...] and in 1973 Crawford credits another professor with pointing out to him a toy which, [...] "about {{a year or two}} ago...appeared in toy stores across the land," [...] and gives the brand or trade names [...] "Whirl-A-Sound", [...] "Freeka", and [...] "The Hummer"; the last being made by W. J. Seidler Co. of L.A., CA. Crawford invented the method of playing small enough hose by blowing, known as a corrugahorn. This requires a tube with a diameter smaller than commonly marketed as toys (a one inch diameter is too great, a half inch is not), Hopkin recommends 3/8" [...] gas <b>heater</b> <b>hose</b> as the most playable of widely available sizes. Crawford invented an, [...] "inverted-wastebasket water piston," [...] operated version he called the [...] "Water Pipe", with which he could easily reach the eleventh harmonic.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "short block" [...] of {{the engine}} {{is the same as}} other Land Rover 4.6 HSE models. Short-blocks used for the 4.6L Callaway engines were stamped with a 9.60:1 {{compression}} ratio marking from Land Rover. The increase of 0.25 points, up from the standard 4.6L compression ratio of 9.35:1 was achieved by a modification to the cylinder heads. The cylinder heads were also modified to improve the airflow {{into and out of the}} combustion chambers. The inlet manifold gasket front valley clamp has been changed to accommodate the <b>heater</b> <b>hose</b> positioning on the bottom front of the Callaway manifold. The ram pipe housing has been modified by shortening the ram pipe tube lengths. The intake runner lengths were tuned to increase both power and torque. The black plastic air inlet tube was replaced with a larger diameter fancy looking carbon fiber inlet tube to match the larger throttle bore in the plenum. The air cleaner box base was modified to increase the airflow. The Lucas GEMS ECU was calibrated to support the mechanical changes to the Callaway engine (the Callaway engine had the same basic FI as in 1998 and did not have the Bosch system that was on other 1999 HSEs).|$|E
5000|$|Although the Vibe and Matrix {{are similar}} designs, the two brands {{actually}} use several different components, which are brand-specific, for their {{heating and air}} conditioning systems. These components include the air conditioning compressor and related <b>hoses,</b> the <b>heater</b> <b>hoses,</b> the <b>heater</b> core, and the serpentine belt.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} type is an {{electric}} heating element in the cylinder block, connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs. In this fashion, the heater element is immersed in the engine's coolant, which then keeps most of the engine warm. This type of heater does not come with a pump. They may also be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or <b>heater</b> <b>hoses.</b> Some <b>heaters</b> pump and circulate the engine coolant while heating, others only heat the still coolant in the reservoir.|$|R
25|$|A {{block heater}} warms {{the engine of}} an {{automobile}} in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs, or may be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or <b>heater</b> <b>hoses.</b> The block <b>heater,</b> first known as a head bolt heater, was invented in 1945 by Andrew Freeman in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons. U.S. patent #2,487,326 was filed on November 4, 1946 and issued to Freeman on November 8, 1949.|$|R
40|$|Premise of the study: An {{efficient}} and inexpensive system {{was developed to}} produce smoke solutions from plant material to research the influence of water-soluble compounds from smoke on seed germination. Methods and Results: Smoke solutions (300 mL per batch) were produced by burning small quantities (100 – 200 g) of dried plant material {{from a range of}} species in a bee smoker attached by a <b>heater</b> <b>hose</b> to a side-arm flask. The flask was attached to a vacuum water aspirator, to pull the smoke through the water. The entire apparatus was operated in a laboratory fume hood. Conclusions: Compared with other smoke solution preparation systems, the system described is easy to assemble and operate, inexpensive to build, and effective at producing smoke solutions from desired species in a small indoor space. Quantitative measurements can be made when using this system, allowing for replication of the process...|$|E
5000|$|Tropical marine refugiums often contain live {{rock and}} live sand, macroalgae, and {{sometimes}} scavenger microfauna such as micro brittle stars, tiny sea {{stars such as}} Asterina, snails, and worms. [...] To achieve maximum biological filtration through uptake of nutrients by macroalgae/mangroves, strong lighting is often utilized in the refugium. In this fashion, macroalgae algae growth is encouraged, competing with nuisance algae which would otherwise thrive in the main/display tank. Some also use refugiums to raise tiny brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, ostracods, amphipods, copepods and isopods for delicate fish like seahorses and dragonets to feed on. A sump is an additional tank often kept under the display tank that serves to house filtration and other miscellaneous equipment such as protein skimmers, reaction chambers, <b>hoses,</b> <b>heaters</b> and the like. This is especially common for show tanks and reef tanks. In addition to housing critical equipment, the sump serves to add volume to the total system; mitigating the effects of nutrient buildup or unintentional introduction of foreign substances.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{dimension}} alternators and batteries {{as well as}} power management control strategies, {{there is a need}} to analyse the electrical current consumption in various systems of a diesel truck engine for different modes of operation. The aim of this project is to develop a general way (method and tool support) to calculate and analyse current consumption of the powertrain system. In this work several models with different levels of accuracy have been designed in order to simulate the current consumption of the urea dosing system, which is one of the main systems of the exhaust after treatment system (EATS). The main reason for selecting such a system was its independent characteristics, having its own controller known as the ACM (After treatment Control Module) and as well it is of primary interest of the Volvo system engineering group due to its new developing technology, designed for future Euro VI heavy duty engines. All the models and simulations have been implemented in Matlab®/Simulink®. Moreover the models were compared and verified with measurements that were carried out at Volvo Powertrain test labs. A user friendly graphical interface was also designed as an interface between the user and the Simulink® model. The tool was designed via Matlab®GUI with convenient viewing and post processing capabilities. The results show that the basic model, being a rather simple model with static simulation is sufficient for modeling the air valve, coolant valve and the <b>hose</b> <b>heaters</b> of the Urea dosing system. The accuracy of the implemented basic model structure is found to be 98 % of the real measured values. However the urea pump requires a more advanced model due to its complexity, which was implemented in the detailed model. The detailed model, which is based on dynamic simulation and detailed mechanical characteristics in addition to the detailed magnetic characteristics of the pump, produces reasonably good results with an error of 23. 8 % in the average coil current. The main contribution to this error is probably the unknown parameters of the electronic control circuit. Finally, the general model is the most suitable model for the urea pump according to the project’s specifications and in comparison with the detailed model, it over predicts the current consumption by 4. 3 %...|$|R
