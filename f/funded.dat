40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the <b>fund</b> flow â€“ {{performance}} relationship for Islamic and conventional equity <b>funds</b> in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use panel regression models to estimate the relationship between <b>fund</b> flows and performance for Islamic and conventional equity <b>funds</b> in Malaysia from 2001 to 2009. The data for each <b>fund</b> include <b>fund</b> flows, assets under management, management expenses, <b>fund</b> age, portfolio turnover, <b>fund</b> risk and return and the number of <b>funds</b> in the <b>fundâ€™s</b> family. The authors also include market returns and year effects. The sample consists of 127 Malaysian equity <b>funds</b> with at least 65 per cent domestic equity holdings comprising 35 Islamic and 92 conventional equity <b>funds.</b> Findings: Islamic <b>fund</b> investors respond to performance in much the same way as conventional <b>fund</b> investors, increasing <b>fund</b> flows to better performing <b>funds</b> and decreasing <b>fund</b> flows to poorer performing <b>funds.</b> However, there is also evidence that Islamic <b>fund</b> investors are relatively less responsive toward poorly performing Islamic <b>funds,</b> suggesting an asymmetry in the expected positive <b>fund</b> flow â€“ performance relationship, but only for Islamic <b>fund</b> investors. When choosing <b>funds</b> based on other <b>fund</b> attributes, Islamic <b>fund</b> investors again exhibit similar behaviour, and like conventional <b>fund</b> investors direct larger percentage <b>fund</b> flows into smaller <b>funds</b> as well as <b>funds</b> with larger past <b>fund</b> flows and higher expense ratios. Research limitations/implications: The authors were only able to access data on annual net <b>fund</b> flows not quarterly or monthly <b>fund</b> inflows and outflows as usual in developed markets and this may obscure some important aspects of investor decision-making. There is also insufficient data for matched-sample techniques, which may better control for fund-specific characteristics. Practical implications: Islamic <b>funds</b> like conventional <b>funds</b> will experience increased <b>fund</b> flows with better performance and vice versa. However, Islamic <b>fund</b> investors appear somewhat less likely to remove monies from poorly performing <b>funds.</b> The authors believe this is because investors either place a premium on the non-return attributes of Shariah-compliant <b>funds</b> and/or wish to avoid search costs in finding another suitable Islamic <b>fund.</b> Apart from this, Islamic and conventional <b>fund</b> investors behave in a similar manner, and the authors believe that this is possible in Malaysia given the size and diversity of its Islamic <b>fund</b> sector. Originality/value: This paper is one of the very few empirical studies concerning the behaviour of Islamic investors, particularly in Malaysia, primarily because of limitations in data availability.
