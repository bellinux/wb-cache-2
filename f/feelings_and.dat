5|$|After {{the second}} year, {{as the child}} begins to see the {{caregiver}} as an independent person, a more complex and goal-corrected partnership is formed. Children begin to notice others' goals and <b>feelings</b> <b>and</b> plan their actions accordingly.

2500|$|While many {{scholars}} in cultural studies draw distinctions between affect, <b>feeling,</b> <b>and</b> emotion, Cvetkovich does not emphasize {{the differences between}} these categories. Rather she uses both affect <b>and</b> <b>feeling</b> “in a generic sense,” where affect is “a category that encompasses affect, emotion, <b>and</b> <b>feeling,</b> <b>and</b> that includes impulses, desires, <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> that get historically constructed {{in a range of}} ways.” She favours the term feeling, though, because it retains “the ambiguity between feelings as embodied sensations <b>and</b> <b>feelings</b> as psychic or cognitive experiences." ...|$|R

Six forms of external tapas are—fasting, control of appetite, accepting food under certain conditions, renunciation of delicious food, sitting and sleeping in lonely place and renunciation of comforts.

5|$|Besides {{the many}} {{literary}} sources, Eliot also draws {{on his personal}} <b>feelings</b> <b>and</b> experience, especially on the great stress that he felt while composing the poem. Similarly, Eliot used the image of pilgrims coming to America and the stories of them that were common throughout his childhood. In particular, his mother wrote poems about the pilgrims arriving in New England, and Eliot found information related to his family's history in a book called Sketch of the Eliot Family. The location, East Coker, was where Andrew Eliott, T. S. Eliot's ancestor, left when joining the pilgrimage.|$|E

5|$|Bloc Party {{aimed to}} create an album that appealed to {{followers}} of different musical genres. Building on the arrangements in their demo songs recorded in 2004, the band members moulded tracks largely through live takes during the Silent Alarm studio sessions. The compositional focus was on rhythm and the drum and bass parts, while lyricist Kele Okereke's writing examined the <b>feelings</b> <b>and</b> hopes of young adults, including views on global politics. Following the album's completion, Bloc Party embarked on promotional tours before its release.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{voices are}} often used, {{it is neither}} a concert opera nor a cantata, but a choral symphony. If there is singing, almost from the beginning, it is to prepare the listener's mind for the {{dramatic}} scenes whose <b>feelings</b> <b>and</b> passions are to be expressed by the orchestra. It is also to introduce the choral masses gradually into the musical development, when their too sudden appearance would have damaged the compositions's unity....|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Asperger's was {{estimated}} to affect 37.2 million people globally. The syndrome is named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger who, in 1944, described children in his practice who lacked nonverbal communication, had limited understanding of others' <b>feelings,</b> <b>and</b> were physically clumsy. The modern conception of Asperger syndrome came into existence in 1981 and went {{through a period of}} popularization. It became a standardized diagnosis in the early 1990s. Many questions and controversies remain about aspects of the disorder. There is doubt about whether it is distinct from high-functioning autism (HFA). Partly because of this, the percentage of people affected is not firmly established.|$|E

5|$|In Suicide (1897), Durkheim {{explores the}} differing suicide rates among Protestants and Catholics, arguing that {{stronger}} social control among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of integration while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated suicide {{as a social}} fact, explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' <b>feelings</b> <b>and</b> motivations.|$|E
5|$|In {{his opinion}} {{all human beings}} have the same {{abilities}} with regard to reason, <b>feelings</b> <b>and</b> imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him {{it is obvious that}} the culture on Tierra del Fuego is at a lower level of development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E
