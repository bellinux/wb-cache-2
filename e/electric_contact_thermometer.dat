50|$|Julabo GmbH is an {{international}} manufacturer of temperature-control technology for research and industry. The company was originally based upon Ernst Juchheim's (1901-1969) development of <b>contact</b> <b>thermometers</b> in 1926.|$|R
50|$|Early glass <b>contact</b> <b>thermometers</b> used in {{temperature}} control were equipped with solid contacts. They {{were able to}} switch an attached device, such as a heater, on and off at short intervals {{by way of a}} contact protection relay as well as trigger an acoustic warning function. However, for more complex applications, variable setting of the temperature value was required. Ernst Juchheim, a master designer of glass instruments, fulfilled this requirement in 1926 with the development of the world's first glass <b>contact</b> <b>thermometer</b> with variable temperature adjustment. In 1927, his invention was granted a patent in Germany.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{calibrate}} thermometers {{they have to}} be used to measure the temperature of an isothermal cavity within an appropriate furnace. This temperature has to be compared with the temperature T_ 9 _ 0 measured by means of a normal instrument approximating the International Temperature Scale ITS- 90. Above 962 C the ITS- 90 can be realized only by means of a radiation thermometer. In many applications, however, the application of <b>contact</b> <b>thermometers</b> is required because of technical reasons. The noise thermometer is the only <b>contact</b> <b>thermometer</b> the signal of which is independent on drift behaviour caused by variation of material. Therefore, it is the most appropriate <b>contact</b> <b>thermometer</b> to approximate the ITS- 90 in this temperature range. In order to realize this application a special calibration furnace for temperatures up to 1500 C has been developed making available both isothermal blackbody cavity to measure the radiation temperature and cavities to insert <b>contact</b> <b>thermometers.</b> Special efforts were necessary to suppress electromagnetic fields influencing the measured noise signal and reducing the accuracy of noise thermometer measurement. As an important requirement a long term stability of the furnace temperature could be achieved with a deviation of 0. 1 K after 48 h at 1460 C. Ten separately controlled heating sections allow to optimize the temperature profile {{in the direction of the}} furnace axis and the remaining deviation of #+-# 0. 6 K over a length of 300 mm finally was one of the main error sources. This first direct comparison of the two thermodynamic temperature measurement techniques at 1460 C led to a difference of approximately 0. 2 K. This value being in the range or below the individual uncertainties demonstrates the applicability of a furnace with the described construction for precise calibration of <b>contact</b> <b>thermometers</b> at high temperatures. Thereby approximation of the temperature T_ 9 _ 0 is possible either by radiation or by noise thermometers. (orig.)

40|$|The {{technical}} literature {{does not}} offer systematic studies on sliding <b>electric</b> <b>contacts</b> (probably {{for the protection of}} the research results). Most firm catalogues and prospects offer information about the <b>electric</b> <b>contacts</b> in general. The paper solves some problems, concerning tribologic aspects regarding the functioning of sliding <b>electric</b> <b>contacts</b> by a set of experimental verifications. The analyse of the main factors which influence the behaviour of sliding <b>electric</b> <b>contacts</b> imposes proofing and testing programs with modification, control and measuring of some tribologic parameters, that intervene in the working process, for a better understanding and optimisation, regarding information and energy transfer. The used equipment consists of a proofing stand (for the study of the main process parameters). The novelty consists of a contact study on the couple sintered metal – graphite brushes with bronze rings. Despite the fact that the value of the volumic wear of the brush is situated under normal limits, by mentaining a constant velocity and by doubling the value of the contact pressure, the intensifying energy loss process leeds to a doubling wear of the averted layer...|$|R
40|$|The forming of coating at <b>electric</b> <b>contact</b> {{surfacing}} is considered. The {{mathematical model}} of the coating formation is developed. The method of numerical recurrent solution of the finite-difference form of static equilibrium conditions of the selected elementary volume of coating is used. This model considers distribution of thermal properties and geometric parameters along the thermal deformation zone {{during the process of}} <b>electric</b> <b>contact</b> surfacing by compact material. It is found that the change of value of speed asymmetry factor leads to increasing of the friction coefficient in zone of surfacing. This provides the forming of the coating of higher quality. The limitation of the technological capabilities of equipment for <b>electric</b> <b>contact</b> surfacing is related to the size of recoverable parts and application of high electromechanical powers.
