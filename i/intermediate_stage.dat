5|$|Because of its {{unstable}} nature, astronomers {{now consider}} the scattered disc {{to be the}} place of origin for most periodic comets in the Solar System, with the centaurs, a population of icy bodies between Jupiter and Neptune, being the <b>intermediate</b> <b>stage</b> in an object's migration from the disc to the inner Solar System. Eventually, perturbations from the giant planets send such objects towards the Sun, transforming them into periodic comets. Many Oort cloud objects are also thought to have originated in the scattered disc. Detached objects are not sharply distinct from scattered disc objects, and some such as Sedna have sometimes been considered {{to be included in}} this group.|$|E

5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are thought to have originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically <b>intermediate</b> <b>stage</b> between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E
5|$|Permission for Blyth A Power Station {{to be built}} {{was granted}} in February 1955, and its {{construction}} took place between 1955 and 1960. The station's first unit went into operation in December 1958, and the A Station was fully operational by June 1960. Its four 120MW sets were the first commissioned in Britain of what became for a time that standardised size. The construction of the B Station began on 4December 1961. Its first unit was commissioned in December 1962, {{and the rest of}} the station was fully operational by September 1966. The station had a total generating capacity of 1,730MW, the highest of any site in the UK until later in the same year, when Ferrybridge C Power Station came into full operation. Blyth B was the first power station in Britain to have 275MW sets installed. Its two 350MW sets were an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stage</b> toward the 500MW standard, so very few of the 350MW sets were ever commissioned in the UK. Both of the stations were designed by L J Couves & Partners. They were engineered by Merz & McLellan and built by the Cleveland Bridge Company.|$|E

25|$|Instrumentation Draft (Partiturerstschrift) – in {{the case}} of the four scenes of Das Rheingold, the {{preliminary}} draft was followed by what Wagner termed an Instrumentationsskizze, in which he worked out most of the orchestral details.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this work was to assess whether the {{incorporation}} of <b>intermediate</b> <b>stages</b> during supine bicycle exercise echocardiography (BEE) improves the accuracy of detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) through the evaluation of a biphasic response. BackgroundExercise echocardiography allows cardiac imaging throughout exercise. MethodsExercise echocardiography was performed in 104 patients (mean age 57 ± 11 years, 37 women), 91 of whom underwent coronary angiography. The BEE protocol started at 25 W with increments of 25 W every 3 -min stage. Images were digitized at rest, 25 W, 50 W, and peak exercise. Two experienced observers and 1 less experienced observer interpreted rest and peak exercise images, with and without the <b>intermediate</b> <b>stages.</b> ResultsImaging during <b>intermediate</b> <b>stages</b> improved the sensitivity for detection of all individual vessel stenoses (78 % vs. 58 %, p 10 % predicted CAD (sensitivity 94 %, specificity 74 %) and was more marked than changes observed from rest to peak exercise. The severity of coronary stenosis related to the double product achieved {{at the onset of}} ischemia during exercise (r = − 0. 61, p < 0. 001) better than that at maximal exercise (r = − 0. 31, p < 0. 01). ConclusionsDuring BEE, the acquisition and interpretation of <b>intermediate</b> <b>stages</b> of exercise in addition to peak exercise improves the detection of CAD and allows a better physiologic evaluation of the severity of coronary stenosis...|$|R

25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm type or the piston type. Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the cylinder pressure pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the <b>intermediate</b> <b>stage</b> pressure and a spring. As cylinder pressure falls the closing force is less, so the regulated pressure increases at lower tank pressure. To keep this pressure rise within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator. A balanced regulator keeps about the same ease of breathing at all depths and pressures, by using the cylinder pressure to also indirectly oppose {{the opening of the}} first stage valve.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that {{protease}} enzymes become trapped in inactive antithrombin-protease complexes {{as a consequence of}} their attack on the reactive bond. Although attacking a similar bond within the normal protease substrate results in rapid proteolytic cleavage of the substrate, initiating an attack on the antithrombin reactive bond causes antithrombin to become activated and trap the enzyme at an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stage</b> of the proteolytic process. Given time, thrombin is able to cleave the reactive bond within antithrombin and an inactive antithrombin-thrombin complex will dissociate, however the time it takes for this to occur may be greater than 3 days. However bonds P3-P4 and P1'-P2' can be rapidly cleaved by neutrophil elastase and the bacterial enzyme thermolysin respectively, resulting in inactive antithrombins no longer able to inhibit thrombin activity.|$|E
25|$|In England, the Romanesque groundplan, {{which in}} that country {{commonly}} had a very long nave, continued to affect the style of building of cathedrals and those large abbey churches which were also to become cathedrals at {{the dissolution of the}} monasteries in the 16th century. Despite the fact that English cathedrals were built or rebuilt in many stages, substantial areas of Norman building can be seen in many of them, particularly in the nave arcades. In the case of Winchester Cathedral, the Gothic arches were literally carved out of the existent Norman piers. Other cathedrals have sections of their building which are clearly an <b>intermediate</b> <b>stage</b> between Norman and Gothic, such as the western towers of Ely Cathedral and part of the nave at Worcester Cathedral. The first truly Gothic building in England is the long eastern end of Canterbury Cathedral commenced in 1175.|$|E
