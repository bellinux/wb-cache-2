500|$|Cornell Law School {{professor}} Sherry F. Colb's {{discussion of}} the decision at Findlaw.com {{was one of the}} former. She called the decision [...] "an alarming break with the philosophy of Miranda v. Arizona [...] leaves that decision to stand as an arbitrary <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement,</b> rather than the protection against coercive interrogation that it was originally crafted to be". The author noted the purpose of Miranda was to address psychologically pressured interviews and that it had noted that adequate protection was essential in order [...] "to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings". The Miranda decision was intended to prevent coercion not merely to require a [...] "disclosure of legal facts". The present decision [...] "allow a waiver of the right to occur after interrogation had commenced, through a response to that interrogation". As a result, two subtly different meanings of [...] "right to remain silent" [...] could be construed, and a suspect who was (in the words of Miranda v. Arizona) [...] "vulnerable, unassertive, and in need of protection"—precisely the kind of suspect Miranda aimed at protecting—would be left unaware: ...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{incentives}} of audit {{firms to}} lobby on proposed <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements.</b> The {{results are consistent}} with the proposition that higher expected costs of non-compliance with statutory <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements</b> compared to professional standards provide less incentives for audit firms to lobby in favour of increased statutory <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements</b> and more incentives to lobby in favour of increased professional <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements.</b> Their lobbying in favour on either source of proposed <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements</b> is not associated with increasing size of the audit firm, the amount of new auditing to be generated by the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements</b> or by whether they are specialised in the proposed requirements.

40|$|The <b>disclosure</b> <b>{{requirement}}s</b> {{for firms}} issuing equity on German crowdinvestingplatforms are quite lax at the moment. This paper states that this loose requirement {{policy is not}} optimal {{in the presence of}} competition among platforms. First, a simple three-staged theoretical model is derived to demonstrate that competition among the platforms should result in a maximization of <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements.</b> Second, characteristics about firms and entrepreneurs that should be revealed are identified because they have an empirically verified effect on the risk-return-profile of a company. Third, a recommendation for the practical implementation of improved <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirements</b> is offered...|$|R
50|$|The US Dodd-Frank Act was {{supposed}} to help bring {{about the end of}} conflict diamonds and minerals in the US. The idea was that public opinion would force divestment over time. Section 1502 does not require divestment, but does mandate disclosure. But instead the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> has simply meant new business opportunities for money launderers.|$|E

50|$|California {{has passed}} the Electronic Waste Recycling Act of 2003 (EWRA). This law prohibits the sale of {{electronic}} devices after January 1, 2007, that are prohibited from being sold under the EU RoHS directive, but across a much narrower scope that includes LCDs, CRTs, and the like and only covers the four heavy metals restricted by RoHS.

50|$|The <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> lies at {{the heart}} and origin of patent law. An inventor, or the inventor's assignee, is granted a {{monopoly}} for a given period of time in exchange for the inventor disclosing to the public how to make or practice his or her invention. If a patent fails to contain such information, then the bargain is violated, and the patent is unenforceable or can be revoked.|$|E

[...] See, e.g., Buckley v. Valeo; Citizens United; Davis v. FEC; ACLF. Exacting scrutiny [...] "requires a 'substantial relation' between the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> and a 'sufficiently important' government interest." ...|$|E

50|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision written by LeBel J, the appeal was allowed. The Supreme Court rejected {{the view that}} each claim in a patent is necessarily a separate invention, and concluded that a patent specification must {{be read as a}} whole when identifying the invention in the patent and determining whether the patent satisfies the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement.</b> In its original judgment, the Court declared that Pfizer's patent for sildenafil was void, but the Court later changed its decision to say that Teva had established its allegation that the patent was invalid.|$|E
50|$|The rule {{mandates}} that specific R-value information for home insulation products be disclosed in certain ads {{and at the}} point of sale. The purpose of the R-value <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> for advertising is to prevent consumers from being misled by certain claims which have a bearing on insulating value. At the point of transaction, some consumers {{will be able to get}} the requisite R-value information from the label on the insulation package. However, since the evidence shows that packages are often unavailable for inspection prior to purchase, no labeled information would be available to consumers in many instances. As a result, the Rule requires that a fact sheet be available to consumers for inspection before they make their purchase.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the {{sufficiency}} of <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> is {{complemented by}} an additional requirement, generally {{not found in}} other national patent jurisdictions: the [...] "best mode requirement". According to the requirement, the disclosure must also contain the inventor's [...] "best mode" [...] of making or practicing the invention. For example, if an inventor knows that a liquid should be heated to 250 degrees for optimal performance, but discloses in the patent that the liquid should be heated to [...] "above 200 degrees", then the inventor has not disclosed his [...] "best mode" [...] for carrying out the invention. The best mode must be disclosed for the entire invention, and not only its innovative aspects.|$|E

The service must offer counseling services from a certified counselor and a plan must be created in consultation by the counselor for debt-management service to commence. The contents of the agreements and fees that may be charged are set by the statute. There is a penalty-free three-day right of rescission {{on the part of the}} debtor. The debtor may cancel the agreement also after 30 days, but may be subject to fees if that occurs. The service may terminate the agreement if required payments are delinquent for at least 60 days.|$|E
50|$|The {{relevant}} law, named Audiovisual Law no. 504, {{requires the}} disclosure of all the information necessary to identify the owners of media companies, e.g. name and contact details of the media organisation; name and contact detail of owners; country of domicile of company with an interest; citizenship / residence status of individual with an interest beyond a given threshold. However, the <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> {{does not apply to}} beneficial ownership, which refers to shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person. According to the law, the information must be reported to the National Audiovisual Council, a public regulatory authority {{under the control of the}} Parliament.

5000|$|In February 2013, {{in a rare}} vote, Flowers almost {{achieved}} a major upset when the state's Republican caucus in the House of Representatives joined some Democrats causing a tie vote for a reform measure sponsored by State Rep. John Kowalko that would have immediately adopted the annual financial <b>disclosure</b> <b>requirement</b> for the Cash Board over opposition from the Governor and the Speaker of the House of Representatives (ultimately, the reforms were sent to a committee of the state legislature for review). [...] However, as political payback, the Governor and Democratic leaders of the legislature introduced legislation to reduce {{the powers of the}} State Treasurer. Flowers refused to back down and ultimately, certain portions of the Honest Way reforms were adopted by the state's General Assembly.|$|E
