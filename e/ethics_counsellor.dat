25|$|In November 2000 {{during the}} election, the Grand-Mere Affair, {{also known as}} the Shawinigate scandal broke. After initial denials, Chrétien {{acknowledged}} having lobbied the Business Development Bank of Canada, owned by the Government of Canada, to grant a $2million loan to Yvon Duhaime. Duhaime was a friend and constituent to whom the Prime Minister stated that he had sold his interest in the Grand-Mère Inn, a local Shawinigan-area hotel and golf resort, eventually providing evidence of the sale—a contract written on a cocktail napkin. Duhaime was a local businessman with an unsavoury reputation and a criminal record, who received a loan from the Business Development Bank that he was ineligible to collect on the account of his criminal record (Duhaime did not mention his record when applying for the loan). The Business Development Bank had turned down the initial loan application, but later approved a $615,000 loan following further lobbying by Chrétien. When the Business Development Bank refused to extend the loan in August 1999 under the grounds that Duhaime was a businessman with a bad reputation with a history for losing money on past business ventures and that he was already behind on his current payments, the president of the bank François Beaudoin was fired by Chrétien in September 1999, which led to a wrongful dismissal suit that Beaudoin was to win in 2004. It was revealed that Chrétien had never been paid for his share in the sale of the adjoining golf course, and criminal charges were laid against Duhaime. The Prime Minister's <b>ethics</b> <b>counsellor</b> Howard Wilson, who was appointed by and reported to the Prime Minister, determined that Prime Minister Chrétien had not violated any conflict-of-interest rules, noting that there were no clear rules on lobbying Crown corporations for making loans to business ventures that the Prime Minister may or may not had a stake in. There was no comment on ethics of Chrétien's lobbying by the <b>ethics</b> <b>counsellor</b> Wilson. The revelation of the Grand-Mere affair did not affect the outcome of the 2000 election. Chrétien and his circle believed that the breaking of the Grand-Mere story during the election was the work of the Martin fraction.|$|E
25|$|May 2002 {{also saw}} the revelation that the new public works minister, Don Boudria, had spent the weekend of March 16–17, 2002 at an estate owned by Claude Boulay, the {{president}} of Groupe Everest advertising firm that head received $55million in contracts from the public works ministry, apparently for free. Only after the story of Boudria's stay at the Boulay estate broke in May did Boulay cash an $800 cheque from Boudria that was dated March 16, 2002; many found this to be too convenient, and opposition critics suggested that the cheque had been post-dated to explain away what {{would otherwise have been}} a major ethical violation on the part of Boudria. Boudria was forced to resign on 26 May, to be replaced with Ralph Goodale. An additional scandal broke later in May 2002 when it was revealed that the Defence Minister Art Eggleton had rewarded a contract worth $36, 500 to research mental illness amongst former soldiers to his former lover Maggie Maier without tender {{while at the same time}} the Defence Ministry had already hired a team of experts to research the same subject. As Eggleton was a Paul Martin supporter, Chrétien promptly fired him on May 27, 2002, following a ruling from Howard Wilson that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules. Some such as the columnist Don Martin believed that Wilson's swift running against the Martinista Eggleton was suspicious with Martin writing Wilson had within a day ruled that Eggleton had broken conflict-of-interest rules while Martin wrote: “But what would you call the prime minister’s chat with a Crown corporation banker to bail out a hotel linked to a golf course he may still have an interest in? Funny, <b>ethics</b> <b>counsellor</b> Howard Wilson was in a “see no evil” monkey mode on that score”.|$|E
50|$|Nine years later, in 1994, {{a revised}} Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment Code for Public Office Holders was issued. The Assistant Deputy Registrar General was {{replaced}} by an <b>Ethics</b> <b>Counsellor,</b> who served under {{the general direction of}} the Clerk of the Privy Council. Howard Wilson was appointed as <b>Ethics</b> <b>Counsellor,</b> and administrative support for the Office of the <b>Ethics</b> <b>Counsellor</b> was provided by Industry Canada. The 1994 Code was amended in 2003, 2004 and 2006.|$|E

To my late father, Frank Bergen, who always pushed me {{to do my best}} in whatever I attempted to do. To my three wonderful, now-adult children, Sarah, Lincoln and Rita. Thank you for always cheering me on! And to my siblings, Joanne Dyck, Bill Bergen, and Annette Diemert, various mentors, supporters, friends and cheerleaders along the way, particularly Beth Dalrymple, M. A., R. Psych, who started it all by saying, “You can do what I‟m doing. ” This project draws attention to <b>ethics</b> in <b>counsellor</b> education, showing that ethics is critical to the formation of new counsellors, not simply an add-on component in counsellor training. This project demonstrates that beginning counsellors, before they commence employment, must have a strong ethical foundation. It examines both formal counsellor education and the supervisory relationship central to a practicum o...|$|R
40|$|The NZAC Code of <b>Ethics</b> {{calls on}} <b>counsellors</b> to honour the Treaty of Waitangi. This article explores {{the meaning of}} the Treaty for {{counselling}} practice. This exploration considers but is not confined to the words used in the Mäori and English versions of the Treaty. It surveys three periods of Treaty history that move from initial cooperation through division and disparity to negotiation and restitution, and shows that this history has added to {{the meaning of the}} Treaty. It explores Treaty principles and biculturalism as vehicles for meaning. It offers a broad context for the pursuit of meaning which counsellors might apply in their practice, while also arguing that the meaning of the Treaty cannot be finally decided...|$|R
50|$|A {{month after}} {{becoming}} prime minister, Chrétien {{agreed to sell}} his personal shares in the golf course to Toronto tycoon Jonas Prince. However, by January 1996, Chrétien was still the formal owner of the golf course since Prince had never paid for the shares. He reported this fact to the Federal <b>Ethics</b> <b>Counsellor,</b> Howard Wilson.|$|E
50|$|He registered, but {{withdrew from}} the 2003 mayoral election, due to a ruled {{conflict}} of interest by the federal <b>ethics</b> <b>counsellor</b> stemming {{from the fact that}} Eisenberger was serving as chair of the Hamilton Port Authority. Faced with the choice of resignation from the board or candidacy in the election, he chose to withdraw from the race.|$|E
5000|$|Minna {{was bitter}} about the {{demotion}} and {{complained to the}} Liberal Party's women's caucus that she was told to keep quiet about the issue. She claimed she was [...] "hung out to dry by ambitious individuals...." [...] Later she conceded that the PMO's office {{had told her that}} it would be better to wait for the results of the ethics investigation. Initially the <b>ethics</b> <b>counsellor</b> terminated the allegations probe since she was dropped from Cabinet but Minna insisted that it be reopened. She said, [...] "It's my personal credibility that's at stake. It's not the cabinet post." [...] Fellow Liberal MP Sheila Copps who sympathized with Minna's situation was quoted as saying, [...] "The one thing you have in politics is your reputation." [...] The probe was reopened and she was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing.|$|E

40|$|Ethics is fast {{becoming}} one of the leading topics inthe press. Very few weeks go by when a lead storydoesn’t report on a lapse in ethical principles in business or the latest crisis in government to be sorted out by an ethical ombudsman or ethics committee. The Globe and Mail publishes interactive ethical dilemmas weekly because of greater reader interest. Conflict of interest cases abound in cabinet and at all levels of government. The Prime Minister attempted to defuse thorny situations by appointing an <b>ethics</b> <b>counsellor,</b> Howard Wilson, who reports to the PM directly and not to the House of Commons. Articles such as “Rubber Stamps Aren’t in the Ethics Tool Kit” 1 exemplify the public’s disdain for this type of arm’s-length approach. Since 1994, the <b>ethics</b> <b>counsellor</b> has rubber-stamped almost everything Liberals do as “ethical, ” even when rules have been clearly violated. According to Democracy Watch coordinator Duf...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{validity}} of arguments in favour, and against, {{the establishment of an}} independent ethics "watchdog" in Ottawa by comparing the experience of other jurisdictions with the regulation of ethics in politics. This suggests that neither the independent prosecutor model, nor the Auditor General, provide accurate examples to describe attempts at designing institutions for enforcing ethics in Westminster democracies. The Office of the <b>Ethics</b> <b>Counsellor</b> is a case of flawed institutional design, as is the new commissioner that the ethics bill tabled in October 2002 proposes to create. ...|$|E
