5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; as soon as he <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
25|$|Ling Tong {{respected}} and befriended {{members of the}} scholar-gentry. They admired him {{even though he was}} a military serviceman. Being receptive, he had a reputation for being accommodating towards men of talent. Even when he was busy with work, he always took time to receive visitors. He viewed righteousness and loyalty as important values and saw wealth as inferior. He was thus praised by Chen Shou as a guoshi. Once, Sun Quan's subjects recommended a famous talent, Sheng Xian, to him. Ling Tong was asleep when he heard that Sheng Xian had arrived to meet his lord. He immediately <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> to receive Sheng Xian and held Sheng's hand while leading him to meet Sun Quan.|$|E
25|$|Zhou Yu later ordered Gan Ning {{to station}} at Yiling (夷陵; present-day Yichang, Hubei). Cao Ren sent a {{separate}} cavalry force to besiege Yiling, so Gan Ning sent an urgent request to Zhou Yu for reinforcements. Zhou Yu followed Lü Meng's advice and left Ling Tong {{to defend his}} current position while leading Lü Meng and others to help Gan Ning. After the siege at Yiling was lifted, Zhou Yu and his troops crossed the Yangtze River and attacked Jiangling, with Zhou personally participating in battle. He was hit on his right side by a stray arrow and had to retreat due to {{the severity of the}} wound. When Cao Ren heard that Zhou Yu was wounded and was lying in bed, he led his troops to outside Zhou's camp and taunted the enemy. Zhou Yu <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> and personally inspected his men and encouraged them to raise their morale. Cao Ren saw that and retreated.|$|E

500|$|Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less {{than a month}} later, on 20 June 1837, William IV {{died at the age}} of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In {{her diary}} she wrote, [...] "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me. I <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> and went into my sitting-room (only in my {{dressing}} gown) and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen." [...] Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.|$|E
500|$|Lloyd's biographer Midge Gillies defines 1891 {{as being}} the year that she officially [...] "made it" [...] thanks to a {{catalogue}} of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; The Era called her [...] "the favourite of the hour". During the summer months, she toured North England, including Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester. [...] At the last she stayed an extra six nights due to popular demand, which caused her to cancel a trip to Paris. [...] The 1892 pantomime was Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O' My Thumb, in which she played Little Red Riding Hood. [...] The production was five hours long and culminated with the show's harlequinade. During one scene, her improvisational skills caused some scandal when she <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> to pray, but instead reached for a chamber pot. The stunt angered Harris, who ordered her {{not to do it}} again or risk immediate dismissal. Max Beerbohm, who was in a later audience, said [...] "Isn't Marie Lloyd charming and sweet in the pantomime? [...] I think of little besides her." [...] On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening's performance of Little Bo-Peep. [...] Courtenay pulled a decorative sword off the wall and threatened to cut her throat; she escaped from the room with minor bruises and reported the incident to the Bow Street police station. In early 1893, she travelled to Wolverhampton where she starred as Flossie in another unsuccessful piece called The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous, which, according to MacQueen-Pope, [...] "ended the Queen of Comedy's career as an actress".|$|E

[...] "We used to smoke dope from when we <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> to {{when we got}} back to bed," [...] recalls Porter, and Marr concurred: [...] "You're from Manchester, you smoke weed till it comes out of your ears."

2500|$|One of {{the accused}} mutineers was David Creagh, second officer of the Charles II. He testified that after refusing to {{participate}} in the mutiny—the only officer to do so—he was ordered to return below deck. On the way to his cabin, Creagh encountered William May, Captain Gibson's former steward. May, described by Every as one of the [...] "true cocks of the game, and old sportsmen," [...] was zealously supportive of the mutiny, and Creagh testified of their bone-chilling exchange:I met with W. May, the Prisoner at the Bar. What do you say here? says he. I made him no Answer, but went down to my Cabin; and he said, God damn you, you deserve to be shot through the Head; and he then held a Pistol to my Head. Then I went to my Cabin, and presently came orders from Every, that those that would go ashore, should prepare to be gone. And when the Captain was <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Bed,</b> who was then very ill of a Feaver, Every came and said, I am a Man of Fortune, and must seek my Fortune.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, Sir, indeed,' {{returned}} Dick, {{yielding to}} his destiny and saying whatever came uppermost; 'an equal quantity of slumber was never <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> one <b>bed</b> and bedstead, and if you're {{going to sleep}} in that way, you must pay for a double-bedded room.' ...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the damp}} conditions, there were {{outbreaks}} of typhoid, {{in addition to}} diphtheria, smallpox and scarlet fever, not helped {{by the fact that}} accommodation was scarce, and the workers were living often twenty to thirty in a house. Working 24-hour shifts, as soon as one man <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his <b>bed,</b> another would take his place, with {{little in the way of}} washing or sanitary facilities.|$|R
60|$|He {{always made}} his own breakfast. Being a man who rose early and {{had plenty of time}} he did not, as some miners do, drag his wife <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> at six o'clock. At five, {{sometimes}} earlier, he woke, <b>got</b> straight <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> and went downstairs. When she could not sleep, his wife lay waiting for this time, as for a period of peace. The only real rest seemed to be when he was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the house.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to Moore's own {{work on the}} paradox, the puzzle also inspired {{a great deal of}} work by Ludwig Wittgenstein, who described the paradox as the most impressive philosophical insight that Moore had ever introduced. It is said that when Wittgenstein first heard this paradox one evening (which Moore had earlier stated in a lecture), he rushed round to Moore's lodgings, <b>got</b> him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> and insisted that Moore repeat the entire lecture to him.|$|R
60|$|It {{might have}} been Mr. Pickwick's very {{unexpected}} gallantry, or it {{might have been}} the complicated manner in which he had <b>got</b> himself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> and fallen all in a mass upon the hornpipe man, that touched his adversaries. Touched they were; for, instead of then and there making an attempt to commit man-slaughter, as Mr. Pickwick implicitly believed they would have done, they paused, stared at each other a short time, and finally laughed outright.|$|R
60|$|General Westmacott, however, {{defended his}} right with energy; the rear-guard regiments {{supporting}} each other, while the batteries were in continual action.

5000|$|Prokopi {{says the}} fossils had been shipped {{to him by}} British dealer Chris Moore, who listed the skeleton's origin as Great Britain on customs forms. Because of the {{investment}} Prokopi had made to refurbishing the fossils, seizure by the Mongolian government threatened to destroy his business. He responded by making a legal claim on the specimen. The stand-off ended when [...] "about two dozen federal agents and sheriff's deputies arrived at estate, <b>got</b> Prokopi <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> and arrested him on three counts involving smuggling." [...] Prokopi pleaded guilty to mislabeling the skeleton and was subsequently forced to forfeit his claim.|$|R
