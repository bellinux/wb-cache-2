5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 October, Warren sighted two of the French frigates {{standing}} out of Donegal Bay and went after them, directing Moore in Melampus to stay behind to search for stragglers. Hindered by contrary winds, Melampus scoured the bay until well after nightfall, and at 23:30 {{was surprised by the}} sudden appearance directly in front of her of Immortalité and Résolue near St. John's Point. Immortalité soon spotted Melampus and made sail, but Captain Bargeau of Résolue had not seen the British ship, and was hesitant about following his compatriot in the dark. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> and confusion, he mistook Melampus for Immortalité and came alongside, only realising his mistake when Melampus opened fire. Because of the heavy seas, Résolues guns had been tied down below decks, so the only return fire she could offer was from her handful of quarterdeck guns. Bargeau, whose ship was still leaking badly, recognised that further resistance was futile and surrendered in minutes, having lost ten men and much of his rigging. Melampus put aboard a prize crew and then departed in pursuit of Immortalité.|$|E

The inaugural first-class match was played at NSK between Pakistan and India on 21–24 April 1955, and it became a fortress of Pakistan cricket.

25|$|The two escort {{ships were}} unaware of what was {{happening}} to General Belgrano, as they were out of touch with her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> and had not seen the distress rockets or lamp signals. Adding to the confusion, the crew of Bouchard felt an impact that was possibly the third torpedo striking {{at the end of its}} run (an examination of the ship later showed an impact mark consistent with a torpedo). The two ships continued on their course westward and began dropping depth charges. By the time the ships realised that something had happened to General Belgrano, it was already dark and the weather had worsened, scattering the life rafts.|$|E

25|$|The {{left-hand}} battalion {{got lost}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> and smoke blown over Guillemont, some troops veered right and met uncut wire south-east of the village, before falling back to Trônes Wood. Another party took a trench {{south of the}} railway, which ran eastwards past {{the north end of}} Guillemont and was then pushed back to trenches near Waterlot Farm, obstructing the right of the 3rd Division. On the left, the 3rd Division attacked Guillemont Station, Delville Wood and Longueval, with the 8th Brigade on the right attempting to occupy ground south of the railway. The troops of the 8th Brigade were held up, then fell back to Waterlot Farm, repulsing a German counter-attack later in the morning. Further north, a battalion also tried to bomb down trenches from Waterlot Farm, either side of the Guillemont road and the railway, to the station. The advance was soon stopped by machine-gun fire from Ginchy and the ground to the north-east, forcing the troops to withdraw; the 9th Brigade attacked Delville Wood and Longueval as part of the Battle of Delville Wood.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Wagram, Sahuc led a {{division}} {{consisting of the}} 6th Chasseurs, 8th Chasseurs, and 9th Chasseurs. Before crossing the Danube, he gave a bombastic speech to his horsemen. His cavalry supported the evening attack on 5 July. At first the attack looked promising and Sahuc's chasseurs broke an Austrian battalion. Then the Vincent Chevau-léger Regiment No. 4 caught his horsemen in flank and drove them off. Without cavalry support, the infantry faltered {{in the face of}} an Austrian infantry counterattack. The assault ended in failure with the French fleeing back to their starting positions after suffering heavy losses. As dusk came on, Sahuc's troopers countercharged the Austrian cavalry, first firing a volley with their pistols and carbines before wading into them. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom,</b> the white-coated chevau-légers presented obvious targets. Even so, Sahuc lost two of his colonels before the entire French force fell back. On 6 July, his cavalry guarded the flanks of Jacques MacDonald's famous hollow square as it attacked the Austrian center.|$|E

5|$|Partial solar eclipses are {{hazardous}} to view because the eye's pupil is not {{adapted to the}} unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to {{the total amount of}} light <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of view, not by <b>the</b> brightest object <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by <b>the</b> Moon passing <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> overall <b>gloom,</b> <b>the</b> pupil expands from ~2mm to ~6mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent blind spots for the viewer. The hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for children, because there is no perception of pain: it is not immediately obvious that one's vision is being destroyed.|$|R

[...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom.</b> It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else.

Christ brings the true {{light to the}} dark space of the sitting tax-collectors. This painting records the collision of two worlds — the ineluctable power of the immortal faith, and the mundane, foppish, world of Levi. Jesus spears him with a beam of light, with an apparent effortless hand gesture he exerts an inescapable sublime gravity, with no need for wrenching worldly muscularity. Jesus' bare feet are classical simplicity <b>in</b> contrast with <b>the</b> dandified accountants; being barefoot may also symbolize holiness, as if one is on holy ground. Similarly to his treatment of Paul <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Conversion on the Way to Damascus, Caravaggio chronicles the moment when a daily routine is interrupted by the miraculous. Around the man to become Matthew are either the unperceptive or unperturbed bystanders.|$|R
50|$|Interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> museum dwindled {{over the}} {{following}} decade even as its collection grew, and <b>in</b> 1869 <b>the</b> somewhat neglected and forlorn museum {{was transferred to the}} care of The Auckland Institute, a learned society formed two years earlier. An Italianate-style building was constructed for <b>the</b> museum <b>in</b> Princes Street, near Government House and across the road from the Northern Club. These new premises included a large gallery top-lit by a metal framed skylight. This room proved problematic as it was impossible to heat during the winter but overheated during the summer. Canvas awnings used to shield the roof from harsh sunlight made the exhibits difficult to view <b>in</b> <b>the</b> resulting <b>gloom.</b> One of <b>the</b> visitors during the 1890s was the French artist Gauguin, who sketched several Maori items and later incorporated them into his Tahitian period paintings.|$|R
2500|$|A bigger German {{attack on}} 25 September, on a [...] front, from the Menin Road to Polygon Wood, began as the 23rd Division was being {{relieved}} by the 33rd Division.

The German infantry advanced in the morning mist, {{either side of the}} Reutelbeek as the artillery boxed the British position opposite, which isolated it from its supports and prevented supplies of ammunition from being brought to the front line. The German attack made little progress on the British right, lost direction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> and veered north, joined with the German battalion there and reached Black Watch Corner, at the south-western extremity of Polygon Wood, which was lost during the Battle of Polygon Wood next day.|$|E
2500|$|Seven cruiser tanks {{from the}} 2nd RTR arrived {{north of the}} hussars and {{destroyed}} the anti-aircraft battery from Benina airfield {{by the light of}} burning vehicles. As dark fell the attacks were stopped despite the Italian disarray, because the 4th Armoured Brigade had been reduced to syphoning the petrol from artillery vehicles and looting Italian supplies to keep going. A better organised and supported Italian breakthrough attempt had to be anticipated for the morning and the tanks disengaged and moved about [...] east of the road to refuel and rearm. Italian vehicle movements around Ghemines and air reconnaissance reports showed that the Italians had achieved a measure of co-ordination and that reinforcements were arriving from the north. Two tanks were seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> but the crews surrendered to a British soldier, when he knocked on their hatches. Further south, a Rifle Brigade patrol escorting two RHA anti-tank guns moved along the column, firing from different points to give the impression of a larger force and to keep the Italians pinned down, as Combeforce dug in deeper and sowed more mines.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the right}} of XIV Corps, the 56th Division {{attacked}} on 9 September at [...] A battalion of the 169th Brigade advanced from the south-east of Leuze Wood towards Loop Trench, to establish a defensive flank along the Combles ravine. German artillery and machine-gun fire forced the battalion back; another battalion was sent forward as reinforcements but took until [...] to find its way through German artillery-fire and the dark. A battalion attacking from inside Leuze Wood, managed to capture the main German line beyond the sunken road into Combles at Bouleaux Wood, then advance north-west to the Guillemont–Morval road, south-east of the Quadrilateral and dig in. The 168th Brigade advanced to the north-east, from south of the Leuze Wood–Guillemont road by pivoting on its right flank, intending to reach the German line from Leuze Wood to the Quadrilateral. The right-hand battalion hugged the barrage and reached its first objective easily about [...] forward, despite the left flank battalion being raked by small-arms fire and only the company on the right reaching its first objective on the Leuze Wood–Ginchy road. The battalion on the right advanced again, when the barrage began to move forward at [...] to the final objective, at the German trench from the Quadrilateral to Bouleaux Wood.
