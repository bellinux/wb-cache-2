40|$|The {{horizontal}} and vertical <b>diameters</b> of the pedicles of the lumbar vertebrae were measured from plain anteroposterior radiographs of the lumbar spines {{of male and female}} subjects aged from 10 to 65 y. The results showed that there were significant differences between the pedicle <b>diameters</b> of males and females. Horizontal <b>diameters</b> ranged from 7. 4 to 13. 6 mm in females and from 7. 5 to 14. 2 mm in males. Female vertical <b>diameters</b> ranged from 14. 2 to 18. 2 mm whilst male vertical <b>diameters</b> ranged from 14. 8 to 20. 7 mm. Generally, there was a cephalocaudal increase of <b>diameters</b> in both sexes. Significant age-related variations of pedicle <b>diameters</b> were noted at all segmental levels. Within the adolescent group (10 - 19. 9 y), the <b>diameters</b> of the 10 - 14. 9 y group and 15 - 19. 9 y group differed significantly (P < 0. 001). When the pedicle <b>diameters</b> of the individual age groups were compared, the pedicles of the 10 - 19. 9, 20 - 29. 9, 30 - 34. 9, 40 - 49. 9, and 50 + y groups were found to be significantly different from each other. The evidence suggests that pedicle <b>diameters</b> undergo continuous change throughout the age range studied. The changes are characterised by increase of <b>diameters</b> in some age groups and decrease in others, but there was an overall increase of both vertical and horizontal <b>diameters</b> as the age groups were followed from the youngest to the oldest.

5|$|According to an IAU draft resolution, the {{roundness}} condition generally {{results in}} {{the need for a}} mass of at least 5 kg, or <b>diameter</b> of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that these numbers are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in <b>diameter.</b> It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature.

Brain volume was measured to express CBF per 100 ml brain volume. Retinal arteriolar and venular <b>diameters</b> were measured on digitized fundus color transparencies on 1 eye of each participant. Regression models were used to investigate the association of SaO(2) and CBF with retinal vessel <b>diameters.</b> Mean retinal arteriolar and venular <b>diameters</b> (in micrometers).
