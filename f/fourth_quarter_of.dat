40|$|The Scottish {{index of}} {{industrial}} production {{has now been}} revised to base 1975 = 100, following a similar revision to the UK index.

Thus, Scottish production in the final <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> 1978, {{a year in which}} the UK economy was thought to have staged some sort of recovery, was actually less than average quarterly production in 1975.
