40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{clinical}} efficiency of escalation and de-escalation procedures for optimizing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting from direct and in indirect damaging factors. Subjects and methods. During a prospective study, 46 examined patients (30 men, 16 women; their age was 21 to 67 years) with ARDS of different genesis were divided into 2 groups: 1) 22 patients (14 men and 8 women) in whom the causes of ARDS were direct damaging factors: gastric content aspiration, blunt chest injury with lung contusion, and acute bilateral bacterial pneumonia; 2) 24 patients (16 men and 8 women) in whom the causes of ARDS were indirect damaging factors: abdominal sepsis, severe nonthoracic injury, and acute massive blood loss. In Groups 1 and 2, {{the efficiency of the}} escalation and de-escalation procedures for PEEP optimization was compared during controlled MV with a managed object. Results. In the patients with ARDS caused by direct damaging factors, the <b>escalation</b> <b>procedure</b> for PEEP optimization was more effective than the de-escalation one. In those with ARDS caused by indirect damaging factors, the de-escalation procedure for PEEP optimization was more effective than the escalation one. Conclusion.

The first 20 presses each resulted in the delivery of a 45 -mg food pellet. Then, the FR increased (2, 4, 8, 11, 16, 20, 25, 30) when each IRT in the ratio was less than 2 s during three consecutive ratios. Sessions lasted 13 hr or until 500 pellets were earned. On average, rats reached a terminal ratio of 11 (mean) or 16 (median) during the first session. Seven rats reached the maximum value of FR 30 and only one rat did not acquire the response. In most rats, a break-and-run pattern of responding characteristic of FR schedules began to develop in this acquisition session. Subsequently, the ratio-escalation procedure continued during daily 2 -hr sessions. In these sessions, the starting ratio requirement was set at the terminal ratio reached in the previous session.

Female gonadal hormones influence responses to stimulant drugs, and estrogen (EST) facilitates while progesterone (PROG) attenuates these responses. The PROG metabolite allopregnanolone (ALLO) also suppresses responses to cocaine, {{and it may}} be responsible for PROG's attenuating effects. The research included in this thesis is concerned with the influence of PROG and its metabolite ALLO on animal models of escalation or bingeing of cocaine of intake (Experiments 1 and 2) and reinstatement of extinguished drug seeking or relapse (Experiments 3, 4, and 5). Experiment 1 focused on the influence of PROG on the escalation of cocaine self-administration that occurs with long (6 h) daily access in ovariectomized (OVX) and gonadally intact female rats treated with either EST or VEH. Following the <b>escalation</b> <b>procedure,</b> treatment groups were compared on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule for several doses of cocaine. This research was extended to the PROG metabolite ALLO in Experiment 2 a. Gonadally intact female rats were treated with ALLO or VEH and allowed to earn either i. v. cocaine infusions or sucrose deliveries under a long-access (LgA) <b>escalation</b> <b>procedure.</b> In Experiment 2 b sucrose was used to determine the specificity of ALLO's effects on the escalation of cocaine self-administration, and in Experiment 2 c control conditions were used to examine the effect of ALLO on locomotor activity and operant behavior reinforced by food. In Experiment 3 the effects of PROG on the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior were examined in OVX and intact female rats that received EST or VEH treatment. In Experiment 4 the mechanism of PROG's effects was further studied by using finasteride, a 5 -alpha reductase inhibitor that prevents the metabolism of PROG into ALLO. Finasteride (FIN) was administered concurrently with PROG to determine whether it could block the attenuating effects of PROG on cocaine-primed reinstatement, thus implicating ALLO in PROG's actions. Allopregnanolone was also tested on cocaine-primed reinstatement in male and female rats to examine possible sex-specific treatment effects. In the final experiment (Experiment 5), the effects of ALLO were examined on stress-induced reinstatement by injecting rats with yohimbine (YOH) to generate a stressful condition. Results from Experiment 1 indicated that EST facilitated while PROG attenuated the escalation of cocaine self-administration during LgA, but neither hormone affected cocaine-maintained responding under a PR schedule. Experiment 2 a confirmed that ALLO also attenuated the escalation of cocaine self-administration, and 2 b indicated that ALLO did not affect the escalation of intake of a nondrug reward (i. e., sucrose). Experiment 2 c revealed that ALLO also had no effect on locomotor activity or operant food-reinforced behavior. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that PROG and ALLO also decreased the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior precipitated by i. p. injections of cocaine. Results from Experiment 4 further indicated that the attenuation of cocaine seeking by PROG may be attributed to its conversion into ALLO, as blocking this conversion with FIN prevented PROG's attenuating effects. In addition, the effects of ALLO were specific to females and did not extend to males. Finally, in Experiment 5, female rats exhibited greater reinstatement of cocaine seeking following a stressful stimulus (YOH) than males, and the attenuating effects of ALLO on this behavior were specific to females. Taken together, these results demonstrated a role for PROG and ALLO in suppressing the bingeing and relapse associated with cocaine abuse. These effects were specific to cocaine seeking in females (vs. males) and did not extend to behavior maintained by a nondrug rewards (i. e., sucrose or food) or locomotor activity...|$|E
40|$|IT {{increasingly}} underpins most {{forms of}} commercial, industrial and government activity. Organisational opportunities and risks related to IT sit {{better in the}} field of IT governance than IT project management alone. This is the more apparent when one considers that many decades of research into project management has failed to significantly improve the 80 - 90 % failure rate of IT projects [1]. IT failure has lead to the failure of organizations and the recent spate of corporate collapses and the aftermath of Sept 11 has refocussed attention on corporate governance and security. For all these reasons, the need for a risk management framework in the context of IT governance is growing but to date there has been no solution. It is difficult because many key success factors are beyond the control of the IT function. Researchers and practitioners are recognising the risk management framework must follow an integrated multi-stakeholder approach [1] [2] [3]. This paper lays the groundwork to develop an integrated approach to risk management and IT governance. It does this by reviewing the development of all major traditions of risk management. It then presents the current crisis in the field because of the recognition of the limitations of statistical approaches to risk. Finally, by synthesising the best of all current practices, it proposes an IT goverance framework which is able to communicate risk from an operational level through all decision makers to Board level and beyond. A case study of a project failure was analysed against this framework and weaknesses in current governance practices were revealed. The framework was shown to hold much promise for practice because it is likely the infrastructure already exists in current business practices to rapidly implement this framework, it leads logically to an <b>escalation</b> <b>procedure</b> for accountability and it effectively addresses the multi-stakeholder issues that confront the modern organization.

The study aims were to introduce and assess the performance of clinically based response surface pathway (RSP) design for dose-finding studies, exemplified by one between-patient study, one within-patient study, and simulation studies. Methods: The between-patient study consisted of 15 women suffering from stage IV breast cancer, while the within-patient study consisted of seven female dogs with metastatic mammary cancer. The studies were conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a new anticancer agent named BP-C 1 using three-level RSP designs. Adjustment of the dose from one design level to the next {{was based on a}} k-adjustment factor estimated to ensure coverage of the entire predefined dose window. Patient sequences with an equal number of patients as design levels were included in the between-patient design, whereas the same patients were included in all the design levels in the within-patient design. Results: Four of the five patient sequences in the between-patient study and all seven dogs in the within-patient study reached the upper limit of the dose windows without any increase in toxicity. The MTD of BP-C 1 was thus found to be higher than the predefined cumulative dose window for both patient groups. In all three scenarios, the RSP design estimated MTDs better than the traditional 3 + 3 design; however, the toxicity rates were found to be higher when the target MTD was under the starting dose. Conclusion: The RSP designs do not need an assumed statistical model, and may be useful in estimating MTD, using a minimal sample size. The k-adjustment factor ensures complete dose window coverage and the design utilizes more information by allowing multinomial outcomes.

Methods: Thirty HIV-infected prisoners meeting DSM-IV pre-incarceration criteria for opioid dependence were enrolled in a prison-based, pre-release MMT program in Kiang Valley, Malaysia; 3 died before release from prison leaving 27 evaluable participants. Beginning 4 months before release, standardized methadone initiation and dose <b>escalation</b> <b>procedures</b> began with 5 mg daily {{for the first week}} and 5 mg/daily increases weekly until 80 mg/day or craving was satisfied. Participants were followed for 12 months post-release at a MMT clinic within 25 kilometers of the prison. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to {{evaluate the}} impact of methadone dose on post-release retention in treatment. Findings: Methadone dose >= 80 mg/day at the time of release was significantly associated with retention in treatment. After 12 months of release, only 21. 4 of participants on = 80 mg (Log Rank chi(2) = (1, 26) 7. 6, p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Higher doses of MMT at time of release are associated with greater retention on MMT after release to the community. Important attention should be given to monitoring and optimizing MMT doses to address cravings and side effects prior to community re-entry from prisons. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study using a retrospective medical record audit, in a universityaffiliated, tertiary referral hospital with a two-tier rapid response system in Melbourne, Australia. We used {{a convenience sample of}} hospital inpatients on general medical, surgical and specialist service wards admitted during a 24 -hour period in 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical emergency team (MET) or code blue activation, unplanned intensive care unit admissions, hospital length of stay and inhospital mortality. For patients who fulfilled CRC or MET criteria during the 24 - hour period, the specific criteria fulfilled, escalation treatments and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: Of the sample (N = 422), 81 patients (19 %) fulfilled CRC on 109 occasions. From 109 CRC events, 66 patients (81 %) had at least one observation fulfilling CRC, and 15 patients (18 %) met CRC on multiple occasions. The documented escalation rate was 58 of 109 events (53 %). The number of patients who fulfilled CRC and subsequent MET call activation criteria within 24 hours was significantly greater than the number who did not meet CRC (P < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: About one in five patients reached CRC during the study period; these patients were about four times more likely to also fulfil MET call criteria.

40|$|BACKGROUND For {{the past}} decade, Maternal Mortality Reports, {{published}} in the United Kingdom every three years, have consistently raised concerns about maternal observations in maternity care. The reports identify that observations are not being done, not being completed fully, are not recorded on Early Warning Score systems, and/or are not escalated appropriately. This has resulted in delays in referral, intervention and {{increases the risk of}} maternal morbidity or mortality. However there has been little exploration of the possible reasons for non-completion of maternal observations. METHODS The aim {{of this study was to}} explore midwives' experiences of performing maternal observations and escalating concerns in rural and urban maternity settings in the West Midlands of England. A qualitative design involving a series of six focus groups with midwives and Supervisors of Midwives was employed to investigate the facilitators of, and barriers to the completion of maternal observations. RESULTS Eighteen Midwives and 8 Supervisors of Midwives participated in a total of 6 focus groups. Three key themes emerged from the data: (1) Organisation of Maternal Observations (including delegation of tasks to Midwifery Support Workers, variation in their training, the care model used e. g. one to one care, and staffing issues); (2) Prioritisation of Maternal Observations (including the role of professional judgement and concerns expressed by midwives that they did not feel equipped to care for women with complex clinical needs; and (3) Negotiated Escalation (including the inappropriate response from senior staff to use of Modified Early Warning Score systems, and the emotional impact of escalation). CONCLUSIONS A number of organisational and cultural barriers exist to the completion of maternal observations and the escalation of concerns. In order to address these the following actions are recommended: standardised training for Midwifery Support Workers, review of training of midwives to ensure it addresses the increasing complexity of the maternal population, identification and agreement regarding the organisation of maternal observations among staff, an emphasis on increasing the priority placed on maternal observations in all clinical settings, and clarification and reinforcement of <b>escalation</b> <b>procedures</b> for both midwives and senior clinicians...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} problem of the mistaken killing of civilians in armed conflict. This occurs when a civilian is intentionally killed by armed forces because he or she is mistakenly believed to pose a threat of harm. The requirement that armed forces distinguish between combatants and civilians who are immune from being attacked is known as the principle of distinction in the international humanitarian law. The problem posed by distinguishing irregular fighters from ordinary civilians has long been recognized in the law, and the modern laws of war were developed, in part, to respond to this problem. At present, two of the more influential approaches to resolving {{the problem of}} distinction are the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Interpretive Guidance on Civilian Direct Participation in Hostilities, which sets out the ICRCs opinion on the circumstances under which civilian participants may be targeted, and modern Rules of Engagement, which regulate the use of force by soldiers and security forces during combat operations. This dissertation argues that both methods are inadequate to resolving the problem of distinction, because they are overbroad, in that they authorize the killing of civilians who have done nothing to forfeit their immunity, and therefore violate this key requirement of the international laws of war. This dissertation proposes a definition of civilian direct participation in hostilities that is based upon ordinary rules governing self-defense. In this way, a civilian will forfeit his or her life only when there is clear and convincing evidence {{that he or she is}} engaged in an act of aggression that wrongfully poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm to civilians or members of armed forces, and the use of force is necessary and proportionate to prevent that harm. Force will be necessary and proportionate only after de-escalation of force procedures have been diligently applied, and the consequences of the use of force on the surrounding population would not be indiscriminate or disproportionate, or be such as to spread terror. Merging the rules for defensive force with the laws of armed conflict possesses several advantages over the present practice of treating self-defensive killings as being separate from, and largely superseding, international law and its norms protecting civilians. First, this approach solves the problem of providing a principled definition of civilian direct participation in hostilities, which has long been the subject of controversy and contention among states and international organizations. Second, this approach provides an explanation for why pre-emptive and status-based interpretations of civilian direct participation result in unjustified killings. Hopefully, this will be a first step in quelling the growing practice of targeting persons based upon group affiliations, both real and perceived, that is gaining legitimacy. At the same time, this approach also addresses the growing problem of mistaken killings during escalation of force incidents. At present, the international laws of armed conflict do not obligate states to use minimal force when dealing with civilians and suspected civilian participants. However, if civilian direct participation were to be based upon rules for defensive force, then minimal force and <b>escalation</b> of force <b>procedures</b> would become mandatory, rather than merely recommended, as they ensure that the killing is necessary a fundamental component of justified defensive force. Furthermore, this provides an analytical framework that can be used to analyze novel or controversial cases of civilian participation, rather than allowing states to make these decisions on an ad hoc, and largely discretionary, basis...|$|R
