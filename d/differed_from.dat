5|$|Grant's {{claims that}} Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga {{correlate}} to Western esoteric traditions, {{and that both}} stem from a core, ancient source, has parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists. However, Grant <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> Traditionalists like René Guénon and Ananda Coomaraswamy in his positive assessment of Western occultism. Moreover, Grant's appreciation of Asian spiritual traditions has {{much in common with}} Theosophy, although Grant <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> the Theosophical movement with his valorisation of the 'left hand path'.|$|E
5|$|Marriage {{policy in}} {{imperial}} China <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> dynasty to dynasty. Several dynasties practiced Heqin, which involved marrying off princesses to other royal families.|$|E
5|$|René Descartes (1596–1650) {{proposed}} {{a number of}} ontological arguments, which <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> Anselm's formulation. Generally speaking, they are less formal arguments than natural intuition.|$|E
60|$|Science is, I believe, {{nothing but}} trained and {{organised}} common sense, <b>differing</b> <b>from</b> the latter {{only as a}} veteran may <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> a raw recruit: and its methods <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> those of common sense only {{so far as the}} guardsman's cut and thrust <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> the manner in which a savage wields his club.|$|R
50|$|Science parks <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> {{high-technology}} {{business districts}} {{in that they}} are more organized, planned, and managed. They <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> science centres in that they lead to commercialized products <b>from</b> research. They <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> industrial parks which focus on manufacturing and from business parks which focus on administration.|$|R
25|$|Examination of this genus by Sues et al. (2011) {{demonstrates}} that Daemonosaurus is {{separate and distinct}} from its other contemporaries. Daemonosaurus <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Herrerasaurus based on key features in the skull and because it has much larger teeth in the premaxilla. Daemonosaurus <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Eodromaeus based on features of the jaw bone, skull, cheek bones, and because it has much larger teeth in the premaxilla. Daemonosaurus <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Eoraptor lunensis based {{on the presence of}} much larger premaxillary and anterior maxillary teeth and a much more restricted antorbital fossa on the maxilla. Daemonosaurus <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Tawa hallae and Coelophysis bauri in features of the skull bones. Daemonosaurus <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Chindesaurus bryansmalli in features of the cervical vertebrae.|$|R
5|$|As of 1800 all German {{states and}} cities except Lübeck (which had the Dutch troy standard) {{followed}} the Nuremberg standard. It was also the standard for Denmark, Norway, the Russian Empire and most cantons of Switzerland. Poland and Sweden had their own variants of the standard, which <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> each other by 0.6%.|$|E
5|$|E. annectens <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> E. regalis {{by having}} a longer, lower, less robust skull. Although Brett-Surman {{regarded}} E. regalis and E. annectens as potentially representing males and females of the same species, all E. regalis specimens come from older formations than E. annectens specimens.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy IV {{introduced}} Square's Active Time Battle (ATB) system, which <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> the turn-based {{designs of}} previous RPGs. The ATB system {{centers on the}} player inputting orders for the characters in real time during battles. The system was used in many subsequent Square games.|$|E
50|$|An {{allosome}} (also {{referred to}} as a sex chromosome, heterotypical chromosome, heterochromosome, or idiochromosome) is a chromosome that <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> an ordinary autosome in form, size, and behavior. The human sex chromosomes, a typical pair of mammal allosomes, determine the sex of an individual created in sexual reproduction. Autosomes <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> allosomes because autosomes appear in pairs whose members have the same form but <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> other pairs in a diploid cell, whereas members of an allosome pair may <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> one another and thereby determine sex.|$|R
50|$|The species <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> H. boydii in that {{it lacks}} large conical scales below the tympanum; it <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> H. spinipes {{in that it}} has {{lanceolate}} scales on the nuchal and dorsal crests (rather than triangular); and it <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> all other species of Hypsilurus in {{that it has a}} heterogeneous (rather than homogeneous) dorsal scalation.|$|R
50|$|Wages {{are defined}} {{somewhat}} differently for different withholding tax purposes. Thus, {{federal income tax}} wages may <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> Social Security wages which may <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> state wages.|$|R
5|$|Her {{approach}} to religious piety <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> {{the approach of}} her predecessors, as she was influenced by Jansenist ideas. The empress actively supported conversion to Roman Catholicism by securing pensions for converts. She tolerated Greek Catholics and emphasised their equal status with Roman Catholics.|$|E
5|$|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is {{an action}} game {{released}} in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game {{is based on}} the arcade game and film of the same name. The resulting product <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> the arcade version in several aspects, but kept the same underlying premise and style.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{only three}} ships {{were going to}} be built in the class, but Georgii Pobedonosets was built to a {{modified}} Ekaterina II design when a more modern design could not be prepared in a timely manner after Sinop was launched. She mainly <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> her half-sisters in her armor layout and composition.|$|E
40|$|Mirror neurons become instigated {{when the}} spectator empathizes with the principal’s intention. But when they involve imitation, empathy ({{understanding}}) is irrelevant. While understanding may attenuate the principal’s emotion, imitation escalates it. A {{solution of the}} contradictory attenuation/escalation pathways of fellow-feeling is to distinguishing two axes: “rationality axis ” concerns whether the action is efficient or suboptimal; “intentionality axis” concerns whether the intention is wellbeing or evil. The solution shows how group solidarity <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> altruism and fairness; how revulsion <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> squeamishness; how sympathy <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> adulation; how evil <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> selfishness; and how racia...|$|R

50|$|Similar in form to Iris {{tigridia}} (within Pseudoregalia section) and Iris bloudowii (another Psammiris section iris), but <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> bloudowii, {{in having}} an ob-conical, not prostrate rhizome. It <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> tigridia by having old leaf fibres on the rhizome. It also <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Iris tigridia in leaf form, Iris potaninii has rounded ended leaves, {{which do not}} end in a point.|$|R
5|$|The {{proportions}} of the legs, pelvis and sacrum of the Rodrigues and red rail were generally similar. The Rodrigues rail <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> the red rail by having a broader and shorter skull, longer and lower nostrils, a proportionately longer humerus, a shorter, stouter femur, {{as well as a}} considerably different plumage, based on early descriptions.|$|E
5|$|The {{separate}} pronouns {{have both}} a {{short and long}} form that are used for emphatic and normal pronouns respectively. Examples of the emphatic form include: emmë, elyë, entë (1st to 3rd person plural). Such emphatic disjunctive pronouns, were already present in early Quenya but <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> the later versions (e.g. plural: tûto, sîse, atta).|$|E
5|$|Wilber's {{interpretation}} of Aurobindo's philosophy <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> {{the notion of}} dividing reality as a different level of matter, life, mind, overmind, supermind proposed by Aurobindo in The Life Divine, and terms them as higher- or lower-nested holons and states {{that there is only}} a fourfold reality (a system of reality created by himself).|$|E
25|$|Laksa Johor is <b>from</b> Johor. It <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> Laksa Penang {{by having}} coconut milk added during cooking. It also <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> other laksas by using {{spaghetti}} instead of rice-based noodles.|$|R
50|$|Pellets <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> oolites and intraclasts, {{which are}} also found in limestones. They <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> oolites in that pellets lack the radial or {{concentric}} structures that characterize oolites. They <b>differ</b> <b>from</b> intraclasts in that pellets lack the complex internal structure, which is typical of intraclasts. In addition, pellets, quite unlike intraclasts, are characterized by a remarkable uniformity of shape, extremely good sorting, and small size.|$|R
40|$|The mirror-neuron system (MNS) becomes instigated {{when the}} spectator empathizes with the principal’s intention. MNS also {{involves}} imitation, where empathy is irrelevant. While the former may attenuate the principal’s emotion, the latter paradoxically reinforces it. This paper proposes {{a solution of}} the contradictory attenuation/reinforcement functions of fellow-feeling by distinguishing two axes: “rationality axis ” concerns whether the action is efficient or suboptimal; “intentionality axis ” concerns whether the intention is “wellbeing ” or “evil. ” The solution shows how group solidarity <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> altruism and fairness; how revulsion <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> squeamishness; how malevolence <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> selfishness; and how racial hatred <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> racia...|$|R
5|$|After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat {{attempted}} to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia. In their analysis, it <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> {{the rest of}} the Eastern Bloc because it was established by the partisans of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by Jock Haston and supported by Ted Grant, were highly critical of this move.|$|E
5|$|Another known form {{of solid}} {{tetravalent}} americium chloride is KAmF5. Tetravalent americium {{has also been}} observed in the aqueous phase. For this purpose, black Am(OH)4 was dissolved in 15-M NH3F with the americium concentration of 0.01 M. The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum {{which is similar to}} that of AmF4 but <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> other oxidation states of americium. Heating the Am(IV) solution to 90°C did not result in its disproportionation or reduction, however a slow reduction was observed to Am(III) and assigned to self-irradiation of americium by alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, {{were also a}} hallmark of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E

25|$|True {{airspeed}} <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> {{the equivalent}} airspeed because the airspeed indicator is calibrated at SL, ISA conditions, {{where the air}} density is 1.225kg/m³, whereas the air density in flight normally <b>differs</b> <b>from</b> this value.|$|R
5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> McCarthy's definition and argued that elbow strikes parallel with the floor in side control (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as he considered 12-6 elbows as being based on where the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E
5|$|Cheap at Half the Price was {{recorded}} by Frith {{at his home}} in New York City on a 4-track machine. He played all the instruments himself, with the exception of bass guitar on two tracks, and drums, for which he used tapes and samples previously recorded by other drummers. The record <b>differed</b> <b>from</b> Frith's previous experimental albums in that it consisted largely of pop-like songs, and he sang for the first time.|$|E
