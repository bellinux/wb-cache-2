40|$|Victoria Neville, 1 Mary Lam, 2 Christopher J Gordon 3 1 Faculty of Science, Medicine and Health, The University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia; 2 Faculty of Health Science, 3 Sydney Nursing School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia Background: The use of {{information}} and communication technology (ICT) in <b>health</b> <b>professional</b> education is increasing rapidly. <b>Health</b> <b>professional</b> educators need to be responsive to health professionals&# 39; information and communication technological needs; however, there is a paucity {{of information}} about educators&# 39; attitudes to, and capabilities with, ICT. Methods: Fifty-two <b>health</b> <b>professional</b> educators, enrolled in <b>health</b> <b>professional</b> education postgraduate studies, participated in an online subject with specific eLearning components requiring the use of ICT. They completed a pre- and postquestionnaire pertaining to ICT attitudes, confidence, and usage. Results: Participants reported significant increases in overall ICT confidence during the subject despite it being high at baseline (mean: 7. 0 out of 10; P= 0. 02). Even with increased ICT confidence, there were decreases in the participants&# 39; sense of ICT control when related to <b>health</b> <b>professional</b> education (P= 0. 002); whereas, {{the amount of time}} participants engaged with ICT devices was negatively correlated with the sense of ICT control (P= 0. 002). The effect of age and health discipline on ICT attitudes and confidence was not significant (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: This study reports that <b>health</b> <b>professional</b> educators have perceptual deficits toward ICT. The impact of eLearning increased confidence in ICT but caused a reduction in participants&# 39; sense of control of ICT. <b>Health</b> <b>professional</b> educators require more ICT training and support to facilitate better ICT integration in <b>health</b> <b>professional</b> education settings.

5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other <b>health</b> <b>professionals.</b>|$|E

The panel released its final report in August 2007, devoting more than 30 pages to detailing Cho's troubled history. In the report, the panel criticized the failure of the educators and mental <b>health</b> <b>professionals</b> who came into contact with Cho during his college years to notice his deteriorating condition and help him. The panel also criticized misinterpretations of privacy laws and gaps in Virginia's mental health system and gun laws. In addition, the panel faulted Virginia Tech administrators in particular for failing to take immediate action after the first shootings. Nevertheless, the report did acknowledge that Cho was still primarily responsible for not seeking assistance and for his murderous rampage.|$|E
