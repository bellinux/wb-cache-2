To mitigate this we propose an incident detection system for cloud computing: Security Audit as a Service (SAaaS), which is build upon intelligent, autonomous agents collecting data directly at the source, analyze and aggregate information and distribute it considering the underlying business process.

40|$|The {{problem of}} cloud {{tracking}} within {{a sequence of}} geo-stationary satellite images has direct relevance {{to the analysis of}} cloud life cycles and to the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> motion vectors (CMVs). The proposed approach first identifies a homogeneous consistent cloud mass for tracking and then establishes motion correspondence within an image sequence. In contrast to the crosscorrelation based approach as adopted in automatic CMV detection analysis, a scale space classifier is designed to detect cloud mass in the source image taken at time t and the destination image at time +. Boundaries of the extracted cloud segments are matched by computing a correspondence between high curvature points. This shape based method is capable of tracking in the cases of rotation, scaling, and shearing, while the correlation technique is limited to translational motion. The final tracking results provide motion magnitude and direction for each contour point, allowing reliable estimation of meteorological events and wind velocities aloft.

The discharges can usually not be seen with bare eyes, hence some tool needs to be used to find bio aerosol cloud discharges. One way is to use a lidar for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>clouds.</b> By sending out a laser pulse into the atmosphere some of the light is scattered back. By measuring the backscattered light, the aerosol structure of the atmosphere can be obtained.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to obtain droplet concentration for water clouds from ground-based remote sensing observations. It relies on observations of cloud thickness, liquid water path, and optical extinction near the cloud base. The method was tested for two case studies (19 April 1996 and 4 September 1996) during the Clouds And Radiation experiment (CLARA). The CLARA experiment was designed to observe clouds {{using a variety of}} remote sensing instruments near the city of Delft {{in the western part of}} the Netherlands. The measurement of cloud thickness is dependent on the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> base by lidar and cloud top by radar. It is shown that during CLARA it was possible to detect cloud base with an uncertainty of less than 30 m using current lidar techniques. The agreement between in situ and remote sensing observations of droplet concentration was reasonable. An error analysis indicates that this method is most sensitive to uncertainties in liquid water path and the unknown effects of multiple scattering on lidar signal returns. When the liquid water path is very small the relative error of the liquid water path increases to unacceptable levels, so that the retrieval of droplet concentration becomes very difficult.
