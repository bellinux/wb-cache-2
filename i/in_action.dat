5|$|A {{document}} prepared on 17 July 1943 by the 5th Guards Tank Army headquarters summarised {{the combat}} losses incurred by the formation from 12 to 16 July inclusive {{for all of}} its five corps, as well as smaller units directly subordinated to the army headquarters. The document reported the following irrecoverable losses: 222 T-34s, 89 T-70s, 12 Churchills, 8 SU-122s, 3 SU-76s, and 240 support vehicles. The document reported damaged vehicles still under repair as 143 T-34s, 56 T-70s, 7 Churchills, 3 SU-122s, and 3 SU-76s, with no figures for support vehicles. The document reported personnel casualties as 2,940 killed <b>in</b> <b>action,</b> 3,510 wounded <b>in</b> <b>action,</b> and 1,157 missing <b>in</b> <b>action.</b> This totals 334 irrevocable losses in tanks and self-propelled guns, with another 212 tanks and self-propelled guns under repair, and 7,607 casualties. The historian Karl-Heinz Frieser argued that the majority of these losses must have occurred on 12 July.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{its three}} years of service, the 21st Massachusetts had been reduced from 1,000 men to fewer than 100. Of these losses, 152 were killed <b>in</b> <b>action</b> or died from wounds {{received}} <b>in</b> <b>action,</b> approximately 400 were discharged due to wounds, 69 were taken prisoner, and approximately 300 were discharged due to disease, resignation, or desertion. Those of the 21st who chose to re-enlist {{at the end of their}} initial three-year commitment were eventually consolidated with the 36th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry on October 21, 1864.|$|E

5|$|From July 1943, the 29th Infantry Division was {{commanded}} by Major General Charles H. Gerhardt. The division {{had such a}} high casualty rate that {{it was said that}} Gerhardt actually commanded three divisions: one on the field of battle, one in the hospital and one in the cemetery. The 29th Infantry Division lost 3,887 killed <b>in</b> <b>action,</b> 15,541 wounded <b>in</b> <b>action,</b> 347 missing <b>in</b> <b>action,</b> 845 prisoners of war, in addition to 8,665 non-combat casualties, during 242 days of combat. This amounted to over 200 percent of the division's normal strength. The division, in turn, took 38,912 German prisoners of war.|$|E
