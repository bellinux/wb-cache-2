He is consumed with thoughts about the roaring twenties, where people were so careless, drunk and on drugs all the time. After some time, he calls Lincoln and questions if he really can’t take his daughter back with him.

5000|$|While 7th Order had {{received}} worldwide recognition via radio and TV exposure since their 2003 radio debut, their progress {{may have been}} impacted by several non-band related matters. Jones once commented in a radio interview: [...] "My 23 year old son passed away in November of 2004...and that is something you don't just bounce back from in a few weeks. I then returned to Hawaii, and the band was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until I could deal with a few things". Consequently, 7th Order appears to have then decided to delay release of their debut CD, The Lake of Memory (the title song reportedly having been inspired by the writings of Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner), but they also had to withstand yet another tragic setback when their management consultant and longtime friend, Steven B. Williams, was murdered on a boat off of Santa Catalina Island, California in May 2006 (Williams had previously been a successful rock radio DJ on stations such as Denver's KBPI and Honolulu's KIKI (AM)) - the CD release eventually took place in October 2007. The one constant, as far as personnel was concerned, was Jones (who wrote and sang all of the band's material) - with guests Pugh and Thorpe on guitars & bass, Tim Kelliher on drums, and various session players.|$|E
5000|$|His final race of 2004 was the Breeders' Cup Classic at Lone Star Park, {{run over}} a {{distance}} of [...] miles. The excellent field included 2002 Horse of the Year Azeri, defending Breeders' Cup winner Pleasantly Perfect, American Classic winners Funny Cide and Birdstone, and multiple stakes winners Roses in May and Perfect Drift. Pleasantly Perfect went off at almost identical odds to Ghostzapper, with Ghostzapper a slight favorite. There were several factors of concern to the bettors, starting {{with the fact that}} Ghostzapper had never run at the distance. Another issue was trainer Bobby Frankel's poor record at the Breeders' Cup despite consistently training some of the best horses in the country. And then there was the fact that Ghostzapper drew post position one and risked getting trapped on the rail in heavy traffic. His exercise rider, Nuno Santos, was not concerned. [...] "Drawing the rail doesn't matter, wire-to-wire," [...] he said {{a few days before the}} race. [...] "Believe me, no worries. This horse is unreal, a freak, and everyone is going to see it on Saturday. You're going to see a Secretariat type of race.

5000|$|How to {{go about}} getting this work {{published}} {{would prove to be}} a tedious affair. By June 23, of 1864, Whitman {{was on the verge of}} a mental breakdown and grew to be so terribly ill from all the work he had been doing in the hospitals that he was forced to retire to his home in Brooklyn. He managed to declare himself [...] "gradually alleviated, until now I go about pretty much the same as usual" [...] on July 24 and dedicated himself to, at last, publishing his collection of poems. [...] "I intend to move heaven & earth to publish my Drum-Taps as soon as I am able to go around", Whitman told his friend and associate William O'Connor. [...] He was excessively motivated to get his work out there but an obstacle had developed. Ironically, it was the perception that his past works had been so highly controversial that had now scared off any legitimate publishers from wanting to buy his fresh compilation of poetry. If this were to be the case, Whitman explained to O’Connor, “I shall probably try to bring it out myself, stereotype it, & print an edition of 500 - I could sell that number by my own exertions in Brooklyn and New York in three weeks." [...] O'Connor was not as confident. He was justifiably concerned that a privately published book would not be available to a large-scale. It was his desire to have this book cement Whitman’s fame. He was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for this however. [...] Whitman's dedication to the hospital remained true as well for he would return to Washington as soon as he was physically fit to. Months later, on March 6, of 1865, he received a letter from his mother explaining that George, who had survived the poor conditions experienced at many prisoner of war camps, had been released and was now going home to Brooklyn on medical leave. Walt now desperately wanted to be home. Not only so he could see his brother but he also felt with the way the war was progressing so well now for the Union, this was the perfect time to publish his book. He was only able to gain minimal momentum however after receiving some money from the government. On this date, Whitman signed a contract with printer Peter Eckler to produce five hundred copies of Drum-Taps. Things began to proceed smoothly until the morning of April 15, 1865 when the newspapers told the story of the assassination of President Lincoln. Like the rest of the country, Whitman was deeply saddened by his passing. Over the following months he would split time between Brooklyn and the Capitol while also adding several additions to his compilation of poems. His poem [...] "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" [...] was extremely popular. It was this success (Roy Morris Jr. later wrote that this would be the final success of his career) that finally lead to the publication of Drum-Taps, along with a twenty-four page insert called Sequel to Drum-Taps, on October 28, 1865.|$|E

I’m getting better, I can begin to make out objects in the room again. We’ve {{got to go to}} the main field this afternoon. They’re going to show us around the place. There’s alot [sic] of secret and new stuff over there that they test in the proving ground. This whole section is the Army Air Forces Proving Ground. It contains about a million acres and it’s nothing but wilderness. Remember in “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo” how sharp they made this place look. He was over at # 4 Field South of us. His wife no doubt must have lived in a tent. That place where she stayed and could hear them starting their engines in the morning must have been one of Hollywood’s pipe dreams. I flew yesterday afternoon and made quite a score. Yeah- total: - one target! I was overleading [sic] it so much that I hit the cable and the target wrapped itself very lovingly around my ship. For a while a wash on instruments but I finally managed to shake it off a couple of more minutes though and I’d of been ready to hit the silk. I now have one sleeve to my credit confirmed! I’ll be an ace yet, by gosh. Honey if you were ever going to have a baby I’d want to be the first to know. Promise me that you’ll tell me right away if you ever do become “fragrant”. Of course I’d be very happy and very proud darling. But it would mean that we’d have to be separated. And another thing, I want to grow up with my son (of course it will have to be a boy) and I want to give him the best and God knows I couldn’t if I was across the world away from him. And then there’s you to think of, and we should think of that first darling. What the devil would you do with a baby while I’m overseas? No honey, “he’s” strictly a postwar plan. You’ve made me very proud to want my child darling and I love you all the more for it. It’s funny honey, but I seem to love you more with everything you do, or say, or want. Oh honey, I miss you so much. I love the way you sleep in my pajama tops, you’re so sweet darling. God, will this time ever pass? All I want to do is be with you, to be able to push your hair away from your ear and whisper I love you. And darling I do love you, so much. You’re my whole life and existence baby. I can never tell you how sublimely happy you have made me by becoming my wife. My wife- gosh that sounds wonderful. Maybe it’s because we haven’t been together, but I still can’t realize it. “Little Dottie Six” gosh. I hope we can get a car honey, but they’re terribly expensive down here. A ’ 38 ford convertible sells for $ 850 down here, so I’m afraid we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> awhile angel. I wish it was two weeks ago today hon, and we could skip the days from the 14 th on. Gosh two weeks. Happy Anniversary Mrs. Clark, I hope we’ll be together on our third. We’re getting to be an old married couple- apart. O well c’est la querre. Wait a minute, I don’t know what it means honest. I copied it, ah-er- French isn’t it? I wouldn’t know. Please destroy this immediately it might fall into the wrong hands. I must be more careful what I say. Remember a wife can’t testify against her husband. Whew, that was close! Well honey, D. A. + Tom say hello. Tom is with me, we room together, sweet isn’t it? I can’t find anything to send the pictures in, so I guess I’d better keep them. I wouldn’t want anything to happen to them. They’re really wonderful, some of the best ones of you I’ve seen. I hope you like them darling. Well baby, I gotta go and when you…… So angel again I say I love you, I love you, I love you. I wish I could hold you in my arms right now and kiss you- just once, that’s all I’d need to last one through this week (it says here).
