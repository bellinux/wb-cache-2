Caseinats are used in the production of food concentrates, medicines, and cheese products. In addition, they may be used as casein glue. Goals of thesis. To determinate total bacterial contamination of acid casein edible, isolate and identify pathological microorganisms. 1. To determine the general bacterial contamination of <b>edible</b> <b>acid</b> casein samples. 2. To determine the influence of thermophylic bacteria on the general bacterial contamination. 3. To determine the general bacterial contamination of repeatedly researched <b>edible</b> <b>acid</b> casein samples and the presumable quantity of coliformic germs. 4.

Micro flora of crude milk constitutes certain part of micro flora, found in powdered milk. However, the increased level of general contamination and coliform germs shows the signs of secondary contamination. The enlarged bacteriological contamination, which exceeded the preset limit of 3. 0 x 104 CFU/g, was identified in 3 per cent of analyzed acid casein edible samples. This was caused by impurity of crude milk. During the acid casein edible casein production process, the temperature of pasteurization was reached twice and in addition to that, comparatively low pH was maintained. These conditions are not hospitable for microorganisms to survive through the production process and remain alive in the final products. The number of thermophylic germs in analyzed samples made up to 19. 79 per cent of bacteria number of bacteria impurity in average.

Microbiological investigations of casein covered the following: total bacteria count, thermophylic bacteria, coliforms, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes. One {{hundred and sixty}} eight <b>edible</b> <b>acid</b> casein samples (each sample of 200 g) were randomly selected in the carried out experiment. The experiment included two stages, where samples were taken 16 hours after production and 6 days after production of casein, respectively. The results of our investigations show, that the enlarged bacterial contamination, which exceed the limit value of 3. 0 × 10 - 4 CFU/g was identified in 3 % of the analysed casein samples. Decrease in total bacteria count was observed in casein, when the samples were taken 6 days after production of the investigated casein. The mean value of casein total bacteria count {{in the first stage}} of investigations was increased and thermophylic bacteria in the analysed samples amounted to 0. 62 × 10 - 3 CFU/g. Percentage of this group of bacteria was approximately 24. 2 % of total bacteria count. The mean value of thermophylic bacteria in total bacteria count was statistically significant (p< 0. 001). After the repeated investigations to 80 % of samples, total bacterial contamination was decreased. The results of repeated samples and related to the initial results were statistically significant (p< 0. 001).

40|$|The {{control of}} {{aggregation}} and solubilization of hen egg white protein (HEWP) {{is an important}} issue for industrial applications {{of one of the most}} familiar food protein sources. Here, we investigated the effects of <b>edible</b> amino <b>acids</b> on heat-induced aggregation of HEWP. The addition of 0. 6 M arginine (Arg) completely suppressed the formation of insoluble aggregates of 1 mg mL− 1 HEWP following heat treatment, even at 90 °C for 20 min. In contrast, lysine (Lys), glycine (Gly), and sodium chloride (NaCl) did little to suppress the aggregation of HEWP under the same conditions. SDS-PAGE indicated that Arg suppresses the thermal aggregation of almost all types of HEWP at 1 mg mL− 1. However, Arg did not suppress the thermal aggregation of HEWP at concentrations ≥ 10 mg mL− 1 and prompted the formation of aggregates. Transmission electron micrographs revealed a high-density structure of unfolded proteins in the presence of Arg. These results indicate that Arg exerts a greater suppressive effect on a protein mixture, such as HEWP, than on a single model protein. These observations may propose Arg as a safe and reasonable additive to HEWP for the elimination of microorganisms by allowing an increase in sterilization temperature...|$|R
40|$|Heavy metals {{are present}} {{naturally}} in relatively low amounts in the earth’s crust. Through food, {{drinking water and}} the air, humans absorb trace amounts of these elements. Trace amounts of some heavy metals, such as selenium, zinc, and copper, are key to maintaining the metabolism of the human body. At high concentrations usually found in contaminated environments, such as and contaminated water, heavy metals can cause poisonings resulting in impaired mental and central nervous function, as well as damage to vital organs. Long-term exposure may result in slowly progressing physical, muscular, and neurological degenerative conditions including cancer. Arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead and inorganic tin account {{for a majority of}} heavy metal poisoning cases involving food products. Levels of arsenic are naturally high in fish and seafood. Found in soil due to the presence of insecticides, fungicides, sludge and commercial fertilizers, cadmium can contaminate agricultural food products. Mercury is an industrial pollutant as well as a by-product of volcanic emission. In recent years, a number of products, ranging from protein shakes to baby formula to fresh produce, have been linked to heavy metal contamination. Spurred by consumer calls for safer products, regulatory agencies around the globe are taking steps to detect and minimize the presence of hazardous heavy metals in food. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforces action levels for poisonous or deleterious substances in human food and animal feed, including cadmium, lead, mercury, and others. For most people, diet is the main route of exposure to trace metals, so the assessment risks of these elements to human via dietary intake is important. Cooking jams using fruits, sugar, pectin and <b>edible</b> <b>acids</b> {{is one of the oldest}} food preserving processes known to mankind and presents a way of making food stable by increasing the content in soluble solids.

The results found highlight that the main release regards zinc, copper and lead, i. e. the three major metals present in brass alloys. The first contact of brass surfaces with the extraction solvent leads to an extensive Pb release which is comparable with that observed for Cu and Zn. Subsequent washings reduce markedly the Pb release, thus rising in evidence a progressive surface passivation. In particular, the Pb release found after four repeated washings turns out to approach the limit set by both Italian and USA governments for liquids used for food purposes when determined in neutral media, while it remains quite higher when evaluated in acid media.

Four different biopolymers were tested: sodium caseinate, pea protein, methylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. In order to study {{the impact of the}} incorporation of the protective culture into the biopolymer matrix, the water vapour permeability (WVP), optical and mechanical properties of the dry films were evaluated. Furthermore, survival of L. plantarum and the antimicrobial potential of bioactive films against Listeria innocua were studied. Whereas optical and mechanical properties of the films were not notably altered by the incorporation, values increased for all biopolymers. Viability of the strain was lower in cellulose derivative matrices than in protein films, although bacteriocin production in the newly prepared films was greater in these matrices. As a result, a significant antimicrobial activity against L.  innocua was observed for polysaccharide matrices, which was not observed for protein films, where the bacteriocin production is delayed. In pea protein films the maximum bacteriocin production occurs at 15 storage days and afterwards decreases. So, the nature of the biopolymer and the knowledge of time when an adequate bacteriocin concentration is produced are key to use bioactive films in an effective way...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe second {{symposium}} on anomalies of fatty acids, ageing and degenerating pathologies for the French-speaking community was held during January 2002 in Paris (France) and reunited more than 200 participants, including {{a majority of}} medical practitioners. It was organised around 8 conferences treating the following subjects: a general presentation of the metabolism of fatty acids and their biological functions (in particular polyunsaturated fatty acids or PUFA), the exploration of PUFA in man during situations of nutritional and pathological disequilibrium, {{and the importance of}} PUFA in the aetiology and prevention of pathophysiologies such as cardiovascular, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, diabetes and obesity, cancer and certain neuropsychiatric affections such as depression. Indeed, even though <b>edible</b> fatty <b>acids</b> present a common energetic function, by β-oxidation, and a structural function, as a constituent of membrane lipids, some of them have a more specific role as an essential nutrient. These are essential fatty acids including the two families of polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 6 and n- 3 PUFA). Their metabolism leads to the synthesis of derivatives found in cellular membranes (structural role) and oxygenated molecules, the eicosanoids, whose main action is of the same type as that of hormones. These derivatives and oxygenated molecules also regulate different metabolic pathways by modulating the expression of target genes via activation of specific transcription factors. Due to their quality and their quantity in food, the PUFA may interfere with the incidence {{of a large number of}} pathologies whose causes are varied (cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases, cancers, neuropathologies, [...] .). The particular interest in nutrition of PUFA of the n- 3 series (or ω 3) and in particular of long-chain derivatives mainly found in high quantity in fish oils (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) is now widely confirmed for cardiovascular and inflammatory physiology and formed the subject of increasing investigations for prevention of certain pathologies of the central nervous system. In this paper, we are first going to recall the generalities of metabolism and functional properties of PUFA. Secondly, we will list the pathologies whose frequency and symptoms are susceptible to be corrected by the dietary intake of PUFA, notably by reaching the nutritional equilibrium between the family of linoleic acid (n- 6 or ω 6) and that of α-linolenic acid (n- 3 or ω 3) ...|$|R
40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} {{leads to}} quality deterioration of foods high in unsaturated fatty <b>acids.</b> <b>Edible</b> oils contain surface active compounds and water that can form physical structures known as association colloids. To {{better understand the}} influence of physical structures on the oxidative stability of bulk oils the role of association colloids on lipid oxidation was investigated. The effectiveness of chain-breaking antioxidants at retarding lipid oxidation depends on their chemical properties and physical location within a food. The first study showed that the surface activity and/or polarity of lipid-soluble antioxidant {{were not the only}} determinant of their effectiveness in food lipids. In the second study of model association colloids in oils, we found that the size of the reverse micelles increased with increased water or phosphatidylcholine concentration, but decreased upon addition of cumene hydroperoxide or oleic acid. Iron catalyzed oxidation of methyl linolenate in the reverse micelle system decreased with increasing water concentration. Phosphatidylcholine decreased methyl linolenate oxidation compared to control and reverse micelles with added oleic acid. These results indicate that water, cumene hydroperoxide, oleic acid, and phosphatidylcholine can alter reverse micelle size and lipid oxidation rates. The influence of these compounds on physical structures of bulk oil was also confirmed in a study using surface active fluorescence probe. The fluorescence intensity of 5 -dodecanoylaminofluorescein (DAF) increased with increasing water concentration in the edible oil. Addition of oleic acid decreased DAF fluorescence due to the ability of the free fatty acid to decrease the pH of the aqueous phase of the bulk oil. Phosphatidylcholine increased DAF fluorescence due to its ability to increase DAF exposure to the aqueous phase. Oleic acid had no impact in the interactions between DAF and water soluble peroxyl radicals while phosphatidylcholine decreased peroxyl radical degradation of DAF. This research established the significance of physical structures of bulk oils on lipid oxidation. Understanding how the physical properties of bulk oils impact lipid oxidation could lead to development of novel antioxidant technologies that help improve the oxidative stability of oils containing increased concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids. ...|$|R

Methods: In this study, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) modified with an <b>edible</b> biopolymer poly(&gamma;-glutamic <b>acid)</b> (PGA) were synthesized by coprecipitation method, characterized and evaluated for their removal efficiency of heavy metals from a metal solution, and simulated gastrointestinal fluid (SGIF). Results: Instrumental characterization of bare- and PGA-SPIONs revealed 7 % coating of PGA on SPIONs with a spherical shape and an iron oxide spinel structure belonging to magnetite. The particle sizes as determined from transmission electron microscopy images were 8. 5 and 11. 7 nm for bare- and PGA-SPIONs, respectively, while the magnetization values were 70. 3 and 61. 5 emu/g. Upon coating with PGA, the zeta potentials were shifted from positive to negative at most of the environmental pH (3 &ndash; 8) and biological pH (1 &ndash; 8), implying good dispersion in aqueous suspension and favorable conditions for heavy metal removal. Batch studies showed rapid removal of lead and cadmium with the kinetic rates estimated by pseudo-second-order model being 0. 212 and 0. 424 g/mg&bull;min, respectively. A maximum removal occurred in the pH range 4 &ndash; 8 in deionized water and 5 &ndash; 8 in SGIF corresponding to most gastrointestinal pH except for the stomach. Addition of different ionic strengths (0. 001 &ndash; 1 M sodium acetate) and essential metals (Cu, Fe, Zn, Mg, Ca, and K) did not show any marked influence on lead removal by PGA-SPIONs, but significantly reduced the binding of cadmium. Compared to deionized water, the lead removal from SGIF was high at all pH with the Langmuir monolayer removal capacity being 98. 70 mg/g for the former and 147. 71 mg/g for the latter. However, a lower cadmium removal capacity was shown for SGIF (23. 15 mg/g) than for deionized water (31. 13 mg/g).

40|$|Traditionally, the {{aquaculture}} {{industry has}} utilized fish oil in aquafeeds {{as a source}} of energy and n- 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA). Use of fish oil has the added benefit of increasing the n- 3 LC-PUFA content of farmed fish, increasing its nutritional value to human consumers. Aquaculture continues to rely heavily on reduction fisheries and fish oil as the only economically viable source of n- 3 LC-PUFA, however this practice is arguably unsustainable. In order to meet growing demand for fish and its associated health benefits, aquafeed ingredients and feeding strategies that yield equivalent production performance and <b>edible</b> product fatty <b>acid</b> (FA) profile must be developed. My goal was to screen a range of plant oils as alternatives to fish oil in feeds for hybrid Striped Bass Morone chrysops x M. saxatilis (objective 1), and then assess the optimal alternative oil in the context of graded fish oil sparing and implementation of finishing as a strategy to augment fillet n- 3 LC-PUFA content prior to harvest. In objective 1, production performance and fillet FA profile were evaluated in juvenile hybrid Striped Bass (67. 8 ± 0. 2 g, mean ± SE) fed practical feeds (40 % protein, 15 % lipid) containing fish oil (FO) or 50 / 50 blends of fish oil and standard (STD SO), saturated fatty acid (SFA) -enriched (SFA SO), low alpha-linolenic acid (LO ALA SO), or monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) -enriched (MUFA SO) soy oil. Feeds were offered to quadruplicate tanks of fish (8 fish/tank, 67. 8 ± 0. 2 g) in a water reuse system for 12 weeks. Production performance was largely unaffected by dietary treatment. No significant differences were observed in weight gain (214 ± 5 %) or specific growth rate (1. 4 ± 0. 0 % body weight/day) among treatments. Some differences were observed in feed conversion ratio among SO-fed treatments; however, these treatments were not significantly different from the FO control (1. 2 ± 0. 0). Fillet fatty acid composition was generally observed to reflect dietary fatty acid composition and intake. The STD SO and LO ALA SO diets resulted in a significant decrease in LC-PUFA content and substantial increases in medium-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (MC-PUFA) and n- 6 fatty acids within the fillet. Both the SFA SO and MUFA-SO diets resulted in fillet LC-PUFA levels similar to the FO diet; however, the MUFA-SO feed yielded significantly elevated levels of MUFA. Of the alternative oils evaluated, all would be acceptable as partial substitutes for fish oil in terms of production performance, though the SFA SO appeared to be the most suitable in terms of both production performance and maintaining a fatty acid profile similar to that associated with feeding fish oil. 	The goal of objective 2 was to further evaluate the SFA-enriched soy oil at graded levels of fish oil sparing in grow-out diets fed in conjunction with finishing with a fish oil-based feed for different durations prior to harvest. Quadruplicate tanks of fish (8 fish/tank, 110. 6 ± 0. 4 g) were fed experimental diets in which 50, 75, or 100 % of the dietary fish oil was replaced with SFA-enriched soy oil in conjunction with 4, 8, or 12 weeks of finishing with a 100 % fish oil feed (10 feeding regimens total) for 21 weeks. Significant differences in growth performance were found among the feeding regimens evaluated in this experiment. Final individual weight was significantly different between treatments with the 50 -SFA-SO + 8 weeks and 100 -SFA-SO + 12 weeks, but none of the treatments was significantly different from the 100 -FO control; when expressed in terms of percent weight gain, growth did not vary significantly among treatments. FCR varied significantly among feeding regimens, with the lower values generally associated with regimens receiving greater amounts of fish oil; more specifically, FCR values were significantly elevated among all three 100 -SFA compared to the 100 -FO control (1. 4 - 1. 5 vs. 1. 2). Furthermore, treatments providing the least amount of fish oil exhibited increased levels of MUFA, MC-PUFA and n- 6 FA. Finishing significantly affected fillet fatty acid profile, with longer finishing periods generally resulting in more comprehensive fillet modification, effectively reversing the deviations associated with feeding the SFA-enriched soy oil. My results indicate that fish oil can be replaced with SFA-SO at 50 % and 75 % with minimal effects on both growth performance and fillet FA. Although substantial amounts of fish oil may still be needed in concurrence with SFA-SO in order to provide ideal FA composition in fillets, any significant reduction in fish oil may be useful in further alleviating the oceans finite resources as well as decreasing production costs for the aquaculture industry...|$|R
40|$|Masteroppgave i økonomi og administrasjon - Universitetet i Agder 2010 The {{theoretical}} framework of this thesis includes macro arguments for trade, shipping theory and definitions, including Martin Stopford’s comprehensive shipping market model, and some theory and definitions {{on some of}} the financial terms, such as gearing, financial and operating lease, used in this thesis. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) is a series of indices based on reports from independent and competitive shipbrokers. Its purpose is to provide the shippers and the ship-owners with unbiased information on freight rates, and it is thought {{to be one of the}} most accurate indicators of economic development in the shipping market. Due to environmental considerations, new IMO regulations state that by the end of 2010 all single-hulled tanker vessels should be phased out of the market and only double-hulled vessels will be accepted. This will result in more ships being scrapped or repurposed. The force behind the financial crisis was subprime mortgages sold to a higher rating than what they should have been, creating solvency and liquidity problems for the banks and the financial sector. It is reasonable to say the crisis started in the US, but it spread to other countries as well. The financial crisis led to a decline in world consumption, and thus world trade and the demand for shipping services decreased. The liquidity problems were faced by the shipping industry as well, with reduced attaining of debt due to interbank lending problems faced. Frontline is one of the world’s biggest tanker companies in the bulk trade. The Company has had a high debt to equity ratio during the period of 2004 to 2009 and the ratio peaked at 7. 44 in 2007. The Company’s net income decreased from $ 701 M in 2008 to $ 105 M in 2009 due to the decrease in voyage and time charters. Revenues were down 46, 1 % from 2008 to 2009, which amounted to a staggering $ 971 M. NAT operates in the tanker market and mainly transports crude oil. It is a fairly young company, which was founded in 1995, but has had a strong growth focus during its relatively short life. In contradiction to Frontline, NAT has a philosophy of low gearing and has financed their growth through issuance of common stock. Their debt to equity ratio was 0. 2, 0. 03 and 0. 01 during the years of the financial crisis. Though, the net income of the Company plummeted from $ 119 M in 2008 to $ 1 M in 2009 due to low revenues and the cost of operating expense, including depreciation, amounting to $ 113 M. Wilh. Wilhelmsen is the market leading company in RORO shipping. Due to the recent financial crisis the Company has had to put 17 vessels into layup entering 2010. The debt to equity ratio has been relatively low; 1. 17 in 2004, 1. 90 by the end of 2009 and peaking in 2008 at 2. 56 due to the issuance of new debt. The freight revenues of Wilh. Wilhelmsen were nearly halved from 2008 ($ 293 M) to 2009 ($ 153 M) due to the sharp decline in average freight rates and the low utilization of the fleet. Odfjell is a worldwide provider of transportation and storage of bulk liquid chemicals, <b>acids,</b> <b>edible</b> oils and other special products. Odfjell’s extensive newbuilding program resulted in an increase in the company’s debt to equity ratio, which peak in 2008 at 2. 59. The net result of the Company went from being negative in 2007 to a positive $ 110. 5 M in 2009 due to the repeal of the Norwegian tonnage tax system. Golden Ocean is a dry bulk shipping company focusing on Panamax, Kamsarmax and Capesize vessels. The Company has had a high debt to equity ratio during the years 2004 - 2009, 5. 52 in 2007 and 4. 74 in 2008, but in 2009 it was down to just 1. 06 due to a major increase in equity and a decrease in debt. Further, the Company has had a return on capital employed peaking at 28. 50 % in 2007, 20. 79 % in 2008 and 18. 73 % in 2009. The revenue in 2009 was $ 350 M, which was a dismal result compared to $ 877 M the year before. Up until the crisis, the shipping industry saw a high degree of new-building, which created to large a supply of vessels during the decline and forced ships into layup. The various segments have all experienced a decrease in freight rates, but the chemical tanker market experienced the least volatile rates, which in turn hurt the companies as they have had a large portion of their ships in the spot market. Bunker cost increased freight rates and companies with hedges on bunker incurred substantial losses when the crude oil price plummeted. Chinese demand, especially for oil and iron ore, has been one of the main factors driving the increased and decreased demand for vessels, both prior to and during the financial crisis. All the shipping companies analyzed, but NAT, have experienced prevailing low share prices when comparing towards the BDI, BDTI, BCTI, OSEBX and the NYSE. The NYSE and OSEBX did not incur as high a decline as the shipping companies, making us believe the shipping industry was one of the losers in the midst and end of the financial crisis...|$|R
