500|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for {{him because}} he must really be stuck in the past. Not only has his music not evolved, but also homeboy is still obsessed with my wife, the same female that wouldn't let him get to second base from eight years ago. What type of grown ass man lies about getting with a chick? Only Slim Lamey! LOL! I’m putting this out there now. Marshall Mathers, you need to holler at me... Man to man, let’s meet up and deal with this like adults. So, Miss Marshall, I'm going to make you wish you never spoke my name and regret the ungodly things you said about my wife. Your legacy has now been tainted from this day forth! You will now be known as the rapper who lost to corny-ass Nick Cannon! ...|$|E
500|$|Describing her character's personality, Smith has stated: [...] "Dr. Hahn is a {{workaholic}} and she's very professional [...] I think {{she feels that}} there should be professionalism at work, and when other people do things that aren't professional she gets a little upset.", adding: [...] "She has little rules in her head about how you’re supposed to act at work. That doesn’t mean she can’t break the rules. But everyone else is supposed to follow them." [...] Stacy McKee, writer of season four episode [...] "Kung Fu Fighting", which saw the establishment of Hahn as a main character, has deemed her: [...] "hardcore. [...] a kick ass female surgeon". Smith has explained that the show's writers [...] "didn’t want to rush to make [...] likable, and hoped I didn’t mind. A lot of actors don’t want to be unlikable, even if they’re the bad guy. But I’m okay with that— I’m good with being unlikable." [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes, discussing the rivalry between Hahn and her Resident Cristina Yang – which saw Hahn reprimanded by Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), Seattle Grace's Chief of Surgery, for her lack of encouragement— has given the insight: [...] "Hahn is a brilliant surgeon and is great with her patients but her teaching skills? [...] Well, let's just say she can use a little more loving care with her students, particularly Cristina. [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for Hahn because Hahn grew up in a surgical world that included even fewer women than there is now (so Hahn is accustomed to a [...] "dog eat dog" [...] kind of surgical world)." [...] Trish Doolan, who consulted with the show's producers on the developing lesbian storyline between Hahn and Callie Torres, said of the character: [...] "She's very strong, very good at what she does, and actually a lot of men are threatened by that. She's very confident with what she does and who she is".|$|E
60|$|She {{began to}} cry, poor thing, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> very <b>sorry</b> for her. But {{in a little}} while she grew calmer.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked so}} crestfallen and abashed that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> quite <b>sorry,</b> though <b>I</b> still thought my rebuke {{a just and}} wise one.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thet put {{the crowd}} right an' nobody moved. Riggs turned green then. <b>I</b> almost <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for him. He {{began to shake}} so he'd dropped a gun if he had pulled one.|$|R
2500|$|From {{behind the}} camera, a {{prisoner}} asked Speck {{if he had}} killed the nurses. [...] Speck responded, [...] "Sure I did." [...] When asked why, Speck shrugged and jokingly said, [...] "It just wasn't their night." [...] Asked {{how he felt about}} himself in the years since, he said, [...] "Like I always felt ... had no feeling. If you're asking me if <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry,</b> no." [...] He also described in detail the experience of strangling someone: [...] "It's not like TV ... it takes over three minutes {{and you have to have}} a lot of strength." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mezger said, [...] "For some reason, I had a {{tremendous}} amount of energy for that 15 minutes, but I started to kind of wilt near the end. Then they called it a draw and I'm like, [...] "What?" [...] Everyone blames Ken for being unprofessional. Really, Ken was protecting his fighter. We had an agreement. Sakuraba said, [...] "I wanted to go another round, thinking {{it would be possible to}} salvage the match, but when it was decided to extend the fight, Ken Shamrock was making scary faces. Later I heard that Mezger's contract was only for a one-round fight. I thought, [...] "Ah, then it couldn't be helped." [...] But Shamrock didn't have to get so angry like that. Seeing Mezger getting scolded by him, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for (Mezger)." ...|$|E
60|$|I saw {{a slight}} {{trembling}} of the lip, perhaps {{the eyes were}} a little moist. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for what I had done.|$|E
6000|$|... "Terrible down. You'd {{think he}} was expectin' to be hanged {{by the way he}} takes on. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> awful <b>sorry</b> for him, even if he did burn us out." ...|$|R
60|$|The poor frog {{had indeed}} {{come to a}} sad and sudden end, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> quite <b>sorry</b> for it, {{although}} I could not help smiling at my companion's quaint manner of announcing the fact.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes he did; and I {{remember}} it by your speaking about my tormenting you. Oh! <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> very <b>sorry</b> for him, and Deerslayer took all so quietly and without noise! Deerslayer {{is not as}} handsome as Hurry Harry, Judith, but he is more quiet." ...|$|R
60|$|At that {{he lowered}} his eyes, as if hunting for memory of those boots, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> I had {{mentioned}} this grave thing.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{knew that}} there was going to be some {{spirited}} doctoring, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for the Government Advocate who would conduct the prosecution.|$|E
60|$|There was a pause. I {{looked at}} his big {{twitching}} face, {{and listened to the}} heavy wheezing of his breath, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for him.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{imagine it}} was largely due to absence of mind. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> very <b>sorry</b> for myself when I stood between the ties and watched the train vanish into the dark. What made it worse, {{was that of the}} joint two dollars only fifty cents was his.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Poor Mr. Coon!' I cried, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> mighty <b>sorry,</b> for Bobby and I {{had always}} been good friends, though I must admit that he has some habits of which I don't approve. 'Do {{you know how he}} {{happened}} to play in such hard luck, Mr. Crow?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Alvin Dark, {{involved}} in the infamous play, recalled years later that [...] "It was a mess, and <b>I</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for Vic Delmore....I don't remember everything about it but I do remember everyone laughed at Vic Delmore. That play ruined him, {{and he was a}} great fellow and a good umpire." ...|$|R
60|$|Melissa {{pinned on}} her hair again {{and put on}} her hat and drank the milk, all without a word; but she was purple. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dad, {{you know}} how Joel runs after me. I've told you. I let him till lately. I liked him. But that wasn't why. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for him--pitied him." ...|$|E
60|$|But even as I spoke <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry,</b> {{remembering how}} many jobs {{he had been}} after in his time, and how soon they ended when he had got them.|$|E
5000|$|Lee said: [...] "There {{are three}} things that made Americans know about Korea, {{according}} to historians: the Korean War, the Koreagate scandal and Haan Kil-soo. The reality is that people hardly remember Haan, who is better known in foreign countries. <b>I</b> always <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> about that." [...] Lee added: [...] "Haan might have played a decisive role in achieving Korean liberation." ...|$|R
60|$|Somehow or other, <b>I</b> seldom <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> when Rectus {{changed his}} mind. I thought, indeed, {{that he ought}} to change it as much as he could. And yet, as I have said, he was a {{thoroughly}} good fellow. The trouble with him was that he wasn't used to making up his mind about things, and didn't make a very good beginning at it.|$|R
5000|$|... "He {{looked like}} Lucifer: {{white in the}} face, his eyes like black coals. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> profoundly <b>sorry</b> for him, and said to the people sitting near me: 'This {{is more than the}} man can endure'. ... It was the unique {{intensity}} of his interpretative art that enabled him to create two such miracles in one day without destroying himself".|$|R
60|$|Vos yeux--she {{had eyes}} like a hare's, flush {{with her head}} and very bright with a {{superficial}} and expressionless brightness. What a formidable woman. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for the Russian General.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't a notion. She {{walked into}} Brown's hotel {{yesterday}} looking played out and anxious, and said somebody {{had told her}} I {{was going to the}} Bluff. As <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for her I started at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{nine years}} since I've seen it, but I can't get those lines {{out of my}} head. Perhaps it's because of the girl who sang them. Somehow, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for her. She had remarkably fine eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{like your}} friend much, papa. He is quite {{as quiet as}} you said; he is almost the only person I have seen since I quitted England who has not jarred my nerves. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> quite <b>sorry</b> that <b>I</b> had so long {{prevented}} you both from cultivating each other's acquaintance. He does not interfere {{with me in the}} least.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Rather. A fine she-otter. Your husband got rather badly bitten {{in trying}} to ‘tail it.’ Poor beast, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> quite <b>sorry</b> for it, it had such a human look in its eyes when it was killed. You’ll call me silly, {{but do you know}} who the look {{reminded}} me of? My dear woman, what is the matter?” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> very <b>sorry</b> for {{the poor}} child, and placed my hand over hers where it rested on my arm. I presume my motive was misunderstood, for with a swift glance about the {{apartment}} to assure herself that we were alone, she threw both her arms about my neck and dragged my face down to hers.|$|R
60|$|I {{thanked her}} most heartily. I felt {{this was the}} real tender sympathy of a being of my own age and like myself, and there were {{something}} so pathetic in her expression that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for her.|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE (laughing at this). You delicious Miss Phoebe. You {{were too}} quiet. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> that one so sweet and young should live so grey a life. I {{wondered}} whether I could put any little pleasures into it.|$|E
6000|$|He {{stopped and}} laughed. [...] "It's nine years since I've seen it, but I can't get those lines {{out of my}} head. Perhaps it's because of the girl who sang them. Somehow, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>sorry</b> for her. She had remarkably fine eyes." ...|$|E
60|$|The fatuousness of {{all this}} made me stare. If the man had not been somehow a {{sympathetic}} personality I would have resented it like an insult. As it was, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> only <b>sorry</b> for him. Something remarkably earnest in his gaze prevented me from laughing in his face. Neither did I yawn at him. I just stared.|$|R
60|$|When {{he told me}} this he put {{his hand}} to his cheek as though he still felt the smart of the blow, and in his eyes was a pain that was heartrending and an amazement that was ludicrous. He looked like an overblown schoolboy, and though <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> so <b>sorry</b> for him, I could hardly help laughing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes, {{he gave me}} a slip {{of paper}} with his name and address written on it," [...] {{answered}} Dora. [...] "You see, I asked him to do that because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> so <b>sorry</b> for him, and I thought that possibly {{you might be able to}} get him something to do;" [...] and she handed the slip of paper over to her husband.|$|R
