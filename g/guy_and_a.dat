500|$|When {{the episode}} {{originally}} aired in 1982, Fred Rothenberg of the Associated Press {{called it an}} introduction to a [...] "new wise-cracking comedy", [...] "a warm and wacky companion of a television show, a delightful place to spend idle time, [...] a five-star watering hole" [...] known as Cheers.

The Immortals of Meluha—originally titled Shiva: The Man, The Legend—was finally released by Tripathi’s literary agent Anuj Bahri, the owner of the landmark BahriSons Booksellers in Khan Market, New Delhi. Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "I would be lying if I said that I was sure I would get a big publisher for my first novel. I was a finance <b>guy</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market.

He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website, so that the readers would get interested. With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E

I asked Mona not to tell him about me." [...] Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked [...] "what is this thing about Steve Jobs?" [...] Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, [...] "My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive... he never contacted Steve." [...] Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did. Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, The Lost Father. She would also create a fictional portrait of Jobs in the 1996 novel, A Regular Guy.|$|E
