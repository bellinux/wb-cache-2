5|$|Washington was a {{lover of}} exotic animals, as well as gardening. He {{maintained}} extensive menageries on his country properties, first at Bellport, and later at Mendham. On Long Island, it is reported that he was often seen with a bird or monkey on <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> <b>At</b> both his menageries, Washington specialized in rare birds, but such animals as deer, sheep, goats, and antelope are also recorded at Bellport, and deer, llamas, and zebras are recorded {{among the hundreds of}} animals in the larger space at Mendham. Socially, he was {{an active member of the}} Lotos Club, a literary gentlemen's club in New York City.|$|E
25|$|The statue was rededicated on October 19, 2012 by General John Mulholland. At {{the time}} of the {{original}} battle he was Lieutenant general and Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Forces Command. He dedicated the statue in its new location in front of One World Trade Center across from Ground Zero and 9/11 Memorial. The bronze statue was positioned so the soldier atop the horse is keeping a watchful eye as he looks back over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the World Trade Center and its tenants. Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|A {{crowd of}} 11,042, {{the fourth largest}} in Gibbs Stadium history, saw the Terriers end the Mountaineers Division I leading winning streak at 17 games, 42–31. The Terriers outgained the Mountaineers 431 to 320 in total yardage with running back Kevious Johnson {{accounting}} for 104 rushing yards. Armanti Edwards, starting {{in his first game}} since the Michigan win, re-injured <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the start of the second half. Trey Elder replaced Edwards and threw for 105 and rushed for 33 yards. Senior wide receiver Hans Batichon had a career-high six receptions for 93 yards. The only other bright spot for the Mountaineers was CoCo Hillary's 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the second quarter.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} part of 1988, during an episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Hercules was {{swinging}} his chain in the direction of another muscular power wrestler the Ultimate Warrior. Warrior caught the chain, and the two began a tug of war, which led to the steel chain snapping at the middle. The broadcast commentators gave credit to the Warrior for snapping the chain, to the chagrin of Hercules and Heenan, though heel commentator Jesse Ventura contended that it took both Hercules and the Warrior to break the chain and not just the Warrior. This led to their grudge match at WrestleMania IV, which ended with Warrior pinning Hercules after pushing off from the turnbuckle while in Hercules' full nelson and landing on top of him before lifting <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the two count while referee Dave Hebner continued to count Hercules. During the match the Warrior had no-sold a number of Hercules' signature power moves, including receiving two clotheslines before being taken down with a third. This match has generally been {{regarded as one of the}} poorest matches in WrestleMania history.|$|E
25|$|In 1183 Balian and Baldwin {{supported}} Raymond against Guy of Lusignan, {{husband of}} Amalric's elder daughter Sibylla {{and by now}} regent for Baldwin IV, who was dying of leprosy. The king had his 5-year-old nephew Baldwin of Montferrat crowned as co-king in his own lifetime, {{in an attempt to}} prevent Guy from ascending. Shortly before his death in spring 1185, Baldwin IV ordered a formal crown-wearing by his nephew at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. It was Balian himself—a notably tall man—who carried the child Baldwin V on <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the ceremony, signifying the support of Isabella's family for her nephew. Soon after, the eight-year-old boy became sole king. When he, too, died in 1186, Balian and Maria, with Raymond's support, put forward Maria's daughter Isabella, then about 14, as a candidate for the throne. However, her husband, Humphrey IV of Toron, refused the crown and swore fealty to Guy. Balian reluctantly also paid homage to Guy, while his brother refused to do so and exiled himself to Antioch. Baldwin placed Balian in charge of raising his son Thomas, the future lord of Ramla, who did not go with his father to Antioch.|$|E

50|$|The {{competing}} {{dates for}} Thanksgiving are parodied in the 1942 film Holiday Inn. In the film, a November calendar appears on which an animated turkey jumps {{back and forth}} between the two weeks, until he gives up and shrugs <b>his</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>at</b> the audience.|$|R

2500|$|The {{mechanic}} {{said he had}} {{remarked to}} Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver there was [...] "less than half in the right tank and {{less than a quarter}} in the left tank". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered in the wreckage. Denver said he would use the autopilot inflight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel, saying he would be flying for about an hour.|$|E
2500|$|He also recounts a {{chain of}} events which led to a major change in the International Laws of Association Football. On 13 May 1967, Stoke City visited Old Trafford to play Manchester United, just after United had been {{confirmed}} as the old Division One champions. Paddy Crerand of United had an altercation with Peter Dobing of Stoke. Unknown to Partridge, TV cameras picked up Crerand's action of spitting over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> Tony Allen, another Stoke player. Partridge later received a letter from Alan Hardaker, the then secretary of the Football League, asking for his observations on the incident, but was unable to respond with conclusive evidence. Nevertheless the International Board changed the Laws of the Game to put spitting on a par with violent conduct, and therefore a dismissible offence.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the first}} day, Cowan pulled the tanks {{out of the}} town during the night, {{although}} he left patrols to defend the area already captured. The next day, 1 March, Cowan had the Corps commander (Lieutenant General Frank Messervy) and General Slim watching anxiously over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> his headquarters, both worried that the Japanese might hold out for weeks. In the event, in spite of desperate resistance, the town fell {{in less than four}} days. Although the Japanese had plenty of artillery, they were unable to concentrate their fire sufficiently to stop any single attacking brigade. Lack of anti-tank weapons gravely handicapped the defenders. Slim later described watching two platoons from 1/7th Gurkha Rifles supported by a single M4 Sherman tank overrun several Japanese bunkers and eliminate their defenders in a few minutes, with only a few casualties to themselves. In an attempt to improvise anti-tank defences, some Japanese soldiers crouched in trenches, clutching [...] aircraft bombs, with orders to strike the detonator when an enemy tank loomed over the trench. Most were shot by an officer of 255 Brigade and Indian soldiers.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Revolution ruined many families--his was one," [...] I answered, {{with what}} {{firmness}} of tone I could muster.

2500|$|At {{this point}} Adorno {{reversed}} his earlier priorities: now his musical activities came {{second to the}} development of a philosophical theory of aesthetics. Thus, in the middle of 1929 he accepted Paul Tillich's offer to present an Habilitation on Kierkegaard, which Adorno eventually submitted under the title The Construction of the Aesthetic. At the time, Kierkegaard's philosophy exerted a strong influence, chiefly through its claim to pose an alternative to Idealism and Hegel's philosophy of history. Yet when Adorno turned his attention to Kierkegaard, watchwords like [...] "anxiety," [...] "inwardness" [...] and [...] "leap"—instructive for existentialist philosophy—were detached from their theological origins and posed, instead, as problems for aesthetics. As the work proceeded—and Kierkegaard's overcoming of Hegel's idealism was revealed to be a mere interiorization—Adorno excitedly remarked in a letter to Berg that he was writing without looking over <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>at</b> the faculty who would soon evaluate his work. Receiving favourable reports from Professors Tillich and Horkheimer, as well as Benjamin and Kracauer, the University conferred on Adorno the venia legendi in February 1931; on the very day his revised study was published, 23 March 1933, Hitler seized dictatorial powers.|$|E
