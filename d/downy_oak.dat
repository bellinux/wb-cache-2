5|$|Maple {{and lime}} forests {{are found in}} gulleys. These forests are only present in {{isolated}} areas and {{are at risk of}} extinction. <b>Downy</b> <b>oak</b> woods are more common in the Aosta Valley area than in the Piedmont area because of its higher temperatures and lower precipitation. Oak is not a typical species in the park and it is often found mixed with Scots pine. The park's chestnut groves have been affected by human cultivation for wood and fruit. It rarely grows above 1,000 metres (3,280ft), and the most important chestnut forests are in the park's Piedmontese side. The park's conifer woods include Scots pine groves, spruce forests dominated by the Norway spruce, often mixed with larch. Larch and Swiss stone pine woods are found up to the highest sub-alpine level (2200–2300 metres (7,217-7,546ft)).|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms {{are mostly}} found during hot spells {{in summer and}} autumn, growing in {{mycorrhizal}} association with various broad-leaved trees and sclerophyllous shrubs, especially oak (Quercus), beech (Fagus), chestnut (Castanea), strawberry trees (Arbutus), treeheath (Erica), and rockrose (Cistus), showing a preference for acid soils. Roadsides and parks are common habitats. The cork oak in particular is an important symbiont, {{and the distribution of}} B.aereus (along with B.mamorensis) aligns with the tree across Europe and North Africa. The ectomycorrhizae that B.aereus forms with sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and <b>downy</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens) have been described in detail. They are characterized by a lack of hyphal clamps, a plectenchymatous mantle (made of parallel-orientated hyphae with little branching or overlap), and rhizomorphs with differentiated hyphae. A 2007 field study on four species of boletes revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies appear to be more complex than previously thought.|$|E
2500|$|The {{vegetation}} in {{the plain}} of Valence is mid-European with a supra-Mediterranean floor (pedunculate oak, oak {{found in the}} coldest places, and thickets of hornbeam) mingled with thermophilic species such as <b>downy</b> <b>oak,</b> or even evergreen oaks on exposed slopes with draining soils. Found also {{in the south of}} the Drôme Valley where the Mediterranean influence finally prevails ( [...] to the South) are spontaneous populations of thyme, lavender, Euphorbia characias, Spanish broom (...) , cane of Provence (Arundo donax), as well as Aleppo pines on the western face of the massif of Crussol. Due to the exposure {{and the nature of the}} soil, the Ardèche hills offer landscapes of garrigue and Mediterranean Oak (Quercus Ilex) from Tournon which is located [...] north of Valence (hills of Cornas, Château de Crussol and Soyons). The hills (mostly limestone) have a double vegetation: Mediterranean on the southern side and Sub-continental on the northern side.|$|E
50|$|The mount is {{surrounded}} by the woods of Foresta Burgos, Sos Niberos and Badde Salighes, characterized {{for the presence of}} thousand-year trees of holly and taxus baccata, and woods of <b>downy</b> <b>oaks,</b> chestnuts and holm oaks.|$|R
50|$|In {{the south}} the rocky terrain forms a {{slightly}} undulating limestone plateau (320-330 metres above sea level) pierced {{by a few}} sinkholes around ten metres deep. This plateau is covered with short grass (dry grasslands) which supports flocks of sheep. There are also forests of contorted <b>downy</b> <b>oaks</b> that are used for firewood.|$|R
50|$|Portuguese oaks can {{be found}} near the humid sectors around the rivers and acquire their maximum splendor in the {{limestone}} areas between the villages of Korres and Bujanda and also around Arlucea. As they are young trees their conservation is precarious. These trees are typical in subhumid climates with a 600 - 900 mm per year precipitation and short summer droughts. As they need to stand in a fresh ground with a good liquid retention capacity, they usually occupy clayey and marly grounds. Under 650 m the Portuguese oak is substituted by the Mediterranean <b>oaks.</b> Groups of <b>downy</b> <b>oaks,</b> field maples and European hollys can also be found. The oaks are the wood's 15.35% occupying an area of 1.12 ha.|$|R

50|$|Portuguese oak also hybridises readily {{with other}} related oaks such as Algerian oak (Quercus canariensis) and <b>downy</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens), {{which can make}} {{identification}} difficult.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} side of {{the mountain}} has trees such as <b>downy</b> <b>oak</b> and hop hornbeam, and the northern side is covered by a beech forest.|$|E
50|$|Withybed Wood {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of tree species {{including}} <b>downy</b> birch, English <b>oak</b> and white poplar. Bluebells carpet the western fringe of the wood; foxglove and violets {{can be seen in the}} sunnier parts.|$|R
50|$|The present wood {{is largely}} {{composed}} of silver birch trees which have grown naturally. The wood was felled in the 1940s by a foundry owner in Kilwinning {{and the ground}} was regularly burned until about forty years ago to keep it clear of brambles, trees, etc. <b>Downy</b> birch, <b>oak,</b> sycamore and willow are also present. An unusually predominant presence of holly trees, especially old holly trees, has already been remarked upon and may reflect {{a feature of the}} planting of the original 'Baroque' feature.|$|R
40|$|In a ringed {{population}} of Blue Tits (Parus caeruleus) {{living in a}} Holm Oak (Quercus ilex) forest of Languedoc, Southern France, and provided with artificial nest-boxes, territorial behaviour {{plays a major role}} in limiting the number of breeding pairs. The experimental removal, or the spontaneous disappearance, of a breeding pair is followed by an increase in size of the territories of the neighbouring pairs, or by the arrivai of non-ringed juvenile individuals settling in the vacant territory. In a Holm Oak forest without artificial nest-boxes, territorial behaviour does not play such a role, as the major limiting factor in that case is the number of available tree-holes. Pairs of Blue Tits settled on territories where <b>Downy</b> <b>Oaks</b> (Quercus pubescens) are mixed with Holm Oaks, lay their eggs four days earlier on the average, than Blue Tits breeding in pure Holm Oak forest. However, the number of fledglings per brood, and their body weight at 15 days of age, tend to be smaller. The benefit of a la ter laying date in pure Holm Oak forest qui te likely lies in a better synchronization of the maximum nutritional requirements of the young, and of the period of maximum food availability in the environmen...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{heterogeneity}} {{in space}} and time {{plays a key role in}} influencing trait variability in animals, and can be particularly relevant to animal phenology. Until recently, the use of remotely sensed imagery in understanding animal variation was limited to analyses at the population level, largely because of a lack of high-resolution data that would allow inference at the individual level. We evaluated the potential of SPOT 4 (Take 5) satellite imagery data (with observations every fifth day at 20 m resolution and equivalent to acquisition parameters of Sentinel- 2) in animal ecology research. We focused on blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus reproduction in a study site containing 227 nestboxes scattered in a Mediterranean forest dominated by deciduous <b>downy</b> <b>oaks</b> Quercus pubescens with a secondary cover of evergreen holm oaks Quercus ilex. We observed high congruence between ground data collected in a 50 m radius around each nestbox and NDVI values averaged across a 5 by 5 pixel grid centered around each nestbox of the study site. The number of deciduous and evergreen oaks around nestboxes explained up to 66 % of variance in nestbox-centered, SPOT-derived NDVI values. We also found highly equivalent patterns of spatial autocorrelation for both ground- and satellite-derived indexes of environmental heterogeneity. For deciduous and evergreen oaks, the derived NDVI signal was highly distinctive in winter and early spring. June NDVI values for deciduous and evergreen oaks were higher by 58 % and 8 % relative to February values, respectively. The number of evergreen oaks was positively associated with later timing of breeding in blue tits. SPOT-derived, Sentinel- 2 like imagery thus provided highly reliable, ground-validated information on habitat heterogeneity of direct relevance to a long-term field study of a free-living passerine bird. Given that the logistical demands of gathering ground data often limit our understanding of variation in animal reproductive traits across time and space, there appears to be great promise in applying fine-resolution satellite data in evolutionary ecology research...|$|R
50|$|From a naturalistic {{point of}} view, {{it can be}} divided into two {{different}} sectors. The northern slopes of the promontory have a more humid climate and are covered by a thick shrub of holly oak in the upper sector, which, at the lower heights, is associated with manna arsh, Ostrya carpinifolia, <b>downy</b> and Italian <b>oak.</b> The understory includes erica, broom and strawberry tree, while where the mount descends to the plain is a 25 ha cork oak wood. The southern slopes have a milder climate and are characterized by Mediterranean rock vegetation (holm oak, Phoenicean juniper, euphorbia tree, myrtus, Pistacia lentiscus, rosemary and erica, while amongst the lower plants are the rock samphire, Helichrysum and Centaurea.|$|R
5000|$|Larvae {{of these}} beetles are xylophagans. They mainly feed on <b>downy</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens), {{evergreen}} oak (Quercus ilex) and cork oak (Quercus suber). [...] These longhorn beetle {{are considered a}} pest of oaks. [...] Females are polyandrous and males are polygynous.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of falling average {{temperatures}} the distribution areas, e.g. of the <b>downy</b> <b>oak,</b> became divided.

50|$|The main {{hosts of}} this insect are oak species, {{including}} English oak (Quercus robur), sessile oak (Q. petraea), <b>downy</b> <b>oak</b> (Q. pubescens), evergreen oak (Q. ilex), cork oak (Q. suber) and turkey oak (Q. cerris). The beetle {{can also be}} found on European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and chestnut (Castanea sativa).|$|E
50|$|Standing on the north-west {{slope of}} the Mow Cop ridge, Limekiln Wood {{is part of a}} larger wood complex that has cloaked the ridge since the end of the last ice age. The trees reflect the thin soils and exposed {{location}} rising above the Cheshire plain: <b>oak,</b> <b>downy</b> birch and rowan predominate, with alder in the wetter patches and dense stands of holly beneath the canopy. There are a number of wet flushes through the wood, and these are home to a particularly rich ground flora; opposite-leaved golden saxifrage, marsh marigold, yellow pimpernel, meadowsweet and lesser celandine are all abundant. In drier areas honeysuckle, greater stitchwort, wood sorrel and foxglove add colour. In the autumn, varieties of fungi including foxy spot, stinkhorn and blushing bracket can be found.|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this study {{provides}} an overview on Sicilian olive systems. Subsequently, the study describes the different typologies of cultivated agroforestry systems present in South-Eastern Sicily employing olive trees in association with other Mediterranean tree species, in particular for the production of firewood, coal and animal food (<b>downy</b> or pubescent <b>oak,</b> holm oak, cork oak), but also in association with forage or grazing species (oat, barley, vetch, etc.) or cereals. The study shows that Sicilian agroforestry systems are much more diversified than it was known so far. In the second part, the study describes the spontaneous colonization processes by plants, observed in abandoned olive agroforestry systems and leading to the formation of more complex ecosystems (renaturation). Most of the previously described agroforestry systems are at present subject to abandonment. Our analysis of secondary succession dynamics shows how woody species, and above all those species which are part of the cultivated system, rapidly colonize abandoned areas, so that a maquis-wood is formed within few decades...|$|R
40|$|U radu su prikazane razlike između srodnih maljavodlakavih hrastova Quercus pubescens i Q. virgiliana. Isto tako prikazana je njihova približna rasprostranjenost u Hrvatskoj, te mogućnost njihova razlikovanja na terenu. Istaknute su i poteškoće u uspješnom određivanju i prepoznavanju navedenih hrastova. In {{the work}} the {{morphological}} {{differences between the}} related <b>downy</b> hairy <b>oaks</b> Quercus pubescens and Q. virgiliana are analyzed. They occupy large areas especially in the Adriatic littoral of the Republic of Croatia, but they develop sporadically in its hinterland, too. The said oaks can be differentiated from each other by the morphology of their leaf, cupule and bark, by the arrangement of flowers on a short fruit shoot {{as well as by}} the appearance of their cupule. Q. pubescens has a leaf with 4 – 6 pairs of lateral lobes, and the petiole is 1 – 2 cm, maximum 3 cm, long. Its bark at the trunk base is shallowly longitudinally furrowed. All female flowers of the short, fruit shoot are sitting, placed terminally. All ripe acorns are sitting, placed terminally. The cupule covered with small, triangular scales arranged like tiles on a roof is smooth in appearance. Q. virgiliana has a leaf with 3 – 4 (- 5) pairs of lateral lobes, and the petiole is more than 3 cm long. Its bark at the trunk base is deeply furrowed, on the cross cut like a cogwheel. The female flowers are arranged on a more or less long rachis, not longer than 10 cm, in the form of an ear, and the ears can be arranged both terminally and laterally in leaf axils. In the ear there are often clusters of several flowers. One or several ripe acorns are on a more or less long stalk, usually 1 – 2 cm long. At the top or sidewise on the cupule the remnant of the rachis can often be noticed in the form of a curved, dry extension. The cupule scales are verrucously swollen or protuberated, making the entire cupule verrucously wrinkled. In case of any deviation from the above parameters, as a rule the hybrids are involved...|$|R

50|$|During the Neolithic period more heat-loving {{deciduous}} shrubs {{spread out}} from their refuges in southern Europe back to Central Europe. Maple (Acer) and ash (Fraxinus) enriched existing stocks. The average temperatures were now 2-3 °C higher than today. The <b>downy</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus pubescens) returned to Germany again. Alder (Alnus glutinosa) carrs arose in the marshy lowlands and spruce (Picea abies) reached the Harz Mountains.|$|E
50|$|Downy oaks {{typically}} grow in dry, lime-rich soils. It is a submediterranean species, {{growing from}} the coastline to {{deep in the}} continent. Its optimum is in the submediterranean region, characterized by hot dry summers and cool winters with little rain fall.
