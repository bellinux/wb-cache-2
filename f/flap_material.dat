40|$|Background: To compare free thin anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap {{with free}} radial forearm (FRF) flap in the {{reconstruction}} of hemiglossectomy defects, and to introduce our methods and experience in the tongue reconstruction with free thin ALT <b>flap.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods: The clinicopathologic data of 46 tongue carcinoma cases hospitalized from December 2009 to April 2014 were obtained from Nangjing Stomatological Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University. All the subjects were evaluated for the articulation and the swallowing function 3 months after the surgery. Results: Among these 46 patients, 12 patients underwent tongue reconstruction after hemiglossectomy with ALT flap; 34 patients underwent tongue reconstruction with FRF flap. The differences {{in the incidence of}} vascular crisis, the speech and the swallowing function between two groups were not significant (P ﹥ 0. 05). Conclusions: Thin ALT flap {{could be one of the}} ideal flaps for hemiglossectomy defect reconstruction with its versatility in design, long pedicle with a suitable vessel diameter, and the neglectable donor site morbidity...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{find out}} the most {{suitable}} perforator and cutaneous nerve for strategic design of the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) <b>flap.</b> <b>Material</b> and Method: The characteristics of the pedicles, perforators, intercostal nerves {{and the relationship between}} nerves and vessels in DIEP flaps were studied in 31 formalin-preserved cadavers. Results: Four hundred and five perforator vessels were divided into three vertical rows. These perforators were mostly contained in the medial row (45. 4 %), the average size of the perforators in the lateral row was the largest (1. 0 + 0. 3 mm). The largest perforators (1. 4 + 0. 3 mm) were mostly located within 1 cm horizontally from the umbilicus. Lateral row perforators, usually rectilinear course (82. 7 %), traveled with nerves from the beginning. Whereas, the perforators in the medial row usually coursed obliquely (86. 4 %) and were not related to nerves initially, they joined before piercing the rectus sheath. Conclusion: The present findings indicate that it would be more beneficial to use the lateral row perforators...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroduction: With {{the better}} {{understanding}} of breast cancer history and biology, improved diagnostic modalities and the shift towards minimally invasive surgeries, indications for prophylactic mastectomy, skin sparing or skin reducing mastectomies (SSM/SRM) with nipple areolar complex (NAC) preservation coupled with immediate breast reconstruction are gaining popularity. The authors share their experience and conception with mastectomy and immediate alloplastic breast reconstruction with the esthetic circumvertical mammoplasty pattern combined with the dermal barrier buttress <b>flap.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods: The described technique was performed for 28 patients presenting for mastectomy and immediate alloplastic breast reconstruction. With close collaboration between the oncologic and plastic surgeons, mastectomy was performed in all cases with the esthetic circumvertical mammoplasty pattern. To achieve safe excision and optimal reconstruction, the standard incisions could be custom designed to fit oncologic requirements and allow {{the creation of a}} dermal barrier flap used as a buttress separating the implant from the suture line. Conclusion: The circumvertical mastectomy pattern combined with the dermal barrier buttress flap is a versatile option allowing safe reconstruction regardless of the tumor and necessary skin excision location...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. We {{describe}} a modified trabeculectomy technique {{in which the}} iris is used to prevent fibrosis of the scleral <b>flap.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods. A retrospective case series of patients with medically uncontrolled open angle glaucoma underwent trabeculectomy. Instead of performing a classical iridectomy, the iris was used as spacer underneath the scleral flap. Postoperative management was identical to classical trabeculectomy, with suture removal and needling if necessary. Five of the patients underwent simultaneous phacoemulsification through a separate temporal corneal incision. Patients should have two-year follow-up. Results. Data of ten patients were analysed, two had a previous failed trabeculectomy, two had LTP, and one had a corneal transplantation. In 3 patients MMC 0, 1 [*]mg/mL was used. After one and two years mean IOP was, respectively, 13, 1 and 12, 1 [*]mmHg. IOP ≤ 16 [*]mmHg was reached in 90 % of patients without pressure lowering medication. No major complications were seen; no abnormal inflammatory reaction and no deformation or dislocation of the pupil occurred. Conclusion. By using the iris from the iridectomy as spacer under the scleral flap, fibrosis of the scleral flap is no longer possible. This iridenflip trabeculectomy technique gives an excellent complete success rate (IOP ≤ 16 [*]mmHg) of 90 %. A larger study is currently being done...|$|E

Este estudio describe su base anatómica mediante la morfometría de las arterias perforantes en una {{muestra de}} nuestra población chilena. Material y Método: Se utilizaron 8 miembros inferiores de amputaciones supracondileas. Previa repleción con látex coloreado vía poplítea, se procedió a disecar los miembros inferiores para así obtener un colgajo fasciomiocutáneo sural de pedículo distal. Una vez obtenida la isla, se procedió a elevar el colgajo y disecar su pedículo. Luego se realizó la mor-fometría de las arterias perforantes tanto por lateral como por medial al pedículo, desde el punto pívot definido a 5 cm cefálico al maléolo lateral, hasta la base de la isla fasciomiocutánea. Se describió la distribución de la irrigación y se realizó registro fotográfico de los hallazgos. Resultados: El paquete vasculonervioso sural con un nervio fue identificado en todas las disecciones. La morfología arterial predominante fue la distribución como plexo perineural. Se reconocen tres arterias surales (lateral, mediana y medial). Fueron identificadas 3 a 6 perforantes hacia medial y 4 a 5 hacia lateral del pedículo. Conclusiones: La distribución de la arteria sural es variable y en la mayoría de los casos se presenta como plexo perineural. Dados los hallazgos de las perforantes, consideramos que el punto de giro del colgajo se encuentra aproximadamente a 5, 5 cm del maleolo lateral, lo cual coincide con el punto ideal para la viabilidad del colgajo informado en otras series. Background: The distally based sural fasciomyocutaneous flap {{is widely used}} in the coverage of deep soft tissue defects on the distal third of lower limbs. Aim: To perform a morphometric description of the perforating arteries that supplies the <b>flap.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods: We used eight lower limbs from amputations performed above the knee. The limbs were injected through the popliteal artery with red colored latex. After the injection, the limbs were dissected to obtain a distally based sural fasciomyocutaneous flap. Once the fasciomyocutaneous island was obtained, the flap was elevated dissecting its pedicle. Once the whole flap was dissected, a morphometric registry of the lateral and medial perforating arteries was performed. The pivot point for the flap was set 5 cm above the upper border of the lateral malleolus. The distance between the upper border of the lateral malleolus {{and the emergence of}} each perforating artery was measured. Results: The sural nerve was identified in all eight dissections. A perineural plexus was the source of the blood supply of the flap, in three of the eight dissections. In two dissections, three sural arteries were identified (medial, median and lateral). The lateral sural artery was identified in two dissections and the medial and lateral arteries in one. Three to six perforating arteries were identified in the medial part of the pedicle and four to five perforating arteries in the lateral part of the pedicle. Conclusions: The distribution of the sural artery along the flap's pedicle is very variable. The most common distribution in these dissections was {{in the form of a}} perineural plexus. Considering the distance from the lateral malleolus to the emergence of the perforating arteries, the pivot point of the flap, should be set approximately at 5. 5 centimeters above the lateral malleolus...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} suture tension in primary wound closure of mucoperiosteal <b>flaps.</b> <b>Materials</b> and methods: Sixty patients, scheduled for a single implant installation, were recruited. Before suturing, the wound closing forces were measured with an electronic tension device. One week after the surgery, the wounds were inspected with regard to complete closure. Results: The applied tension varied between 0. 01 and 0. 4 N. In 72 % a tension of 0. 01 - 0. 1 N was applied, resulting in few dehiscences (10 %). Higher closing forces (> 0. 1 N) increased the percentage of wound dehiscences significantly (≥ 40 %).

40|$|Introduction: The anterolateral thigh flap (ALT) is a {{versatile}} flap and very {{useful for the}} reconstruction of different anatomical districts. The main disadvantage of this flap is the anatomical variability in number and location of perforators. In general, absence of perforators is extremely rare. In literature, it {{is reported to be}} from 0. 89 % to 5. 4 %. If no sizable perforators are found, an alternative reconstructive strategy must be considered. Tensor fascia lata (TFL) perforator flap can be a good alternative in these cases: Perforator vessels are always present, the anatomy is more constant and it is possible to harvest it through the same surgical access. The skin island of the flap can be very large and can be thinned removing {{a large part of the}} muscle allowing its use for almost the same indications of the ALT <b>flap.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: We report 11 cases of reconstruction firstly planned with the ALT flap, then converted into TFL perforator flap.

40|$|Introduction. Flap {{innervation}} by neoaxonogenesis is {{a promising}} field of investigation. The authors evaluated {{the possibility of}} innervating an acellular collagen scaffold as component of a potential prefabricated <b>flap.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods. Collagen matrix sheets were implanted around the femoral bundle of a murine model to produce two flaps on proximal and distal nerve stumps based on a flow-through model. After thirty days, nerve regeneration and integration into the collagen matrix were evaluated. The specimens were microscopically analyzed to study Schwann cell colonization and axonal integration with the matrix. Axonal count and density were assessed and statistically evaluated. Results. Qualitative structural and ultrastructural evaluation indicated integration, with axonal fibers merged within the collagen matrix, along with a newly formed vascular network on the proximal flap. Wallerian degeneration occurred inside the distal chamber. Axonal count and density did not show {{statistically significant differences between}} the nerve inside the proximal flap and the control side. Conclusions. Innervation of an acellular matrix can be obtained by direct nerve stump implantation. The flow-through system was relatively easy to build and reliable to provide adequate blood supply.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The authors {{present an}} {{algorithm}} of partial breast reconstruction following quadrantectomy that allows {{to restore the}} breast volume defect {{with the use of}} pedicled perforator <b>flaps.</b> 	<b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS: Between March 2009 and May 2010, at the Plastic and Reconstructive Institute of University of Palermo, pedicled perforator flaps were used to integrate volume and/or breast skin in 12 patients after benign and malignant breast tumors. The flaps used were based on perforators of the thoraco-dorsal artery (TDAP) and of the intercostal arteries (ICAP). TDAP flaps were used to reconstruct defects in any breast quadrant, while ICAP perforator were used to reconstruct lateral and central inferior pole defects. 	RESULTS: All flaps survived completely. Breast size, shape and volume were satisfactorily restored. Contralateral breast procedure to adjust symmetry were not necessary. Donor sites scars were well hidden in the inframammary fold or under the brassiere. 	CONCLUSIONS : Partial breast reconstruction can be performed, in selected patients, with pedicled perforator flaps to restore both volume, shape and skin envelope.

40|$|Introduction: Peroneal artery {{gives off}} plenty of {{perforators}} that pass through fascial septum to supply skin and tenosynovium of peroneal muscles. Aim: The {{aim of this}} study was to study the anatomical basis of perforators from terminal part of peroneal artery axiality and to make use of this knowledge in reconstructing defects of posterior heel with the advantage of reducing the morbidity of conventional <b>flaps.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: Our study was conducted at Department of Plastic surgery, Madras Medical College and Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, India. We have carried out eleven cadaver dissections (from six cadavers-four fresh cadavers and two preserved cadavers) and delineated all septocutaneous and septosynovial perforators of distal peroneal axis and studied their relation with short saphenous vein (SSV) and sural nerve. Using this anatomical knowledge we have fashioned perforator based flaps in 13 patients (three propeller, four V-Y advancement, six tenosynovial flaps) for reconstruction of defects over tendo achilles and pericalcaneal region. Results: In all cases, SSV and sural nerve were preserved and donor site was closed primarily. No total flap loss was noted. Conclusion: Perforator based flaps from distal most part of peroneal artery provide a good and reliable method for reconstruction of pericalcaneal and tendo achilles region defects with preservation of SSV and sural nerve.

40|$|Introduction: Repair {{of large}} defects {{of the lower}} eyelid can be difficult. A common {{procedure}} performed to address these defects is a Hughes flap. This procedure {{has a number of}} disadvantages: The eye is closed postoperatively, a second stage is required, and the edge of the flap is often erythematous. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe a one-stage procedure for the repair of large full-thickness defects of the lower lid as an alternative to a Hughes <b>flap.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent the described procedure. The procedure employs lateral stabilization of the posterior lamella with a periosteal strip, medial transposition of the lateral posterior lamella for central and medial defects, and a myocutaneous advancement flap to stabilize the anterior lamella. Results: A total of 38 patients underwent the procedure to reconstruct full-thickness defects of the lower lid ranging from 50 % to 75 %. All patients underwent previous Mohs excision of a skin cancer. The average follow-up was 5. 6 months. Eleven patients (29 %) had postoperative sequelae, but only two patients (5 %) required additional treatment. Conclusion: Lateral stabilization with a periosteal strip and myocutaneous advancement flap is an excellent one-step procedure that avoids many of the complications seen with the Hughes procedure and is comparable to other techniques used for the reconstruction of subtotal, full-thickness lower lid defects...|$|R
40|$|Background: Transtympanic myringoplasty is an {{alternate}} technique that allows graft placement medial to tympanic membrane remnant through the perforation {{without the need}} for tympanomeatal flap elevation. Objectives: The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the efficacy and compare the results of transtympanic myringoplasty without tympanomeatal flap elevation with the usual method of graft placement by the elevation of a tympanomeatal <b>flap.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: This is a prospective study done on fifty patients divided into two groups, each consisting of 25 patients. Group I patients underwent transtympanic myringoplasty without elevation of tympanomeatal flap and group II patients underwent tympanomeatal flap elevation myringoplasty. Both the procedures were done by underlay technique through transcanal approach using only tragal perichondrium as graft material. Results and Observations: Graft uptake was successful in 88 % and 92 % ears while hearing improvement was seen in 84 % and 91. 3 % in the group I and II patients respectively. The mean hearing gain was 15. 04 dB and 15. 57 dB in group I and II respectively. Conclusion: Transtympanic myringoplasty is a simple and less traumatic yet equally effective approach for the repair of tympanic membrane perforation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Any {{bone loss}} that {{interrupts}} {{the continuity of}} the mandible has important functional and aesthetic consequences. One of the posibilities of plasty is represented by the use of the titan reconstruction plate and the optimization of results by association of free <b>flaps.</b> <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS: Between 2006 - 2012, for a number of 26 patients the titan plate was used for restoring mandibular continuity for bone defects resulted from the excision of malignant tumors. RESULTS: In all cases a free flap was asociated, usually a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap (20 cases); in one case a radial fascio-cutaneous flap combined with a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. In 5 cases the modelation of the fibula flap was performed on a mandibular reconstruction plate. 3 of the reconstruction plates were removed postoperative, one of them because of the necrosing of a latissimus dorsi free flap, and the other two because of cutaneous or intraoral decubitus lesions. In the rest of the patiens the results were good or very good, with the resumption of oral feeding, a good diction and restoration of facial symmetry. CONCLUSIONS: The use of voluminous muscular free flaps is followed by a reduced rate of exteriorization of the reconstruction plates, with good and very good aesthetic and functional results.

40|$|Objective: This report details our {{experience}} {{with the use of}} the temporoparietal fascia flap in different scenarios of reconstruction and to discuss our technique of harvest, clinical applications, and review of literature of this versatile <b>flap.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: A retrospective study of 82 cases of temporoparietal fascia flap in 71 patients, operated over a period of 10 years was conducted. Patients were grouped based on various clinical indications. The follow up period ranged from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 10 years (Mean-four and a half years). All patients were analyzed for functional and aesthetic outcome using preoperative and postoperative photographs. Results: No significant complications were seen in our series. Only 2 out of 82 flaps had partial necrosis of flap (2. 44 %). Two patients who were operated for release of submucous fibrosis developed recurrence due to continued use of tobacco. The final outcome in one patient of ear reconstruction was unsatisfactory due to flap failure. The remaining patients had satisfactory functional and aesthetic outcomes (95. 77 %). None had other complications like temporal branch of facial nerve injury or alopecia along the scar line. Conclusion: The TPFF is one of the most reliable and versatile flap in the head and neck region. It can also be reliably used as free fascial flap. When its advantages are combined with the surgeon′s resourcefulness, various defects can be successfully reconstructed using the temporoparietal facia flap with satisfactory aesthetic and functional outcome...|$|R

Then the demographic characteristics, early and late complications, comfort and pain score on the first and fourth postoperative day, hospital stay, time of return to work, and patient satisfaction were compared. P< 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. ResultsThe mean age was 24 years and the male to female ratio was 4 : 1. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics, operation time, early complication rate and recurrence. But significant difference was observed in return to work, first pain-free toilet sitting, pain score and patient satisfaction. ConclusionIt seems that the Limberg flap has similar complications as the primary repair method, but earlier return to work and less hospital stay, lower pain score and higher comfort and satisfaction were the advantages of the Limberg flap method. Thus, this method is recommended for the treatment of primary pilonidal disease...|$|R
40|$|A 71 -year-old {{woman was}} {{admitted}} to our hospital due to unstable chest pain. Coronary angiography demonstrated a complex eccentric lesion with 80 % narrowing of the right coronary arterial lumen (Panel A). Intravascular optical coherence tomography (IV-OCT) revealed typical characteristics of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), such as proximal intimo-medial tear (Panel Aa), false lumen (Panel Ab), and intramural hematoma (Panel Ac, asterisk). A zotarolimus-eluting stent (Resolute Integrity, Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA, USA) was deployed at the lesion. Post-stenting angiography showed completely restored luminal patency (Panel B) and an IV-OCT confirmed the well-covered proximal dissected site (Panel Ba′), obliteration of the false lumen without compromising the side branch (Panel Bb′), and compression of the intramural hematoma (Panel Bc′, asterisk). Three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction of the OCT images allows clear visualization of dissected flap (Panel Ad) and its complete obliteration following stenting (Panel Bd′). A fly through 3 D rendered OCT image in a distal to proximal direction which is conventional direction in routine practice, dissected lesion was hardly identified (Panel C, arrow heads: dissection <b>flap,</b> Supplementary <b>material</b> online, Video S 1). In contrast, in a proximal to distal direction, intuitive comprehension of spatial structure of the dissected lesion was possible at a glance (Panel D, arrow heads: dissection <b>flap,</b> Supplementary <b>material</b> online, Video S 2). This bi-directional assessment of SCAD using a fly through 3 D rendered OCT image might be useful for clinicians to evaluate the characteristic of coronary dissection and would provide valuable information for lesion-specific treatment...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Theobjective of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the indications, utility, advantages and surgical approach for the anteromedial thigh (AMT) <b>flap.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: We reviewed the records of the patients in whom the AMT flap was used for head and neck reconstruction. We use an anterior approach to harvest the anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap with a non-committal straight line incision. This preserves both ALT and AMT flap territories intact, and further decision is based on the intraoperative anatomy of perforator and pedicle. The ALT flap was usually used as the first choice when available and suitable. Results: Free AMT skin flaps were harvested in 24 patients. All flaps were used for the head and neck reconstruction. Two flaps had marginal flap necrosis. One flap was lost due to venous thrombosis. Discussion: The thigh is an excellent donor site as it has large available skin territory, expendable lateral circumflex femoral artery system and low donorsite morbidity. The ALT flap is the most commonly used flap for reconstruction of soft-tissue defects. However, it is characterised by variable vascular pedicle and perforator anatomy. The AMT flap is an excellent alternative when the ALT flap is not available due to variable perforator anatomy, injury to perforator, when an intermediate thickness is needed between distal and proximal thigh or a chimeric flap is needed. Conclusion: The AMT flap offers all the advantages of the ALT flap without increasing donor-site morbidity. The anterior non-committal approach keeps both the ALT and the AMT flap options viable...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The rectal {{sphincter}} preserving transperineal {{approach has}} been increasingly used successfully. We analyzed our experience with this surgical approach. A secondary aim was to evaluate the surgical outcome of energy ablative rectourethral fistulas without a concomitant interposition muscle <b>flap.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: We identified all patients with rectourethral fistula who underwent rectal sphincter preserving transperineal repair from 1998 to 2011. Re-approximation of the urethral mucosa, posterior anastomotic urethroplasty or partial/total prostatectomy with urethrovesical anastomosis was performed for urinary closure. The fistula cohort was divided into 2 groups, including postoperative and energy ablative fistulas, respectively. Success after perineal rectourethral fistula repair was defined as resolution after the first attempt at repair. Results: A total of 23 patients underwent rectal sphincter preserving, transperineal rectourethral fistula repair. In the postoperative fistula cohort the fistula was successfully resolved in all 10 patients. A dartos interposition muscle flap was used in 2 of 10 patients. In the energy ablative cohort the fistula was successfully closed in 8 of 13 patients. An interposition muscle flap was not placed in 8 patients with an energy ablative fistula, of whom success was achieved in 5. Two of the 5 patients with an energy ablative fistula and a successful outcome without a concomitant interposition muscle flap had urinary extravasation, necessitating temporary catheterization. Conclusions: Rectal sphincter preserving transperineal repair is a successful surgical method to repair postoperative and energy ablative rectourethral fistulas. An interposition muscle flap {{should be considered in}} the setting of energy ablative rectourethral fistulas to increase successful outcomes. © 2013 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract AIM: Muscular flaps are {{considered}} by many surgeons as a treatment of choice for pressure sores. Nevertheless fasciocutaneous and adipofascial flaps are less sensitive to ischemia, more resistant to pressure and have higher mechanical resistance. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the results of our integrated rehabilitative and surgical protocol in pressure sore management based on the use of cutaneous <b>flaps.</b> <b>MATERIAL</b> OF STUDY: Since 1998, we treated 338 pressure sores (PS) in 195 patients (120 males; 75 females), 189 patients were affected by paraplegia and tetraplegia and 6 of them by neurological disorders. RESULTS: Ninety sacral, 156 ischiatic, 75 trochanteric, 9 calcanean and 8 sores of the iliac-crest were succesfully treated. All showed an involvement of the bone element, with osteitis and/or periosteitis. 14 cases of trocanteric sores showed a deeper bone involvement, with evidences of osteomyelitis. Follow up ranges from 7 years to 2 months. Median time for wound healing was 18 days. DISCUSSION: The use of fasciocutaneous flaps, as an alternative to the traditional muscolocutaneous flaps in the treatment of pressure sores leads to good and statistically comparable, healing rate, time and incidence of complications. Reconstructive plastic surgery as is a decisive factor to reach a good rehabilitative outcome, minimizing the time of rehabilitation with a following decrease of hospitalization costs. In spinal cord injured patients, surgical treatment of pressure sores is not proposed as the main procedure, but it is an important stage during the natural history of pressure sores. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous, adipofascial and fasciocutaneous flaps are less invasive, of a relatively easy execution, provided by a reliable vascular pedicle and they could be "re-used" in case of recurrences...|$|R
40|$|IF 2. 4 International audienceIntroduction: In surgery, some defects require {{reconstruction}} with microsurgical flap. The free flap {{failure rate}} varies between 2 % and 5 % with severe. Vascular thrombosis {{is the most}} frequent complication and represents 15 - 73 %. The success rate of salvage therapy is greater when salvage surgery is early. Currently clinical monitoring is the gold standard. Many non-invasive or minimally invasive techniques {{have been developed to}} improve early diagnosis of complications of vascular thrombosis. Each technique has advantages and disadvantages. The aim of our experimental study was to compare the clinical assessment and intracapillary glycemia and lactataemia measurements during monitoring of free <b>flaps.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods: Pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) were operated under general anesthesia. A myocutaneous latissimus dorsi with skin paddle was performed. Each animal was operated twice (right and left) similarly. 4 groups were made: Group 1 (no flap ligature or control group); Group 2 (flap with final ligation of the artery); Group 3 (flap with final ligation of the two veins); Group 4 (flap with transient ligature of the artery and two veins for 1 hour). An incision was made {{in the center of the}} skin paddle to make the measurements. Postoperative monitoring protocol consisted of a triple monitoring: clinical, biological and histological. Results: Eight animals were operated and sixteen flaps were realized. Each flap was clinically and biologically tested 25 times. Clinical, biological and histological monitoring showed significant variations according to the groups. Discussion-Conclusion: Experimentally the intra-capillary measures of lactate and glucose levels associated with clinical monitoring may shorten the delay in diagnosis. Ultimately this will save lives and achieve better functional and aesthetic results...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Myocutaneous flaps {{are often}} used to repair oral and maxillofacial defects after surgery for oral cancer; however, their volume {{decreases}} during the postoperative period. To facilitate treatment planning, the authors measured the extent of such postoperative flap volume loss and identified associated factors in patients who underwent oral reconstruction with myocutaneous <b>flaps.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: The authors designed and performed a retrospective observational study of patients who underwent reconstructive procedures involving rectus abdominal myocutaneous (RAM) or pectoralis major myocutaneous (PMMC) flaps at Tokai University Hospital, Kobe University Hospital, or Nagasaki University Hospital from April 2009 through March 2013. Flap type and other clinical variables were examined as potential predictors of flap loss. The primary outcome was flap loss at 6 months postoperatively. Correlations between each potential predictor and the primary outcome were examined using multiple regression analysis. Results: The subjects were 75 patients whose oral defects were reconstructed with RAM flaps (n = 57) or PMMC flaps (n = 18). RAM flaps exhibited a mean volume shrinkage of 22 % at 6 months postoperatively, which was less than the 27. 5 % displayed by the PMMC flaps, but {{the difference was not}} important. Renal failure, previous surgery of the oral region, postoperative radiotherapy, and postoperative serum albumin level were found to be meaningful risk factors for postoperative flap volume loss. Conclusion: The {{results of this study suggest}} that larger flaps should be used in patients who possess these risk factors or are scheduled to undergo postoperative radiotherapy. Future studies should examine the utility of postoperative nutritional management for preventing flap volume loss. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 829 号 学位授与年月日:平成 28 年 3 月 18 日Author: Yuki Sakamoto, Soichi Yanamoto, Yoshihide Ota, Shungo Furudoi, Takahide Komori, Masahiro UmedaCitation: Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, 74 (3), pp. 644 – 649; 201...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims. Wound {{dehiscence}} after {{lower third}} molar surgery extends the postoperative treatment period and may cause long-standing pain. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare wound dehiscence after removal of wisdom teeth in the most prevalent mandibular impaction (mesioangular class IB) by two different soft tissue <b>flap</b> designs. <b>Materials</b> and methods. Partially-erupted mandibular third molars with mesioangular class IB impaction (Pell and Gregory classification) were selected.
