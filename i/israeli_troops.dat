5|$|On December 21, 1995, <b>Israeli</b> <b>troops</b> {{withdrew from}} Bethlehem, {{and three days}} later the city came under the {{complete}} administration and military control of the Palestinian National Authority in conformance with the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1995.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the invasion, the Syrian force {{consisted}} of a reinforced infantry brigade, supplemented by at least one armored battalion (including Renault R35 tanks) and a field artillery battalion. The troops moved to Kafr Harib and were spotted by Haganah reconnaissance, but because the attack was not expected, the <b>Israeli</b> <b>troops</b> did not attack the invaders. At night between 15 and 16 May, the bulk of the Syrian forces set up camp in Tel al-Qasr in the southwestern Golan. One company with armored reinforcements split up to the south to proceed to the Jewish water station on the Yarmouk riverbank.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Arafat {{left the}} University and, {{along with other}} Arabs, sought to enter Palestine to join Arab forces {{fighting}} against <b>Israeli</b> <b>troops</b> {{and the creation of}} the state of Israel. However, instead of joining the ranks of the Palestinian fedayeen, Arafat fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood, although he did not join the organization. He took part in combat in the Gaza area (which was the main battleground of Egyptian forces during the conflict). In early 1949, the war was winding down in Israel's favor, and Arafat returned to Cairo from a lack of logistical support.|$|E

5000|$|In October 1948 Operation Hiram took place, {{where the}} {{operational}} {{orders to the}} <b>Israeli</b> <b>troop</b> were [...] "to occupy {{the whole of the}} Galilee”. On the 30 October, 1948, the 71st Battalion from the 7th Armored Brigade took Ras al-Ahmar, together with Rehaniya, Alma and Dayshum. Word of the Jish and Safsaf massacres had apparently spread to Ras al-Ahmar, as the village was largely empty when the 7th Brigade arrived.|$|R
5000|$|After {{watching}} {{footage of}} <b>Israeli</b> <b>troop</b> deployments on television, a British soldier who completed numerous combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan with the Intelligence Corps defended the Israeli Army's use of white phosphorus. The soldier noted, [...] "White phosphorus is used {{because it provides}} an instant smokescreen, other munitions can provide a smokescreen but the effect is not instant. Faced with overwhelming enemy fire and wounded comrades, every commander would choose to screen his men instantly, to do otherwise would be negligent." ...|$|R
5|$|Just before Jaffa was conquered by <b>Israeli</b> <b>troops</b> in April 1948, {{the family}} fled {{to their house}} near Majdal, but the Jewish militias arrived there too, {{and they had to}} flee again. This time they went to the Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, then under Egyptian control. Melman writes that the family spent nine months living in tents, {{dependent}} on UNRWA for an allowance of oil, rice and potatoes. The experience had a powerful effect on Abu Nidal.|$|E
5|$|Nine Comets, {{including}} Comet 1s {{operated by}} BOAC and Union Aeromaritime de Transport and Comet 4s flown by Aerolíneas Argentinas, Dan-Air, Malaysian Airlines, and United Arab Airlines, were irreparably damaged during takeoff or landing accidents that were survived by all on board. A hangar fire damaged a No. 192 Squadron RAF Comet 2R beyond repair on 13 September 1957, and three Middle East Airlines Comet 4Cs {{were destroyed by}} <b>Israeli</b> <b>troops</b> at Beirut, Lebanon on 28 December 1968.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{just before}} the {{outbreak}} of the Six-Day War, Podgorny delivered an intelligence report to Egyptian Vice President Anwar Sadat which claimed, falsely, that <b>Israeli</b> <b>troops</b> were massing along the Syrian border. That same year, he engaged in a dialogue with Pope Paul VI as part of the pontiff's ostpolitik; the result was greater openness for the Roman Catholic Church in Eastern Europe. In 1971 Podgorny went on two state visits, the first to the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the second to North Vietnam; Kosygin went on a visit to Canada while Brezhnev visited Yugoslavia. Podgorny frequently paid visits to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War to discuss Soviet-Vietnamese foreign relations. In 1973, Podgorny visited Finland and Mohammed Daoud Khan's Afghanistan.|$|E
50|$|America {{features}} {{prominently in}} Arab conspiracy theories purporting {{to explain the}} June 1967 defeat. Mohamed Hassanein Heikal, a confidant of Nasser, claims that President Lyndon B. Johnson was obsessed with Nasser and that Johnson conspired with Israel to bring him down. The reported <b>Israeli</b> <b>troop</b> movements seemed all the more threatening because they were perceived {{in the context of}} a US conspiracy against Egypt. Salah Bassiouny of the Foreign ministry, claims that Foreign Ministry saw the reported <b>Israeli</b> <b>troop</b> movements as credible because Israel had reached the level at which it could find strategic alliance with the United States. During the war, Cairo announced that American and British planes were participating in the Israeli attack. Nasser broke off diplomatic relations following this allegation. Nasser's image of the United States was such that he might well have believed the worst. However Anwar Sadat implied that Nasser used this deliberate conspiracy in order to accuse the United States as a political cover-up for domestic consumption. Lutfi Abd al-Qadir, the director of Radio Cairo during the late 1960s, who accompanied Nasser to his visits in Moscow, had his conspiracy theory that both the Soviets and the Western powers wanted to topple Nasser or to reduce his influence.|$|R
2500|$|UNIFIL {{also came}} under {{criticism}} during the 2006 Lebanon War for broadcasting detailed reports of <b>Israeli</b> <b>troop</b> movements, numbers, and positions on their website which [...] "could have exposed Israeli soldiers to grave danger", while making no such reports about Hezbollah. UNIFIL's actions {{could have been}} motivated {{by the fact that}} Israel was, as a response to Hezbollah rocket fire (which Hezbollah alleges to have been a reaction to Israeli [...] "border violations") and to the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers, conducting a ground invasion of Lebanon at that time.|$|R
25|$|Some <b>Israeli</b> ground <b>troops</b> briefly {{advanced}} approximately 1km into Lebanon and leveled Hezbollah border outposts with bulldozers in {{an effort}} to make it difficult for Hezbollah to reestablish its border presence.|$|R
5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, <b>Israeli</b> <b>troops</b> fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E

5000|$|A hybrid adversary uses {{advanced}} {{weapons systems}} and other disruptive technologies. These weapons can be now bought at bargain prices. Moreover, other novel technologies are being {{adapted to the}} battlefield such as cellular networks. In 2006, Hezbollah was armed with high-tech weaponry, such as precision guided missiles, that nation-states typically use. Hezbollah forces shot down Israeli helicopters, severely damaged a patrol boat with a cruise missile and destroyed heavily armored tanks by firing guided missiles from hidden bunkers. The organization also used aerial drones to gather intelligence, communicated with encrypted cell phones and watched <b>Israeli</b> <b>troop</b> movements with thermal night-vision equipment.|$|R
25|$|The crisis had a {{major impact}} on {{international}} relations and created a rift within NATO. Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott. Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an <b>Israeli</b> <b>troop</b> withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula. The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.|$|R

Israel was concerned when it was reported that Indonesia was being considered to replace Italy as commander of UNIFIL's naval force. As Indonesia does not recognize Israel, and the two countries have no diplomatic or military relations, Israel expressed concern that cooperation with the IDF, especially the Israeli Navy, could deteriorate.|$|R

25|$|At dawn, 130 Syrian {{tanks and}} many APCs were {{lying in the}} valley, many of them behind or between the Israeli positions. During the night, two Syrian {{infantry}} battalions attacked the position on Hermonit and were fought off by less than twenty <b>Israeli</b> infantry <b>troops</b> from the Golani Brigade. Dozens of bodies were left lying on the battlefield.|$|R
5000|$|While {{working as}} a private investigator, Amit met an American naval officer whose ship had docked in Haifa at a bar in the city, and Amit told him about his {{experiences}} in Israeli intelligence. The officer informed his superiors, and a plan to recruit Amit as a spy was devised. The officer told Amit {{that he intended to}} retire from the US Navy, settle in West Germany and start a business. Amit responded that he had a wish to make good money, and suggested that they do business together, to which he agreed. Amit travelled to West Germany sometime later, where he met the officer, who introduced him to his [...] "friends", who were in fact CIA officers from the U.S. Embassy in Bonn. They successfully recruited Amit as a spy. His handler was Tom Waltz, a Jewish CIA officer from the CIA station at the US embassy in Tel Aviv. Waltz instructed Amit on which kind of material was needed. Above all, the CIA was interested in <b>Israeli</b> <b>troop</b> movements and intentions in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. Amit was also alleged to have passed classified information to an unidentified NATO country in Europe. Amit continued spying almost until his arrest.|$|R
50|$|The Siniora Plan {{called for}} a mutual release of Lebanese and Israeli prisoners and detainees, an {{immediate}} withdrawal of the <b>Israeli</b> ground <b>troops</b> behind the Blue Line, that the disputed Shebaa Farms area would be placed under UN jurisdiction until the ownership issue had been settled, that Israel handed over all remaining maps showing their landmines in southern Lebanon, that the Lebanese army took full control over southern Lebanon, and that a strong multi-national force under the UN is given the necessary powers (including operating under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which allows the use of force) to guarantee stability and security.|$|R

2500|$|Following {{an ambush}} by Hezbollah in Israeli {{territory}} that left three soldiers dead and two abducted, the 2006 Lebanon War started. During the war Israeli bombardments seeking Hezbollah targets caused damage {{in many parts}} of Beirut, especially the poorer and largely Shiite South Beirut, which is controlled by Hezbollah. On 3 August 2006, Hasan Nasrallah vowed to strike Tel Aviv in retaliation for Israel's bombardment of Lebanon's capital. [...] "If you hit Beirut, the Islamic resistance will hit Tel Aviv and is able to do that with God's help," [...] Nasrallah said in a televised address.
