The assembly conditions of compound planetary gears are more restrictive than simple planetary gears, and they must be assembled in the correct initial orientation relative to each other, or their teeth will not simultaneously engage the sun and ring gear at opposite ends of the planet, leading to very rough running and short life. Compound planetary gears can easily achieve larger transmission ratio with equal or smaller volume. For example, compound planets with teeth in a 2:1 ratio with a 50T ring gear would give the same effect as a 100T ring gear, but with half the actual diameter.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{reliability}} when testing gear efficiency and on how <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> efficiency {{can be increased}} without {{detrimental effects on the}} gears. Test equipment commonly used in gear research was analysed to identify important parameters for gear efficiency testing. The effect of the bearing model's load-dependent losses on <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> efficiency was also investigated. Two different surface finishes of gears, ground and superfinished, were investigated to determine how two different load levels during running-in affect <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> efficiency and changes in surface roughness. Efficiency and gear temperature were also measured for ground and superfinished gears with dip lubrication, as well as two different forms of spray lubrication (before and after <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> contact). Tests on a gear test rig, showed that different assemblies of the same test setup can yield different measurements of torque loss. The applied bearing model had a significant effect on the estimated <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> efficiency. The mesh efficiency of ground gears is affected by the running-in procedure, with a higher running-in load resulting in a higher mesh efficiency than a lower load. This effect was not seen for superfinished gears, which show the same <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> efficiency for both running-in loads. Gearbox efficiency increased with spray lubrication rather than dip lubrication. The <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> efficiency increased, and thus gear temperatures were reduced, when superfinished gears were used rather than ground gears. A lower gear temperature was measured when gears were spray lubricated at the mesh inlet rather than the mesh outlet. QC 20170314 </p...|$|E
