So far, general public knows channidae as snakehead, Channa striata, {{but there are}} several members of this family {{that have not been}} used as high <b>fish</b> <b>albumin</b> yet. Based on proximate analysis, the highest protein level was recorded in common snakehead (Channa striata), 20. 83 %, the lowest fat and water content were recorded in giant snakehead (Channa micropeltes), 0. 22 %,The highest albumin level was recorded in Toman (channa micropelthes), 8. 26 % in filtrate and 3. 50 in flesh, respectively, and the highest zn was also found in Toman (channa micropelthes), 2. 59 %. As a whole, there are 14 amino acids distributed among members of family channidas...|$|E
40|$|Snakehead fish (Channa striata) {{is a type}} of {{carnivore}} fish living in fresh water and belogs to family of Channidaea. Protein and albumin content in the snakehead fish as reported is considered as high and thus, can provide health function to help in the treatment of wound healing patients, children with malnutrition and some other medical cases. Protein, as biomolecule, is very sensitive to the external condition and thus, requires adequate treatment during extraction and dying processes {{in order to get a}} biologically active albumin concentrate. In this work we varied the extraction and drying methods (temperature, maceration time, and steps of extraction and drying procesess) from sample of snakehead fish from Kalimantan. It was found that maceration temperature and drying methods gave significant effect to both yield and quality of albumin concentrate from the snakehead fish. Additionally we also analyzed one commercial snakehead <b>fish</b> <b>albumin</b> concentrate which was proven to have a significantly lower protein profile as well as poor solubility in aqueous solvents...|$|E

The soluble subtances cause trouble environment {{if it was}} untreated. In addition recovery protein will give benefit both in reducing trouble environment and utilizing soluble protein as sources of albumin protein. The objectives of research were to recover albumin from snakehead fish surimi wash water and to valorize as stock albumin tablet. Recovery of albumin use 0. 05 m ultrafiltration membrane and the valorization of albumin tablets was by direct compression. The protein band with molecular weight of 67. 741 kDa on the retentate was detected as albumin. Concentration of protein recover by ultrafiltration membrane increased 89. 98 and the albumin content 3. 50. 4 gdl. Based on the result of chemical composition and microbiology analysis albumin of snakehead surimi wash water appropriate with Indonesia National Standard SNI quality requirement about snakehead <b>fish</b> <b>albumin</b> extract. The best formulation {{in the preparation of}} surimi wash water albumin tablet was by using corn starch excipients with uniformity weight value 410. 39 0. 09 g hardness value 7. 65 0. 8 Kp uniformity size of tablet with diameter 1 cm and thickness 0. 59 cm friability value 2. 3 and disintregation time of the tablet is 2 minutes 16 second...|$|E

40|$|The Research about {{utilization}} of sap Biduri {{in the production}} of <b>albumin</b> <b>fish</b> cork (Ophiocephalus striatus). Has been done This research purposes to determine the ratio of sap Biduri to extract cork fish that produce the protein albumin with the highest yield and optimum heating time which produces the highest yield of the protein albumin. The study used a completely randomized design (CRD), which consists of the influence of the ratio of sap Biduri to extract protein and the effect of heating time Biduri to extract latex mixture. Each treatment is done twice to obtain 22 units of the experiment. The highest protein yield was obtained at a ratio of sap Biduri 3, 0 : 30 and the heating time of 60 minutes at 53, 43 %. The purity of the highest degree obtained at the optimum 50 minutes warm up period of 35. 50 %...|$|R
40|$|Transthyretin (TTR) {{is one of}} {{the three}} plasma {{proteins}} that participate in the transport of thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3); it is also involved in the carriage of retinol through the mediation of retinol-binding protein. 1 The liver and choroid plexus are the major sites of TTR synthesis in mammals, birds, and diprotodont marsupials; in reptiles, TTR is only synthesized in the choroid plexus. 2 cDNA coding for TTR has been cloned from several mammalian, reptilian, and avian species and is highly conserved especially in the domains involved in binding to thyroid hormones. 3 TTR expression has never been reported in <b>fish,</b> in which <b>albumin</b> is considered to be the main carrier for T 3 and T 4. 2 We report the cloning of a TTR cDNA from sea bream (Sparus aurata) and demonstrate the presence of TTR mRNA in the liver of this fish...|$|R
