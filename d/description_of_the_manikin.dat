40|$|The {{vibration}} attenuation {{performance of}} suspension seats employed in heavy vehicles {{are influenced by}} energy dissipation property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seated body. Owing to complexities associated with biodynamic response behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human body, <b>the</b> performance assessments <b>of</b> suspension seats are invariably accomplished through laboratory or field experimentation. Such laboratory experiments involve certain safety and ethical concerns, while field measurements yield difficulties in interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results {{due to lack of}} controlled conditions. In this dissertation, two prototype anthropodynamic manikins, designed to replace human subjects in assessments of seat, are evaluated through laboratory experiments and analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biodynamic responses. The apparent mass (APMS) responses of manikins are characterized under different levels of vibration excitations and three body masses (55 kg, 75 kg and 98 kg). The measured responses are compared with the standardized values to assess the APMS prediction abilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikins.</b> <b>The</b> results suggest the need for deriving more reliable APMS responses of seated humans <b>of</b> particular masses. <b>The</b> applicability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikins</b> for seating dynamics is then assessed for a range of seats and vibration spectra <b>of</b> different vehicles. <b>The</b> seat effective acceleration transmissibility (S. E. A. T) of five different seats are measured using human subjects, equivalent inert mass and <b>the</b> prototype <b>manikins.</b> <b>The</b> results suggest that equivalent inert mass could provide reasonably good prediction of seat performance, when excitations dominate in the low frequency range. Under high frequency excitations, the inert mass yields poor estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seat-human system performance, while <b>the</b> <b>manikins</b> provide better estimations. The need for tuning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikins</b> was identified to improve their biodynamic response prediction abilities. An analytical model <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> was thus formulated and analyzed to perform the necessary design refinements. System identification technique was applied to derive uncertain parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model so as to satisfy the measured APMS responses for three body masses. Additional parameter identification was performed to realize desirable parameters that would satisfy the standardized biodynamic response. The results suggested that only minor refinements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prototype would be needed to enhance the biodynamic response prediction ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin,</b> which may translate into improved applicability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> for assessment <b>of</b> suspension seats...|$|R

A manikin needs to have the following properties: shape and size, heat production, skin temperature, sweat rate, physiological responses and others. So far, no manikin satisfying all these criteria has been available. In the present study, a two-layer movable sweating thermal manikin was newly developed as a trial {{to compensate for the}} differences between conventional thermal <b>manikins</b> and <b>the</b> human body. <b>The</b> <b>manikin</b> consisted <b>of</b> two layers, a core section in the trunk and a shell section divided into 17 parts over the whole body, the temperature and heat supply of which could be independently controlled. <b>The</b> <b>manikin</b> is possible to change the posture and to walk. The sweat rate from 180 pores on the skin was controlled by peristaltic pumps. <b>The</b> temperature performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> was investigated using thermograph. As a result, <b>the</b> surface temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> decreased more in the extremities than in the trunk when <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> was exposed to 18 °C after being exposed to 28 °C for 20 min.

40|$|Digital Human Modeling {{programs}} are important tools in virtual manufacturing that allow simulation of manual assembly work, long before any physical product has been built. By investigating the logistics, ergonomics {{and the interaction}} among the workers at an early stage, {{it may be possible}} to reduce <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> design changes, increase the quality and to decrease <b>the</b> ramp-up time <b>of</b> a manufacturing process. However, far from all assembly operations are simulated, even if all the necessary data is available. One reason is the tedious work required to setup and to define all the motions needed by a manikin to perform a simulation. In each simulation, <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> must be adjusted into the desired posture and the user must ensure that balance is held and that it avoids collision with objects in the environment. Thus, even a small case may be time consuming to simulate. This shows that there is a need of an easier way <b>of</b> instructing <b>the</b> <b>manikins.</b> In this work we propose a new formal high-level language for controlling an automated <b>manikin.</b> <b>The</b> language instructions are structured by a grammar, which defines a hierarchical tree for <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> instructions. <b>The</b> low- level instructions contains basic functionality for maneuvering <b>the</b> <b>manikin,</b> such as Move, Position and Grasp, and higher levels contain more abstract instructions such as Get and Assemble. Thus, the high-level instructions define sequences of other instructions, whereas a low-level instruction corresponds to a direct instruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> <b>The</b> set <b>of</b> available instructions that <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> may perform during a simulation depends on <b>the</b> current state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> and <b>the</b> objects at the assembly station. Thus, properties of objects, such as grasping and mating points, also help define <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> available instructions for <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> <b>The</b> order in which the different parts in the assembly operations have to be connected may also be considered when constructing instruction sequences for <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> instruction sequences may be formally verified to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> only performs valid instructions. The language have been implemented in <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> simulation software IMMA and tested on elementary cases with relevance to industrial applications. The results show that fewer steps are needed to perform a realistic simulation when the language is used compared to manually instructing <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> Furthermore, it is also shown that the instructions generated by the language are formally correct...|$|R

This requires that the system know several basic facts about <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> (surface area, hypothesized metabolic rate) while experimental factors must be input by the user (clothing insulation, Wet Bulb Globe Temperature). The second control method is constant heat flux from <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> That is, <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> supplies a constant level of power, set by the user, and <b>the</b> skin temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different segments is measured. The third method is that <b>the</b> skin temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> is maintained constant at a user-specified value, while the power increases or decreases depending on the environmental conditions.

Results show that the different appearance modes affect the ergonomic judgment. A more realistic looking manikin is rated higher than the very same posture visualized with a less natural appearance. Therefore, it is important to educate human simulation tool users to always combine visualizations (pictures) with an objective ergonomic evaluation method...|$|R

It is closely connected with the fact that it affects the person's wellbeing in relation to the protection, skin sensations and heat as well as moisture management. In relation to water and air permeability as well as permeability <b>of</b> water vapours, <b>the</b> testing process and evaluation were not based on investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole garments and utilization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikins</b> but they were performed by help of selected and available methods for evaluating the moisture, water and air management properties. These selected methods were based on investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small textile samples under the laboratory conditions. The result was connected with <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> these mentioned properties for <b>the</b> whole assortment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work clothes with different material composition...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the human chest {{exhibits}} a strong force displacement hysteresis during CPR, a stark contrast to the non hysteretic behavior of standard spring manikins. We hypothesize that individuals with experience performing CPR on humans would perceive a manikin with damping as more realistic and better for training. By analyzing data collected from chest compressions on real patients, we created a dynamic model that accounts for this hysteresis with a linear spring and a one-way variable damper, and we built a new high-fidelity <b>manikin</b> to enact <b>the</b> desired force displacement relationship. A linkage attached to the chest plate converts vertical compression motions to <b>the</b> horizontal displacement <b>of</b> a set of pneumatic dashpot pistons, sending a volume of air into and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> through a programmable valve. Position and pressure sensors allow a microcontroller to adjust the valve orifice so that the provided damping force closely follows the desired damping force throughout the compression cycle. Eight experienced CPR practitioners tested both <b>the</b> new <b>manikin</b> and an identical looking standard manikin; <b>the</b> <b>manikin</b> with damping received significantly higher ratings for haptic realism and perceived utility as a training tool...|$|R

40|$|Thermal manikins {{are useful}} tools to study {{clothing}} comfort and environmental ergonomics. <b>The</b> simulation <b>of</b> sweating {{can be achieved}} by putting a highly wicking stretchable knit fabric “skin” on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>manikin.</b> However, <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> such a fabric skin makes it difficult to accurately measure the skin surface temperature. Moreover, it takes considerable amount of time to measure the fabric skin surface temperature at each test. At present <b>the</b> attachment <b>of</b> temperature sensors to the wet fabric skin is still a challenge. <b>The</b> distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensors to the fabric skin could significantly influence the temperature and relative humidity values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wet skin surface. Hence, we conducted an intensive skin study on a dry thermal <b>manikin</b> to investigate <b>the</b> relationships among <b>the</b> nude <b>manikin</b> surface temperature, heat losses and the fabric skin surface temperature. An empirical equation was developed and validated on <b>the</b> thermal <b>manikin</b> „Tore‟ at Lund University. The empirical equation at an ambient temperature 34. 0 ºC is Tsk = 34. 00 - 0. 0103 HL.
