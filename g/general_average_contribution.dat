The role of incentives in shaping individual behaviour has been largely analysed in the traditional economic literature. On the contrary, very {{little is known about}} the specific role of obligations. In this paper we test whether or not obligations have any independent effect on cooperation in a public good game. The results show that, for given marginal incentives, different levels of minimum contribution required by obligation determine significantly different levels of <b>average</b> <b>contributions.</b> Moreover, obligations per se cannot sustain cooperation over time, even if they affect the rate of decline of <b>average</b> <b>contributions.</b> Finally, unexpected changes in the minimum contribution have asymmetric dynamic effects on the levels of cooperation: a reduction does not alter the descending trend of cooperation, whereas an increase induces a temporary re-start in <b>average</b> <b>contributions...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{information}} regarding other people’s choices on individual choice in a public good experiment with two separate treatments. In the implicit treatment, subjects do not see the <b>average</b> <b>contribution</b> of others in their group, but they can calculate it from the information available. In the explicit treatment, subjects see the <b>average</b> <b>contribution</b> of others in their group. If subjects are rational calculating agents as suggested in mainstream economic theory there should be no difference in observed behavior across treatments: agents should use all available information to make decisions. What we see instead is quite different and consistent with the presence of social norms: first, players change their behavior in response to the change in displayed information; second, changes in individual behavior produce identical group outcomes, in terms of total payoffs or efficiency across the two treatments. How does this happen? The display of the <b>average</b> <b>contribution</b> of others results in behavior consistent with a focal point (Schelling, 1960), i. e., more subjects behave as reciprocators (conditioning their contributions on the contributions of others), and fewer behave as cooperators or free-riders (unconditionally contributing a lot or a little, respectively). This change in behavior differs by gender: women behave similarly to men when they see the <b>average</b> <b>contribution</b> by others; when they cannot, they behave differently, favoring unconditional strategies of free-riding or cooperation. Men’s behavior, in contrast to women’s adaption, does not adjust to social cues, as suggested by Croson and Gneezy (2009). public goods, focal points, social norms, gender, experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the impact of various {{fundraising}} incentives and mechanisms on the donation behavior of Finnish households. This study is conducted as a Natural Field Experiment and measures the effect of challenge and “per-head” matching gifts on the total donations received from households. A challenge gift is an unconditional commitment by the donor, or a set of donors, to provide a given sum of money to a cause. A “per-head” matching gift is a conditional commitment by the leadership donors to donate a given sum, up to the maximum amount the leader donor is prepared to give, for every household that decides to contribute. Further, this study examines the effect of different “tick-the-box” amounts on the payment sheets of the mail-solicitations on total contributions made by the approached households. The fundraising campaign conducted for the Cancer Society raised in total over 80, 000 euros. I find that the higher ‘tick-the-box’ treatment of € 20 /€ 60 /€ 100 compared to € 10 /€ 30 /€ 50 induces significantly higher <b>average</b> <b>contributions</b> with no significant change in response rate. I also find that introducing a challenge gift or a fixed matching gift does not affect the <b>average</b> <b>contributions</b> or the response rate of households. However, if a challenge gift is introduced, the larger challenge gift leads to slightly higher <b>average</b> <b>contributions</b> with no significant change in response rate. Conversely, however, if a fixed matching gift is introduced, the smaller gift leads to slightly higher <b>average</b> <b>contributions</b> with no significant change in response rate...|$|R
