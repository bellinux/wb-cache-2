40|$|We {{report on}} four fatal cases of renal {{infection}} due to Paratanaisia bragai in scarlet macaws (Ara macao) from two rescue centres in Costa Rica. At necropsy, birds had severe dehydration and cachexia. Two birds had hydropericardium, oedematous lungs, and liver lipidic degeneration. All birds had enlarged kidneys with brown pale discoloration and diffuse white {{spots on the}} cortical and sliced surfaces. Ureters were filled with many specimens of P. bragai. Histopathologically, the urinary system revealed multifocal <b>interstitial</b> lymphocytic-plasmacytic <b>nephritis,</b> multifocal mineralization of renal tubules, and interstitial fibrosis associated with flukes. Death of all scarlet macaws was related to severe nephritis leading to chronic renal failure due to P. bragai infection. It is plausible that P. bragai infection of scarlet macaws was accidental due to ingestion of the gastropod intermediate host inside the cages {{during the rainy season}} when humidity is higher and gastropods are more active.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{described}} {{a range of}} Klossiella species parasitic in marsupial hosts. Klossiella quimrensis is the etiologic agent of renal coccidiosis in the peramelid marsupial hosts Isoodon obesulus and Perameles gunnii in Eastern Australia, {{but there is no}} previous report of klossiellosis in Western Australian peramelids. This study describes klossiellosis diagnosed by histology of renal tissue sections collected during necropsy of 20 Perameles bougainville between 2000 and 2005. Sporonts, sporoblasts, and macrogametes were identified within parasitophorous vacuoles of epithelial cells located near the renal corticomedullary junction. The prevalence of renal coccidiosis in P. bougainville diagnosed by renal histology is estimated at 30 %. Only a single unsporulated sporocyst was detected by examination of cystocentesis-collected urine, indicating that microscopic evaluation of urine samples is an insensitive diagnostic test for detection of K. quimrensis in P. bougainville. This infection in P. bougainville is indirectly associated with mild multifocal <b>interstitial</b> lymphohistiocytic <b>nephritis</b> and is likely to be only minimally pathogenic in otherwise healthy individuals. Our study also extends the host and geographic range of K. quimrensis to include P. bougainville and Western Australia. M. D. Bennett, L. Woolford, A. J. O'Hara, P. K. Nicholls, K. S. Warren, J. A.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{isolating}} Leptospira spp., blood serum, kidney, {{liver and}} genital tract of 137 female swine (40 sows and 97 gilts) and also urine samples from 22 sows were collected in a slaughterhouse in the State of São Paulo, from April 2003 to August 2004. Four isolates were obtained from animals that presented microagglutination test (MAT) titers > 100 for the serovar Pomona and one was obtained from an animal negative by MAT in which Leptospira was isolated from the liver and reproductive tract. The presence of leptospiral DNA was investigated by PCR, and positive results were found in kidneys of 11 females, liver of two, genital tract of two and urine of one of them. Nephrosis, <b>interstitial</b> multifocal <b>nephritis,</b> moderate to severe changing, hyalines cylinders and hemorrhagic focuses, hepatic and uterine horns congestion were histological lesions observed in higher frequency in animals positive for leptospira.

40|$|Human Bartonella infections {{result in}} diverse medical presentations, whereas many cats appear to {{tolerate}} chronic bacteremia without obvious clinical abnormalities. Eighteen specific-pathogen-free cats were inoculated with Bartonella henselae- and/or Bartonella clarridgeiae-infected cat blood and monitored for 454 days. Relapsing bacteremia did not correlate {{with changes in}} protein profiles or differences in antigenic protein recognition. Intradermal skin testing did not induce a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction to cat scratch disease skin test antigen. Thirteen cats were euthanatized {{at the end of}} the study. Despite persistent infection, clinical signs were minimal and gross necropsy results were unremarkable. Histopathology revealed peripheral lymph node hyperplasia (in all of the 13 cats), splenic follicular hyperplasia (in 9 cats), lymphocytic cholangitis/pericholangitis (in 9 cats), lymphocytic hepatitis (in 6 cats), lymphoplasmacytic myocarditis (in 8 cats), and <b>interstitial</b> lymphocytic <b>nephritis</b> (in 4 cats). Structures suggestive of Bartonella were visualized in some Warthin-Starry stained sections, and Bartonella DNA was amplified from the lymph node (from 6 of the 13 cats), liver (from 11 cats) heart (from 8 cats), kidney (from 9 cats), lung (from 2 cats), and brain (from 9 cats). This study indicates that B. henselae or B. clarridgeiae can induce chronic infection following blood transfusion in specific-pathogen-free cats and that Bartonella DNA can be detected in blood, brain, lymph node, myocardium, liver, and kidney tissues of both blood culture-positive cats and blood culture-negative cats. Detection of histologic changes in these cats supports a potential etiologic role for Bartonella species in several idiopathic disease processes in cats...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine {{pathology}} and the distribution pattern of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in internal organs of chickens from a field case using immunohistochemical staining. Materials and Methods: 10 groups of broiler, layer, and domestic chicken were collected from necropsy room Division of Pathology, Bogor Agricultural University. These chickens were originated from West Java and collected based on pathologist diagnosis as suspect of Newcastle disease (ND). They were subsequently confirmed positive of ND with real-time-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The respiratory, circulatory, digestive, lymphoreticular and central nervous systems were collected for histopathology examination. Results: The gross pathology and histopathology changes were tracheitis, pneumonia, pericarditis, myocarditis, catarrhal proventriculitis, catarrhal enteritis, typhlitis, perihepatitis, pancreatitis, <b>nephritis</b> <b>interstitial,</b> splenitis, atrophy of Bursa Fabricius, and encephalitis. Conclusion: The distribution pattern of NDV in internal organs of chickens from a field case in this study is similar with a previous reported pattern in systemic cases of the internal chicken organs.

40|$|International audienceMercury is a {{widespread}} heavy metal with potential severe impacts on human health. Exposure conditions to mercury and profile of toxicity among humans depend on the chemical forms of the mercury: elemental or metallic mercury, inorganic or organic mercury compounds. This article aims to reviewing and synthesizing the main knowledge of the mercury toxicity and its organic compounds that clinicians should know. Acute inhalation of metallic or inorganic mercury vapours mainly induces pulmonary diseases, whereas chronic inhalation rather induces neurological or renal disorders (encephalopathy and <b>interstitial</b> or glomerular <b>nephritis).</b> Methylmercury poisonings from intoxicated food occurred among some populations resulting in neurological disorders and developmental troubles for children exposed in utero. Treatment using chelating agents is recommended in case of symptomatic acute mercury intoxication; sometimes it improves the clinical effects of chronic mercury poisoning. Although it is currently rare to encounter situations of severe intoxication, efforts remain necessary to decrease the mercury concentration in the environment and to reduce risk on human health due to low level exposure (dental amalgam, fish contamination by organic mercury compounds [...] .). In case of occupational exposure to mercury and its compounds, some disorders could be compensated in France.

40|$|Based on {{histological}} and immunohistochemical {{examination of}} various organs {{of patients with}} autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), a novel clinicopathological entity of IgG 4 -related sclerosing disease has been proposed. This is a systemic disease that is characterized by extensive IgG 4 -positive plasma cells and T-lymphocyte infiltration of various organs. Clinical manifestations are apparent in the pancreas, bile duct, gallbladder, salivary gland, retroperitoneum, kidney, lung, and prostate, in which tissue fibrosis with obliterative phlebitis is pathologically induced. AIP is not simply pancreatitis but, in fact, is a pancreatic disease indicative of IgG 4 -related sclerosing diseases. This disease includes AIP, sclerosing cholangitis, cholecystitis, sialadenitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, tubulointerstitial <b>nephritis,</b> <b>interstitial</b> pneumonia, prostatitis, inflammatory pseudotumor and lymphadenopathy, all IgG 4 -related. Most IgG 4 -related sclerosing diseases {{have been found to}} be associated with AIP, but also those without pancreatic involvement have been reported. In some cases, only one or two organs are clinically involved, while in others, three or four organs are affected. The disease occurs predominantly in older men and responds well to steroid therapy. Serum IgG 4 levels and immunostaining with anti-IgG 4 antibody are useful in making the diagnosis. Since malignant tumors are frequently suspected on initial presentation, IgG 4 -related sclerosing disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis to avoid unnecessary surgery...|$|R

40|$|The 2003 International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) {{system for}} {{classifying}} patients with lupus nephritis {{was based on}} glomerular lesions exclusively, {{despite the fact that}} lupus nephritis affects all compartments of the kidney. Hence, we analyzed the tubulointerstitial lesions in patients with lupus nephritis within the different classes and subclasses of the 2003 ISN/RPS system. Among 313 patients from five centers in northern China with lupus <b>nephritis,</b> <b>interstitial</b> inflammatory cell infiltration, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis were severe in 170 patients with class IV, moderate in 55 with class III, and mild in 19 with class II and in 69 with class V disease, each with significance. The severity of tubulointerstitial lesions in classes IV-segmental and III was similar, whereas the score of interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration in patients with subclass IV-global was significantly higher than that in those with subclass IV-segmental. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy were each significantly more prominent in patients with both active and chronic lesions than in those with active lesions alone. The correlation coefficient ranged from 0. 222 to 0. 811 comparing glomerular and tubulointerstitial indices. In multivariate Cox hazard analysis of tubulointerstitial lesions, indices of interstitial infiltration, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis were confirmed as significant independent risk factors for renal outcome. Thus, we found that the 2003 ISN/RPS classification system of lupus nephritis, based on glomerular lesions, could also reflect related tubulointerstitial lesions. Hence, we suggest that the extent of tubulointerstitial lesions may be helpful in predicting renal outcome in patients with lupus nephritis...|$|R

40|$|Throughout {{this paper}} the term {{acidosis}} {{is used in}} the sense in which it was employed by Van Slyke and Cullen (1) to define "a condition in which the bicarbonate of the blood is reduced below the normal level. " They have pointed out that the bicarbonate represents the excess of base which is left after all of the non-volatile acids have been neutral-ized and that this is the base available for the immediate neutralization of any further increments of acids. Acidosis is an almost constant feature of the later stages of chronic <b>interstitial</b> and arteriosclerotic <b>nephritis.</b> In a series of such cases the inorganic constituents of the serum have been determined in order to obtain some indication of the cause of the acidosis.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE In most cases arterial blood was obtained in the morning before breakfast and the plasma or serum separated at once without exposure to air. In a few cases plasma obtained from venous blood collected without stasis was used. In a few other cases venous blood was saturated at 38 °C. with CO 2 at 40 mm. pressure and the plasma then obtained. The determinations in earlier studies were made on plasma from oxalated blood while later ones were on serum. Blood in these later studies was defibrinated by continuously inverting and reinverting the sampling tube containing the blood and a small amount of mercury.
