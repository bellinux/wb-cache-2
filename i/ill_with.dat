30|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective observational study of 96 transfused, critically <b>ill</b> patients <b>with</b> sepsis, 176 transfused, critically <b>ill</b> patients <b>with</b> traumatic injury, and 125 transfused, critically ill nontrauma, nonsepsis patients.

30|$|Introduction: Continuous renal {{replacement}} therapy (CRRT) {{is the most}} common therapy in critical <b>ill</b> patients <b>with</b> acute renal failure, having circuit coagulation as the most frequent complication. The CRRT circuit requires careful anticoagulation to avoid coagulation and bleeding complications. Critically <b>ill</b> patients <b>with</b> acquired antithrombin (AT) deficiency, may have a shorter filter lifespan.|$|R
30|$|Although {{outcomes}} of critically <b>ill</b> patients <b>with</b> haematological malignancies (HMs) have been fully investigated {{in terms of}} organ failure and mortality, data are scarce on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in this population. We aim to assess post-intensive care unit (ICU) burden and HRQOL of critically <b>ill</b> patients <b>with</b> HMs and to identify risk factors for quality-of-life (QOL) impairment.|$|R

5|$|In November 1908, {{returning}} from a meeting in Chicago, Beilhart fell <b>ill</b> <b>with</b> stomach pains. He was diagnosed with appendicitis, and a surgeon was brought in. There is some discrepancy concerning the diagnosis once surgery was performed. One doctor indicated that his appendix was healthy while another maintained that it had ruptured. Beilhart developed peritonitis and died on November 24, 1908.|$|E

30|$|Despite {{advantages}} {{in intensive care}} medicine, which have led to an improved outcome {{over the last decade}} [12], mortality in cirrhotic patients admitted to ICU is still high [13 – 15]. Measurement and knowledge of specific acid–base patterns and their implications in critically <b>ill</b> patients <b>with</b> liver cirrhosis may help to improve patient management, especially in the ICU setting [16]. However, to our knowledge, the acid–base profile of critically <b>ill</b> cirrhotic patients <b>with</b> acute-on-chronic liver disease (ACLF) has not been compared to critically ill patients without acute or chronic liver disease. Most information on the acid–base status of critically <b>ill</b> patients <b>with</b> cirrhosis was obtained by comparing these patients with healthy controls [8]. Yet, part of metabolic disturbances in critically <b>ill</b> patients <b>with</b> liver cirrhosis may be attributable to critical illness per se, rather than to the presence of chronic liver disease.|$|R
50|$|Article 5 of the Order stated wives with {{breast-feeding}} children, {{those who}} were <b>ill,</b> or <b>with</b> <b>ill</b> children {{were not to be}} arrested.

5|$|Irwin became terminally <b>ill</b> <b>with</b> {{cancer in}} the last weeks of his life.

He had been married to one woman since the 1880s and to the other since the 1890s. He was posthumously elected to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived in}} London in early January, 1695. Upon {{his arrival in}} London, he was arrested on exaggerated charges, levied by Dudley, that he had conspired to {{withhold}} customs monies. Phips was bailed out by Sir Henry Ashurst but fell <b>ill</b> <b>with</b> a fever and died on February 18, 1695, aged 44, before his charges were heard. He was buried in London at the Church of St. Mary Woolnoth.|$|E

5|$|Weakened {{from breast}} cancer and her {{treatment}} regimen, Carson became <b>ill</b> <b>with</b> a respiratory virus in January 1964.

30|$|Conclusion Critically <b>ill</b> {{patients}} <b>with</b> solid cancer have {{a meaningful}} day- 120 survival. Conversely to critically <b>ill</b> patients <b>with</b> haematological malignancy underlying malignancy and {{extension of the}} disease seems to be independently associated with day- 120 mortality. The Oncoscore developed in this study, although performing fairly in the studied population remains to be validated in an external population of solid cancer patients requiring ICU admission.|$|R

5|$|According to Hinchliffe, {{this is an}} {{incorrect}} statement. Hinchliffe based his account on Rumpelhardt's testimony who claims that Schnaufer was never taken to England. Rumpelhardt was released on 4 August 1945 and soon after Schnaufer was admitted {{to a hospital in}} Flensburg, <b>ill</b> <b>with</b> a combination of diphtheria and scarlet fever. Interrogation had begun in late May 1945 by a team of twelve officers from the Department of Air Technical Intelligence (DAT), led by Air Commodore Roderick Aeneas Chisholm. The German prisoners were brought to Eggebek. Here they conducted a number of interviews with various members of the night fighter force.|$|E

They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby. It was also on this trip, while <b>ill</b> <b>with</b> colitis, that Zelda began painting.|$|E

As the horses continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were cuts and bruises. He told his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.|$|E
