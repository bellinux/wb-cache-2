5|$|Diamond {{enhancements}} {{are specific}} treatments performed on natural or synthetic diamonds (usually those already cut and polished into a gem), which {{are designed to}} better the gemological characteristics of the stone {{in one or more}} ways. These include laser drilling to remove inclusions, application of sealants to fill cracks, treatments to <b>improve</b> <b>a</b> white diamond's color grade, and treatments to give fancy color to a white diamond.|$|E
5|$|In {{the more}} general case where the firm cannot price {{discriminate}} between domestic and foreign consumers {{the effects of a}} subsidy are less clear since both an expansion of exports and deterioration of terms of trade are present.

5|$|Promotion: A {{communication}} with the market should put stress on environmental aspects, for example that the company possesses a CP certificate or is ISO 14000 certified. This may be publicized to <b>improve</b> <b>a</b> firm’s image. Furthermore, {{the fact that a}} company spends expenditures on environmental protection should be advertised. Third, sponsoring the natural environment is also very important. And last but not least, ecological products will probably require special sales promotions.|$|E
5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically <b>improve</b> <b>a</b> filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|Double hulls {{have become}} {{popular in the}} past ten years. Designing a vessel with double sides adds {{primarily}} to its breadth, since bulkers are already required to have double bottoms. One of the advantages of the double hull is to make room to place all the structural elements in the sides, removing them from the holds. This increases the volume of the holds, and simplifies their structure which helps in loading, unloading, and cleaning. Double sides also <b>improve</b> <b>a</b> ship's capacity for ballasting, which is useful when carrying light goods: the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons, which is done by adding ballast water.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute {{low back pain}} is positive. Pain and {{disability}} usually <b>improve</b> <b>a</b> great deal {{in the first six}} weeks, with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous low back pain, and job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of low back pain. Following a first episode of back pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E

5|$|The {{heads-up display}} {{features}} a health meter, a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. Depending on the level, the player can control several different air, {{land and water}} vehicles. Aircraft are the Naboo N-1 Starfighter, the Naboo Bomber and Police Cruiser, while land and watercraft are the Flash and Gian speeders, the Trade Federation Gunboat and the Heavy STAP. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft that falls within its air, land or watercraft specification. Some levels offer the player the option to change craft mid-level. Seven bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses <b>improve</b> <b>a</b> craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft {{for the remainder of}} the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads-up display}} {{features}} a health meter, a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. The player can control five craft: X-wing, A-wing, Y-wing, snowspeeder and V-wing. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, {{as well as}} varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft. Levels set on non-atmospheric moons expose the player's craft to space; thus disallowing the Speeder and V-Wing (which are repulsorcraft) from being used; but as on other levels, the craft is vertically confined. Nine bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses <b>improve</b> <b>a</b> craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft {{for the remainder of}} the game.|$|E
5|$|Sabah {{currently}} receives 5% oil royalty (percentage of {{oil production}} {{paid by the}} mining company to the lease owner) from Petronas over oil explorations in Sabah territorial waters based on the 1974 Petroleum Development Act. Majority of {{the oil and gas}} deposits are located on Sabah Trough basin in the west coast side. Sabah was also given a 10% stake in Petronas liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Bintulu, Sarawak. Income inequality and the high cost living remain the major economic issues in Sabah. The high cost living has been blamed on the Cabotage Policy, although the cause was due to the smaller trade volumes, cost of transport and efficiency of port to handle trade. The government has set to review the Cabotage Policy even thought the cause was due to other reasons with the World Bank has stated that the result was due to weak distribution channels, high handling charges and inefficient inland transportation. It was finally agreed to exempt the policy from 1 June 2017; with foreign ships will go directly to ports in the East without need to go to West Malaysia although Cabotage Policy on transshipment of goods within Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan remain. Prime Minister Najib also promised to narrow development gap between Sabah and the Peninsular by improving and built more infrastructures in the state. Based on a latest record, the total unemployment in the state have been reduced from 5.1% (2014) to 4.7% (2015), although the number of unemployment was still high. Slum is almost non-existent in Malaysia but due to the high number of refugees arriving from the troubling southern Philippines, Sabah has since saw a significant rise on its numbers. To eliminate water pollution and <b>improve</b> <b>a</b> better hygiene, the Sabah state government are working to relocate them into a better housing settlement. As part of the BIMP-EAGA, Sabah also continued to position itself as a main gateway for regional investments. Foreign investment are mainly concentrated in the Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park (KKIP) areas. Although country such as Japan have mainly focusing their various development and investment projects in the interior and islands since after the end of Second World War. Following America's abandonment in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPPA) economic agreements in early 2017, Sabah began to turns its trade to China and India markets.|$|E
