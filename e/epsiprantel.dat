50|$|<b>Epsiprantel</b> (trade name Cestex) is a {{veterinary}} drug {{which is used}} as an anthelmintic against tapeworms such as Echinococcus granulosus.|$|E
50|$|Praziquantel (5 mg/kg body weight) and <b>epsiprantel</b> {{have both}} {{been shown to be}} efficacious in the {{treatment}} of taeniataeniaeformis in cats. Similarly, febantel and fenbendazole are approved for the treatment of this parasite in most of the world. Mebendazole and nitroscanate are also products that have efficacy against taeniataeniaeformis in cats.|$|E
50|$|If the {{infection}} is already present then {{use one of}} these drugs: <b>Epsiprantel,</b> Praziquantel, Mebendazole, Niclosamide, Bunamindine hydrochloride or Fenbendazole. This will kill the adult stage but not the cyst or egg stage, so several treatments may be needed. Daily doses of Praziquantel for about one to two weeks' time will be effective against larval cysticercosis in rabbits. One dose of Niclosamide or Praziquantel can be very effective in dogs.|$|E
5000|$|The {{infection}} with the metacestode larval form (coenurus) of T. serialis is called Coenurosis. [...] When humans ingest these eggs from definitive host remains, the eggs develop into coenuri. This coenuri {{can occur in}} humans within their muscles, brain, eye, or subcutaneous connective tissue though humans are neither the definitive of intermediate hosts of the T. serialis. [...] The symptoms are variable, and depend on the location and number of larvae. [...] <b>Epsiprantel,</b> praziquantel, fenbendazole and surgical removal are used to combat coenuri infection but discretion should be used when treating this evoloving cestode of medical importance.|$|E
40|$|Helminth-free {{dogs and}} cats were {{experimentally}} infected with protoscoleces of Echinococcus multilocularis and used in controlled trials for efficacy evaluation of the cestodicide <b>epsiprantel.</b> In two separate trials each 4 dogs were treated at day 20 post infection (p. i.) with average oral dosages of 5. 1 (4. 9 - 5. 3) and 5. 4 (5. 2 - 5. 8) mg/kg body weight (b. w.) <b>epsiprantel,</b> respectively, and necropsied at day 24 p. i. Among each 4 dogs of the two untreated control groups all animals were infected and had high intestinal worm burdens with averages of 33, 575 and 100, 725 E. multilocularis specimens per animal (individual worm burdens in group Ib 59, 500 - 149, 800, group IIb 20, 500 - 43, 200); {{in the two groups}} of treated dogs the average worm burdens were reduced by 99. 6 and 99. 9 %. Among 8 treated dogs 4 were helminth-free, the other 4 had residual worm burdens (10 - 70 in 3 dogs, 1480 in 1 dog). In each 5 cats single oral treatments with average doses of 2. 7 (2. 7 - 2. 8) and 5. 5 (5. 5 - 5. 5) mg/kg b. w. <b>epsiprantel</b> were 100 % effective against E. multilocularis 20 days p. i. and eliminated the worm burdens from all 10 animals. In the untreated group of 5 cats the average worm burden was 2864 per animal (individual worm burdens 20 - 6830). Side effects of the drug treatment were not observed. The results of the study show that in single therapeutic dosages recommended by the producer (dogs 5. 5 mg, cats 2. 75 mg/kg b. w.) <b>epsiprantel</b> eliminates E. multilocularis to over 99 % or completely, but residual worm burdens may persist in some animals...|$|E
40|$|In vitro, <b>epsiprantel</b> at a {{concentration}} of 10 μg ml− 1 caused tegumental damage and death of protoscoleces, juveniles (seven-day-old) and adult (37 -day-old) Echinococcus granulosus. Degenerative changes and death occurred more rapidly in the older parasites. Similarly, <b>epsiprantel</b> was more effective against adult (28 -day-old) than seven-day-old experimental infections of E granulosus in dogs. Oral doses of 2 · 5, 5 and 7 · 5 mg kg− 1 were greater than 96 per cent, 99 · 9 per cent and 99 · 99 per cent active, respectively, against mature worms, whereas in seven-day-old infections doses of 5, 7 · 5 and 10 mg kg− 1 produced greater than 94 per cent, 90 per cent and 99 · 8 per cent reduction in worm burdens, respectively. No side effects from treatment were seen...|$|E
