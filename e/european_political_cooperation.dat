5|$|The European Council officially {{gained the}} status of an EU {{institution}} after the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007, distinct from the Council of the European Union (Council of Ministers). Before that, the first summits of EU heads of state or government were held in February and July 1961 (in Paris and Bonn respectively). They were informal summits {{of the leaders of}} the European Community, and were started due to then-French President Charles de Gaulle's resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (e.g. the European Commission) over the integration process, but petered out. The first influential summit held, after the departure of de Gaulle, was the Hague summit of 1969, which reached an agreement on the admittance of the United Kingdom into the Community and initiated foreign policy cooperation (the <b>European</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Cooperation)</b> taking integration beyond economics.|$|E
25|$|Foreign policy {{co-operation}} between {{member states}} {{dates from the}} establishment of the Community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the common commercial policy. Steps for a more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of <b>European</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Cooperation</b> which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. It was not, however, until 1987 when <b>European</b> <b>Political</b> <b>Cooperation</b> was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act. EPC was renamed as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{thesis is}} about the {{reaction}} of Czechoslovak political scene to Milan Hodža's Danubian plan. Milan Hodža was Slovak Agrarian and economist who introduced his plan {{in the second half}} of 1935 at the time when he was Prime minister of Czechoslovakia. Author emerged from broader considerations of Czech and Czechoslovak ideas about economic and political developments in Central Europe, according to Palacký "space between Germany and Russia. " In this context author accepts Palackys beliefs about the indispensability of the Danubian Hapsburg Empire as the counter imperialist expansion's bumper of both the continental powers and efforts of political parties Mladočeši and Staročeši who tried to reform and maintain the country. He also describes the interwar projects of Czechoslovak sovereign foreign policy, where Czechoslovaks tried to take on an inspirational leadership role of Central <b>European</b> economic and <b>political</b> <b>cooperation</b> which was based on Little Entente. Author of this thesis thinks that Hodža's Plan is just one of these projects. And as all the previous projects Hodža's plan had no opportunity to be implemented in the new internationally-political and internationally-economic context. Had Milan Hodža prepared his plan for economic and potentially <b>political</b> <b>cooperation</b> between Danube region countries from the national economy point of view? Did he start the wider discussion about the possibility of Danube region cooperation in Czechoslovakia? These are the basic questions that the author asks and he answers them in the last chapter of his work: Milan Hodža never made any concrete national economic statement for his plan. His attempt for the realization had never gone out of the diplomatic detection. Likewise he did not evoke any specific reaction of Czechoslovak political parties not even in party periodicals...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} in this dissertation {{is focused on the}} question what processes decentralized governments (i. e., municipalities and provinces) have to overcome in order to intervene in the Dutch and <b>European</b> <b>political</b> arena and to acquire attention for their interests. In the introduction (ch. 1) PA is defined and related to regionalism. The chapters 2, 3, 4 and 6 are based on 41 in-depth interviews with prolific subnational PA professionals and PA practitioners (i. e., subnational politicians and officials temporarily entrusted with PA messages), together representing 93 functions (by career), connected with subnational interests. The interviews were focused on the arenas (ch. 2), on the internal and external organization of PA in decentralized governments (ch. 3 and 4) and on the competences of PA professionals (ch. 6). Chapter 5 – profiling the PA professional: importance and self-evaluation of PA competences - is based on quantitative research of PA professionals who were questioned about their demography, their organization and the way they are judging PA competences, also in relation to themselves. Chapter 7 is the general discussion. Data-analyzing points out that (a) communication with the national arena is complex because of minimal susceptibility for subnational interests, in particular as result of Randstad-dominance; the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> arena is - because of program financing - more susceptible but now national interests may frustrate subnational PA. Communication in the municipal and provincial home organization (b) is determined by the extent PA is embedded and accepted, also in the region by (potential) regional stakeholders. Cooperation (in the region) with private and other (public) stakeholders is commonly undisputed but in the national and <b>European</b> <b>political</b> arenas subnational <b>cooperation</b> is oftentimes fragmentized, because of self-interest, opportunism and a money-drive attitude. PA professionals, including PA practitioners are (c) diplomats and fighters at the same time, enriched with competences in local, regional, national and European arena-knowledge, in communicative and political skills and in attitude. However, knowledge-competences are weakly developed. Regionalism is less dominant than expected...|$|R

They are slightly less cohesive {{about the future of the}} EU, but since approval of their basic program in the year of 1992 they are more capable of acting due to remove of the national veto. They have organized "Network Europe", organization of party activists, which helps to bring the PES closer to citizens. The European Liberal Democratic and Reform Party is also party with long tradition. This party has included both parts of liberal scene - social as well as free market liberals.

40|$|<b>Political</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{between the}} {{different}} races in the Malay Peninsula started in a period following the Second World War. Given the existing challenges of that time, some had succeeded and some {{had come to a}} dead end. The Malays‟ political maturity and openness started with the joint cooperation of Pusat Tenaga Rakyat (PUTERA) with THE All Malayan Council of Joint Action (AMCJA) in 1947. This political tolerance succeeded in giving birth to the People‟s Constitution. However, it was promptly rejected by the British as it was put forward by radical group. Thereafter, another <b>political</b> <b>cooperation,</b> this time of the moderate parties, involving the United Malayan National Organization (UMNO) and Malayan Chinese Association (MCA) gave birth to what is famously called PERIKATAN in 1949. In the run-up to the Independence, there was another failed effort at <b>political</b> <b>cooperation</b> among the radical groups, known as SOCIALIST FRONT. Eventually, the <b>political</b> <b>cooperation</b> managed to prove to the British that the Malays and non-Malays can exist together and politically cooperate in order to fulfill their common aspiration of achieving independence. Thus, this article will explore the early history of multi-racial <b>political</b> <b>cooperation</b> and tolerance in Tanah Melayu...|$|R
