2500|$|Once calculated, the Course Handicap {{is applied}} in stroke play by simply {{reducing}} the player's <b>gross</b> <b>score</b> by the handicap, {{to produce a}} net score. So, a <b>gross</b> <b>score</b> of 96 with a handicap of 22 would produce a net score of 74. In match play, the lower handicap is subtracted from the higher handicap, and the resulting handicap strokes are awarded to the higher handicapper by distributing them among the holes according to each hole's difficulty; holes are ranked on the scorecard from 1 to 18 (or however many holes are available), and one stroke is applied to each hole from {{the most difficult to}} the least difficult. So, if one player has a 9 handicap and another has a 25 handicap, the 25-handicap player receives one handicap stroke on each of the most difficult 16 holes (25-9). If the 25-handicapper were playing against a [...] "scratch golfer" [...] (zero handicap), all 25 strokes would be distributed, first by applying one stroke to each hole, then applying the remaining strokes, one each, to the most difficult 7 holes; so, the handicap player would subtract 2 strokes from each of the most difficult 7 holes, and 1 each from the remaining 11.|$|E

Study participants were 742 infants enrolled in the Hamamatsu Birth Cohort (HBC) Study and followed-up from birth to the 14 th month of age. Gross motor skills were assessed at the ages of 6, 10, and 14 months, using Mullen Scales of Early Learning. The score at each assessment was regressed onto a trigonometric function of months of birth, with an adjustment for potential confounders. <b>Gross</b> motor <b>scores</b> at the 6 th and 10 th months showed significant 1 -year-cycle variations, peaking among March- and April-born infants, and among February-born infants, respectively.

40|$|Amoebic {{gill disease}} (AGD) {{is the most}} serious health problem {{affecting}} the culturing of Atlantic salmon in Tasmania. A selective breeding project is selecting for AGD resistance amongst other important commercial traits. This paper presents the first assessment of genetic variation associated with resistance or susceptibility to AGD, and reports on a comparison of three measures of AGD infection leading to a recommended breeding trait measure. Naïve smolts from 30 full sibling families were communally challenged with Neoparamoeba spp., the agent of AGD, in a 19 day challenge in three replicate tanks. At termination of the challenge all fish were euthanized and the level of infection on the gills assessed through a <b>gross</b> gill <b>score,</b> histopathology and image gill score. Broad sense heritability estimates varied between 0. 16 ± 0. 07 for <b>gross</b> gill <b>score</b> and 0. 35 ± 0. 10 for image gill score. A high genetic correlation between image gill score and histopathology score was observed (rg= 0. 90) suggesting these are measurements of the same trait. A lower genetic correlation was observed for <b>gross</b> gill <b>score</b> with image gill score/histopathology (rg= 0. 65). This study suggests a moderate proportion of genetic variance in AGD resistance exists within the Tasmanian Atlantic salmon population and provides good scope for selective breeding for AGD resistance...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLeveling {{the playing}} field is an {{important}} policy instrument to guarantee an equitable competition among heterogeneous individuals. However, the incentive effects of those policies are usually not explicitly addressed in empirical studies. In this paper the performance in amateur golf tournaments is analyzed to gain insights into the incentive effects of those types of policies. The empirical analysis takes advantage of the fact that tournaments in amateur golf are of two distinctive types that apply different scoring rules: While one scoring rule is based on <b>gross</b> <b>scores,</b> i. e. the total number of strokes of a player, the second scoring rule is based on net scores where the total number of strokes is normalized with respect to the respective player's handicap. Performance comparisons of players that participated in both types of tournaments suggest that leveling {{the playing field}}, as in tournaments based on net score, has positive and significant performance effects...|$|R

40|$|Comparison of {{subchondral}} {{bone density}} determined by quantitative computed tomography (CT) with gross and histopathologic changes {{have not been}} made in horses. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine if mean quantitative CT density and mean voxel standard deviation are associated with the presence and severity of osteochondral lesions in the palmar aspect of the distal third metacarpal bone in racing horses. Meta-carpophalangeal joints from nine racehorses were imaged using CT and scored for gross damage. Four-millimeter-thick sagittal and 301 palmar dorsal plane sections were cut, decalcified and stained with hem-atoxylin and eosin from the distal third metacarpal bone. Microscopic osteochondral lesions and subchondral remodeling were scored on a scale of 0 – 3. Percent subchondral bone, expressed as the ratio of bone volume to tissue volume, was also measured. Mean quantitative CT density and mean voxel standard deviation were measured from three-dimensional models of CT images comparable with histologic sections. Mean quantitative CT density was not associated with lesion severity or number of lesions. A weak correlation between mean quantitative CT density and <b>gross</b> <b>score</b> was found, but mean quantitative CT density was not predictive for <b>gross</b> <b>score.</b> Mean voxel standard deviation was not correlated with gross or histopathologic measures, but was predictive of mild osteochondral lesions.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{assessment}} of articular cartilage integrity is of {{value for the}} detection of early degenerative joint disease in both the clinical and the research settings. It was {{the purpose of this study}} to determine the accuracy and reliability of identifying articular cartilage defects through Diffraction Enhanced Imaging (DEI), a high contrast radiographic imaging technique. DEI provides two new sources of image contrast to radiography: refraction and scatter rejection, besides the absorption of conventional radiography. DesignCadaveric tali were DEI imaged in the anterior–posterior position at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Two independent observers provided <b>gross</b> <b>score</b> evaluations (on a five point scale) of the trochlear surfaces. The DEI image of each trochlear surface was then graded (on a five point scale) by two additional independent observers who were blinded with regard to the gross evaluation of the articular surfaces. Inter-observer agreement for DEI grades was assessed with the weighted κ statistic. Correlation of diffraction enhanced image score to the <b>gross</b> <b>score</b> was assessed with Spearman correlation coefficient. ResultsThe defects of articular cartilage of talar trochleae could be visualized through DEI. The Spearman correlation of gross grades with DEI grades on the 165 talar regions for observers 1 and 2 were 0. 91 and 0. 91, respectively. The overall weighted κ value for inter-observer agreement was 0. 93, thus considered high agreement. ConclusionsDEI is accurate and reliable for detection of articular cartilage defects ex vivo. Even early stages of degeneration of cartilage can be visualized with this high contrast technique. Future studies will focus on the application of DEI to the identification of such lesions in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Background: Resveratrol has {{antiinflammatory}} and antifibrotic effects. Resveratrol decreases {{proliferation and}} collagen synthesis by intestinal smooth muscle cells. We hypothesized that resveratrol would decrease inflammation and fibrosis in an animal model of Crohn’s disease. Methods: Peptidoglycan-polysaccharide (PG-PS) or human serum albumin (HSA) was {{injected into the}} bowel wall of Lewis rats at laparotomy. Resveratrol or vehicle was administered daily by gavage 1 – 27 days postinjection. On day 28, gross abdominal and histologic findings were scored. Cecal collagen content was measured by colorimetric analysis of digital images of trichrome-stained sections. Cecal levels of procollagen, cytokine, and growth factor mRNAs were determined. Results: PG-PS-injected rats (vehicle-treated) developed more fibrosis than HSA-injected rats by all measurements: <b>gross</b> abdominal <b>score</b> (P < 0. 001), cecal collagen content (P 0. 04), and procollagen I and III mRNAs (P 0. 0007).
