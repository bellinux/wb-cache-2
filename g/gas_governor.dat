For two weeks, the streets of Berkeley were patrolled by National Guardsmen, who broke up even small demonstrations with tear <b>gas.</b> <b>Governor</b> Reagan was steadfast and unapologetic: [...] "Once the dogs of war have been unleashed, you must expect things will happen, and that people, being human, will make mistakes on both sides." ...|$|E
50|$|Frederick A. Sabbaton (1830-1894), was a {{specialist}} {{in the construction of}} gas works, and was the superintendent of the Troy Gas Light Company, from 1862 to 1890. Sabbaton worked extensively in New York State, and came from a family of engineers. His father, Paul A. Sabbation, was a close friend of Robert Fulton, prepared plans and specifications for The Clermont. Frederick Sabbaton's two brothers, and two sons were all employed as gas engineers. Sabboton supervised, constructed, and owned gas works in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and throughout New York State. He was also involved in the manufacturing of aniline dye, made from coal tar, and designed a <b>gas</b> <b>governor</b> valve.|$|E

40|$|Increasing use {{is being}} made of small digital {{controllers}} in Industry and Commerce. The failure of such controllers is important since it may cause either plant to become unsafe or the interruption of production. Fault tolerant techniques are discussed for improving the reliability of digital controllers with special reference {{to the development of}} a hybrid electromechanical <b>gas</b> <b>governor,</b> whose electronic controller is an example of a small digital controller. Three microprocessors are used in a two out of three majority voting configuration and the memory is Hamming code protected. Redundancy techniques are used to protect against faults in other parts of the controller and it will tolerate most classes of transient fault. When comparing designs or attempting to meet reliability criteria, it is necessary to predict the reliability of a system and its individual components. Several sources of failure rate prediction are compared and the wide variation in the failure rates of integrated circuits is highlighted. The comparison concludes by recommending which reliability data source is likely to be most accurate for each type of component. The <b>gas</b> <b>governor</b> is an example of a repairable system and analysis is developed for predicting the improvement in reliability for repairable redundant systems and for determining the optimum maintenance and repair times for equipment. The testing of redundant systems is difficult because of their complexity, and under certain circumstances the redundancy can mask design faults. Testing methods using complex test equipment are described, as well as the testing of the experimental controller. A review is included of other fault-tolerant systems. Although the work on large computers is not directly applicable to small controllers, many of the techniques can be used...|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the adaptation of}} a low-power natural gas engine for using producer gas as a fuel. The 5. 9 L natural gas engine with a compression ratio of 10. 5 : 1, rated at 55 kW shaft power, delivered 30 kW using producer gas as fuel in the naturally aspirated mode. Optimal ignition timing for peak power {{was found to be}} 20 degrees before top dead centre. Air-to-fuel ratio (A/F) was found to be 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 over a range of loads. Critical evaluation of the energy flows in the engine resulted in identifying losses and optimizing the engine cooling. The specific fuel consumption was found to be 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 kg of biomass per kilowatt hour. A reduction of 40 per cent in brake mean effective pressure was observed compared with natural <b>gas</b> operation. <b>Governor</b> response to load variations has been studied with respect to frequency recovery time. The study also attempts to adopt a turbocharger for higher power output. Preliminary results suggest a possibility of about 30 per cent increase in the output...|$|R
5000|$|On 30 May, Turkish {{newspapers}} {{reported that}} Turkish security forces had arrested al-Nusra fighters {{in the southern}} provinces of Mersin and Adana near the Syrian border and confiscated 2 kg of sarin <b>gas.</b> The <b>governor</b> of Adana claimed that the security forces had not found sarin gas but unknown chemicals, without offering further elaboration. The Turkish Ambassador to Moscow later said that tests showed the chemical seized was anti-freeze, not sarin. In September six of those arrested in May were charged with attempting to acquire chemicals {{which could be used}} to produce sarin; the indictment said that it was [...] "possible to produce sarin gas by combining the materials in proper conditions." [...] The indictment said that [...] "The suspects have pleaded not guilty saying that they had not been aware the materials they had tried to obtain could have been used to make sarin gas. Suspects have been consistently providing conflicting and incoherent facts on this matter." [...] The suspects were said to be linked to al-Nusra and to Ahrar ash-Sham.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{gas turbine}} plants, {{thanks to their}} {{superior}} power density in comparison with other thermal engines (i. e. diesel engines), represent an appreciated and competitive typology of prime movers, of particular interest for the propulsion systems of high speed marine vehicles, typically based on both propeller and waterjet propulsion. Because of the high performance required by these high speed ships propulsion plants, {{in order to ensure}} the vessel safety in every foreseeable condition, it may be very useful the availability of validated and reliable gas turbines simulation mod-els, to be used not only for the performance prediction in normal operative situations, but also when the gas turbine is run-ning under faulty conditions. In the paper a gas turbine thermodynamic mathematical model, specifically developed by the authors for ship propulsion plants studies, is used for the simulation of the LM 2500 gas turbine performance variations caused by six typical faults. For a more realistic prediction of the faults consequences on the gas turbine performance, also the <b>gas</b> turbine <b>governor</b> used in typical ship propulsion plants is modelled, while the load resistance (propeller or waterjet pump) is simulated, in this application, by means of simple relations. The faulty gas turbine simulation results, relative to the main engine parameters variations, obtained for different load conditions, are presented and analysed. A gas turbine faults matrix is then generated and reported in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} a criterion for the acceleration performance improvement of vessels whose propulsion system {{consists of a}} gas turbine/waterjet combination. The criterion is developed and tested by means of computer simulation, through a complex mathematical model applied here to a fast trimaran ferry. The model consists of several modules, describing the dynamic performance of the different elements of the propulsion system (i. e. : gas turbine, waterjet, hull resistance, telegraph, engine governor, etc.). So, linking together the modules, the dynamic simulation model of the ship propulsion system is obtained. The improvement of the acceleration performance for the considered fast ferry is obtained {{by means of a}} careful choice of the telegraph setting, able to maintain, in combination with the <b>gas</b> turbine <b>governor,</b> each of the propulsion system components within its correct operative range. According to this concept, in order to optimize the acceleration performance of the ship, different acceleration manoeuvres have been considered and analyzed, by applying to the telegraph a setting logic similar to that used for the slam acceleration of a turbojet propelled aircraft. The analysis of the results puts into evidence the considerable improvement of the ferry acceleration performance allowed by the here proposed telegraph setting logic, as compared with an analogue acceleration manoeuvre obtained using a less sophisticated telegraph setting...|$|R

2500|$|Just a {{few weeks}} later, Pollock became deeply {{involved}} in the Hardin County onion pickers strike. [...] On June 19, 1934, onion weeders formed the first union of farm laborers in the United States, {{under the auspices of the}} International Quarrymen's Union. The 30 employers belong to the Onion Growers' Association, refused to recognize or bargain with the union, so the union called a strike. On June 22, a local court judge issued a sweeping labor injunction which restricted picketing in groups of two. Local sheriff's deputies began mass arrests of the picketers for congregating in violation of the injunction. The county sheriff, supplied with funds provided by the employers, hired Ohio National Guard troops who had recently served in Toledo during the Auto-Lite strike, and armed them with riot guns, machine-guns, and tear <b>gas.</b> Protests from <b>Governor</b> George White regarding the use of public equipment for private use were ignored. The troops helped break the strike by forcing workers off the picket lines, and arrests hundreds of workers. [...] When a truck full of replacement workers attempted to run down a group of picketers, the picketers retaliated by throwing stones. [...] Pollock was jailed, and a $1,000 bail set for this incident. Pollock was held incommunicado for several days. [...] When the local sheriff did tell Sarah Pollock where her husband was, he denied her access to him. When Pollock finally met with his defense attorneys, sheriff's deputies crowded close to listen in the conversations, and physically intimidate the lawyers. The strike ended shortly thereafter without agreement, and the union disbanded.|$|R
