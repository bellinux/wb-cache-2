5|$|His {{capital is}} {{believed}} to be somewhere in modern-day Haryana. Prithu used his Kshatriya power to make the earth yield its riches. Hence the earth is called Prithvi, daughter of Prithu. Prithu, by mere fiat of will, created millions of men, elephants, chariots and horses. During his reign, there was no decreptitude, no calamity, no famine, no disease, no agriculture and no mining. Prithu enjoyed popularity amongst his subjects, hence all kings are called Rajas. Cows yielded buckets of rich milk when they were touched. Trees and lotuses always had <b>honey</b> <b>in</b> them. People were healthy and happy and had no fear of thieves or wild animals. Nobody died of accidents. Kusha grass was golden in colour. Fruits were always sweet and ripe and nobody went hungry. People lived in houses or caves or trees or wherever they liked. For the first time, civilization and commerce came into existence.|$|E

40|$|Even though honey {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} known sweets, there is a general lack of {{knowledge}} concerning its chemical and physical properties. This is particularly true of those <b>honeys</b> produced <b>in</b> the intermountain region. Beekeepers of this region have long felt that their product was sweeter than those <b>honeys</b> produced <b>in</b> other sections of the country. This, of course, implies that <b>honey</b> produced <b>in</b> the intermountain area is higher in sugar concentration and lower in percent moisture. The present study was made in order to supply some data concerning honeys of this area...|$|R

(2008), 80 to 90 % of the <b>honey</b> produced <b>in</b> the Atsbi district was marketed, which points to the market-oriented nature of <b>honey</b> production <b>in</b> the region. There is an increasing trend in the production of honey from modern beehives; i.e., 269 tons in 2005 to 1061 tons in 2010.
