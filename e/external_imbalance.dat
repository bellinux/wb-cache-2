To assess how much of the current U.

40|$|This work {{attempts}} {{to quantify the}} size of the adjustment of the United States <b>external</b> <b>imbalance</b> which can arise from a depreciation of the dollar, an adjustment of the GovernmentÂ’s budget in the United States and an acceleration of the technological process in other main advanced economies. The quantitative assessment of the three different mechanisms (each one of them separately considered) is carried out making use of the econometric model of the world economy NiGEM, elaborated by the National Institute of Economic Social Research. The results of the simulations investigating the effects of a depreciation of the US dollar highlight the limited adjustment of the United States <b>external</b> <b>imbalance</b> when associated with this mechanism. The limited size of the adjustment is partly the result of interest rates equal nearly to zero in Japan which restricts the margins of reaction of the Japanese monetary policy to an appreciation of the yen. Simulations studying the hypothesis of an improvement of the Government budget in the United States demonstrate how the adjustment of the <b>external</b> <b>imbalance</b> equals, in the medium run, just one third of the GovernmentÂ’s budget adjustment. The simulations analysing the hypothesis of acceleration of the technological progress in the main advanced economies, other than the United States, show that correction of the United States <b>external</b> <b>imbalance</b> would be limited in the short run but would tend to widen out in the longer term. In the scenario of depreciation of the dollar and in that of acceleration of the technological progress the improvement of the net international investment position of the United States largely exceeds the improvement of the external deficit because of the significant effects of revaluation of the stocks of foreign assets held by the United States. disavanzo esterno, posizione netta sullÂ’estero...|$|E

40|$|The {{onset of}} the {{financial}} crisis in 2008 has highlighted the problems of diverging <b>external</b> <b>imbalances</b> within Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and the role of persistent losses in competitiveness. This paper starts by investigating some of the competitiveness factors which contributed to <b>external</b> <b>imbalances</b> in euro area countries. The evidence suggests significant heterogeneity across countries in both price/cost and non-price competitiveness in the euro area and that there is no one factor, but rather a range of potential factors explaining diverging <b>external</b> <b>imbalances.</b> In particular, while non-price competitiveness effects contributed largely to the trade surplus in some countries, for some southern European countries the trade balance was also driven by price factors. The second part of the paper studies the implications of competitiveness adjustment by means of quantitative tools. Using four different multi-country macro models, improvements in both price/cost aspects (namely wage reduction, productivity improvements or fiscal devaluation) and non-price competitiveness factors (quality improvements) were shown – under certain conditions – to improve <b>external</b> <b>imbalances.</b> The analysis suggests differences in countries’ composition of trade could lead to heterogeneity in the potential gains from improvements in competitiveness...|$|R

Results for 1998 support the statement that recovery of economic growth will be the macroeconomic priority for 1999 rather than <b>external</b> <b>imbalance.</b> The recovery of domestic demand could, however, - under certain circumstances - represent an import promoting impetus, which could threaten the painfully acquired and still fragile external balance.

Until recently, these firms {{were not required}} to pay dividends to the state and the post- 2000 surge in growth made them very profitable, with their economic profits adding corporate saving amounting to a fifth of GDP. This bolstered China's overall saving-investment gap and hence its controversial current account surplus. In other countries, oligopolistic industries tend to be taxed more heavily and they are commonly subjected to price regulation. This study offers an economy-wide analysis of approaches to oligopoly rents in China. The results suggest that, while policy changes targeting national saving, including increased corporate taxation, expansionary fiscal policy and SOE privatisation all help to control the <b>external</b> <b>imbalance,</b> they tend also to turn demand inward, inducing higher oligopoly rents and slower growth. Competition policy, embodying both price cap regulation and free entry, proves more effective both in controlling the <b>external</b> <b>imbalance</b> and in fostering continued growth. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper makes three points. The {{first is}} that <b>external</b> <b>imbalances</b> between Member States are {{relevant}} {{for the performance of}} a monetary union when the latter is not backed by a strong political commitment and a solid political framework. Eurozone policymakers have ignored these inter-member imbalances and have instead concentrated on union-wide imbalances, so much so that statistical data on the former phenomenon still remain largely incomplete. There are signs that a correction is in the making, which we hope will lead to a comprehensive quantitative knowledge of intra-EMU imbalances. The second objective of the paper is to design specific policies aimed at reducing inter-member external disequilibria, for example by fixing targets on current-account imbalances symmetrically applied to both deficit and surplus countries. The contrast between the keen attention of the EZ policymakers on national fiscal imbalances and the belated and lukewarm attention given to <b>external</b> <b>imbalances</b> is striking. The third aim of the paper is to propose a more flexible monetary policy aimed at controlling the distribution of liquidity among Member States, resulting from inter-member <b>external</b> <b>imbalances.</b> Our proposal is that National Central Banks should add a risk premium cost to official interest rates on banks that accumulate “excessive” borrowings or deposits to compensate, respectively, for outflows and inflows of the monetary base due to the effect of <b>external</b> <b>imbalances.</b> JEL classification: E 42, E 52, E 5...|$|R

The exact import price index thus calculated suggests that US conventional import prices are biased upwards. The consequent downward adjustment in import prices causes appreciation in the real exchange rate and lowers the excessive portion of imports (the difference between actual and theoretical amounts of imports obtained from the import demand equation). Since the early 2000 s, however, the role that new product varieties play in lowering the excessive portion of imports has declined because the impact of new products on import prices has been outweighed by the impact of the spike in primary commodity prices, which has resulted in a substantial depreciation of the real exchange rate.
